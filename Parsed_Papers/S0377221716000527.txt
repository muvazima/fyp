                  Value added models have been proposed to analyze different aspects related to school effectiveness on the basis of student growth. There is consensus in the literature about the need to control for socioeconomic status and other contextual variables at student and school level in the estimation of value added, for which the methodologies employed have largely relied on hierarchical linear models. However, this approach is problematic because results are based on comparisons to the school’s average—implying no real incentive for performance excellence. Meanwhile, activity analysis models to estimate school value added have been unable to control for contextual variables at both the student and school levels. In this study we propose a robust frontier model to estimate contextual value added which merges relevant branches of the activity analysis literature, namely, metafrontiers and partial frontier methods. We provide an application to a large sample of Chilean schools, a relevant country to study due to the reforms made to its educational system that point out to the need of accountability measures. Results indicate not only the general relevance of including contextual variables but also how they contribute to explaining the performance differentials found for the three types of schools—public, privately-owned subsidized, and privately-owned fee-paying. Also, the results indicate that contextual value added models generate school rankings more consistent with the evaluation models currently used in Chile than any other type of evaluation models.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The development of indicators to evaluate the quality of education is a core element of countries’ efforts to implement improvements in their education systems (Battauz, Bellio, & Gori, 2011). In many countries, this concern has motivated the adoption of accountability systems (Kane & Staiger, 2002), whose main objective is to evaluate school quality and report these results to parents, principals, teachers, or policy makers, who will use them to make choices about schools, to improve their professional practice or to develop educational policies.
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        By way of example, see, for instance, the detailed information regarding school performance in the UK disclosed in http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/.
                      The available empirical evidence in this regard has contributed to strengthen this tendency, showing that well designed accountability systems (i.e. those which find the responsibility attributable to each of the participants in the educational system) enable organizational improvement inside each school (Rouse, Hannaway, Goldhaber, & Figlio, 2007), as well as optimizing the educational outcomes (Carnoy & Loeb, 2002; Hanushek & Raymond, 2005). An underlying requisite of any accountability system is to use a robust methodology to disentangle what share of the students’ achievement can be attributed to the school, and what share is simply the result of other variables beyond the school’s control.

In terms of methodology, the general consensus is that students’ educational achievement depends both on their personal characteristics as well as those of their school and context. In order to analyze these scenarios, the most common and accepted methodology is multilevel regression models (McCaffrey, Lockwood, Koretz, Louis, & Hamilton, 2004), also known as hierarchical linear models, or regression models with random effects (Goldstein, 2003; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). The key characteristic of these methods is their capacity to disentangle what proportion of variance in student achievement can be explained by student variables (level 1), and what share can be explained by aggregate, or school, contextual variables (level 2). When multiple levels are considered, such as hierarchical systems of students nested in schools, it is possible to obtain a better understanding and measurement of the causes that explain students’ learning processes (Aitkin & Longford, 1986). The multilevel approach is highly relevant when attempting to make decisions, specific to each student, school, or context, that contribute useful information to develop new improvement processes in schools, discourage managers’ opportunistic behavior, signal a correct resource endowments policy (by establishing rewards and penalties), and make decisions on public policies.

The initial stages of research on school accountability were characterized by the use of cross sectional measures to estimate school performance (e.g. the mean annual results of standardized tests), but the current practice is to rely on panel data methods to evaluate student performance in order to estimate the academic growth of students throughout their school life—ideally also controlling for other relevant variables (Goldstein et al., 1993; Goldstein & Thomas, 1996; Gray, Jesson, Goldstein, Hedger, & Rasbash, 1995; Mortimore, Sammons, & Thomas, 1994; Sammons, 1995). In this context of school accountability, the value added (VA) of a given school can be broadly defined as the contribution that it makes to students’ net progress (i.e. to the learning objectives) after the effects of other variables, external to the school, have been removed (Meyer, 1997). The basic value added model compares schools’ performance controlling for students’ previous achievement.

More complex value added models are also available, and over the last few years there has been a growing tendency to use contextual VA models, which allow researchers to control for socioeconomic status (SES), ethnic background, gender, and other variables that are not under the school’s control or responsibility. Thus, contextual VA models provide an estimation of the net performance of schools by removing the effect of previous achievement and other preexisting differences among students (Ballou, Sanders, & Wright, 2004). It is generally agreed that contextual variables should be used to estimate VA models, especially when setting some form of accountability, or when disseminating the results, since results might be questionable if they do not take into account contextual characteristics of both students and schools. Although there is no consensus as to what specific contextual variables should be included in the model (Tekwe et al., 2004), socioeconomic status (SES) is usually one of them.

According to their characteristics, VA indicators emerge as an attractive methodology for several actors interested in measuring or improving school performance, including: (i) governments (which need to rely on objective accountability measures); (ii) politicians (who want to guarantee that the assessment of schools considers their ethnic and socioeconomic diversity); (iii) researchers (who need to study those factors contributing to school effectiveness using net indicators, which are not spuriously contaminated by the characteristics of students); (iv) teachers and school managers (who want objective measures of their performance, tuned for their specific student populations); (v) parents (who need to choose schools for their children according to their real capacity to add value to their students); and (vi) society as a whole, since this entails a more accurate and fair evaluation of the schools in the country (Drury & Doran, 2003; McCaffrey et al., 2004).

It is also crucial to understand that school effectiveness studies—including VA analysis—require using some kind of methodology to compare the schools being evaluated with a benchmark. In the case of VA research, the most popular methodology is multilevel regression models (see, for instance Goldstein et al., 1993; Gray et al., 1995; Cervini, 2009; Goddard & Goddard, 2001). An implicit assumption of this approach is to use the average school as a benchmark. However, this approach is not free from criticisms such as, for instance, that using the average as a benchmark is not an incentive for excellence (Bock, Wolfe, & Fisher, 1996; Kupermintz, 2003; McCaffrey, Lockwood, Koretz, & Hamilton, 2003), that according to traditional VA models test scores must be vertically scaled, and that the appropriate functional form for the model is not granted in advanced (Murphy, 2012; Ray, Evans, & McCormack, 2009).

An attractive approach to overcome this criticism is to consider the models derived from the activity analysis literature, which evaluate school performance by comparing any given school with the best observed performance. Instead of using a regression line as a benchmark, these methodologies consider a nonparametric frontier built either using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), or its nonconvex variant, namely, Free Disposal Hull (FDH).
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        We can also find parametric variants to this literature, among which SFA (Stochastic Frontier Analysis) is the most popular. Parametric and nonparametric methods have both advantages and disadvantages, some of which have been recently outlined by Badunenko, Henderson, and Kumbhakar (2012).
                      In addition to explicitly defining an optimal benchmark, frontier models also allow several outputs to be used simultaneously (i.e. several concurrent measures of student and school performance), offering greater flexibility to estimate VA.

In this line of research, there has been a growing interest in developing approaches to estimate school effectiveness. For instance, Silva Portela and Thanassoulis (2001), De Witte, Thanassoulis, Simpson, Battisti, and Charlesworth-May (2010) and Portela, Camanho, and Keshvari, (2013) have developed methodologies to estimate basic VA models, whereas Thieme, Prior, and Tortosa-Ausina (2013) have proposed a model to analyse contextual effects in multilevel settings with cross-sectional data. However, the existing methodologies have not been able to estimate contextual VA, namely, to develop a frontier model able to estimate school VA effects controlling for students’ previous achievement, and also for contextual variables at student and school levels. This development is crucial to further explore the use of frontier models to estimate contextual VA models in real world applications.

For this reason, the aim of this paper is both empirical and, to a lesser degree, methodological. Regarding the latter (at the methodological level) we propose a robust frontier model to estimate contextual value added (CVA) which combines both methodological contributions from multilevel modeling to school VA, as well as relevant proposals in the field of activity analysis methods—namely, the so-called metafrontiers (Battese, Rao, & O’Donnell, 2004) as well as the partial frontier methods (Cazals, Florens, & Simar, 2002).

Regarding the former (at the empirical level), we use this novel approach to analyze school effectiveness in Chile. This application is especially relevant for this country which, since the 1980s, has been implementing a series of reforms to its educational system (see Mizala & Romaguera, 2000), with strong emphasis on accountability measures. Among other reforms, the government transferred the management of public schools from the Ministry of Education to city councils, and allowed for the participation of private schools in the public system through a voucher system. Simultaneously, an accountability system was created, consisting of national standardized tests of educational achievement applied annually to all students in 4th, 8th or 10th grade. The average school results of this assessment, called the SIMCE test (Sistema de Medición de la Calidad Educativa, or Measurement System of Educational Quality), are reported to parents, and used by the Ministry of Education as a measure of school quality. More recently, some new laws have been passed which emphsize further the use of accountability measures. Specifically, the Law #20529 features a new system of insurance of educational quality (Sistema Nacional de Aseguramiento de la Calidad de la Educación) and a new national agency of education quality (Agencia de Calidad de la Educación). This public institution should classify the educational institutions according to their school effectiveness and school performance into four groups. Specifically, in its article 18 this law indicates that the classification should be based primarily on the SIMCE average results achieved by the educational institutions. In addition to this, the law considers that the procedure to make the classification could eventually include VA models, stating explicitly that the agency should consider the results from the learning process in all the evaluated areas as well as the characteristics of the school’s students including, among others, their vulnerability and, when applicable, indicators of progress or value added (article 17). Currently this agency has developed several alternative methodologies for performing the classification of schools, but none of them has included measures of value added—despite the fact that the Law #20529 contemplates it, and it is a possible alternative considered in some research initiatives. Moreover, the methodologies considered correspond to variations in what we will later refer to as Model 1.

The resulting classification will be obviously contingent to the different models chosen as well as the estimation procedures, as well as data availability. Therefore, these definitions might have important consequences for Chilean schools, among which we should consider that this Law also contemplates issues ranging from involvement in organizational aspects or the closure of low-performing schools. This article aims, among other issues, to contribute to the existing debate in Chile on this issue, comparing the effect on the classification of schools using value-added vs. status models (such as those that the agency is currently contemplating). This is possible due to some particularities of the SIMCE test calendar, since 2009 was the first time in which the same student that took the SIMCE test in 8th grade had also taken the test in 4th grade in year 2005.

This scenario allows us to apply our model to a large sample—47,076 students from 948 primary schools. All students took Mathematics and Language SIMCE tests. The sample was made up of 4th and 8th grade students (9 and 13 years old, respectively), for which we have socioeconomic information on their families (at student level), obtained via a questionnaire for parents. In an attempt to achieve a reliable and homogeneous sample at school level, we only included those students in schools who took both exams and for whom we had socioeconomic information, whose schools met the requirement of having more than 30 students meeting these criteria, and that this value corresponded to 60 percent of the students at the school who took the exam in 2009.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the relevant theoretical framework. In Section 3 we detail the methodology used. The background of the empirical application and the description of the database used are presented in Section 4. The comparative results between models are discussed in Section 5, and the main conclusions of the study are outlined in Section 6.

All national or state accountability systems attempt to improve learning and instruction processes, but they differ significantly in the way they control for both the quality and progress of schools. This heterogeneity leads to different perceptions of which schools should be rewarded, and which should be encouraged to improve, among other recommendations.

There are several frameworks to classify these evaluation models (Carlson, 2001), but most of them take into account two fundamental aspects. First, one may distinguish between two different approaches for monitoring school performance, namely, status models and growth models. Status models use a single year to evaluate students’ academic achievement (i.e. cross sectional data), whereas growth models use two or more years (i.e. panel data). Second, in both approaches one may distinguish between models that use contextual variables (both at student and school level) to evaluate school achievement, and those which do not. This scenario, and the core questions that these models try to answer, can be represented in a 2 × 2 matrix as in Table 1
                        .

As Table 1 shows, Model 0 (which is also referred to as type 0 model) only considers for the evaluation the outputs related to students’ academic achievement in a given time period. In the literature on education these models are usually referred to as academic achievement status models without contextual variables. As indicated by Tekwe et al. (2004), the distinguishing characteristic of status-based models is the absence of adjustment for students’ incoming knowledge level. This would imply that the differences among schools in terms of the average knowledge of their incoming students is convoluted with the assessment of teaching quality. An implicit assumption is that all students and schools have optimal and similar backgrounds. Therefore, accountability systems based on this model consider that students’ academic achievement is entirely attributable to schools, disregarding evidence in the literature that a large share of students’ academic achievement might be attributable to contextual factors, which are non-controllable, and not attributable to the school itself (Teddlie & Reynolds, 2000).

The strongest criticisms suggest that this model could generate perverse incentives for the attainment of the objective being pursued, endowing fewer resources to those students with relatively worse results who do not help their schools to achieve their objectives. Simultaneously, this could generate selection of students within schools, or lead to self-selection (Wilson, 2004). In spite of these disadvantages, we analyze Model 0 as a first step, because it is the approach currently used in Chile to evaluate its schools since 1999. Therefore, it is of interest to compare its results with those that could be yielded by other models proposed in this study.

Model 1 extends the variables considered. While, analogously to model 0, it includes the outputs related to students’ academic achievement at a given moment of time, it also considers input variables not attributable to the school, either at student or at school level. This model corresponds to an academic achievement status model with contextual variables, according to the literature on education. A recent example of this type of approach is the study by Thieme et al. (2013), which proposes a multilevel model incorporating contextual variables both at student and school levels. Despite the remarkable progress it represents, by not considering as input the initial academic achievement of students, it assumes that it is the same, and optimal, for all students, a situation which is obviously far from reality, and could lead to misinterpretation of results. It should be noted that the methodologies recommended by the Chilean agency for the quality of education (“Agencia de Calidad de la Educación”) for the classification of schools correspond to this family of models.

Model 2 corresponds to a “pure” value-added model; the only inputs and outputs it considers are the results of students’ academic achievement, both at the beginning and at the end of the educational process under evaluation. The educational research literature considers that value added measures (gain) are more informative measures of the effectiveness of institutions, since they allow the effect of the school’s student progress to be isolated (Wilson & Piebalga, 2008), and contribute to reducing incentives for dishonest behavior. Two relatively recent studies are consistent with this model, namely, Silva Portela and Thanassoulis (2001) and De Witte et al. (2010). However, as in the previous model, they have the disadvantage of not controlling for non-school elements which influence this particular process.

Model 3 overcomes the disadvantages of models 1 and 2. In the education research literature this type of model emerged strongly as a refinement of measures of growth, and has been called CVA (contextual value added). The CVA was first used in 2006 in British schools, and it is a measure intended to isolate the real impact of the school on students’ progress. This type of modeling involves obtaining results that consider a number of factors such as gender, ethnicity, and language of origin, among others. The difference between the model estimate and the result that the student actually achieves is what is referred to as CVA (Wilson & Piebalga, 2008).

There is an open discussion about this point, with arguments for and against using several contextual variables in VA models (Timmermans, Doolaard, & de Wolf, 2011; Willms & Raudenbush, 1989). In our case, we have decided to include only the SES, basically for three reasons. First, it is important to understand that, in the Chilean context, the most important contextual variable explaining school performance is SES, as repeatedly demonstrated in many studies (Auguste & Valenzuela, 2003; Bellei, 2009; Contreras, Sepúlveda, & Bustos, 2010; Gauri, 1999; Hsieh & Urquiola, 2006). For instance, Manzi, Strasser, San Martín, and Contreras (2008) show that a very large and stable percentage of between-school variance is accounted for by socioeconomic factors; in fact, over 60 percent of this variance is explained by the combination of the individual SES and school average SES. This result is consistent with PISA decomposition of variance (OECD, 2010), which shows that Chile is one of the countries with the largest percentage of between-school variance explained by socioeconomic factors. Manzi et al. (2008) also show that the effect of other variables is negligible, and that the type of school does not explain a relevant share of between school variance once socioeconomic factors are controlled for. These results corroborate the extent of socioeconomic segregation in the Chilean educational system (see also Carrasco & San Martín, 2012; Valenzuela, Bellei, & Ríos, 2014).

Considering the previous arguments, it is important to understand that, in the case of Chile, the most important contextual variable to analyze school performance is SES both at individual and school (average) levels, and due to this reason we include these variables and no other. Second, and from a broader perspective, models with different types of contextual variables usually yield similar results (Timmermans et al., 2011), which would include both basic and advanced value added models (Harris, 2011). However, interestingly, although different VA models might use different contextual variables, there is a wide consensus on the inclusion among them of SES (e.g. see the OECD report on VA models in different countries). Third, using SES as the only control variable enables achieving a balance between the amount of information used and the sample size. It is debatable if the increased amount of information considered when including more contextual variables offsets the problems derived from the curse of dimensionality, a relevant issue to control for in nonparametric models for efficiency measurement (Simar and Wilson, 2008, p. 441, chap. 4). Actually, in our particular case the number of contextual variables which we summarize in our composite index is very high (4) and, therefore, we consider this to be a case in which a composite index may be particularly convenient.

Despite the great advances that models 1 and 2 represent, when activity analysis methods are considered to evaluate them, model 3 in Table 1 best isolates the real impact of the school on students’ progress, as indicated by many contributions from the traditional literature on school evaluation—which generally use parametric multilevel analysis. Therefore, evaluating model 3 considering activity analysis methods has some unexplored advantages that will be part of our aims. It should be considered that, up to now, the Chilean agency for the quality of education has not considered type 2 or type 3 models for the classification of schools.

As indicated in the introduction, in recent years there has been considerable progress in the evaluation methodology of school performance, especially regarding the development of multilevel models (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992; Goldstein, 1995). The general concept is that students’ academic achievement depends on their personal characteristics, and the characteristics of the school, and its context. To analyze these situations, the different levels are considered as hierarchical systems of students and schools, with individuals and groups defined in separate hierarchies, using variables that are defined at each level (Hox, 2002).

This significant progress can solve the main methodological problem of the pioneering studies in this field, by breaking down the various nested effects that explain students’ educational outcomes. The percentage of student achievement due to the different variables at different organizational levels—district, school, class, and student—can also be determined.

In this particular area, there are many statistical models for estimation which differ in several regards such as the definition and inclusion of adjustment variables (Tekwe et al., 2004). However, the most prominent position is to include adjustment variables, especially when establishing some form of accountability or dissemination of the results, since the equity is questionable if the background characteristics of students and schools are not taken into account (McCaffrey et al., 2004; McCaffrey et al., 2003).

Despite the many methodological and empirical contributions, this research is not without its criticisms (Kupermintz, 2003; McEwan, 2003). One of them is related to the nature of their estimate as a comparison with the average, assuming no real incentive for performance excellence. Indeed, the vast majority of value-added studies used multilevel regression or analysis.

An alternative is found in the models that consider activity analysis techniques, mainly using nonparametric frontier methods (mostly Data Envelopment Analysis, DEA, and its nonconvex counterpart, Free Disposal Hull, FDH). They provide relevant advantages such as the ability to compare with the optimal or, more importantly, the possibility to specify several inputs and outputs simultaneously. In the field of education many studies have adopted these techniques (see, for instance Mizala, Romaguera, and Farren, 2002; Thanassoulis, Kortelainen, Johnes, and Johnes, 2011; Portela, Camanho, and Keshvari, 2013; Johnes and Johnes, 2009, among others). However, these methods are not exempt from general criticisms. On the one hand, regarding the nature of these methods, their deterministic and probabilistic features, the curse of dimensionality, or their heavy reliance on the absence of outliers have been a source of continuous concern. On the other, in the specific field of education, their main disadvantage has been to consider only student-level data, which would yield estimations that incorrectly assume that schools are operating with the optimal endowment of inputs (both, controllable or uncontrollable), without establishing thus a multilevel analysis.

From the perspective of the non-parametric deterministic technology, Cazals et al. (2002) pointed out the problem of lack of statistical properties and the impact that the presence of outliers can cause. From the perspective of student data, another criticism is that multilevel analysis avoids the resources schools allocate in order to sustain the education process (McCaffrey et al., 2004; McCaffrey et al., 2003). Both problems are addressed in this paper, by providing an integrated approach with the use of metafrontier approaches (Battese et al., 2004) and the use of robust partial order-m frontiers (Cazals et al., 2002).

Some previous research initiatives have taken these considerations into account. Specifically, our aims and methods are consistent with previous literature such as Silva Portela and Thanassoulis (2001) who, following model 2, decompose the overall efficiency into two different effects, namely, school effect and student-within-school effect. Later on, De Witte et al. (2010) refined this methodology, proposing a robust approach based on Cazals et al.’s (2002) ideas for the estimation. A more recent contribution by Thieme et al. (2013), based on model 1, considered both ideas, performing a multilevel decomposition in which additional variables are factored in so as to provide a more comprehensive analysis. However, despite their interest, these previous studies disregard the existence of contextual factors—at both the student and school level—in the assessment of school performance.

In contrast, our proposal here is based on the definition of a contextualized value-added robust multilevel nonparametric frontier assessment that separates the net effects of student and school, controlling for socioeconomic status, both at the student and school level, eliminating (or at least drastically reducing) the potential problems caused by the existence of outliers and dimensionality problems, as will be explained in the following section.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

Following the rationale described in the above paragraphs, our model is inspired by Silva Portela and Thanassoulis’s (2001) initial contribution, in which two frontiers are considered, namely, the local and the global frontiers. Whereas the former is specific to each school, and oriented to an estimation of student-within-school efficiency, the latter is used to estimate student within-all-schools efficiency. The so-called student’s effect (henceforth STE), or student’s efficiency, will determine the distance to the local frontier. In contrast, the school’s effect (henceforth SCE), or school’s efficiency, refers to the distance separating the local and the global frontiers. Model 2 in Fig. 1
                         documents the ideas underlying both effects.

In Fig. 1, the student (c) achieves an output level represented by yc
                        , corresponding to an input level xc
                        —the score achieved by the student in a previous academic year. When the student’s (c) academic performance is compared with the local frontier (which corresponds to the school in which student c is enrolled, i.e. school d), one may notice that student c is inefficient. This occurs because there are more efficient students enrolled in the same school d who achieve better results (
                           
                              y
                              2
                              ′
                           
                        ) using the same inputs—or previous knowledge (xc
                        ). Therefore, the student’s effect, or what Silva Portela and Thanassoulis (2001) refer to as the student-within-school’s efficiency, is determined as the ratio of the potential to the actual output, i.e.

According to the taxonomy proposed in Table 1, this decomposition corresponds to model 2, or pure value added. As mentioned above, we partially follow this proposal as we are interested in the student as the unit of analysis. However, in contrast to Silva Portela and Thanassoulis (2001), our aim is to develop a multilevel decomposition of contextual value added (CVA). This implies considering not only students’ academic results, but also contextual factors regarding student and schools. To that end, we follow a previous proposal (Thieme et al., 2013), classifiable as a type 1 model (considering only the contextual status but not the value added; see Table 1), which introduces successive decompositions after the consideration of specific variables. The final effect is the modification of the school effect, after introducing contextual variables on the average socio-economic level of the parents of students attending the same school.

In Fig. 1 we illustrate the differences between model 2 (consisting of the assessment of the pure value added), and our proposal, which gives rise to model 3 (a contextual value added assessment). Regarding the student’s effect, we see that

                         because in model 3 we consider as inputs not only the previous scores but also the socio-economic and cultural level of the student’s family. This would imply that, in order to estimate

                         comes from a student that, having the same previous scores and comparable socio-economic situation, achieves a better academic outcome. In contrast, benchmark

                        3) and the net student’s effect (STE
                        3). Analogously, the school’s effect from model 2 (SCE
                        2) can be decomposed in order to account for the impact of the context due to socio-economic factors (SCCE
                        3) and the net effect of the school (SCE
                        3). This implies that a potential technology gap (represented by both STCE
                        3 and SCCE
                        3) appears when the context has a significant impact on the scores that students can achieve. In model 3 this gap may, or may not, be significant whereas in model 2, by definition, the impact is nonexistent. To conclude, the decomposition corresponding to model 3 can be expressed as:

                           
                              (2)

When estimating inefficiency levels, the first decision to be made is the specification of the technology, which has relevant implications as different technologies could lead to different results. Many previous applications have considered DEA models, implying that a convex technology is assumed—i.e. each inefficient student will be compared to her more efficient peers, or combinations of them. In contrast, FDH models require comparison with an existing student, and linear combinations are not allowed as a benchmark—i.e. the convexity assumption is dropped.

Both DEA and FDH have some shortcomings, among which we may highlight the so-called curse of dimensionality and the potential impact of outliers. Some studies have established the statistical properties of the FDH estimator (Kneip, Park, & Simar, 1998; Simar & Wilson, 2000), indicating that the dimensionality problems of the FDH models originate from their slow convergence rates. However, their statistical properties are very appealing, since they are consistent estimators for any monotone boundary—i.e. by imposing only strong disposability. In addition, as shown by Park, Simar, and Weiner (2000), FDH has additional advantages over convex models, since the latter causes a specification error when the true technology is nonconvex.

                           Some authors such as Thanassoulis and Silva Portela (2002) have proposed other methods to overcome the issue of outliers, by identifying and eliminating the extreme (super-efficient) cases; however, this is a controversial approach, since these units can convey relevant information. In the particular context of education, eliminating super-efficient observations could lead to an increase of overall efficiency—magnifying mediocrity, and reducing potential efficiency gains that could be achieved.
                        
                     

In our study we will assume nonconvex technologies which, in our particular setting will imply that an existing student will be compared with another existing albeit more efficient student. However, FDH approaches have also some limitations and, therefore, we will consider a partial frontier approach such as order-m (Cazals et al., 2002), which is much more robust to both outliers and the curse of dimensionality.

                           In a recent paper, Krüger (2012) ranked the order-m estimation method as dominated, in general conditions, by the stochastic frontier, DEA and FDH methods. So, it appears that its use should be restricted to those cases characterized by the significant presence of outliers. This is precisely the case of education, where some students with very limited resources may achieve a brilliant academic curriculum.

As indicated earlier, there are contributions in the literature that provide methods to overcome the curse of dimensionality and the effect of outliers inherent to FDH. Among them, the order-m estimator (Cazals et al., 2002; Simar, 2003) has become one of the most popular methods to get round these issues while at the same time maintaining the advantages of a nonconvex and nonparametric methodology.

According to this method, we will first consider a positive fixed integer, m. For a given level of input (x
                        
                           c, i

                           c, j
                        ), the order-m estimation defines the expected value of maximum of m random variables (

In order to carry out the multilevel estimation, we adapt the metafrontier approaches proposed by Battese and Rao (2002), Battese et al. (2004) and O’Donnell, Prasada Rao, and Battese (2008). In the case of Model 3, this process has the following steps:

The database used in this study was built from the results of standardized tests undertaken by the national system for evaluating education quality in Chile (i.e. the Sistema de Evaluación de la Calidad de la Educación, SIMCE, or “Educational Quality Measurement System”), which since the mid-1990s has collected information on student characteristics and academic performance. The tests must be performed on a country wide basis by all students in the 4th and 8th years of basic education, as well as 2nd year of secondary education. The SIMCE also includes information on teachers, students and parents using questionnaires on the context. This information is then used to contextualize and to analyze students’ results in the SIMCE tests.

For this study we used information on results for 4th grade students, for year 2005, as well as 8th grade students, for year 2009. Information for estimating families’ socioeconomic level was obtained via the questionnaire responded by parents for year 2005.

Accordingly, out of 142,109 students who took both exams, and were enrolled in the same school, only 47,076 also met the requirement of being enrolled in a school with more than 30 students taking the exam, and complete information existed for more than 60 percent of students who took the SIMCE exam in that school in 2009. This smaller sub-sample of 948 schools (containing 47,076 students) was drawn from this large sample, out of which 395 (41.67 percent) were enrolled in municipal (public) schools, 460 (48.52 percent) were enrolled in privately-owned subsidized schools, and 93 (9.81 percent) were enrolled in either private nonvoucher schools or fee-charging private voucher schools. This information is reported in Table 2
                     .

The different models to evaluate are based on a different combination of inputs and outputs gathered at student level (5 variables) and school level (1 variable).

As outputs we use variables at student level regarding achievement at end of the second cicle of Basic Education (8th grade). Thus, we consider the following:

                        
                           
                              y
                              1:
                           student mathematics’ score from SIMCE 8th grade, year 2009 (Student level);

student language score from SIMCE 8th grade, year 2009 (Student level).

Regarding the input variables at student level, we consider two variables of previous academic achievement such as the score obtained by the same students in the SIMCE Mathematics and Language tests when they leave 4th grade in 2005. This is the level of achievement of each student at start the second cicle of Basic Education.

                        
                           
                              x
                              1:
                           student mathematics’ score from SIMCE 4th grade, year 2005 (student level);

student language score from SIMCE 4th grade, year 2005 (student level).

All those variables (y
                     1, y
                     2, x
                     1 and x
                     2) corresponding to the individual SIMCE scores are estimated using Item Response Theory (IRT models); for details on these models, see Ministerio de Educación (2005).

At the student level, we also consider:

                        
                           
                              x
                              3:
                           index of the socioeconomic and cultural level of the families, constructed using principal components analysis and including the variables corresponding to: (i) father educational level; (ii) mother educational level; and (iii) the average family monthly income; year 2005.

Although there is not a strong consensus on the conceptual meaning of SES (Bornstein & Bradley, 2003; Deaton, 2002), in educational research SES indexes are typically built through measures of parental educational levels and family wealth (Buchmann, 2002; Gottfried, 1985; Hauser, 1994; Yang & Gustafsson, 2004). Thus, in this paper we calculated a SES index from data collected through SIMCE background questionnaires, that asked parents about their highest level of education completed (from elementary to post graduate), family monthly income (according to 15 income categories). In line with the tradition in this area of research, we aggregated the three indicators of parental education (father and mother separately), and family monthly income by principal component analysis (PCA). In PCA, the first component extracted is the optimal combination of the indicators analyzed. In this research, the eigenvalue associated to the first component was

                      and the ratio between the first and the second eigen value was

                      indicating high uni-dimensionality of the resulting SES index. Additionally, we estimated the reliability of the SES index using the θ coefficient, obtaining 
                        
                           θ
                           =

                     . Thus, the resulting index is highly reliable (Carmines & Zeller, 1982).

Also as input variable, but at school level, we consider:

                        
                           
                              x
                              4:
                           proxy for the socioeconomic level of the school, corresponding to the average of the students index of the socioeconomic and cultural levels of the families at school, year 2005.

The input variables x

                     4 would be the contextual value-added variables.

                        In a relatively recent contribution, De Witte and Kortelainen (2008) provide a very comprehensive review of the different approaches to include environmental variables in efficiency and productivity analysis studies.
                     
                  

The descriptive statistics of the variables included in the different models by type of schools are reported in Table 3
                     .

Thus, and following the classification provided in Section 2, we consider four evaluation models (one of which, model 0, corresponds to SIMCE average). The variables considered in each of these models were the following:

                        
                           Model 0:
                           status, overall effect (y
                              1, y
                              2).

contextual status (y
                              1, y
                              2, x
                              3, x
                              4).

value added (y
                              1, y
                              2, x
                              1, x
                              2).

contextual value added (y
                              1, y
                              2, x
                              1, x
                              2, x
                              3, x
                              4).

Regarding the number of covariates that need to be included in a model of VA, there is an open discussion about this point, with arguments for and against using several contextual variables in these models (Timmermans et al., 2011; Willms & Raudenbush, 1989). In our case, there are three main reasons for having used only socioeconomic status (SES) variables.

First, it is important to understand that, in the Chilean context, the most important contextual variable explaining school performance is the socioeconomic level, as repeatedly demonstrated in many studies (Auguste & Valenzuela, 2003; Bellei, 2009; Contreras et al., 2010; Drago & Paredes, 2011; Gauri, 1999; Hsieh & Urquiola, 2006). For instance, Manzi et al. (2008) shown that a very large and stable percentage of between-school variance is accounted for by socioeconomic factors; in fact, over 60 percent of this variance is explained by the combination of the individual SES and school average SES. This result is consistent with PISA decomposition of variance (OECD, 2010), which shows that Chile is one of the countries with the largest percentage of between-school variance explained by socioeconomic factors. The same authors Manzi et al. (2008) show that the effect of other variables is negligible, and that the type of school does not explain a relevant share of between school variance once socioeconomic factors are controlled for. These results corroborate the extent of socioeconomic segregation in the Chilean educational system (see also Carrasco & San Martín, 2012; Valenzuela et al., 2014). Considering the previous arguments, it is important to understand that, in the case of Chile, the most important contextual variable to analyze school performance is SES both at individual and school (average) levels, and it is due to this reason why we include these variables and no other.

Second, and from a broader perspective, models with different types of contextual variables usually yield similar results (Timmermans et al., 2011), which would include both basic and advanced value added models (Harris, 2011). However, and interestingly, although different VA models might use different contextual variables, there is a wide consensus on the inclusion among them of SES variables (e.g. see the OECD report on VA models in different countries).

Third, this alternative enables achieving a balance between the amount of information used and the sample size. It is partly debatable if the increased amount of information considered when including more contextual variables offsets the problems derived from the curse of dimensionality, a relevant issue to control for in nonparametric models for efficiency measurement (Simar and Wilson, 2008, p. 441). Actually, in our particular case the number of contextual variables which we summarize in our composite index is relatively high (4) and, therefore, we consider this to be a case in which a composite index may be particularly convenient.

@&#RESULTS@&#


                        Table 4
                         reports the results for the four types of models: type 0 (status model without contextual variables), type 1 (status model with contextual variables), type 2 (pure value added model), type 3 (contextual value added model). The results of type 0 model correspond to the raw results of the average for each student, similar to those reported every year in Chile. The other three types of models correspond to the order-m results obtained for each of them.

Results for the type 0 model are reported in the first column. They indicate remarkable differences in performance among school types. They also indicate that paid private schools outperform their subsidized counterparts, and these, in turn, have better performances than municipal schools. However, it should also be taken into account that this type of evaluation erroneously attributes all existing differences (overall effect) to the school (school effect). This occurs because, according to this type of evaluation, all students are assumed to have similar cognitive abilities as well as optimal input and environmental factors (socioeconomic and cultural level of the student’s family).

The order-m results for the contextual status model (type 1), which decomposes the total effect between pupil effect and school effect are reported in the second column of Table 4. This model considers observable (and therefore not optimal) values of uncontrollable factors at both student and school levels. For the total sample, overall inefficiency (overall effect) is 1.1737 (geometric mean), mainly dominated by the student effect, whose value is 1.1515, and to a much lesser extent by the school effect, which takes a value of 1.0192. Therefore, on average, the contribution of the student effect is much greater than that attributable to the school. The breakdown of these results by type of school indicates that for all three categories the student effect is much more relevant than the school effect on the overall inefficiency. In addition, similarly to what was found for the type 0 model, the overall differences across school types are also remarkable (the geometric means are 1.2335, 1.1500 and 1.0508 for public, privately owned subsidized and privately owned fee paying, respectively).

The results for the type 2 evaluation model (pure added value), reported in the third column of Table 4, consider observed values of students’ academic achievement at both the beginning and the end of the second cycle of basic education. However, it assumes that all students have the optimum deployment of environmental factors. For the whole sample, the geometric mean corresponding to the overall inefficiency (overall effect) is 1.0545, and the student effect (1.0283) is only slightly higher than the school effect (1.0255). However, in this case the decomposition of results by type of school is not analogous to that found either for the type 0 or for the type 1 model. Indeed, although the student effect is relatively stable across school types (between 1.0274 in the case of public schools and 1.0304 in the case of privately-owned fee paying), the school effect varies remarkably. In this case, on average (geometric mean), privately owned fee paying schools are the most efficient (0.9326), whereas public schools are the most inefficient (1.0710).

With respect to the more basic models, the type 3 model represents a value-added evaluation which goes further by incorporating contextual variables at both the student and school levels. The results for this type of evaluation (contextual value added model) are reported in the fourth model in Table 4. For the whole sample, inefficiency decreases substantially with respect to the models evaluated in the preceding paragraphs, since the geometric mean is 1.0155. Indeed, much of this inefficiency is brought about by overall context variables (1.0385), followed by the student effect (1.0179), while the average effect at the school level is close to efficiency (0.9976).

Decomposing the results by type of school we obtain the same ranking as those obtained for the more basic models. Again, regarding the overall effect, public schools are the most inefficient, whereas privately-owned fee paying schools are the most efficient. Regarding the components of the school effect already taken into account (student and school effect), the sorting is also similar—on average. However, there is a now a third effect, the contextual effect (CXTE). This effect is clearly the worst for public schools (1.0518), whereas its impact is less pronounced for privately-owned subsidized schools (1.0329) and privately-owned fee paying schools (1.0101). Regarding the other two effects that had already been included in the previous models, in the case of the school effect we only find inefficiency for public schools. Both privately-owned subsidized and fee paying schools are, on average, efficient or, more specifically, super-efficient, since their corresponding geometric means are below one. In contrast, the student effect indicates there is inefficiency for three types of schools, and its magnitude is similar—on an average.

A more detailed view of the results is gained by inspecting Fig. 2
                        . Each sub-figure represents densities estimated using kernel smoothing for the different components of the type 3 model, and in each particular sub-figure the densities for all school types are also depicted. Therefore, Fig. 2 is the entire distribution counterpart to the fourth column in Table 4, since the results reported are not restricted to some summary statistics such as the (geometric) mean or the variance (not reported). This might be important in some particular contexts, since neither the mean nor any dispersion indicator can detect if some scenarios such as polarization or multi-modality are emerging. Although using additional summary statistics may help in this regard, we consider it is much more informative to analyze the entire shape of the distributions, which provide much more encompassing views.

The results shown in Fig. 2 generally corroborate those reported in Table 4. As indicated in Fig. 2a, the most favorable overall effect (OE) is found for the privately-owned fee paying schools (dash-dotted line), whose density is tightly concentrated in the vicinity of 0.95. In contrast, the density for both public schools (dashed line) and privately-owned subsidized schools (dotted line) shifts rightwards, especially in the case of the former. However, in both cases the probability mass is much more spread than in the case of the privately-owned fee paying schools, generating a remarkable amount of overlapping between the overall effect for both types of schools. The overlapping found between privately-owned fee paying and public schools is much more modest, however.

These results are very similar for the school effect (SCE) reported in Fig. 2, which might be suggesting that the overall effect is mainly driven by the school effect. The contextual effect (CXTE), shown in Fig. 2d, points in this direction as well. In this case, the differences are more pronounced, with no overlapping at all between the contextual effect for public schools (Fig. 2d, dashed line) and that found for privately-owned fee paying schools (Fig. 2d, dash-dotted line). In contrast, the student effect (STE), shown in Fig. 2b, indicates that the differences for all school types are negligible.

We can test formally whether the visual differences observed among school types in Fig. 2 are actually statistically significant or not. Li (1996) test provides the means to do so. This test, also based on kernel smoothing, compared to other nonparametric tests such as the Wilcoxon or Kruskal–Wallis tests has the great advantage of testing whether the differences between the entire distributions, say f(·) and g(·), are significant or not. Despite these great advantages, the applications are still very scarce (see, for instance Kumar & Russell, 2002).

Results for Li (1996) test (see Table 5
                        ) indicate that the differences observed in Fig. 2 are mostly significant at the 1 percent level—i.e., the results of this test would reinforce analytically the results observed visually via the shape of the densities. The significance of these differences is revealed by the p-Values in Table 5 which, with the exception of the student effect (STE), are always zero. In this case, even for the case with the greatest amount of overlapping, corresponding to the comparison of the student effect between public and privately-owned fee paying schools (STE, Fig. 2b), the differences were significant. This would reinforce the convenience of complementing the densities in Fig. 2 with the results of the test in Table 5.

The first methodology we use to compare the different models considered is to estimate school correlation coefficients among the four types of models. Table 6
                         presents the results of the correlations for the school effect (SCE).
                           6
                        
                        
                           6
                           In the case of the evaluation model currently used (model 0), the overall effect (OE) is used as an indicator of school effect.
                         These indicators provide with a first approximation to the question as to how consistent are the school rankings yielded by the different models.

The correlations found for the school effect, as shown in Table 6, are mixed. They are generally high for the whole sample (either close or higher than 0.8). However, by breaking down the sample by type of school, correlations are generally lower (ranging between 0.6 to 0.8). When comparing models, the lowest correlations are observed the results corresponding to the school effect between model 1 (CS) and model 2 (VA). Moreover, we find the highest correlations when comparing the two variants of the VA (model 2 vs. model 3), which might imply that, once VA is accounted for, the effect of the socioeconomic level on school rankings is relatively low. The latter is similar to what reported in studies which compare various value-added models using linear traditional methodologies (Gorard, 2006, 2008; Timmermans et al., 2011). When comparing by type of school, the lowest correlations correspond to private fee-paying schools, followed by the public schools.

In particular, we find relatively high correlations (in the 0.793 and 0.904 range) when comparing the current form of evaluation of schools (model 0) with an evaluation scheme such as the one that the ministry of education is planning to use (model 1). Furthermore, as one might expect, privately-owned fee-paying schools are those with lower correlations, something that anticipates changes in the rankings (or intra-distribution mobility), particularly for this type of schools.

In addition to this, when comparing the results corresponding to model 0 (status) and model 3 (CVA), the correlation between them is higher (0.847) than the correlation between models 0 and 1 (0.793)—in contrast to what one might expect. An analysis of these correlations by type of school indicates that this discrepancy is particularly important for privately-owned subsidized schools, followed by privately-owned fee-paying schools. In public schools, the correlation between both transitions (from model 0 to 1 or 0 to 3) is very similar (0.767 vs. 0.756).

The correlations among the different models offer useful information on the school rankings yielded by each model. However, they have the same disadvantage as that attributable to the information contained in Table 4, i.e. some important phenomena are boiled down to a summary statistic—in Table 4 it is the mean, in Table 6 it is the correlation coefficient. Yet the way in which two given distributions are related may be too complex to be summarized in a single statistic only—i.e. the law of movement between one distribution (say, model 0) and another one (say, model 1) should be modeled more carefully. Related to this, we should bear in mind that the empirical objective of this study is to compare the classification of schools resulting from the application of various models.

Accordingly, Table 7
                         provides results on transition probabilities across models. As indicated by the results in Table 7a, the comparison of the models 0 and 1 indicates that, out of the 100 percent of schools classified in the highest quintile (Q5) according to the average SIMCE (type 0), 61.9 percent remain in the same quintile according to an analysis of contextual status (type 1), 26.3 percent moved to quintile 4, 9.5 percent to quintile 3, 1.6 percent to quintile 2, and 0.5 percent to quintile 1. The transitions corresponding to the schools classified in the lowest quintile (Q1) indicate higher mobility. Indeed, out of the 100 percent of schools classified in the lowest quintile (Q1, 20 percent in line with the average worst SIMCE performance), 61.4 percent would be in the same classification according to a status assessment, 25.8 percent should be classified in quintile 2, 5.8 percent in quintile 3, 5.8 percent in quintile 2, and 1.1 percent in quintile 5. In the case of the central quintiles, the intra-distribution mobility is much higher, as shown by the rest of the entries on the main diagonal (33.2 percent, 28.9 percent and 31.6 percent for quintiles 2, 3 and 4, respectively).

The transitions across models 0 and 3 (current situation vs. CVA evaluation) are shown in Table 7c. In this case, the entries on the main diagonal average to 47.7 percent, compared with the 43.4 percent of Table 7a, indicating lower intra-distribution mobility—i.e. the different schools are more stable in their rankings when contextual variables are introduced. However, on average, almost 53 percent of the schools move in this ranking, suggesting the importance of including this type of effect when modeling school effectiveness. In the case of the central quintiles of the distributions, the changes in the relative positions are still higher (only 36.5 percent, on average, remain in their relative positions), and even higher when modeling the transitions between model 0 and model 1 (barely 31 percent of the central quintiles remain in their relative positions).

This paper has attempted to make a twofold contribution—both methodological and empirical—to the evaluation of school performance. Regarding the methodology considered, our study differs in two aspects from the existing proposals in the literature: the techniques used for performance evaluation and the type of model considered. With respect to our proposed methodological approach for evaluating school effectiveness, unlike most studies in this area which use multilevel regression approaches to measure the net contribution of the student and school in the student’s achievement, we use activity analysis techniques. In this regard, similarly to the recent contributions by De Witte et al. (2010) and Thieme et al. (2013), we use order-m techniques to alleviate the problems of dimensionality and the influence of outliers, obtaining more statistically robust results.

With respect to the type of model considered, previous proposals such as Silva Portela and Thanassoulis (2001) or De Witte et al. (2010) considered only variables of academic achievement at the student level. Instead, we consider contextual variables at both the student and the school levels. This approach is more in line with the studies in the economics of education literature, and enables us to propose a model of contextual value added within the methodological context of activity analysis techniques. To our knowledge, no previous studies have been published using these methodologies to study school performance.

Indeed, the relevant literature of value added and multilevel analysis in education, as well as the results found in this paper, show how important and necessary it is to include contextual variables that are beyond the school’s control (the most notable example is students’ socioeconomic status) at different levels under analysis, mainly for two reasons. First, if we do not consider contextual variables when estimating sub-performing schools that students with unfavorable economic conditions attend, it could result in managers blaming these centers for variables that are beyond their control or, even worse, it might create perverse incentives to select students according to their socio-economic characteristics.

Second, our results also indicate, corroborating the existing literature, that performance differences among the different types of institutions (privately-owned fee paying, privately-owned subsidized, and public schools) decrease significantly when controlling for these variables. From an empirical point of view, the results show that most of the large differences observed in the raw results of academic achievement among types of schools are largely explained away when incorporating variables that account for students’ entry conditions and contextual variables. Thus, much of the variance explained by the school, which is particularly high in Chile due to the high level of school segregation in the country, disappears once these variables enter the model. Indeed, the study results show that, for the total sample average, a pure value added model (type 2 model, which does not consider contextual variables), allocates approximately 53 percent of overall inefficiency to the student effect and the remaining 47 percent to the school effect. However, a contextual VA model (type 3 model) attributes only 33 percent of the inefficiency to the student effect and the remaining inefficiency to the student contextual effect (individual/family and school). So, clearly a VA model over evaluates pure inefficiency of schools whose students do not have optimal socioeconomic status.

This situation becomes more visible when analyzing the results according to the type of schools. Due to the characteristics of the Chilean education system, there is a close correlation between the type of school and the socioeconomic status of their students. Indeed, for privately-owned fee-paying schools, catering to the more affluent sectors of society, and therefore with contextual variables very close to optimal for the vast majority of their students, the differences between the results for type 2 and type 3 models do not vary significantly. In fact, the school effect remains almost unchanged. In contrast, for public schools, catering to the lower income population, the results of school effect change significantly. In this case, the contextual effect incidence almost halves that corresponding to the overall inefficiency.

This study is also relevant to Chile, a country where new reforms that emphasize accountability measures have been recently approved. Specifically, the reforms suggest to classify schools according to their performance, taking into account not only students’ socioeconomic characteristics but also value-added measures. Therefore, the resulting ranking could be quite pertinent to the country’s education system. In this regard, the comparisons performed indicate that moving from the current model that considers only students’ academic achievement variables (type 0) to one that considers contextual variables of both students and their families (type 1) lead to higher re-orderings (or movements in the rankings of school performance) than when the comparison is carried out between type 0 and type 3 models. Therefore, the most comprehensive model (type 3) do not only receive a generally stronger academic support but, in addition, leads to results which are more in line to the current evaluations which have been available for decades.

From an empirical point of view, these results have several implications for the measurement of accountability and public policies in Chile. First, results clearly indicate that the accountability model currently applied in Chile (type 0 model) is not the most appropriate to evaluate the effect of schools on student learning. A status model that does not take into consideration the characteristics of context or prior learning of students cannot measure by how much schools contribute to the educational achievement of students. Our results show that the classification and ranking of schools yielded by the status model differ significantly from those obtained by taking into account prior learning of students. Unfortunately, today the Agency for Quality of Education (Agencia de Calidad de la Educación) in Chile provides information based on a status model which can indicate, erroneously, that setting a high average mark on the standardized tests makes an important contribution to student learning. This is even more problematic in a country like Chile whose public policy in education promotes establishes that the role of the Ministry of Education is to inform parents so that they can freely choose a school for their children. Moreover, the Chilean educational policy uses an incentive system to promote, or punish, the performance of schools based solely on status measures. It is obvious that under such conditions educational managers have perverse incentives to improve their results via selection of top students and to deliver false signals on quality such as uniforms, school names in English, or high tuition prices (Schneider, Elacqua, & Buckley, 2006; Thieme & Treviño, 2013).

A second practical implication concerns the advisability of using value-added measures to evaluate schools. Should Chile adopt a model based on value-added accountability? The answer is not easy. While much of the literature recommends using value added as well as other measures of progress, and this study shows clear differences in the school rankings when comparing different evaluation models, the characteristics of the Chilean education system make it difficult to implement them. This occurs especially due to the need of a minimum number of students who are enrolled in same school between the two measurements. In this regard, previous studies indicate that small samples of students significantly decrease the reliability of the results (Kane & Staiger, 2002). This criterion is particularly difficult to meet for Chile, due to the relatively small size of its schools, as well as the high mobility of students.

Finally, is there an alternative to status models, which deliver consistent results with measures of value added but can be applied to all Chilean schools? Our results suggest that a model of contextual status (type 1 model) is a reasonable balance and, therefore, could be an appropriate solution for Chile. However, in order to approach a model which eliminates managers’ opportunistic behaviors, this solution should be accompanied by public policy measures that prevent selection criteria based on academic reasons and remove entry barriers for economic reasons.
