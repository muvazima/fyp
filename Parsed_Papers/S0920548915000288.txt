                  The efficiency of telecommunication services (TS) has increased their popularity. However, objectively evaluating the quality and the potential of TS is difficult for the TS provider because its milieu differs from that of the customer. This obstructs the progression of TS development and usage. This study therefore provides a model for measuring the presence, magnitude, and form of the perception discrepancy regarding TS. This model can help the TS provider and the customer gauge the pros and cons of investment in TS and shape corresponding strategies by linking the developed model, short/long-term TS strategies, and business activities related to TS.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The deployment of fiber to the x (FTTX) and technological advancements in third generation (3G) and upcoming fourth generation (4G) mobile telecommunications have given birth to many new broadband, multimedia, and cloud computing services in the telecommunication service industry (TSI)
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        The definition of TSI includes network operators and service providers but not hardware suppliers and media industry.
                      
                     [1]. Because of the convenience of telecommunication services (TS), many companies in Taiwan are increasing their use of these services for business management and are demanding highly customized services that suit their business workflow [2,3]. Owing to the increasing popularity and the high efficiency of TS, the competitiveness of companies has strengthened and improved.

Intuitively, after the telecommunication privatization policy was implemented by the Ministry of Transportation & Communications (MOTC) of Taiwan in 1996, the deregulated telecommunications B2B market quickly responded to customer requirements and expectations in order to maximize customer satisfaction. However, the development and usage of TS did not substantially progress [4] because TS providers had difficulty in objectively evaluating the quality and the potential of the designed TS based only on TS customer satisfaction. The reasons are twofold. First, from the TS provider perspective, the TS provider encounters a management dilemma when the Taiwan government attempts to maintain market competition according to the national policy for public resource management. For example, since the service fee of nation-wide TS is still regulated and limited by the Taiwan National Communication Committee, it does not reflect the actual market price.
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        The overall revenues for mobile business reported by Chunghwa Telecom in 2008 declined 1.9% year-over-year due to declining traffic and price cuts imposed by the National Communications Commission (NCC) [5].
                      Therefore, unlike conventional services, the development of TS is affected not only by customer satisfaction, but also by government policy. Secondly, from the TS customer perspective, a TS is considered effective if the gap between customer expectations and actual services received is small, and the perception regarding the TS is determined by the IT and organization milieu of the customer [6]. Therefore, customer satisfaction toward the TS quality is a compound effect that varies according to the customer IT construct (e.g., IT infrastructure and training) and organization characteristics (e.g., centralization and formalization). Therefore, the different milieus of the TS provider and the customer result in different perceptions toward TS. Notably, this phenomenon has been observed not only in Taiwan but also in South Korea and Japan [7,8]. Therefore, according to the above discussion, the quality estimation/evaluation and short/long-term development scheme of the TS should depend not only on customer satisfaction, but also on the gap in perceptions of TS quality between the provider and customer. Hereafter, this perception discrepancy toward TS quality between the provider and the customer is referred to as PDSQ.

Despite the robust theoretical literature, no studies have provided empirical evidence of the presence and magnitude of PDSQ. Some works have analyzed the impact of PDSQ on customer satisfaction without comparing its presence, magnitude, and form between the TS provider and the customer [9–12]. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature on electronic commerce measurement and information systems by providing a model to analyze the presence and magnitude of PDSQ, and in what form PDSQ exists using data commonly available in the TS industry. The impacts of the IT construct gap (ITG) and organization characteristic difference (OCD) between the TS provider and the customer on PDSQ are also analyzed to identify the conditions under which PDSQ occurs and to predict the direction of change. The proposed model applies analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to compare the preferences of the TS providers and the customers regarding TS quality. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is used to compare the providers and the customers in terms of perceived TS quality. The Spearman correlation coefficient is also calculated to determine the relationship between “ITG/OCD” and “the perception variation toward TS quality”. The potential applications of the developed approach include (1) measuring PDSQ, (2) calculating ITG and OCD, and (3) estimating the relationship between (1) and (2). This measurement can help firms understand their service quality and to evaluate alternative methods for managing customer switching costs, retention, and acquisition by harmonizing the differences in IT/organization milieus between the provider and the customer, which can improve TS quality.

The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the literature on the information technology construct, organization characteristics, perception discrepancy, and telecommunication service industry. Section 3 introduces the hypotheses and methodology of this study. Section 4 presents the questionnaire results, analysis, and findings. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions and implications of the study.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

The information technology (IT) construct is the amount of investment in IT infrastructure [13,14] and in training [15,16]. Empirical data in many studies indicate that the magnitude of the IT construct in a firm is the crucial factor in the survival and growth of a firm [17].

The IT Infrastructure includes computers, communications technology, and databases that comprise the IT environment for the software and the hardware requirements of a firm. Two effects of the IT infrastructure are under intensive study in the e-commerce literature. The first is reducing the cost of business processes such as electronic data interchange (EDI) and supply chain systems [18], and the second is using information technology to find improved solutions for problems associated with productivity [19,20]. This results in the introduction of new procedures and possible replacement of original procedures. For example, cloud computing requires migration of computing and data from desktop and handhold devices into large data centers, so that services can be executed over the internet anywhere and anytime, which inevitably changes the business process. Therefore, by evaluating the IT infrastructure through the reduced costs and the enhanced productivity, enterprises can realize the performance and the improvement of IT construction on business process.

The IT training indicates the learning content that enables employees to understand the means of using IT and to realize the enhanced performance that IT can bring to them [21]. Two dimensions are considered when analyzing how IT training contributes to business effectiveness and efficiency: information technology acceptance [22] and resource-based theories [13]. According to the information technology acceptance theory, IT training helps improve employee attitudes about using the information systems. In the resource-based view, IT training develops the IT human resources (e.g., technical know-how and managerial IT skills) that determine the overall competence of a firm. A firm with a strong IT human resource can integrate IT and business processes and can achieve effective cooperation among different business units. By inspecting IT training through the IT acceptance and IT human resource of the employees, enterprises can evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the IT construction on business process.

Organizational characteristics are the formal task and authority relationships that coordinate employee actions and use of resources to achieve organizational goals [23]. Different organizational characteristics also reflect different ways of information processing and organizational practicing. Two dimensions are typically used to represent the attitude and effect of different organizational characteristics on IT usage: centralization and formalization [24–26].

Centralization is the concentration of management power to make decisions and evaluate activities [24]. An organization is highly centralized when the right of the decision making is retained by managers. Although managers can efficiently coordinate organizational activities, opportunities for individual growth and advancement are limited. In contrast, a decentralized organization delegates decisions to frontline employees. Although decentralization can promote flexibility and responsiveness, it increases the difficulty of achieving the long-term business strategy planning and coordination.

Formalization is defined as the explicit rules and procedures for performing organizational operations and decision making [23]. In an organization with high formalization, each employee has distinct function/power and clear-cut responsibility, leading to employee behavior that can be predicable. Although a highly formalized organization has superior integration and efficiency, it can inadvertently impede the spontaneity and flexibility of internal innovation. In an organization with low formalization, the function/power and responsibility is relatively unstructured and undefined, and the employees therefore are more flexible to execute their work. However, as the size and complexity of an organization increases, low formalization can cause inefficient business processes and poor strategic planning.

In this study, service quality is defined as the difference between customer expectations and service performance [27]. Several dimensions of service quality (SERVQUAL) identified in a survey of different industries can be modified for application to different industry conditions and features [28–31]. Therefore, the studies [32–39] regard the dimensions used to evaluate TS can be rearranged by system service quality, information service quality, and customer service quality. System service quality refers to the quality of connectivity, compatibility, and modularity of the hardware and software within an organization; information quality implies the fitness for use of the provided information including the content, accuracy, format, ease of use, and timeliness; customer service quality is the quality of a series of activities designed to assist customers before, during and after a purchase, including the price and technique support.

Therefore, the perception discrepancy of service quality (PDSQ) is the gap between “the service quality which provider presume customer to experience” and “the service quality which the customer actually experiences” [40,41]. A high PDSQ means there is a huge difference between “the service quality expected by the provider” and “the service quality experienced by the customer”. A high PDSQ can cause the provider to misunderstand the causes of customer satisfaction (whether high or low), which leads the provider to make a wrong decision about the future development and wastes huge monetary and time cost which can be avoided. For example, the EEE PC 900A netbook designed by ASUS in 2007 was targeted at schoolchildren in third world countries.
                           3
                        
                        
                           3
                           “Asus plans to ship 1 million Eee PCs to schoolchildren in third-world countries.” from news press “The Eee PC is here” (http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9809393-7.html).
                         However, this product unexpectedly attracted the interest of business workers as a secondary laptop for travel or business affair because of its low price and light weight,
                           4
                        
                        
                           4
                           The “…8.9" screen does not affect the overall weight of the Eee PC™ 900A, which remains below 1kg — allowing children and women to carry it with ease, but also perhaps as a secondary laptop or a good option for travel…” from the Eee PC product website (http://uk.asus.com/Eee/).
                         which resulted in high PDSQ. Therefore, ASUS misinterpreted the high customer satisfaction as customer interest in a small laptop with robust functionalities. Therefore, ASUS changed the design of the Eee PC to a small laptop with high computational ability and further expanded their product lines. However, the true customer need was simply an “interface” for easy access to data and the internet rather than a powerful and robust laptop. Therefore, the lighter, more portable, and more convenient iPad took the market share from the Eee PC in 2009. Afterward, ASUS admitted that Eee PC failed to satisfy the customers and the cost of this failure was 2years of market leading place and countless monetary cost.

                           5
                           Former ASUS CEO Ian Drew stated that ASUS has “failed the consumer because we have imposed constraints on them.” (http://www.gaj-it.com/14190/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-netbook-will-apples-tablet-become-king/).
                        
                     

The IT construct and organizational characteristics may also be related to PDSQ as do the information quality, system quality, and customer service quality of TS. The gap of the IT constructs, e.g., IT infrastructure and IT training, between the provider and customer may affect the perspectives of the provider and the customer regarding the philosophies and technologies of TS design [42]. In contrast, differences in organizational characteristics, e.g., formalization and centralization, between the provider and the customer imply incompatible business procedures and, of course, the TS system procedure. These differences may also cause some inconvenience/disutility perceived and experienced by a customer from the original system to the new TS provided by providers [43].

A telecommunication service is an offer of service for a fee directly to the public or to a class of users while telecommunications is the transmission of data selected by the user.

                         The TS market is oligopolistic because of the high barriers to entry, such as the enormous cost and license fees of infrastructure construction and the radio spectrum [44].

A TS is an interesting candidate for studying how discrepancies in quality perception affect customer satisfaction for several reasons. First, TSI is a large and significant market because telecommunication service spending comprises the largest ratio of spending on information technology products and services. By year 2011, global TS spending reached $1.7 trillion while global IT spending approximated $3.66 trillion. Therefore, approximately 46.4% of the IT spending is TS spending [45]. Additionally, the penetration rates of mobile and fixed-line broadband TSs in Taiwan increased from 5.2% (2005) to 71.2% (2010) and from 19.1% (2005) to 22.9% (2010), respectively, which demonstrates the growing dependence of Taiwan citizens on telecommunication services [46]. Second, the rapid, complex, and unprecedented progress of telecommunication technology has resulted in continuous development and promotion of new TSs by providers [42]. As a result, the TS customers are often forced to learn and integrate these new TSs into their business strategy and workflow in order to strengthen their competition capability. Third, the TS customers have highly diverse levels and types of IT adoption/training and organizational structures/procedures [47]. These events motivated this study of the effects of IT and organization on PDSQ. Finally, the oligopolistic TS market in Taiwan cannot quickly respond to the requirements and expectations of customers [4]. This slow interaction process provides an opportunity to observe the changes in the perceptions and attitudes of the TS providers and the customers regarding TS quality. For the same reasons, TS is also an excellent case study to measure the presence, magnitude, and effects of PDSQ.

This study analyzed the presence, magnitude, and forms of PDSQ by using data obtained from the TS providers and the customers. For this purpose, as mentioned in Section 2, this study defines the provider perception of service quality (PPSQ) as the expected service quality from the provider perspective and defines customer perception of service quality (CPSQ) as the quality and functionality that a customer actually experiences from the acquired service. Therefore, the perception discrepancy of service quality (PDSQ) is the gap between the PPSQ and CPSQ. According to the literature discussed in Section 2.3, the presence and magnitude of PDSQ might be related to the IT construct gap between the provider and the customer, and they might be also related to the differences in organizational characteristics between the provider and the customer. Therefore, this study also defines the IT construct gap (ITG) as the IT construct gap between a provider and a customer in terms of IT infrastructure and training and defines the organization characteristic difference (OCD) as the different degrees of the formalization and centralization between a provider and a customer. By exploring the relationship between ITG and PDSQ and the relationship between OCD and PDSQ, the TS provider can comprehend the conditions under which the PDSQ takes place and predict the direction of the PDSQ changes. Table 1
                         summarizes these factors along with descriptions and variable names, and Fig. 1
                         depicts the research framework of this study.

First, a simple null hypothesis is introduced to ensure the existence of PDSQ:
                           Hypothesis 1
                           Perceived discrepancy of service quality (PDSQ) does not significantly differ between the providers and the customers.

After ensuring the existence of PDSQ by rejecting Hypothesis 1, this study distinguishes between the milieu of the provider and that of the customer and how they affect PDSQ. The purpose is two-fold.

First, PDSQ is associated with different observable variables (i.e., TS provider and customer), which have different strategic implications. If PDSQ is driven solely by customer characteristics, then the challenge for providers is identifying the customers who are most likely to be loyal and those most likely to be misled by observable attributes or past behaviors. On the other hand, if PDSQ is solely due to provider practices, a TS designed by the provider is likely to be affected by non-market forces such as government regulation. Thus, the challenge is how to design their TS offerings and products such that they can balance the non-market strategies/issues to maintain customer loyalty in old customers or to develop customer loyalty in new customers.

Second, in addition to measuring the presence of PDSQ, the effects of the TS provider and the customer attributes on PDSQ should also be measured. Specifically, the TS provider and the customer attributes should be used to predict PDSQ.

The rationale is that the way to estimate PDSQ (in Hypothesis 1) is to compute the PDSQ directly for each provider and customer and to regress them on the provider and customer characteristics. However, a limitation of this strategy is the inability to predict how PDSQ will evolve by observing the current status of PDSQ. Additionally, it cannot effectively examine customer-specific effects on PDSQ. Therefore, this study developed a model for predicting PDSQ as a function of the TS provider and customer attributes, such as the IT construct and organization characteristics. The model also enables conceptualization and prediction of the presence and evolving patterns of PDSQ.

Therefore, this empirical analysis attempts to distinguish these effects by statistically controlling heterogeneity between the TS providers and the customers. Therefore, this study hypothesized that the IT construct gap between the TS provider and the customer (IT gap or ITG hereafter) affects PDSQ. A large ITG, which results from a TS customer with poor IT infrastructure and insufficient IT training compared to the TS provider, may result in customers who are prone to recognize the advantages of TS (i.e., efficiency and effectiveness) but ignore the corresponding “side-effect” (such as the integration/coordination problems) [64,65]. This results from customers with low IT constructs and insufficient IT knowledge to comprehend and predict the effect of introducing such TS into their company. Therefore, they are inclined to believe and accept that the TS service quality would be what the TS provider says. As a result, the PDSQ between the TS provider and the customer is low. In contrast, low ITG may result in high PDSQ. This results from the TS customers with high IT construct comprehending the pros and cons of introducing such IS into their company, and on the other hand, the TS provider who just pushes the sales cannot know whether their TS is suitable for their customer or not. Therefore, they inevitably have a huge TS perception discrepancy. Accordingly, the second hypothesis was formulated as:
                           Hypothesis 2
                           The IT construct gap between the TS provider and customer correlates negatively with PDSQ.

By the same arguments as ITG on PDSQ mentioned above, this study also generally expects that organization characteristic difference (OCD) in terms of centralization and formalization between the TS provider and customer should have some effect on PDSQ. Organizational characteristics are the implementation, execution, and control of business process. These characteristics also determine the TS design philosophy of the TS provider and the behavior pattern of the TS customer when performing their business procedure. Different organization characteristics between the provider and customer could result in a TS service that does not operate as expected by the TS customer. This arises because the behavioral patterns and business procedures of the employee are shaped to become compatible with the demands of the role requirements of the organization. When the TS customers become accustomed to the conventional procedure in their organizations, they may become confused when using a TS service developed by the TS provider with quite different organization characteristics. For example, if the provider is an organization with low centralization, the philosophy of delegating authority to subordinates is unintentionally embedded in the designed TS, which depresses the customer in a highly centralized organization since the customer must strictly monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of corporate activities. In contrast, a provider with a highly formalized organization would be inclined to design a TS embedded with explicit rules and procedures. From the perspective of a customer with low formalized organization, the explicit rules and procedures result in insufficiency and inflexibility, which leads customers to believe that the quality of a TS designed by the provider is inferior and does not meet their requirements. Thus, the tension and misunderstanding between customers and provider increase. These phenomena may then increase the service perception discrepancy. Thus, the following hypothesis was proposed.
                           Hypothesis 3
                           The difference in organizational characteristics between the TS provider and customer correlates positively with PDSQ.


                        Hypothesis 1 was examined by comparing the preferences of the TS provider and customer on the attributes of service quality. Without PDSQ, the TS provider and customer would have the same preference on each attribute of service quality based on average quality levels. However, a difference between the preferences of the TS provider and customer regarding service quality attributes suggests that they have different perspectives on what TS should be, which results in a PDSQ.

Therefore, the two-step process used to measure PDSQ was (1) applying analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to estimate the preference of each criteria from the TS provider perspective and the preference of each criteria from the customer perspective and (2) applying multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to evaluate the variation in the two preferences from the viewpoint of the TS provider and that of the customer. The AHP is a research method to support rational decision making on several qualitative factors, and it makes use of pairwise comparisons, hierarchical structures, and 9-point ratio scaling to apply weights to attributes [66]. Here, the AHP enabled the estimation of the preferences for each service quality dimension from the viewpoint of the TS provider and customer, respectively. The details of the two-step process are as follows.

In the first step, two-tier criteria hierarchy is used to apply AHP (Fig. 2
                        ). The goal, which is at the top of the control hierarchy, is to assess service quality in TS. Level 1 has three criteria: system service quality (A
                        1,1), information service quality (A
                        1,2), and customer service quality (A
                        1,3). Based on the results of expert interviews, several sub-criteria at level 2 are selected using random selection format and simple frequency analysis method. System service quality has five sub-criteria: efficiency & effectiveness (A
                        2,1), functionality (A
                        2,2), integration (A
                        2,3), construct cost (A
                        2,4), and security (A
                        2,5); information service quality owns four sub-criteria including accuracy (A
                        2,6), integrity (A
                        2,7), usability (A
                        2,8), and readability (A
                        2,9); and customer service quality has four sub-criteria including after sales service (A
                        2,10), flexible-price policy (A
                        2,11), technique support (A
                        2,12), and training (A
                        2,13). The AHP enabled estimation of the preferences of the TS provider regarding service quality, which were A

The second step applies MANOCA to evaluate the similarities in the preferences (i.e., A

Otherwise, Hypothesis 1 is accepted. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was also performed to ensure that the personal characteristics of the respondents would not affect the preference toward the TS.


                        Hypotheses 2 and 3 were tested by using a two-step process to determine how ITG and OCD affect PDSQ.

First, the square root of the sum of the squares (RSS), which is typically used to calculate the aggregate accuracy of a measurement when all measuring items are known, is used to calculate PDSQ, ITG, and OCD. The PDSQ between provider i and customer j (PDSQ
                           i,j
                        ) was obtained by comparing preferences for each service quality criterion between provider i and customer j:

                         are the mean values calculated in Eqs. (1), (2), and (3), respectively. The R value, which ranges from −1 to 1, is the correlation between variables ITG/OCD and PDSQ. An R value of 1 indicates a positive correlation, and an R value of −1 indicates a negative correlation. An R value of 0 indicates that PDSQ and ITG/OCD are not linearly correlated.

The data used to test Hypothesis 1 regarding the TS provider perspective of service quality were collected from the five TS providers in Taiwan. The five TS providers are Chunghwa Telecom (6,697,428 subscribers, 29.54% of total subscribers), TWM Solution (5,781,758 subscribers, 25.49% of total subscribers), FarEasTone (5,666,932 subscribers, 24.99% of total subscribers), Asia Pacific Telecom (2,860,762 subscribers, 12.62% of total subscribers), and Vibo (1,669,669 subscribers, 7.36% of total subscribers) [67]. Since these TS providers provide similar TS products (i.e., virtual server hosting, audio conference service, micro payment service) at similar prices, the analysis did not consider the barriers and switching costs for TS customers switching between TS providers.

The data used to analyze the effects of TS customer perceptions on TS service quality were collected from TS customers in Taiwan. To ensure consistent data across different industry types, the TS customers are categorized into four economic sectors: primary (55.55% CPR
                           7
                        
                        
                           7
                           CPR: computer penetration ratio.
                        ), secondary (73.66% CPR), tertiary (75.39% CPR), and quaternary industry sector (93.48% CPR) [68,69]. The primary industry section includes industries that profit from extraction of natural resources, e.g., farming, mining, and fishing; the secondary industry section is the factories that process products from the primary industries, such as refining metals, producing furniture, and packing farm products; the tertiary industry sector includes services as teaching, management; and the quaternary industry sector means the research group of science and technology. All collected data were classified into one of these four sectors.

The same questionnaires were used to collect the IT constructs and organization characteristics of the TS providers and customers in order to examine Hypotheses 2 and 3. The questionnaires also collect demographic data (years of experience, job grades, education background, and volume of business) from the respondents, which included the TS providers and customers to enable use of individual-level control variables and to ensure that the data were demographically consistent.

These data had three key limitations. First, the questionnaires are collected from the TS providers and customers in a specific geographic region, i.e., Taiwan. The data may not be uniformly applied without discretion. Second, the questionnaire did not obtain the perspective of the TS provider regarding some TS products, i.e., monopolistic TS products (e.g., IPTV) and obsolete TS products (e.g., 2G mobile service). The purpose was to avoid bias since some TS providers do not provide these TS products. The third issue is that data was collected only for work usage but not home usage. Therefore, perceptions of TS service quality were not analyzed in single office/home office (SOHO). The SOHO workers were excluded from analysis because they typically use the same TS products for both work and personal use, which would have introduced errors into the analysis in this study.

This study explored the relationships among the IT construct gap, organization characteristic difference, and perception discrepancy of service quality between the TS provider and customer, as shown in Fig. 3
                     . The survey was performed from June, 2012 to February, 2013. The TS customer population included Taiwan firms listed in Taiwan Business Directory published in 2011. A random stratified sampling method was used to select 50 firms in each of the four economic sectors. The TS provider population included telecommunication service providers in Taiwan. A random stratified sampling method was used to select 25 project leaders/senior software programmers and senior executives (i.e., directors or general managers) to avoid common method variance problems. The surveys were performed in face-to-face interviews and by telephone. Of the 75 questionnaires distributed, 22 responses were invalid. The remaining 53 questionnaires were valid, which resulted in a useable response rate of 70.66%.


                     Fig. 4
                      shows the three-part questionnaire used for hypothesis testing in this study. The first section of the questionnaire was used to collect the respondent characteristics. The second section of the questionnaire was used to perform AHP. The consistency ratio was calculated to ensure consistency in this section. A CR of less than 0.1 was considered an indication that the section was trustworthy. The third section of the questionnaire contained Likert-type scales ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree).

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to reduce the number of variables regarding the IT construct with the minimum loss of information. Therefore, the items with eigenvalues higher than 1 were extracted for analysis, and those with factor loadings higher than 0.7 were retained in order to ensure the convergent validity [70]. To enhance the rigor and simplicity of the measurements, the dimensions of these retained factors were further extracted by principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation method. Cronbach's alpha values were also calculated to ensure internal consistency of the questionnaires [71].

The reliability and validity of the measurements were ensured by performing the item generation process described in the studies listed in Table 1 in Section 3, in Cron & Sobol [72], and in Sakaguchi & Dibrell [22]. A list of 36 questionnaire items was reviewed by four academic researchers with expertise in survey methodology and telecommunication service. The explanation and corresponding results are given in the sub-sections below.


                        Hypothesis 1, i.e., that service perceptions do not significantly differ between the TS providers and customers, was tested by the second part of the questionnaire. First, 13 items were used to measure the perception preference of providers and customers regarding TS. A one-way between-group MANOVA was then used to compare the variation in the perceptions between the TS providers and customers toward TS. Table 2
                         shows that the multivariate analysis confirmed a statistically significant difference between the TS providers and customers toward the TS quality.


                        Table 2(a) and Fig. 5
                         further reveal the different viewpoints under the restrictive assumption of the two criteria for evaluating a TS. As a result, the sets of preferences and perceptions differed between the TS providers and customers. Table 2(a) shows that, according to the TS providers, after-sales service, technique support, and effectiveness & efficiency were the key TS quality indicators. In contrast, TS customers indicated that integrity, accuracy, and security indicator were the key TS quality indicators. Notably, Fig. 5 shows that the TS providers and customers significantly (above 0.04) differed in the indicators of after-sales service, technique support, construct cost, accuracy, and integrity. The preferences of the TS providers regarding after-sales service and technical support were substantially higher than those of the TS customers. However, the preferences of the TS providers regarding construct cost, accuracy, and integrity were substantially lower than those of the TS customers. The hypothesized reasons are the following. The TS provider focuses on costs and schedules, so the services are designed to be highly flexible in order to fit widely varying requirements with minimal modification effort/cost. However, this strategy inevitably requires the provider to improve technical support and after-sales service. It also motivates providers to persuade customers to upgrade their IT infrastructure to fit the provider TS. However, customers think that accurately integrating the TS into customer business procedure is most important and should not be postponed to the after-sales service. Moreover, the TS designed by the provider should also fit the IT infrastructure currently used by the customer rather than requiring an upgrade to hardware/software with enhanced but non-essential capability. Therefore, the strategy to achieve a faster and less costly TS may not always meet customer requirements. This phenomenon is also consistent with the studies in [73,74].

This study further controlled the economic sectors of TS customers in order to observe the discrepancy in preferences between the TS providers and TS customers in different economic sectors. Table 3
                         shows statically significant differences between the TS providers and customers when controlling the economic sectors of the TS customers. On the other hand, after further controlling for the annual income of the TS customers, Table 4
                         also shows that the TS providers and customers significantly differed. That is, the discrepancy in the TS indicators between the TS providers and TS customers occurred regardless of the economic sector or business scale of the TS customers.

A MANCOVA was further used to ensure that the personal characteristics of the respondents would not affect the TS preferences. The control variables included age, years of experience, job grades, and education background. Table 5
                         shows that respondents with different personal characteristics did not significantly differ in the TS preferences.

Based on the analytical results, Hypothesis 1 was rejected, i.e., service perceptions significantly differed between the TS providers and customers.


                        Hypothesis 2, that the gap in the IT construct between the TS provider and customer significantly affects PDSQ, was tested by the III-A part of the questionnaire. A two-phase procedure was applied, and the results were as follows.

First, two dimensions with nine items were used to measure the IT construct of the TS providers and customers. Table 6(a) shows the results of the factor analysis, which revealed two dimensions, IT training (five items, α=0.88) and IT infrastructure (four items, α=0.92), which is consistent with the literature review discussed in Section 2.1. The items included in the IT training dimension were “Knowledge management mechanism”, “IT consultancy”, “Collaborative training”, “Off-site training”, and “On-site training”. The items in the IT infrastructure were “Software investment”, “Telecommunication technology”, “Personal computer & mobile device investment”, and “Mainframe hardware support”.

The Spearman correlation coefficient was then used to measure the relationship between the “IT construct gap between the TS provider and customer (ITG)” and “perception discrepancy between the TS provider and customer toward TS (PDSQ)”. Table 6(b) shows the analytical results, which indicated that ITG has a significant negative effect on PDSQ. Hence, Hypothesis 2 was supported.

The effects of two ITG dimensions on three PDSQ dimensions were further explored since the results in Table 6(b) only revealed the compound effect. Fig. 6
                         also presents the relationships between two dimensions of the IT construct gap and three dimensions of PDSQ. Table 7
                         shows that both “the IT infrastructure gap” and “the IT training gap” have significant negative effects on “the perception discrepancy of the system service quality” and “the perception discrepancy of information service quality”. The interpretation is that, given that the questionnaires revealed that the TS providers have a high IT construct, the lower the IT construct of the TS customers, the larger the IT construct gaps. Therefore, “perception discrepancy of system service quality” and “perception discrepancy of information service quality” decrease. The reason is that, once the TS customer IT construct is poor, the TS provider would automatically obtain the expert power
                           8
                        
                        
                           8
                           Expert power is the term widely used in social science to describe power based on credibility or perceived expertise or skills in an area [75].
                         and the TS customer has to obey the authority of the TS provider regarding his/her expertise in IT. Specifically, when the TS provider have sufficient IT knowledge which enables him/her to comprehend the situation that the TS customer encounters and provides judgment, the TS customer with low IT construct will likely defer to the TS provider. If the TS provider demonstrates his/her experience and achievement in TS and attempts to expand them to the TS customer business procedure, the TS customer tends to respect, trust, and then accept the TS provider's suggestion/solution and furthermore look to the TS to provide for leadership, even the TS customer does not have sufficient IT knowledge to make sure such suggestion/solution is suitable for his/her business procedure and can be seamlessly integrated into his/her original information system. As the result, the TS provider derives expert power from his/her expertise in the IT construct, when the TS customer lacks IT construct and requires such expertise.

In contrast, the TS provider cannot obtain expert power when the TS customer IT construct is high and the IT construct gap between the TS provider and customer is low. In such circumstance, the TS customer does have sufficient IT knowledge and understand what situation he/her encounters and what TS he/she exactly needs very well. Therefore, the TS customer has the power to disagree with the TS provider regarding the TS especially in terms of system quality and information quality. As a result, “the perception discrepancy of system service quality” and “the perception discrepancy of information service quality” inescapably increase.

Conversely, “IT infrastructure gap” and “IT training gap” have a significant positive correlation with “the perception discrepancy of customer service quality” as shown in Table 7. This means that, given that the TS providers own high IT construct based on the questionnaires, the lower IT construct that the TS customers own, the insufficient IT knowledge that the TS customers have, and the larger the IT construct gaps are caused, lead to the increase of “the perception discrepancy of customer service quality”. The reasons for this phenomenon are twofold.

First, the TS customer service is mostly triggered by the TS customer response. In other words, the TS customer service is generally provided after the provider receives the complaint from the customer. This gives the TS customer information power.
                           9
                        
                        
                           9
                           Information power is the term widely used in social science to describe power based on the potential to manage information including how to limit it to the key people, how to organize/interpret it, or even to falsify it [75].
                         Once a TS customer does not have insufficient IT knowledge to manage information power, he/she cannot make a rational argument to persuade the TS provider to provide sufficient customer service quality. In this case, the TS provider has the power to contend with the TS customer regarding the TS, especially in terms of customer service quality. The “perception discrepancy in customer service quality” then increases.

Second, the TS customer without sufficient IT knowledge tends to ask the TS provider to establish a concise and delicate IT risk management
                           10
                        
                        
                           10
                           Risk management is the process of identifying vulnerabilities/threats to information resources and deciding what countermeasures can reduce risk to an acceptable level based on the value of the information resource to the organization [76].
                         framework to minimize, monitor, and control the impact of unfortunate events. However, the expert interviews in this study indicated that establishing such a framework is difficult for three reasons. First, strategizing and decision making in conventional risk management required statistical analysis of probability based on the prior events. However, as TS evolves with the continuing changes in the technological environment, the designed risk management framework and corresponding measurement may not adequately cope with a potential/unknown new threat.
                           11
                        
                        
                           11
                           Threat is “a potential cause of an incident, that may result in the harming of systems and organization.” [77].
                         Second, the IT risk management methodology involves highly subjective valuations of TS customer assets related to TS service, especially for intangible assets such as business processes, information, and intelligent assets. Third, building a system for monitoring deterioration in TS quality and for initiating required action is still a controversial issue both technically and legally. From a technical perspective, monitoring TS quality confronts the scalability problem because the TS traffic traverse along all the routers on the traffic path, especially on a global scale TS, rather than merely the two ends of the TS provider and the customer. From the legislative view, building such a monitoring system is likely to be viewed as an excuse for introducing internet censorship in order to monitor and control the transfer, publication, viewing, and access of information because such a system inevitably infringes upon privacy and eventually affects innocent TS customers with low IT constructs, whose TS traffic may be hijacked without their knowledge. Similar views were also expressed in [78].

A TS customer with a high IT construct, however, can efficiently use information power to persuade the TS provider to provide the required customer service since a TS customer with a high IT construct knows what technique supports he/she requires, how to organize and interpret this requirement to the key person of the TS provider, and how to persuade him/her to provide such customer service. Therefore, “the perception discrepancy of customer service quality” decreases.


                        Hypothesis 3, i.e., that differences in organizational characteristics between the TS provider and the customer significantly affect PDSQ, was tested by the III-B part of the questionnaire through a two-phase procedure. The analysis was performed as follows.

First, two dimensions with eleven items were used to capture the organizational characteristics of the TS provider and the TS customer. Table 8(a) presents the factor analysis results. The two dimensions are centralization (six items, α=0.91) and formalization (five items, α=0.90), which are consistent with the results of the literature review discussed in Section 2.2. Centralization consists of items: “Employee autonomy”, “Chain of command”, “Division of labor and cooperation”, “Participation in the decision making”, “Problem reporting/resolving through one channel”, and “Explicit promotion and rotation system”. Formalization includes “Norm”, “Standard operating procedure”, “Purposely impersonal”, “Stable organization structure”, and “Complex work flow”.

Second, the Spearman correlation coefficient was also performed to measure the relationship between “the organization characteristic difference between the TS provider and the customer (OCD)” and “perception discrepancy between the TS provider and the customer toward TS (PDSQ)”. Table 8(b) shows the analysis results, which indicate that OCD has significant positive effects on PDSQ. Hence, Hypothesis 3 was supported.

This study performed a detailed analysis of the effects of differences in two dimensions of organizational characteristics on three dimensions of PDSQ. Whereas Table 8(b) only shows the compound effect, Table 9
                         and Fig. 7
                         show that both “formalization difference” and “centralization difference” significantly and positively affect the perception discrepancy of system service quality, information service quality, and customer service quality. This confirms the assumption in Section 3.1.

Notably, the positive effects of “formalization difference” (rho value=0.090) and “centralization difference” (rho value=0.093) on the perception discrepancy of customer service quality are relatively small. The reason is provided as follows. The TS providers have evolved into an organization with low centralization to ensure that it is a more responsive and adaptive one for the more rapidly changing TS business environment, and they have also developed as a high formalized organization to provide a predictable procedure without losing control of their giant TS cooperation's activities. As a result, a TS provider with low centralization and high formalization matches the expectations of the TS customer regarding TS customer service quality, i.e., TS customers prefer that customer service is highly responsive, adaptive, and predictable [79], which decreases the effect of “organization characteristic difference” on “the perception discrepancy of customer service quality”.

Based on data commonly available in the TS industry, this study measured the presence and magnitude of PDSQ. The analytical results revealed statistically significant perception differences between the TS providers and the customers in terms of TS information quality, system quality, and customer quality regardless of economic sectors or business scale of the TS customers. Notably, the perception of the TS providers and the customers substantially differed in the indicators of after-sales service, technique support, construct cost, accuracy, and integrity.

The relationships between the ITG/OCD and PDSQ were further investigated. The results show that ITG is negatively correlated with PDSQ mainly due to a firm with high IT construct owning high expert power. This leads the firm with low IT construct tending to respect, trust, and accept the suggestion/solution of the firm with high IT construct, and look for leadership in advance. As a result, the higher the ITG exists, the lower the PDSQ is. On the other hand, the OCD is positively correlated with PDSQ because the more similar organization characteristics the provider and the customer have, the more similar business behavior patterns they have, leading them to have a more similar perception toward the TS quality. Therefore, PDSQ decreases as OCD decreases.

The analytical results of this study have several implications for researchers and practitioners. First, this study offers a new and comprehensive view of the TS provider/customer perceptions and attitudes about TS. This study shows how and why their perceptions toward TS differ and also provides a model for measuring its presence, magnitude, and in what form it exists. This model further explores the conditions under which perceptions differ and their directions of change.

Second, the TS provider can apply the proposed model to develop a business strategy based on PDSQ rather than merely relying on the customer satisfaction. By using the model to predict the evolvement of TS, the TS provider can adjust their future TS investment accordingly. The TS provider can also use the model to predict customer decisions after estimating ITG and OCD.

Third, the TS customers can also use this model to understand the motivations of the TS provider to provide such a TS service to them. That is, the TS customer can analyze and predict the business strategy of the TS provider by this model. Moreover, the TS customers can better gauge the pros and cons of the TS investment by linking this model, their short/long-term TS strategies, and their business activities relative to TS.
