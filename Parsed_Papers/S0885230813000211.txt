                  Post-filtering can be used in mobile communications to improve the quality and intelligibility of speech. Energy reallocation with a high-pass type filter has been shown to work effectively in improving the intelligibility of speech in difficult noise conditions. This paper introduces a post-filtering algorithm that adapts to the background noise level as well as to the fundamental frequency of the speaker and models the spectral effects observed in natural Lombard speech. The introduced method and another post-filtering technique were compared to unprocessed telephone speech in subjective listening tests in terms of intelligibility and quality. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the reference method in difficult noise conditions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In mobile communications, pre- and post-processing methods are used to enhance the quality and intelligibility of degraded speech. The degradation can be caused by quantization noise or acoustical background noise from the sending or receiving side of the communication channel, referred to as far end or near end, respectively. Noise reduction methods are typically used in mobile phones as a pre-processing step to remove far-end noise before speech is transmitted over the communication channel. In contrast, techniques that process speech in order to enhance its quality and intelligibility when listened to in noisy near-end conditions are implemented as a post-processing step in the receiving side of the channel. In the case of speech signals with negligible noise, post-processing is typically implemented in the form of post-filtering, which refers to filtering the decoded speech signal at the mobile phone receiver with an adaptive filter. A conventional post-filtering method, introduced by Chen and Gersho (1995), contains a short-term formant filter and a long-term pitch filter which are used to emphasize the formant and pitch peaks, respectively, and to attenuate noise components in the valleys between the peaks. This straightforward filter structure has shown good performance in improving the perceptual quality of speech. The approach proposed by Chen and Gersho (1995) has been developed further in several studies, for instance, by utilizing a modified Yule-Walker filter (Mustapha and Yeldener, 1999) and psychoacoustic models (Chen et al., 2005). Additionally, a modified version with better adaptability to varying noise conditions was proposed by Grancharov et al. (2008). They replaced the post-filter parameters controlling the formant and pitch emphasis with new parameters that were adapted to the statistics of the background noise and showed this modification to improve the performance of the basic post-filter with different noise types and varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, as in most of the previous studies on post-filtering, the tests were conducted in moderate noise conditions where the quality of speech is the main focus. Mobile communications might, however, involve scenarios in which speech is listened to in difficult background noise conditions. In these circumstances, quality is no longer essential, and speech intelligibility becomes the most important factor affecting the communication.

Several post-processing methods addressing the improvement of intelligibility in adverse noise conditions have been proposed. For instance, Sauert and Vary (2006, 2010) presented several slightly modified algorithms, which try to find optimal gains for the sub-bands of the unprocessed speech signal by maximizing the speech intelligibility index (SII). The proposed methods have been shown to improve intelligibility as measured with SII, but the authors did not conduct any subjective tests on the algorithms. Similarly, Tang and Cooke (2012) used reallocation of speech energy across frequency by determining optimal frequency band weights with glimpse proportion as the objective intelligibility metric. Their approach was evaluated in several noise conditions with subjective listening tests and was shown to improve intelligibility over unprocessed speech, but the effects of the processing on quality were not studied. In addition, Skowronski and Harris (2006) have used a similar energy reallocation approach to transfer energy from voiced sounds to unvoiced utterances while preserving the overall energy.

Energy reallocation can also be used in post-filtering algorithms by utilizing a high-pass type post-filter to attenuate low frequency regions and to enhance higher frequencies, effectively transferring more energy to upper frequencies. Niederjohn and Grotelueschen (1976) used high-pass filtering in combination with amplitude compression and demonstrated that this approach produced intelligibility gain compared to unprocessed speech in noisy conditions. Additionally, Hall and Flanagan (2010) studied the effects of two techniques utilizing high-pass type filters, differentiation and formant equalization, on the intelligibility of telephone speech and concluded that both approaches provided more intelligible speech. However, while this kind of post-filtering has been shown to provide intelligibility enhancement, it is worth noting that the improvement is due to high-pass filtering which is unable to model the spectral changes occurring in the production of natural speech when, for instance, vocal effort is increased to enhance loudness. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a post-filtering method capable of better modeling the spectral effects that occur in natural human-to-human communication when talkers change their speaking style in order to make their speech more intelligible.

The Lombard effect is a natural phenomenon observed when talkers modify their speaking style in the presence of background noise (Lombard, 1911; Summers et al., 1988). The speech signal produced due to this effect is called Lombard speech. Naturally produced Lombard speech contains multiple modifications compared to normal speech, such as increased vocal intensity, fundamental frequency (F
                     0), formant frequencies, and word durations, as well as decreased spectral tilt (Junqua, 1993), and it has been shown to increase intelligibility (Summers et al., 1988). Furthermore, for instance Lu and Cooke (2009) studied the effects of these changes on intelligibility and showed that the decrease in spectral tilt is a major factor in improving the intelligibility, although other modifications contribute as well. Post-processing algorithms based on energy reallocation from low to high frequencies produce similarly some decrease in the overall spectral tilt, and thus they can be said to take advantage of this aspect of Lombard speech. Additionally, Huang et al. (2009) used an analysis-synthesis approach to mimic the modifications present in Lombard speech more closely and obtained positive results in subjective intelligibility tests. However, their method utilizes a computationally expensive analysis system, which makes the algorithm unsuitable for mobile phones. In this application area, limitations, such as the need for frame-based analysis with low delay enabling real-time processing as well as low computational demand, complicate the implementation of post-processing algorithms. Consequently, with the exception of the present authors’ recent conference paper (Jokinen et al., 2012), there are no previous studies, to the knowledge of the authors, attempting to utilize spectral tilt compensation and formant shaping introduced by Lombard speech in post-processing methods suitable for mobile phones.

In this study, an adaptive post-filtering method motivated by the natural Lombard effect is introduced. The approach is aimed at the intelligibility improvement of narrowband telephone speech in severe near-end background noise conditions. The far-end speech signal is assumed to have negligible noise, and at the near end of the communication channel, a Lombard-like effect is artificially created to enhance the intelligibility of the received narrowband speech signal. Narrowband speech contains less information and acoustical cues in comparison to wideband speech and it therefore constitutes a more challenging speech material for intelligibility enhancement algorithms. However, narrowband speech is still prevalent in mobile communications and is, therefore, a natural choice as the focus of this study. The post-filter implementation also fulfills the other requirements set by the mobile communications framework mentioned above and, additionally, adapts to the level of the background noise in a robust manner. The performance of the proposed method was compared to the post-filtering technique proposed by Hall and Flanagan (2010) in terms of intelligibility as well as subjective quality in listening tests.

@&#METHODS@&#

A new post-filtering algorithm imitating natural Lombard speech was developed in this work. This new technique, the Lombard-motivated (LM) post-filtering algorithm, was compared to a formant equalizing (FE) post-filtering method proposed recently by Hall and Flanagan (2010). The computational complexity and processing delay of these methods are low, which makes their practical implementation in a mobile phone receiver feasible. Both methods utilize a high-pass filter to transfer speech energy from low to high frequencies. This is implemented in FE using a fixed filter, whereas the LM method adapts the filtering according to the spectral characteristics of the far-end speaker's voice as well as the level of the near-end background noise.

The flowchart of the LM post-filtering algorithm is shown in Fig. 1
                        . The algorithm consists of four sections which are spectral tilt compensation, formant sharpening, F
                        0- and noise-adaptive high-pass filtering, and gain control. The incoming speech signal is processed in 20-ms frames with 10-ms overlap using an 8-kHz sampling frequency. In addition to the speech frame, an estimate of the F
                        0 of the speaker as well as of the level of the background noise is required. The estimate of the F
                        0 is obtained directly from the speech decoder (3rd Generation Partnership Project, 2009) at the receiver, which estimates the F
                        0 in 5-ms frames. For the purposes of the post-filtering algorithm, an average of these estimates over the 20-ms frame is computed.

Each incoming speech frame is first windowed with 
                           
                              w
                              n
                           
                           =
                           sin
                           (
                           π
                           /
                           (
                           2
                           N
                           )
                           ·
                           (
                           n
                           +
                           0.5
                           )
                           )
                        , where n is a discrete-time index and N denotes the length of the frame. This window is also applied after the processing to reduce audible artifacts caused by discontinuities at frame borders. The energy of the incoming speech frame is used to determine whether the frame contains speech or silence. If the energy is below the threshold, set to E
                        thr
                        =2×10−4, the frame is not processed.

The spectral tilt of the incoming speech frame is estimated using a two-stage linear prediction (LP) followed by exponential windowing. This results in a 6th-order all-pole filter, denoted by 
                              1
                              /

                              )

                           NB with the all-pole filter 
                              1

                              (
                              z
                              )
                           .

The formants of the tilt compensated speech frame, s
                           TC, are sharpened by using an iterative algorithm that was originally developed for statistical speech synthesis by Ling et al. (2006). First, a 10th-order LP predictor polynomial A
                           10(z) is computed from s
                           TC and transformed to line spectral frequencies (LSFs). Using the algorithm described by Ling et al. (2006) with α
                           =0.67, the LSFs are iteratively updated in a manner that corresponds to reducing the formant bandwidths of the LP filter. The speech frame is then filtered with 
                              
                                 A
                                 10
                              
                              (
                              z
                              )
                              /
                              
                                 A
                                 10
                                 ′
                              
                              (
                              z
                              )
                           , which effectively replaces the old formant structure with the new one.

The parameter controlling the amount of formant sharpening was chosen by computing the optimal values from a corpus containing normal and Lombard speech from five female speakers (Vainio et al., 2012). The duration of the speech data used for the optimization was approximately 1min. First, for each phone of normal speech, the corresponding phone of Lombard speech was located, and a 40-ms frame was taken from the middle of both phones. After this, the spectral tilt of both frames was removed using the two-stage LP method described above. Next, a 10th-order LP was computed from both frames and the coefficients were transformed to LSFs. The iterative LSF-sharpening algorithm by Ling et al. (2006) was then used on the LSFs of normal speech for several values of α ranging from 0 to 1. An error term for each value was determined by computing the difference between the estimated bandwidths of the three lowest formants in the enhanced frame and the Lombard frame. The bandwidths were estimated by computing the distance between the two closest LSFs in the vicinity of an estimated formant peak.

The formant-sharpened speech frame, s
                           FS, is filtered with an adaptive high-pass filter, 
                              
                                 H
                                 L
                                 ′
                              
                              (
                              z
                              )
                           , to remove low-frequency components and to further reduce the spectral tilt. The basis for the adaptation is a 6th-order, minimum-phase finite impulse response (FIR) filter, H
                           L(z), which was fitted to the difference between the long-term average spectra of normal and Lombard speech computed from previously recorded material. The recordings contained approximately 23min of phonetically rich, Finnish sentence material from one male speaker (average F
                           0
                           =116Hz) spoken in silence (normal speech) and with babble noise fed to the speaker's ears through headphones (Lombard speech).

The adaptation of the filter according to the F
                           0 of the speaker was partially motivated by the test results obtained previously with a fixed filter (Jokinen et al., 2012). A male speaker with a low F
                           0 benefited less from the processing than the other speakers in the evaluation. The reason for this could be that the used high-pass filter removed some energy from higher formants for this speaker thus reducing the intelligibility. To confirm this assumption, the difference between the long-term average spectra of normal and Lombard speech was computed for a female speaker (average F
                           0
                           =222Hz) with the same speech material as for the male speaker (approx. 22min). The obtained difference spectra for both speakers are shown in Fig. 3
                           .

The adaptation of the filter according to the speaker's F
                           0 is done only for voiced frames, whereas for unvoiced frames the filter obtained in the previous voiced frame is utilized. For the voicing decision, the gradient index is computed from the pre-emphasized frame and compared to a threshold. The adaption for voiced frames is accomplished by moving the first two zeros of H
                           L(z) according to a smoothed F
                           0 estimate. The smoothing is required to avoid audible distortions caused by discontinuities at frame borders and is done by restricting the change in the estimate to 5Hz between consecutive frames.

                            to the noise level is done by windowing the filter polynomial with an exponential window, 
                              
                                 a
                                 2
                                 n
                              
                           , where a
                           2 is interpolated linearly between 0 and 1 according to the estimated SNR computed from an estimate of the background noise level. After filtering, the energy level of the processed frame, s
                           HF, is equalized to the level of the original frame with the adaptive gain control (AGC) used in the AMR standard (3rd Generation Partnership Project, 2008).

The FE method introduced by Hall and Flanagan (2010) was chosen for comparison due to the similarity of the approach with the proposed LM method. The algorithm utilizes a fixed high-pass filter, which was derived by inverting the average amplitudes of the first two formants measured from adult male speakers. Intended originally for wideband speech with 22.05-kHz sampling frequency, the algorithm was modified for narrowband speech using the z transform given in the original paper (Hall and Flanagan, 2010) for the purposes of the present study. All incoming frames are processed with the post-filter, after which the energy level of the processed frames are equalized to the level of the unprocessed frames using AGC.

The performance of the two post-filtering algorithms (LM and FE) was evaluated in a word-error rate (WER) test with two noise types (car and factory noise) and three SNR levels (20dB, −5dB and −10dB). In addition, a pair comparison test was conducted with two noise conditions (car noise with SNR=−10dB and factory noise with SNR=−5dB). The test cases of the pair comparison test were limited to two noise conditions so that the test would not become too exhausting for the listeners. Moreover, the two noise conditions applied were selected based on informal listening as the most interesting ones. Unprocessed speech (UN) was used as the reference condition in both the WER and the pair comparison tests.

The speech material in the test consisted of phonetically balanced sentence material from four speakers (2 males) which has been calibrated in terms of intelligibility in a previous study (Vainio et al., 2005). The calibration was done by determining WER scores for all of the samples using subjective tests and then comparing the scores to the average intelligibility score of the entire corpus. The presentation levels of the samples with intelligibility below average were increased and those above decreased. This procedure was then repeated for the calibrated samples to increase the accuracy of the final calibration. The speech material developed by Vainio et al. (2005) consists of sentences both in Finnish and English, but the present study used only the Finnish material.

All speech samples were first down-sampled to 16kHz, filtered with the MSIN filter (ITU-T, 2005) to simulate mobile station input characteristics, then down-sampled to 8kHz, and AMR encoded and decoded [3rd Generation Partnership Project, 2009] at 12.2-kbit/s bitrate. After this, the samples were equalized to −26dBov with SV56 (ITU-T, 2005, 1993) and post-filtered (conditions LM and FE). Finally, car or factory noise was added according to the SNR level and the noisy samples were equalized to −26dBov with SV56. The car noise was stationary, low-pass type distortion, which is often encountered in real-life situations where mobile phones are used. The factory noise (Varga and Steeneken, 1993) is non-stationary containing short bursts, such as sharp clangs, and it is expected to affect speech perception more severely than stationary car noise of the same intensity level. The samples were presented to the listeners using an 8-kHz sampling frequency.

Fifteen listeners between the ages of 19 yrs and 25 yrs (mean=21 yrs), all native speakers of Finnish, participated in the listening tests. None of the subjects had any history of hearing damage and they all reported having a normal hearing. The listeners were either university students or staff and were paid for their participation.

The tests were conducted in single-walled listening booths with a background noise level of less than 10dB in the frequency range of the test samples, and circumaural Sennheiser HD650 headphones were used for the reproduction. In the beginning of the test session, the listeners were given written instructions explaining the progression of the WER test. After reading the instructions, the listeners were asked to undergo a small practice test during which they were able to adjust the volume to a comfortable listening level. The chosen volume settings were used for the entire WER test, which consisted of two parts with a short break in between. A different background noise was used in the two parts, and in both the SNR level was progressively deteriorated from 20dB to −5dB and finally to −10dB. Every time the type or level of the background noise was altered, a small practice test was given to help the listeners become acquainted with the change. In the WER test, for each combination of noise type and level, 24 samples were used, eight for each of the methods in the comparison. Additionally, all of the samples for one listener were distinct in order to avoid learning effects.

After completing the WER test, the listeners were instructed on the pair comparison test and asked to take a short practice test during which they were once again able to modify the volume setting if they wanted to. After the practice session, the volume was kept constant for the rest of the test. The pair comparison test consisted of two parts with different background noise conditions. Each part contained twelve pairs of samples with different processings and three pairs where both of the samples were the same, i.e., control pairs.

In the WER test, the subjects were allowed to play each sample only once, after which they typed the sentence on the computer. In the pair comparison test, the listeners were able to listen to two samples, A and B, as many times as they desired when asked to answer the following questions:
                           
                              •
                              Which sample is more suitable considering the background noise?

Which sample do you prefer to listen to?

Each question was answered to by selecting one of the options: A, B or No difference. The play buttons for the speech samples were marked with the corresponding letters A and B.

The percentage of correct words in the WER test was calculated by comparing the typed answer with the original sentence. Vainio et al. (2005) suggested that for some words multiple forms could be accepted because of their similarity in Finnish. For instance, the present and the past tense of verbs are often almost identical: “puhuu/puhui” (“speaks/spoke”) or “löytyy/löytyi” (“is found/was found”). Thus, some words had multiple correct variants that were easily confused but did not change the overall meaning of the statement. Additionally, due to the inflected nature of Finnish, in some cases the stem and the suffix of an inflected word were scored separately. Half of the word score was given for the correct stem and the other half for the correct suffix. The existence of extraneous incorrect words did not affect the scoring, but the ordering of the correct words in the typed answer had to be right in order to achieve a full score.

All obvious spelling and typing errors in the answers of the WER test were corrected before the results were analyzed further. Additionally, the listeners were checked for consistency in the pair comparison test using the scores of the control pairs. As a result, two listeners who were not consistent in their ratings were excluded from further analysis. However, their results for the WER test were used normally. The summary scores for suitability and preference were determined by computing the percentage of times that a given condition was preferred in the course of all pairwise comparisons.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The results of the WER test were analyzed using a five-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the noise type (car and factory), the SNR level (−5dB, and −10dB), the speaker gender (male and female), and the method (FE, LM, and UN) modeled as fixed variables and the test subject as a random variable. It should be noted that the results with the SNR level 20dB were excluded from the analysis, as no variation in the WER scores was found in the visual inspection of the results between different noise types, methods, or speaker genders. Additionally, the underlying assumptions of ANOVA for such linear mixed effects model, i.e., the normality of the random effects and the normality of the error, were tested first using the Shapiro–Wilk test of normality with the significance level of 5%. The normality of the random effects was verified with the test (p≫0.05), but the normality of the error was rejected. However, the violation of the normality assumption was found to be small by inspecting the distribution of the error term. Moreover, linear mixed-effects models have been found to be robust against violations of the assumptions (Jacqmin-Gadda et al., 2007). Consequently, ANOVA was applied in the analysis of the results.

ANOVA indicated that the noise type [F(1, 14)=465.9, p
                        ≪0.001], the SNR level [F(1, 14)=417.8, p
                        ≪0.001], the speaker gender [F(1, 14)=60.8, p
                        ≪0.001], and the method [F(2, 28)=19.8, p
                        ≪0.001], as well as the interactions between the noise type and the method [F(2, 28)=11.6, p
                        <0.001], between the noise type and the SNR level [F(1, 14)=6.2, p
                        <0.05], and between the noise type, the method and the SNR level [F(2, 28)=8.6, p
                        <0.01] had a significant effect on the WER score.

The marginal means and standard errors of the mean were computed to gain insight on the nature of the effects. The resulting mean WER scores for the methods are shown in Fig. 4
                         for the two noise types, male and female speakers, and the three SNR levels. Additionally, Dunnett's T3 post hoc test with the significance level of 5% was applied to test the significance of the differences found. The effect of the SNR level on the WER scores can be seen as the overall trend of an increased WER as the SNR level is decreased, and the effect of the noise type is illustrated as the somewhat higher WER obtained for the factory noise condition in comparison to the car noise condition, on average. There exist also significant differences between the methods in the two lowest SNR conditions (−5dB and −10dB). More specifically, the use of the post hoc test revealed that LM has a significantly lower WER score than FE with car noise, whereas no significant differences between LM and FE exist in the factory noise condition, on average. Furthermore, UN has the lowest WER score with both noise types. Additionally, with both noise types, a decrease of the SNR level significantly increases the differences between the WER scores of the algorithms.

The mean summary scores obtained from the pair comparison test for suitability and for preference were analyzed separately with a three-way ANOVA with the noise condition (car noise SNR=−10dB, and factory noise SNR=−5dB), the method (FE, LM, and UN), and the speaker gender (male and female) modeled as fixed variables and the test subject modeled as a random variable. The underlying assumptions of ANOVA were tested similarly as before. Again, the normality of the random effects was confirmed (p≫0.05), whereas the normality of the error term was rejected for both tests. However, the violations of the normality assumption for the error term were considered to be insignificant based on visual inspection of the distribution of the error term, and consequently the ANOVA was applied in the analysis.

For the suitability (see Fig. 5(a)), ANOVA revealed that the noise condition [F(1, 12)=7.7, p
                        <0.05] and the method [F(2, 24)=25.3, p
                        ≪0.001] as well as the interaction between the noise condition and the method [F(2, 24)=3.7, p
                        <0.05] had a significant effect on the suitability score. Moreover, the post hoc test confirmed that LM was considered more suitable than the two other algorithms with factory noise at −5dB SNR level, whereas with the car noise at −10dB SNR level, UN was rated the least suitable. For the preference (see Fig. 5(b)), ANOVA found significant effects on the preference rating for the noise condition [F(1, 12)=12.3, p
                        <0.01] and the method [F(2, 24)=8.0, p
                        <0.01] as well as for the interaction between the noise condition and the method [F(2, 24)=6.8, p
                        <0.01]. No significant differences were found between LM and FE in the post hoc test. However, UN was least preferred with the car noise at the −10-dB SNR level, whereas no significant differences in preference existed between the methods in the other noise condition.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Two post-filtering methods (FE and LM) were evaluated and compared to unprocessed speech (UN) in a WER test and in a pair comparison test with questions on the suitability for the noise environment and on preference. The WER test was conducted with two noise types and three SNRs, whereas two of the noise conditions were chosen for the pair comparison test.

The results of the WER test indicate that both post-filtering methods provide improvement over unprocessed speech. The proposed method outperforms FE in difficult noise conditions especially with car noise, but in the case where the level of the background noise is too high, neither of the algorithms yields a significant intelligibility improvement. The non-stationary factory noise at SNR=−10dB is an extremely difficult noise condition for the listener, and the speech is almost completely unintelligible. A method adapting to the characteristics of the background noise, e.g., spectral or temporal properties, might be able to provide some more improvement.

In the pair comparison test, the proposed method is rated the highest in terms of suitability for the noise environment in the factory noise condition. However, the FE post-filter is rated almost as high as LM in the car noise condition. This indicates that the proposed method sounds more natural in the more difficult non-stationary noise condition than with the stationary car noise. Perhaps, the reason for this is that the Lombard speech used in the development of the algorithm was produced in the presence of non-stationary babble noise. As shown by Hansen and Varadarajan (2009), the type of distortion has an impact on the spectral characteristics of the produced Lombard speech.

Based on the results obtained, it seems that the gender of the speaker may have an impact on the performance of the proposed method, even though the fundamental frequency of the speaker is utilized to adapt the processing. From the WER results, the female speakers seem to benefit less from the processing, and conversely, in the pair comparison test, the proposed method achieved better results with female speakers compared to male speakers. Additionally, informal listening of processed samples with multiple different speakers revealed that the proposed method has difficulties with some male voices. However, these problematic speakers did not have a significantly different fundamental frequency from other male speakers, which indicates that the problem might be a result of some other speaker characteristic.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A Lombard-motivated post-filtering method (LM) for the intelligibility enhancement of narrowband telephone speech was introduced. The proposed method models aspects of Lombard speech in an automated way and works with small delay and low computational complexity, which are mandatory requirements when implementing speech quality and intelligibility enhancement algorithms in mobile phones. The proposed algorithm also adapts in a robust manner to the spectral characteristics of the speaker's voice as well as to the level of the background noise. The proposed method was compared to a formant equalizing post-filter (FE) and to unprocessed normal speech (UN) in a WER test and a pair comparison test containing questions on suitability for the noise environment and preference.

The test results show that both of the post-filtering algorithms under evaluation enhance intelligibility over unprocessed speech. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms the reference algorithm in difficult background noise conditions where intelligibility improvement is required the most. However, the production of the artificial Lombard-like effect in the algorithm is highly simplified, and therefore the processed speech can sometimes sound slightly unnatural, especially with some male speakers. Further work is required to more accurately model the acoustical changes occurring in natural Lombard speech.
