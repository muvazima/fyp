                  Computation-intensive analyses/simulations are becoming increasingly common in engineering design problems. To improve the computation efficiency, surrogate models are used to replace expensive simulations of engineering problems. This paper proposes a new high-fidelity surrogate modeling approach which is called the Sparsity-promoting Polynomial Response Surface (SPPRS). In the SPPRS model, a series of Legendre polynomials is selected as basis functions, and its number is compatible with the sample size so as to enhance the expression ability for complex functional relationships. The coefficients associated with basis functions are estimated using a “sparsity-promoting” regression approach which is an ensemble of two techniques: least squares and ℓ1-norm regularization. As a result, only these basis functions relevant to explain the function relationship are picked out, and that dedicates to ease the problem of overfitting for training points. With the sparsity-promoting regression approach, such a surrogate model intends to capture both the global trend of the functional variation and a reasonable local accuracy in the neighborhood of training points. Additionally, Latin hypercube design (LHD) is proved conducive to improving the predictive capability of our model. The SPPRS is applied to seven benchmark test functions and a complex engineering problem. The results illustrate the promising benefits of this novel surrogate modeling technique.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Despite the tremendous promotion in computer processing power, optimization-aided design in real-world problems is usually time consuming and computationally expensive in the evaluation of objective functions [1]. Just taking a single crash testing simulation for example, it is reported that it requires several hours even when performed in a parallel processing environment [2]. Other engineering problems, such as analyses in aircraft multidisciplinary design and optimization (MDO) and the design of structures or a structural component in civil engineering, also require large amounts of computation time. To meet the challenge of increasing model complexity, surrogate models, also called “metamodels”, have been widely used to replace the expensive simulation models [3].

A wide variety of surrogate models have been developed in the last few decades. Among these models described in relevant literature, Polynomial Response Surface (PRS) [4] is commonly used and relatively easy to be established. The coefficients of PRS are usually determined according to a least squares procedure. Kriging was developed for modeling spatial data collected in the geo-sciences [5], and then Sacks et al. [6] utilized Kriging to model data from computer experiments. The core idea of Kriging is combining a global regression model and a stochastic model into one interpolation model. Radial Basis Functions (RBF) [7,8] are an interpolating method on all data points. The response of RBF is a linear sum of basis functions with weights which can be estimated by solving a system of linear equations. In addition, there are also other types of surrogate models, including Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) [9], Support Vector Regression (SVR) [10,11], Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [12], etc. In general, PRS is unsuitable for the non-linear, multi-modal, multi-dimensional design landscapes we often encounter in engineering unless the ranges of the variables being considered are reduced, as in trust-region methods [13]. Compared with PRS, RBF provides more accurate results for more non-linear and high-dimensional objective functions, but it takes more computational expense [14]. Kriging has a better performance on non-linear problems than other models due to its excellent ability to interpolate training data and filter noisy data. However, Kriging is difficult to be established and used because a global optimization process is applied to identify the maximum likelihood estimators [15]. SVR was used and tested in [10], which showed that SVR achieved a higher accuracy over all other metamodeling techniques including Kriging, PRS, MARS, and RBF on a large number of test problems. The fundamental reasons why SVR surpasses the others, however, are not clear. In summary, each surrogate model has its own superiorities and defects; therefore, these models present widely different levels of numerical fidelity for various types of problems. More comprehensive reviews of different surrogate models can be found in [16–18].

Because of limitations existing in these models mentioned above, some literature proposed the enhanced versions, for example, Moving Least Squares (MLS) (also called Locally Weighted Regression) [19,20], Blind Kriging (BK) [21,22], Extended Radial Basis Functions (ERBF) [23], and so on. To make full use of the resources available for surrogate modeling and eliminate the negative impact brought by poorly fitted models, several kinds of hybrid surrogates were developed in [3,24,25]. Although many efforts have been made to ameliorate the performances of pre-existing models, there are still some deficiencies in these models as following: (i) when constructing a PRS or a Kriging model, the highest order of polynomials is hard to determine without priori information on simulation model, and an inappropriate choice may result in overfitting for training data [26]; (ii) in the PRS model, the coefficients of polynomials are determined by an ordinary least squares estimate which has low bias but large variance [27]; and (iii) some parameters, such as the correlation parameters of Kriging, the parameter c in RBF and the kernel’s parameters of SVR, are generally obtained by a time-consuming procedure based on cross-validation errors [28].

Motivated by the previous research, this paper provides a novel approach to develop a new surrogate model, which is called the Sparsity-promoting Polynomial Response Surface (SPPRS). In this model, a series of Legendre polynomials is selected as basis functions, and its number is compatible with the sample size. The coefficients of basis functions are estimated using a “sparsity-promoting” regression approach which is a combination of the least squares procedure and the ℓ1-norm regularization method. Potential benefits of this surrogate model include:
                        
                           •
                           The model has a more powerful ability in distilling correct trends from data set due to its adaptive basis functions.

With the “sparsity-promoting” regression approach, this model only picks out these basis functions which are relevant to characterize the function relationship, and that contributes to easing the problem of overfitting for training points.

Combined the least squares procedure with the ℓ1-norm regularization, both the global trend of the actual response and a reasonable local accuracy in the neighborhood of training points are captured.

All parameters involved in the model are automatically determined.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present a brief review of Polynomial Response Surface (PRS). Section 3 gives the formulation of this new surrogate model. Then, we discuss the test problems, numerical experiments, and the results supporting our viewpoints. Finally, the paper comes to an end with the summary of some significant conclusions.

The Sparsity-promoting Polynomial Response Surface (SPPRS) is an extension of PRS. In this section, we give a brief review of PRS. Similar with RBF, the predicted response of PRS models is a sum of basis functions with their coefficients. A PRS model with m variables can be written as:

Generally, PRS is more suitable to capture the global trend of the functional variation but falls short of obtaining local accuracy in the close neighborhood of training points [25]. Although a high-order PRS model can follow the training points so closely such that it captures local accuracy around the training points, it is not proper to capture the global trend due to the problem of overfitting for training points. Fortunately, the “sparsity-promoting” regression approach, which brings in a ℓ1-norm penalty based on the least squares estimate, is reported to efficiently avoid the problem of overfitting [29]. This approach is based on the well-known “Lasso” and is first developed by [27]. By utilizing the regression approach, it is possible for high-order PRS models to obtain a reasonable local accuracy as well as the global trend.

Compared with PRS, SPPRS has the same form as PRS, that is, the predicted response of SPPRS is also the sum of the polynomials with their coefficients. However, there are several remarkable differences between PRS and SPPRS.
                        
                           •
                           To enhance the capability of fitness, the SPPRS method constructs a model with a series of polynomials which adjusts with training points. It means that the more training points are used, the more basis functions are selected. In this way, high-order polynomials may be adopted.

Legendre polynomials are selected as the basis functions in the SPPRS model.

To ease the problem of overfitting, the coefficients of the SPPRS model are estimated with the “sparsity-promoting” regression method.

The primary of this paper is to lay the foundation for the sparsity-promoting polynomial response surface. This surrogate modeling method mainly follows a three-step approach: (i) design of experiments; (ii) estimation of the “coefficient path”; and (iii) model selection.

The basic idea of surrogate modeling is to construct an approximate model using function values at some given training points, which are typically generated by experimental design methods [17]. Training points for our surrogate model are generated using Latin hypercube design (LHD) [30] which is proved conducive to improving the quality of approximation (see Section 3.4.3).

The coefficients associated with basis functions are calculated by the “sparsity-promoting” regression method. However, this method generates a so-called “coefficient path” which contains a series of candidate coefficient vectors. We usually need to select the optimal coefficient vector from the coefficient path (see Section 3.3). Typically, these candidate coefficient vectors all have a sparse solution. It means that most elements of the coefficient vectors are exactly or nearly zero and only several elements are large in magnitude. To well comprehend this, we first present the conception of sparse representation.

Here, we focus our attention on an interesting case in which a function can be represented with just a few significant terms from a set of basis functions. For such a function, there are a few large (in magnitude) coefficients associated with basis functions and most of them are zero or they can be ignored without much influence on the original function. To illustrate this case, consider an example from [25]. Suppose that the 1-variable function is: f(x)=(6x
                           −2)2 sin[2(6x
                           −2)] over [0,1]. In our experiment, the set of basis functions Ψ consists of the first 30 Legendre polynomials (see Section 3.4.2), and this function is mapped on the interval [−1,1] since Legendre polynomials are defined on that interval. We assume that f(x) is well represented by Ψ, that is, for a small enough positive number ε,

                           Fig. 1
                            shows the solution to coefficients. It can be seen that only 10 coefficients are large in magnitude and the rest are close to zero. Fig. 2
                            gives the difference between the original function and the function reconstructed by these 10 basis functions. We can observe from Fig. 2 that f(x) is very well approximated by these 10 basis functions. For this reason, we say f(x) has a sparse representation on the set of basis functions Ψ, and its sparsity level is 10. The conception of sparse representation is frequently mentioned in diverse fields of research: noise reduction, compression and feature extraction [31,32].

The “sparsity-promoting” regression method exactly aims to seek such a sparse representation with limited training points. That is, this method forces the coefficients associated with the superfluous basis functions to be zero (or nearly zero) and only picks out these basis functions which are crucial to depict the functional relationship. Thus, the problem of overfitting for training points can be alleviated.

The regression model for this approach is composed of a least squares estimate and a ℓ1-norm penalty, and can be expressed as [33,34]

                            will be exactly zero or close to zero. Because the ℓ1-norm regularization term promotes a sparse solution, we call it the “sparsity-promoting” term. Spontaneously, we name the regression approach the “sparsity-promoting” regression method. The selection of α depends on specific circumstances. An appropriate α is the assurance of quality for our surrogate model. In our research, we try to find out the so-called “coefficient path” which indicates the relationship between the solution to

                            and α. Then, we choose the optimal solution from the coefficient path.

A number of algorithms, such as the quadratic programming approach [27], the LAR-LASSO algorithm [35] and the rsqrt-LASSO algorithm [29], have been developed to solve this optimization problem. In this paper, the algorithm raised by Rosset and Zhu [34] is adopted to solve Eq. (7). This algorithm can generate the piecewise linear coefficient path, that is, ∃α

For the purpose of selecting a suitable model, cross-validation and hold-out validation are obvious choices. However, the process of cross-validation (e.g., the leave-one-out strategy and the k-fold strategy), usually needs to be repeated several times or more, and it is computationally expensive for large number of training points. Though hold-out validation needs to be performed only once, it wastes of some sample information due to some training points only involving in validation but not estimation. In this paper, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) [33] is adopted to select the best model and is here defined as

                        The best surrogate model, which is constructed with the sparsity-promoting regression method, is called the Sparsity-promoting Polynomial Response Surface (SPPRS).

For a PRS model, a group of general polynomials is selected as basis functions. In the SPPRS model, however, Legendre polynomials are employed. In this part, we present the structure of basis functions and, what’ more, give a brief introduction for Legendre polynomials.

The structure of basis functions depends on the number of basis functions and the exponent vector for each basis function. So, in this part we have to answer the two questions. One is, for a given set of training points, how many basis functions we should select to construct the surrogate model. The other one is how to determine the exponent vector for each basis function. The two issues are raised because the structure of basis functions has a considerable influence on the coefficient path and the stability of results. Videlicet, the structure of basis functions affects the prediction accuracy and the robustness of our model.

As mentioned previously, in our approach the number of basis functions is compatible with the sample size. Here, we hypothesize that the number of basis functions is proportional with the number of training points. If the proportionality coefficient is small, the set of basis functions may be insufficient to depict the functional relationship. On the contrary, with an excess of basis functions, Eq. (7) becomes a badly underdetermined problem, and this may result in a useless solution. In line with [36], the number of training points should be at least 15% of the number of basis functions. In our research, we let N
                           
                              b
                           
                           =6n
                           
                              s
                           , and N
                           
                              b
                           
                           ⩽1500.

In general, we prefer to select the lower order polynomials to construct a surrogate model (e.g., PRS and Kriging). Here, we select the polynomials by orders (from zero) which are in ascending sequential order. That is, we also select the lower order polynomials preferentially until the number of these polynomials arrives at its cap. For a multivariable case, however, an order may derive many polynomials. Suppose that the order is T, and the number of variables is m, then

There are other forms of orthogonal polynomials, e.g., Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials, but most of them are orthogonal with respect to a weight function. With an exponent vector, the multivariable Legendre orthogonal polynomials can be defined as [37]

Based on the description above, we have the important property of design matrix Φ.
                              Property 1
                              
                                 The design matrix with Legendre polynomials tends to have a low mutual coherence as the number of training points increases. What is more, when the training points are sufficient, any two columns of the design matrix are almost orthogonal.
                              

Because the training points are generated by LHD, each component of a training point is uniformly distributed over its corresponding interval, i.e.,

                                 From Eqs. (22) and (23), we conclude that μ(Φ) tends to be low as the number of training points increases. Besides, when the training points are sufficient, μ(Φ) can be extremely small, and that implies any two columns of Φ are almost orthogonal. Here, we should note that the training points are obtained by LHD. Otherwise, the design matrix may have not the property. The proof is finished.□

With the important property, we can get a potential advantage of the design matrix with Legendre polynomials. Because a low mutual coherence helps to find a sparse solution [38], the design matrix with Legendre polynomials contributes to identify the significant basis functions, and hence alleviates the problem of overfitting. In other words, a SPPRS model with Legendre polynomials provides a better approximation for functions.

To demonstrate the potential advantage, we compare the performances of two SPPRS models, one with Legendre polynomials and the other with general polynomials (i.e.,

                           . In the experiment, the training points are obtained by MATLAB®(2012a) routine lhsdesign with maximin criterion and a maximum of 20 iterations. The plots of the actual function and these two SPPRS models (with the same DOE consisting of 20 training points) for Giunta function are shown in Fig. 5
                           . We observe that the SPPRS model with Legendre polynomials provides a more accurate approximation for Giunta function than that with general polynomials under the same DOE.

                                  can be generated by Algorithm 1. To keep computational expense low for this approach, one point we should note is that we must set the maximum number of iterations in Algorithm 1. In this paper, the maximum number of iterations is set as 8n

Although sparse representation has been applied to construct other polynomial models, this model proposed in the paper has several differences from the existing models:
                           
                              (1)
                              In our model, the Legendre polynomials are selected as basis functions and the training points are picked by LHD. As has been proven in Section 3.4.3, the design matrix of our model tends to have a low mutual coherence, which helps to identify these significant basis functions for explaining the functional relationship.

The model presented in the paper prefers to select low order polynomials as basis functions and the number of basis functions is compatible with the sample size. The number of basis functions significantly affects the robustness and the accuracy of the model. A small number of basis functions may be inadequate to represent unknown simulation models, while with too many basis functions the model will be unstable. To balance the accuracy with the robustness, we adopt the compromise scheme based on the theoretical results in [36], i.e., let N
                                 
                                    b
                                 
                                 =6n
                                 
                                    s
                                 .

To get the optimal coefficients for basis functions, the model proposed in this paper generates a so-called “coefficient path” which indicates the relationship between the coefficients and the ℓ1-norm penalty factor, and then picks out the optimal coefficients by Akaike’s Information Criterion. That is, the optimal penalty factor for Eq. (7) is automatically determined in the process of constructing the model.

However, most existing polynomial models modeled based on sparse representation, e.g., the model presented in [29], usually select the general polynomials as basis functions and they do not care about the mutual coherence of design matrix. What is more, the choice of sampling strategy for these models is not discussed. Besides, the structure of basis functions for these models is generally determined by prior information. Nevertheless, it seems that there is not so much prior information which can be used to construct a surrogate model in most complex engineering applications. Finally, the optimal ℓ1-norm penalty factor for these models is often obtained with a cross-validation procedure which is time-consuming.

In order to illustrate the predictive capability of the proposed approach in this paper, we choose two types of problems: (1) analytical [39], which are usually regarded as benchmark problems in global optimization and (2) industrial, a sandwich panel design problem [40]. The details of each test problems are given below.

The structural design of all-metal sandwich panels with finite element calculations and natural tests is often time-consuming and quite complex [40]. To keep the computation cost down, it requires a more effective and fast simulation procedure that should have the same level of reliability compared to the method based on finite element calculations. Obviously, the surrogate modeling techniques can contribute to such an aim by providing simple but reliable metamodels.

For comparison, the surrogate modeling techniques considered in this paper are used to predict the global deflection of the Square-core type sandwich panel, which is an essential structural response in the optimal design of sandwich structures. As described by [40], the global deflection is determined by six variables, and among them there are four geometrical design variables (see Fig. 7
                        ). The description of design parameters and their corresponding lower and upper bounds are outlined in Table 4
                        .

The response values of global deflection are calculated by FEM commercial software ANSYS employing SHELL 181-4-node shell element and the simulation conditions are given in [40]. The simulation results can be downloaded from http://www.cs.rtu.lv/jekabsons/datasets.html.

In this section, we compare the performance of the Sparsity-promoting Polynomial Response Surface (SPPRS) put forward in this paper, with the performances of the following surrogate modeling techniques: (1) Ordinary Kriging (OK), (2) Blind Kring (BK), (3) Radial Basis Functions (RBF), (4) Extended Radial Basis Functions (ERBF), (5) Polynomial Response Surface (PRS), (6) Moving Least Squares (MLS), (7) Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and (8) Support Vector Regression (SVR). Additionally, to investigate the effect of “sparsity-promoting” term on the model, we construct another polynomial response surface which is named Legendre Polynomial Response Surface (LPRS). An LPRS model has the same basis functions as the SPPRS model and is modeled based on Eq. (7) without the sparsity-promoting term.

The following metrics [24] are used to evaluate the predictive capabilities of the surrogate models considered in this paper:

Correlation coefficient (R)

The correlation coefficient between actual response and predicted response at test points is represented as

For a high-quality surrogate model, the RMSE and the MAE should be low, while the R should be high.

Through the numerical experiments, we knew that the parameters for surrogate models have a great impact on the prediction accuracy. In all the surrogates mentioned above, the following parameters should be determined: the highest order (denoted by p) in PRS and MLS, the parameter (c) in RBF, the parameters (n, γ, c) in ERBF, the initial values and the bounds for the correlation parameters (

                        .

For all benchmark problems, LHD is used to pick sample points such that the minimum distance between these points is maximized. We employ MATLAB®(2012a) Latin hypercube function lhsdesign with maximin criterion and a maximum of 20 iterations to obtain training points, and a maximum of 10 iterations for test points. As for the sandwich panel design problem, 500 sequential design sampling points has been obtained by finite element simulation. In our research, we randomly select 75 points to fit these surrogate models and the rest 425 points to test their predictive capabilities.

To reduce the effect of random sampling, we randomly select 500 training sets for the test functions expressed in Eqs. (24)–(26). However, for the purpose of cutting computational expense, we select 300 training sets for Colville and the sandwich panel design problem, and 100 training sets for Dixon-Price, Paviani and Trigonometric functions. The numerical settings used to fit different surrogate models for each problem are listed in Table 6
                        , and some of them are the same as that in [24].

Because the experiments are based on 500 (300 or 100) instances of DOEs, the mean and the variation of each prediction metric (RMAE, MAE or R) are used to evaluate the predictive capabilities of different surrogate models. The variation of each prediction metric is depicted with the help of box plots. A short tail and a small size of a box plot signify a robust approximation.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, we present some numerical results to display the predictive abilities of different surrogate models using the test problems described in Section 4. The performances of these surrogate models are measured with three metrics: RMSE, MAE and R. Besides, the robustness and the efficiency of each surrogate modeling technique are also compared with the help of several box plots and tables. Moreover, the effect of the number of basis functions on prediction accuracy and robustness of our model is also discussed.

The RMSEs for different test problems based on different surrogate models are shown with the help of box plots in Fig. 8
                        . The results are statistically diverse for all problems and DOEs. Overall, models like PRS, OK, RBF, MARS, SVR and SPPRS have a more robust performance whether with a satisfactory DOE or not. On the contrary, we can observe that some of the DOEs yield large RMSEs for MLS, BK and EBRF.

SPPRS performs well for the all problems but Hosaki and Paviani. On the contrary, ERBF does excellently for Hosaki and Paviani. However, it works very poorly for the sandwich panel design problem. The performances of OK and BK seem to be opposite in robustness and accuracy. That is, OK often gives larger RMSEs for some problems but a good stability, while BK has smaller RMSEs but a poor robustness in general. Compared with MLS, PRS performs more robustly. The overall performances of RBF, MSRS and SVR are comparable to the others because they not only provide relatively low RMSEs for most problems but also perform placidly.

It is clear that SPPRS far outperforms all the other surrogate models for Colville and Trigonometric functions. Actually, both Colville and Trigonometric functions have a sparse (or nearly sparse) representation on the set of Legendre polynomials. Once these significant basis functions have been identified, our method will establish an accuracy model. Specially, we can see that the performance of SPPRS is better than that of LPRS for almost all test problems (for Hosaki, LPRS and SPPRS have a similar result). It indicates that the sparsity-promoting term indeed helps to construct a better model in most cases.


                        Table 7
                         shows the average of RMSEs for different test problems to assess the performances of different metamodels. It is obvious that the mean of RMSEs for SPPRS is the lowest for almost all the test cases except Hosaki and Paviani. Although SPPRS is not the best model for Hosaki and Paviani, it provides a reasonable result for them. In addition, it is interesting that, for low dimensional problems, such as Branin, Hosaki, and Biggs, the difference in the performances of these 10 surrogate models is not so distinct, however, for high dimensional problems, such as Colville, Dixon-Price, and Paviani, the results vary dramatically from surrogate model to surrogate model. We can also observe that BK, SVR and ERBF seem to be feasible choices for most test problems.

The MAEs based on 500 (300 or 100) DOEs for different test problems are shown in Fig. 9
                        , from which we can see that the results almost significantly vary with the choice of DOE and there is no one method working very steadily for all the test problems. Relatively speaking, MLS and BK perform worse because their box plots often have a larger size or a long tail, which indicates a significant variation.

For most test problems, PRS and MLS have similar results except Trigonometric function. With the Bayesian variable selection technique, BK has lower MAEs than OK, especially for Colville function and the sandwich panel design problem. However, the robustness of BK needs to be improved. It is evident that ERBF has a more excellent behavior than the typical RBF for these problems, especially for Colville, Dixon-Price, and Trigonometric functions. Actually, in contrast to RBF, ERBF has a class of non-radial functions, which offers more flexibility for actual response.

As has been observed for RMSE, the SPPRS model performs well for all the test problems except Hosaki and Paviani. Owing to the sparse representation, the MAEs provided by SPPRS for Colville function are extremely close to zero and that is an outstanding performance compared to other surrogate models. The similar results are presented for Trigonometric function. What is more, as we have expected, the SPPRS model works better than the LPRS model for most test problems.

The mean of MAEs using different surrogates on different problems are tabulated in Table 8
                        , where we can note that SPPRS is competent to predict the response in most cases. Though SPPRS performs not so well for Hosaki and Paviani, it gives passable results for them. Besides, despite poor results for some test problems, it seems that BK, ERBF and SVR are not too bad models. The performance of MLS varies significantly with the test problems, for example, it gives low MAEs for Branin function but a useless model for Trigonometric function. In other words, MLS is deficient in robustness when tackling various types of problems.

Next, the correlation coefficients for different test problems are compared. Fig. 10
                         reveals that the performance of SPPRS is better than that of other metamodels for almost all the test problems except Paviani function. Specially, for Colville, Dixon-Price and Trigonometric functions, the correlation coefficients are all very close to 1 when using SPPRS, and what is more, the result for the sandwich panel design problem is superior to that given by other surrogate models. However, in another aspect, the box plot of SPPRS has a little long tail for Branin, Hosaki and Biggs, which implies that SPPRS performs not so robustly for some problems. Besides, we can still find that the correlation coefficients given by SPPRS are higher than that given by LPRS for most instances.

It is also can be observed that MARS provides a bad model for Branin. OK performs poorly for Dixon-Price and Paviani due to the correlation coefficients being nearly to zero. Meanwhile, both OK and MLS give a bad result for Trigonometric function. In contrast, PRS, BK, RBF and SVR almost have a relatively reasonable result for all the test problems. Despite the bad performance in the sandwich panel design problem, ERBF is comparable to SPPRS for Colville, Dixon-Price and Trigonometric functions.

Numerical quantification of the results is listed in Table 9
                        , where we can see that SPPRS is not the best model for Paviani but just a passable one. However, for other test problems, SPPRS provides a good approximation. Most surrogate models can yield a reasonable approximation for Branin, Hosaki, Dixon-Price and Paviani, however, they fail in obtaining good predictions for Biggs, Trigonometric, and the sandwich panel design problem.

The effect of sample size on the metamodel prediction accuracy is an important criterion to select an appropriate surrogate modeling technique [23]. Generally, we expect that with more sample points the prediction accuracy will be higher. To investigate the overall performances of different surrogate models with different sample sizes, we study two representative problems: Hosaki and Biggs. Both problems are modeled with increased sample size such that all regions are adequately sampled in the design space. Taking account the clarity of following figures, we only choose the first 5 better surrogate modeling approaches for each error metric(except LPRS), which are measured by the average value of the corresponding prediction metric listed in Tables 7–9. All other numerical settings are kept the same as that given in Table 6.


                        Figs. 11–13
                        
                        
                         show the effect of sample size on the mean of RMSEs, MAEs and correlation coefficients, respectively. We can observe on Fig. 11(a) that SPPRS is not the best model for Hosaki when the sample size is less than 60. However, with more training points, SPPRS works well for HosaKi. BK or ERBF seems to be a better choice for Hosaki when there are only a small number of training points. For Biggs, Fig. 11(b) shows that the performance of SPPRS is better compared to other surrogate models. Similar results also can be seen in Figs. 12 and 13. It can be concluded that the choice of the best model depends on the sample size and the problem itself. As we have expected, the overall performances of all surrogate models become better and better as the sample size increases. Additionally, for the problems considered here, SPPRS is proved a considerable surrogate modeling technique.

To study the effect of the number of basis functions, we separately construct a SPPRS model for Branin and Dixon-Price with different numbers of basis functions. This issue is raised because of conspicuous variation in the performance of SPPRS with different numbers of basis functions. All other parameters are kept the same. The comparison of each prediction metric based on 500 or 100 DOEs is given in Tables 10 and 11
                        
                        . To quantize the robustness of SPPRS for all cases, the coefficient of variation of each prediction metric (RMSE, MAE, or R) is deemed to the criterion for this purpose. The coefficient of variation (CV) is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of a set of data to its mean. The smaller the value of CV is, the more robust the surrogate model is.

When we increase the number of basis functions, we observe the difference in the performance of SPPRS for different cases. It can be seen from Table 10 that the performance of SPPRS is better for Branin function when the number of basis functions is 4 times the sample size. For other cases, however, SPPRS works not so well for Branin function, especially when the number of basis functions is 8 times the sample size. From Table 11, we can see that SPPRS provides a better approximation for Dixon-Price function in the case that the number of basis is 8 times the sample size. However, the robustness of the performance is woefully inadequate.

Without any priori information about the simulation model, how to select an appropriate number of basis functions is a difficulty for us. On one hand, the set of basis functions is required to sufficiently express the relationship between the simulation response and the design variables, and that needs to enlarge the number of basis functions. On the other hand, the performance of SPPRS is expected to be robust, and that requests the number of basis functions to be reduced. Apparently, these two objectives contradict each other. In this paper, we adopt the compromise scheme based on the theoretical results in [36], and in this scheme the number of basis functions is 6 times the sample size. Actually, SPPRS performs reasonably both in prediction accuracy and robustness for Branin and Dixon-Price functions with the compromise scheme, and that can be observed from Tables 10 and 11.

An important aspect of a surrogate modeling technique is the computational cost in model construction and response prediction [14]. In the SPPRS method, most computation time is spent in building the design matrix and estimating the coefficients associated with basis functions. To compare the time consumption, the sandwich panel design problem is taken as an example and each metamodeling technique is tested on a desktop with a Pentium (R) Dual-Core E5400 processor and a RAM memory of 2.00GB. The computation time for model construction and new predictions with different surrogate modeling techniques is provided in Table 12
                        .

It is obvious that PRS is the most efficient method both in model construction and response prediction. Relatively, model construction is very time-consuming for BK due to a Bayesian forward selection and an optimization for correlation parameters. Because of a forward selection phase and a backward deletion phase, it is also not so easy to construct a MARS model. On the other hand, it is computationally expensive for ERBF to generate new predictions. SPPRS gives a reasonable consumption of time both in model construction and response prediction. Anyway, all the reported time scales are considered to be small compared to the time needed for simulations to obtain the “expensive” training data in complex engineering applications.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper develops a new surrogate modeling technique which intends to simultaneously capture the global trend of the functional variation as well as a reasonable local accuracy. The Sparsity-promoting Polynomial Response Surface (SPPRS) are mainly based on the following features: (i) the number of basis functions is compatible with the sample size; (ii) the Legendre polynomials are selected as basis functions; (iii) the coefficients associated with basis functions are estimated with the sparsity-promoting regression method; and (iv) all parameters involving this model are determined by the model itself. The performance of the surrogate model is assessed using three standard prediction metrics: (i) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE); (ii) Maximum Absolute Error (MAE); and (iii) correlation coefficient (R).

The effectiveness of the SPPRS surrogate model is tested on a series of benchmark functions as well as a real-world problem-the sandwich panel design problem. Preliminary results show that SPPRS can provide good approximations to most test problems considered in our research. From the comparison between SPPRS and LPRS, we find that the “sparsity-promoting” term indeed helps to construct a better model in most situations. Additionally, we also give a useful insight into the performances of several classic approaches.

Although the technique proposed in this paper has achieved desirable results, several points should be noted: (i) because the number of basis functions for each order is a combinatorial number with respect to the number of variables and the order, the SPPRS model is more suitable for high-dimensional and low-order problems or low-dimensional and high-order problems; (ii) the SPPRS model should be more robust in response prediction; and (iii) other prediction metrics that can better represent the prediction ability over the entire design space should be investigated. Besides addressing these limitations, future work should include the application of the developed surrogate model to a more diverse set of test problems, to show potential benefits of the method.
