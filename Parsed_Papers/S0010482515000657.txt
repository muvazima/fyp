                  Purpose
                  The purpose of this study is to validate a model for the analysis of the load distribution through the wrist joint, subjected to forces on the axes of the metacarpals from distal to proximal for two different mesh densities.
               
               
                  Method
                  To this end, the Rigid Body Spring Model (RBSM) method was used on a three-dimensional model of the wrist joint, simulating the conditions when making a grip handle. The cartilage and ligaments were simulated as springs acting under compression and tension, respectively, while the bones were considered as rigid bodies. At the proximal end of the ulna the movement was completely restricted, and the radius was allowed to move only in the lateral/medial direction.
               
               
                  Results
                  With these models, we found the load distributions on each carpal articular surface of radius. Additionally, the results show that the percentage of the applied load transmitted through the radius was about 86% for one mesh and 88% for the coarser one; for the ulna it was 21% for one mesh and 18% for the coarser.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The obtained results are comparable with previous outcomes reported in prior studies. The latter allows concluding that, in theory, the methodology can be used to describe the changes in load distribution in the wrist.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The wrist is the joint between the forearm and the hand, formed by the interaction of 15 bones [1] stabilized by the ligaments that interconnect them [2]. When there are conditions of high load concentration on the wrist, the cartilage that covers the bone can become impaired, causing pain, malfunction and progressive degeneration [2–6], affecting functionality of the upper extremity [7]. Various surgical treatments [2] have been proposed to treat these kind of diseases, which can be categorized into those that remove only part of the affected bone [2,8,9], the complete bone [2], or a total or partial arthrodesis (artificial ossification between two or more bones of a joint through surgery) [2,10,11].

Due to the variety of choices in treatments, it is necessary to identify the most appropriate one in the reduction and redistribution of loads. To do so, it is mandatory to compare load distribution in a healthy joint with a pathological after surgical treatment [12]. When trying to address this problem, experimental and computational methods have been used [13]. The most used methods range from ex-vivo techniques for measuring pressures.The most common computational method is the Finite Element (FEM) [14], which has proven effectiveness with simple geometric joints such as the hip [15,16] and knee [17,18], but not in complex joints like the ankle and wrist [14].

Based on the above mentioned limitations, and searching for a cost-effective modeling strategy, this paper presents a three-dimensional study of load distribution on the wrist, using the Rigid Body Spring Model –RBSM [19]. With this method, the distribution of forces in a joint can be analyzed where the bones are considered as rigid bodies, the cartilage and ligaments are modeled as compression-only and tension-only springs, respectively [20], and the system in static equilibrium [12]. Additionally, the RBSM method is able to predict the distribution of loads on joints with a low computational cost, regardless of its geometry or large deformations [21].

The RBSM has been previously applied in the analysis of the load distribution in the wrist joint in two dimensions under static equilibrium conditions, initially by Horii et al. 
                     [22], who developed a model that was then used to examine procedures for treating Kienböck׳s disease. Shuind et al. 
                     [12] also developed a two-dimensional analysis using RBSM. Iwasaki et al. 
                     [23] applied the same method to analyze the changes on force distribution across the wrist for different stages of Kienböck׳s disease. Subsequently models in three-dimensions were developed by Iwasaki et al. 
                     [24] who determined which intercarpal fusions reduced loads on the lunate the most. Genda and Horii [25] also analyzed the force distribution on the radio-carpal joint with the wrist in neutral and functional position. This last work was continued by Majima et al. 
                     [19], who analyzed the load distribution on the wrist joint on extended position. Another three-dimensional RBSM of the wrist has been developed, where kinematics was analyzed and the findings were compared with experimental data [26].

The main purpose of this work is to test and validate a method for the determination of the forces distribution in the carpal joint of the radius and ulna, with loads of a grip handle in a physiological wrist joint under static equilibrium conditions. The results will be compared with previous studies by other authors. We also determined how a change on mesh density affects the final results, in order to have a notion of how this factor influences the model. This can then be used to compare load distributions on a wrist for various treatments of arthrodesis, pathologies and wrist positions.

The study began with the generation of a three-dimensional model of the wrist joint to which we applied the RBSM method. The bones were considered as rigid bodies connected by springs between their articular surfaces. The cartilage was modeled as springs that support only compressive loads, while the ligaments were considered as tension-only springs. The models were assembled using a multi-body dynamic analysis software RecurDyn (Multi-Body Dynamics - MBD), a software based on Computer Aid Engineering tools (CAE) for dynamic analysis –MultiBody Dinamics MBD- by Functionbay, Inc. Seoul, Korea, [27]; the same software used in the study by Fischli [26].

Three-dimensional models of the bones were obtained from segmented images from a CT scan (kV: 120; Slice Thickness: 0.5mm; ma: 60) of a living subject׳s (adult male with type II lunate) wrist in a neutral pose with no alteration or disease on his joint and who volunteered and gave informed consent, which was subsequently processed in Mimics 10.01 (Materialize, Belgium); the study was approved by the University׳s Ethics Committee. Each solid was meshed in ICEM CFD 14.5 (ANSYS, Inc.,) with triangular elements so that the area of these was equivalent. It resulted in two models with a different number of elements on its surface (
                        Fig. 1). These meshes were imported as a stereolithography format file (the extension of this type of file is.STL) in RecurDyn software (Functionbay, Inc. Seoul, Korea), where each bone was considered as an independent solid.

                         were applied from distal to proximal on the metacarpals I, II, III, IV and V, respectively (
                        Fig. 2). These axial forces on the metacarpals simulate grasp maneuver of the hand [12,23]. The cartesian components of the loads on each metacarpal were determined based on a global system (
                        Table 1), which was defined as having its origin in the average height of the carpals and near the palmar part of the radius, with the x-axis pointing medially, the y-axis pointing dorsally, and the z-axis on the proximal to distal direction (Fig. 2).

The models were constrained by fixing the proximal end of the ulna and allowing the medial/lateral movement of the radius with planar restriction at its proximal end (Fig. 2); the metacarpals can only move in the distal/proximal direction. The carpal bones were just allowed to move and rotate in a plane, in order to include the effect on the bones of the joint capsule.

The cartilages were modeled as discrete elements distributed in the joint surfaces. These elements were simulated as linear springs acting only under compression loads. They were placed so that their length would be the minimum possible (
                        Fig. 3). The spring constant for each articular surface was calculated [21,31]

                         the final length after reaching equilibrium. Two models were conducted, one with elements whose average area is 0.18mm2, yielding a total of 14.410 springs, and a second one with area elements of 0.73mm2, in average, and with 3.244 springs (Fig. 3).

The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was assumed to be interacting with the triquetrum, and modeled as springs connecting the ulna with the lunate and with the triquetrum. The properties of this cartilage complex were simulated in a similar way as the other articular cartilage on the wrist joint.

Ligaments were modeled as linear springs acting exclusively under tensile loads, one spring per ligament, and the anatomic insertions of the 50 modeled ligaments were determined based on previous anatomical studies (
                        Fig. 4) [1,36,37]. The stiffness constant for the springs was determined from previous studies [1,12] (
                        
                        Table 3), and the resting length of the ligaments was considered as the same when placed on the insertion points with the hand on neutral position. Finally, the wrapping of the ligaments on the bones was not considered.

@&#RESULTS@&#

An analysis of load distribution in the distal articular surfaces of the radius and ulna under static equilibrium conditions was carried out, using the discrete method RBSM. Likewise, two models of elements with different mesh sizes using the software RecurDyn were used in the analysis.

The total load on the surface was determined by adding the Cartesian components of the spring׳s forces of each joint. A comparison of the percentage of load transmitted through each articular surface was made, by considering the cartesian components for both the applied force and the springs forces (Table 2). These results show that a larger share of load is transmitted through the distal articular surface of the radius (share of load is transmitted through the dista%1.4%, 12.5%, 14.7%, 104.6% 9%, 2.1%, 35.8). Additionally, it was found that radio-scaphoid joint transmits 50.8% of the applied load. Meanwhile, between the radius and the lunate, 36% is transmitted. Note that much of the load that gets to the ulna is transmitted through the articular surface between the latter and the triquetral, and between the ulna and the lunate, just about 5% of the applied load is transmitted.

The percentage of the external load transmitted between the joint surfaces of the models developed in this study was determined (with elements of

                     ) (
                     Fig. 5). The difference between the models for the percentage of external load transmitted through the articular surfaces is less than 2%, except for the articular surfaces between the capitate and the lunate, and the radius and the lunate. Furthermore, when comparing the results of the total loads that reach the radius and the ulna, it was found that 103% of the applied load is transmitted with a difference of 0.5% between meshes. Finally, the movement of the bones to reach equilibrium static conditions did not exceed 0.3mm.

In addition to the total loads on each articular surface, the force distribution in the articular surface of the radius and the ulna was obtained, which acted mainly on the palm side of the joint surfaces (
                     Fig. 6).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this study, the behavior of the wrist joint is analyzed under static conditions using RBSM, determining load distribution in the radio-carpal articular surface. Other authors have done experimental studies to determine the load distribution in the wrist, as in Hara et al. [38]. Also computational simulations using RBSM have been developed [12,19,20,22–24,39], for different physiological wrist positions, a pathological wrist, and after a treatment has been applied. Additionally, the finite element method (FEM) also has been employed [40]. The findings on load distribution across the radio-carpal joint of the mentioned former authors are shown in (
                     
                     Fig. 7 and 8).

The RBSM method used in this study is a noninvasive procedure, which predicts changes in the distribution of forces on the articular surfaces. However, RBSM has some simplifications as bones are simplified as rigid bodies (so their deformation) and cartilage and ligaments are assumed as linear elastic materials, and anatomical insertions of the latter are simplified as a point and not as a region, as actually happens. In addition, the restrictions and mechanical loads have simulated physiological conditions but with limitations in the exactly form that those are applied, namely, there is anatomical and physiological variability that has not been included. Moreover, as static analysis was performed, inertial effects are considered to be negligible.

Comparative charts between the results found in the study and those reported in the literature (Figs. 7 and 8) were made. For the two models presented in this study, the force transmitted by the articular surface between the radius and the scaphoid was 51%, and the average result obtained in other studies was 50%. In similar way, for the contact between the radius and lunate, here we obtained 36% compared with 34% as is reported in [12,19,20,22–24,38–40]. Moreover, the loads trough the ulna are in the range of results published in previous studies, reaching 19.6%. In fact, the total force received by the distal radius and ulna exceeds in 3% the external applied load (Table 2). This may be due to error of the method itself, or to the boundary conditions assumed in the models. It could also be a consequence of internal moments and changes on the direction of the applied load when reaching the radius and ulna.

When the results reported by other studies are analyzed, it is not possible to draw a conclusion about the distribution of the load on each articular surface. The data analyzed from [12,19,20,22–24,38–40] shows an approximate deviation of 6%, with coefficients of variation of 7% to 20% for the joint surfaces of the radius, and 40% for the ulna. Also, no important difference was found between the models, whether 3D or 2D, or using RBSM or FEM.

In conclusion, the results obtained here are comparable to those reported by other authors (Figs. 7 and 8), which allows to validate the model and conclude that the methodology, theoretically, can describe the changes in load distribution in the wrist due to a pathology or for evaluate surgical treatment in this joint. In future works we will include the evaluation of surgical treatment using this proved methodology.
