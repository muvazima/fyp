@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Contact mechanics originated in 1882 when Hertz published his famous paper that named On the Contact of Elastic Solids 
                     [1]. The systematic researches of elastic contact mechanics were finished by Galin in his book Contact Problem in the Theory of Elasticity, which was first published in Russian. Then, Gladwell conducted similar studies on the contact problem of ideal elastic solids in 1980 [2]. Until 1985, a famous book that named Contact Mechanics, which had been the most authoritative book in the field of contact mechanics in recent 30years, was published by Johnson. This book included a lot of their latest studies, and did a systematic research on multi situations of contact problem, such as normal and tangential contact, elastic and inelastic contact, Hertz and non Hertz contact, sliding and rolling, static pressure and dynamic pressure, smooth surface and rough surface contact [3]. The models and hypotheses presented in this book are still very important at present.

In theoretical investigations of contact, Deeg proposed a new method to calculate contact stress and deformation based on the hypothesis of Hertz contact [4]. Zhang studied the impact contact between space docking probe and cone by using Lagrange analytical method in his dissertation. The contact model used is based on the simplified Hertz impact model, which is just able to describe the impact force in the normal direction but not able to give any description of the contact area [5]. Jamari presented a theoretical model for the elastic–plastic contact of ellipsoid bodies. He formulated and modeled the contact parameters, such as the mean contact pressure, the contact area and the contact load, in three different contact regimes: elastic, elastic–plastic and fully plastic [6]. Dini and Hills found the interfacial contact pressure and shear traction distributions for a sphere pressed onto an elastically similar half-space. It was shown that the rough contact absorbed less energy than a smooth one subject to the same loading history [7]. Alfredsson and Cadario evaluated the evolution of the slip zone coefficient of friction at a spherical fretting contact using four different ways. The importance of a correct coefficient of friction and the advantages of each evaluation method were discussed [8]. Wu, Shi and Polycarpou developed a finite element model for obliquely loaded spherical contact by utilizing the maximum frictional shear stress criterion [9]. Chen and Wang presented a three-dimensional numerical model for the simulation of the contacts of elastically dissimilar materials. This model was based on the Boussinesq–Cerruti integral equations relating normal and tangential surface tractions to surface displacements and employed the static friction law to identify the onset of local micro-slip [10]. Reinelt and Wriggers used a multi-scale approach to make an attempt to understand the sources of elastomere friction in a more rigorous way [11].

In experimental researches of contact, Brun and Melkote addressed the influence of the partial slip phenomenon on the dynamic motion of a spherical work piece held in a fixture. The model considered the effect of interfacial slip damping arising from partial slip at a spherical–planar frictional contact subjected to a constant normal load and oscillating tangential load. Their researches showed that the effect of the partial slip phenomenon on work piece dynamic motion was significant and should not be ignored [12]. Garland and Rogers presented, for the first time, a comprehensive set of experimentally obtained contact force waveforms during oblique elastic impact for a range of initial velocities and incidence angles [13]. Sumer and Onal studied the elliptical adhesive contact experimentally utilizing two hemi-cylinders of elastomeric poly. Their experimental results were compared with the approximate Johnson–Kendall–Roberts theory for elliptical contacts, and the deviation of the experiment from this theory was discussed in detail [14].

The purpose of this paper is to do some researches on contact dynamic characteristics of flexible probe during docking process. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the docking dynamic model based on flexible probe is developed with the help of Lagrange analytical method. The modal equation of flexible rod is derived with the effect of the rigid counterweight considered. In Section 3, the contact models of docking impact in both normal and tangential directions are presented in detail. In Section 4, the parameters of docking model are given, and the ground-based experimental system is introduced. Section 5 provides the analysis of simulation and experiment results. Several conclusions are summed up in Section 6.

Docking model based on space probe-cone mechanism is shown in Fig. 1
                        . It is reasonable to simplify the space docking as plane motion due to rotational symmetry of probe and cone. In order to discuss the contact characteristics of flexible probe in docking process, the docking dynamic model must be developed firstly.

In the model above, 
                           
                              o
                              -
                              
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                                 
                                    →
                                 
                              
                              
                                 
                                    j
                                 
                                 
                                    →
                                 
                              
                           
                         is the inertial coordinate system. o
                        1 is the mass center of chaser satellite and o
                        2 is the mass center of target satellite. The counterweights of chaser satellite and target satellite, which are to simulate the mass and principal inertia moments of satellites, are simplified as rigid bodies. Docking probe is studied by using linear elastic model [15].

In order to show the deformation of flexible beam more clearly, the docking probe is simplified as a curve of central axis in the following figures.

In Fig. 2
                        , the length and the radius of flexible beam are respectively defined as l and r. θ
                        1 is the angle between axis direction of chaser satellite and horizontal direction, as
                         is the distance between the end of flexible beam and mass center of the chaser satellite. It is assumed that the deformation of flexible beam is still consistent with the little deformation assumption. The point Q′ in the principal axis which has a distance of x away from the end of probe will move to Q when the deformation happens, and its axial and lateral displacements are respectively u(x,
                        t) and v(x,
                        t).

The displacement vector of mass center of chaser satellite in the inertial coordinate system is:

                        , is built. Its base point is mass center of the whole coupling system, and its x-direction is central axis of the whole coupling system. θ is the deflection angle of the x-direction relative to the horizontal direction during the process of free vibration. The motion of point Q is a coupling motion of rigid counterweight moving and flexible beam vibration. Therefore, the inertial force at point Q also includes two parts. Distributed load is used to equivalently express the inertial force of flexible beam.

                        .

In addition, the friction coefficient is defined as μ
                        =0.3. 4-order Runge–Kutta method is introduced to solve the docking model. The time step is defined as Δt
                        =1×10−6
                        s. According to these parameters, the frequency Eq. (23) of the coupling system can be solved. The value of kn

                        +

                        .

From Table 2, it is known that the difference between flexible rod and cantilever beam is not evident. The mass and inertia moment of counterweight is great enough relative to the flexible rod. Therefore, the cantilever beam model can be introduced into the assumed mode method to describe dynamical properties of flexible beam at the situation in this paper.

The experiment samples are suspended at the air-bearing platform to obtained three freedoms that are necessary for plane situation. The platforms can move in a setting velocity that is supplied by the air lubricated linear guide. The schematic diagram of experimental system is shown in Fig. 5
                        .

One of the experiment purposes is to get the impact force during the docking process; the other aim is to obtain the contact trace between ball head and inner cone, which is recorded by dyeing processing. The time history of impact force can be calculated indirectly by obtaining acceleration time history [17]. The type of accelerometer used in the experiment is KISTLER 8766A500AB, which is an IEPE tri-axial accelerometer with a frequency range of 0.5Hz–12kHz and an acceleration range of ±500g. Its measurement accuracy at room temperature is 10mV/g. The type of data acquisition is DH5927N, which has 8-channel dynamic signal acquisition modules for making high-accuracy measurements. Its single channel sampling rate can reach to 256kHz.

The real figure of the experimental system is shown in Fig. 6
                        .

In Fig. 7
                        , the peak values of impact force gotten from theoretical model and experiment are respectively 496.3N and 488N. The contact durations of the first impact during docking process are respectively 5.647ms and 5.16ms. Their deviations, which are respectively 1.7% and 9.4%, are both in permissible range. Their variation trends are also in agreement. These agreements can be the verification of correctness of the contact model presented in this paper. In the case of low-speed impact, the quasi-static Hertz contact model can be used to approximate the impact contact.

The contact ellipse obtained from theoretical model is shown in Fig. 8
                        . The length of semi-major axis is 0.00125m, the minor semi-axis is 0.00113m, and the elliptic eccentricity is 0.4275.

The experimental sample of docking probe is a Nylon probe, whose modulus of elasticity is 2.83×109
                        N/m2. In order to obtain the shape and size of contact trace on the ball head, the inner cone is processed by dyeing. The experiment result is shown in Fig. 9
                        .

The length of major axis and minor axis of the contact ellipse, which is marked in Fig. 9, is respectively 0.00246m and 0.00219m. Then, the eccentricity of the contact ellipse is 0.4555. Three groups of the elliptical contact data have been gotten for multi-measurement average, and they are listed in Table 3
                        .

The deviations of theoretical results relative to experimental data are listed as follows: major axis 2.46%, minor axis 4.63%, and eccentricity 8.48%. The causes of these deviations mainly lie in two aspects: one is the approximate treatment of theoretical model; the other is the experiment error. However, these deviations are in the allowable range. The comparison of theoretical result and experiment result proves that the theoretical model presented in this paper can reveal the geometrical property of contact area.


                        Fig. 10
                         shows the stress distribution of contact ellipse at the moment when the impact force reaches to its peak value. As we can see above that the stress reaches to its maximum in the central part of contact ellipse, and declines to its edge. The maximum stress reaches to 170.2MPa, which is still in the elastic limit of Aluminum (274MPa). Therefore, this impact contact would not cause any damage to the inner cone. From Fig. 10, we can also see that a tangential migration happens to the distribution of contact stress due to the effect of tangential friction. Fig. 10 shows that the friction causes a tangential deformation to the distribution of contact stress, which will be no longer symmetrical distribution at each moment. Furthermore, the stress curve along the short axis direction is shown in Fig. 11
                        .

From Fig. 11, it is known that the maximum tangential migration is 3.953×10−5
                        m, which appears in the central part of contact ellipse. The effect of friction is very small because it shows the tangential deformation of the contact ellipse, which represents the material deformation of contact bodies in the tangential direction. It is similar to the contact compression deformation in the normal direction, which is also very small, during the docking impact process. In order to make the deformation of contact ellipse more clearly, its deformation distribution will be given as follows.


                        Fig. 12
                         shows the deformation distribution of contact ellipse at the moment when the impact force reaches to its peak value. Its distribution regularity is the same as the stress distribution of the contact ellipse in Fig. 10. It is also shown that a tangential migration happens to the distribution of contact deformation, which will be no longer symmetrical, due to the effect of tangential friction. The maximum compression deformation in the normal direction is 1.036×10−4
                        m, while the maximum tangential deformation is 3.953×10−5
                        m.

The elastic modulus of docking probe is a representation of its structural flexibility. Therefore, the effect of structural flexibility to contact surface can be discussed by changing the elastic modulus of docking probe. The range of variation is from 1×107
                        N/m2 to 2×1011
                        N/m2, from which 39 data points are chosen. The variation of maximum stress versus elastic modulus, which is calculated by theoretical modeling, is shown in Fig. 13
                         as follows.

The elastic limit and the strength limit of aluminum are respectively 274MPa and 412MPa. In order to protect the inner surface of aluminum cone, the maximum contact stress must be limited to the elastic limit of aluminum (274MPa). If the maximum stress exceeds the strength limit (412MPa), the inner cone will be damaged. Fig. 13 tells us that the elastic modulus of docking probe (E
                        1) must be limit to 5×109
                        N/m2. If its elastic modulus surpasses 9×109
                        N/m2, the inner cone will be damaged. Three experimental samples, whose elastic parameters are listed in Table 4
                        , are chosen to verify this conclusion.

The pictures of three experimental samples are shown in Fig. 14
                        .

Te experiment results are shown in Fig. 15
                         as follows.

From Fig. 15a, it is known that the nylon probe does not cause any damage to the inner cone. However, both the aluminum probe and the steel probe take damage to the inner surface of docking cone. Moreover, the damage caused by the steel probe (Fig. 15c) is much heavier than the damage caused by aluminum probe (Fig. 15b). This is because the elastic modulus of steel is much higher than the aluminum’s. These differences of damage to the inner cone keep well agreement with the conclusions gotten from theoretical discussion. What’s more, these conclusions will provide important guidance to the selection of probe material in the practical engineering.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper mainly focuses on the impact contact problem during docking process of flexible probe. The docking dynamic model based on flexible probe is developed with the help of Lagrange analytical method, which provides a platform to study the contact problem during flexible docking impact. The modal equation of flexible rod is derived with the effect of the rigid counterweight considered, which is more suitable to the rigid-flexible coupling system of flexible probe. The contact models of docking impact in both normal and tangential directions are presented in detail, which is the focus of this paper. Moreover, the ground-based docking impact experiment is conducted to verify the theoretical results. Results from theoretical model and experiment show a good agreement.

The main conclusions are listed as follows.
                        
                           (1).
                           In the case of low-speed impact, the quasi-static Hertz contact model can be used to approximate the impact contact.

The contact area between ball head and inner cone is elliptical at each moment.

The stress distribution on the contact ellipse researches to the maximum in its central part, and declines to its edge. The effect of tangential friction causes a tangential deformation to the distribution of contact stress, which will be no longer symmetrical at each moment. The effect of friction is very small because it shows the local material deformation of the contact bodies in the tangential direction. The deformation distribution of contact ellipse has the similar regularity with the contact stress.

Under the initial docking conditions in this paper, the elastic modulus of docking probe (E
                              1) must be limit to 5×109
                              N/m2; if it surpasses 9×109
                              N/m2, the inner cone will be damaged. These conclusions will provide important guidance to the selection of probe material in the practical engineering.
