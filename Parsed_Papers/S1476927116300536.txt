                  Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) are highly polymorphic proteins that play a key role in the immune system. HLA molecule is present on the cell membrane of antigen-presenting cells of the immune system and presents short peptides, originating from the proteins of invading pathogens or self-proteins, to the T-cell Receptor (TCR) molecule of the T-cells. In this study, peptide-binding characteristics of HLA-B*44:02, 44:03, 44:05 alleles bound to three nonameric peptides were studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Polymorphisms among these alleles (Asp116Tyr and Asp156Leu) result in major differences in the allele characteristics. While HLA-B*44:02 (Asp116, Asp156) and HLA-B*44:03 (Asp116, Leu156) depend on tapasin for efficient peptide loading, HLA-B*44:05 (Tyr116, Asp156) is tapasin independent. On the other hand, HLA-B*44:02 and HLA-B*44:03 mismatch is closely related to transplant rejection and acute-graft-versus-host disease. In order to understand the dynamic characteristics, the simulation trajectories were analyzed by applying Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) and Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) calculations and hydrogen bonding analysis. Binding dynamics of the three HLA-B*44 alleles and peptide sequences are comparatively discussed. In general, peptide binding stability is found to depend on the peptide rather than the allele type for HLA-B*44 alleles.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are heterodimer cell membrane proteins consisting of a highly polymorphic heavy chain (α-chain), a light chain, β2-microglobulin and a peptide. Forming highly stable complexes with the peptides, they have roles in the recognition of the peptides by T cells. Peptides are generally between 8 and 11 amino acids in length and have allele-specific anchor residues at certain positions (Falk et al., 1991). Due to the large number of available peptide binders leading to tremendous number of possible peptide-MHC complexes, the immune system is challenged to respond to a wide variety of complexes (Madden, 1995). Studies on MHC molecule have been accomplished from past to present due to the importance of MHC molecule in the immune response to foreign antigens (Ostermeir et al., 2015).

HLA encoded genes are the most polymorphic genes in the whole genome, while polymorphisms affect the specific region for peptide binding region. Polymorphism occurring in the peptide binding region of the HLA molecule is important for antigen presentation and recognition of antigens by T cells. Additionally, polymorphisms for HLA class I molecules are also known to affect the Tapasin dependency (Macdonald et al., 2002), which is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in the stabilization of peptide receptive state of HLA class I molecules (Badrinath et al., 2014). Tapasin exerts an optimizing influence and is correlated with the rate of peptide dissociation from class I molecules. The dependence to Tapasin is still an unsolved issue, and it is still not known why some alleles depend on tapasin while the others don’t (Garstka et al., 2011). In this respect, HLA-B44 family has been under investigation (Garstka et al., 2011; Ostermeir et al., 2015; Ostermeir and Zacharias, 2014; Sieker et al., 2007, 2008) since they display varying Tapasin dependencies. Among HLA-B*44:02/03/05, there are two polymorphic positions, 116 and 156 (HLA-B*44:02; Asp116, Asp156; HLA-B*44:03; Asp116, Leu156; HLA-B*44:05; Tyr116, Asp156). Residue 116 is buried at the bottom of the F-pocket (formed by residues 95, 97, 116, 118) on the floor of the antigen binding cleft contributing to the peptide binding, away from the tapasin binding region (residues 134, 229 and 229 (Suh et al., 1999; Zernich et al., 2004)) and 156 is located on the α2 helix forming part of the D/E pocket (Ostermeir et al., 2015) (Fig. 1
                     ). HLA-B*44:02 and HLA-B*44:03 mismatch is closely related to transplant rejection and acute-graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The polymorphic position 156 is known to be one of the most non-permissive transplantation mismatches (Badrinath et al., 2012). Additionally, HLA-B*44:02 and HLA-B*44:03 show tapasin dependence during peptide loading (Thammavongsa et al., 2006), while HLA-B*44:05 is tapasin independent (Zernich et al., 2004).

In this study, the dynamics of peptide binding on HLA-B*44:02/03/05 alleles bound to three different peptides was examined via 20ns molecular dynamics simulations. Root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) profiles as well as hydrogen bonding were investigated for the polymorphic HLA molecules bound to the same peptide.

HLA-B*44 alleles are the most commonly processed alleles for antigen presentation because of their polymorphic properties related to varying tapasin dependency and transplant rejection. Table 1
                         lists the molecules examined in this study along with their respective polymorphic residues. The structures of the complexes were retrieved from protein data bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000). Although binding to the same peptide, the conformations of the peptides show small variations among the alleles as well. Structures are displayed in Fig. 1.

20ns molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on the 9 structures given in Table 1. A total of 18 simulations were employed together with the parallel runs. MD simulations were performed with NAMD 2.9 (Phillips et al., 2005) using CHARMM 27 force field. An integration time step of 2fs was used. Langevin Dynamics was used to keep temperature and pressure stable at 310K and 101.3kPa. The structure was surrounded by water molecules with a solvent area shaped as a rectangular box with 10Å padding. The system was ionized with Na and Cl ions. Periodic boundary conditions were applied and Particle Mesh Ewald summation (Darden et al., 1993) with 12Å cutoff distance for non-bonded interaction energies was used during the simulations.

For the determination of the overall stability of simulations, time evolution of the root-mean square deviation (RMSD) of backbone atoms with respect to the initial structure was monitored. Further detailed analysis (RMSF and hydrogen bonding between the peptide and the binding groove residues) was employed on the simulations after the determination of the equilibrium time step. Details of the calculations are given in Supplementary Material. The analyses were conducted using VMD program (Humphrey et al., 1996) packages. For hydrogen analysis, a distance of 3Å and an angle cut-off of 20° is used.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Average RMSD results for HLA-B*44:02, HLA-B*44:03 and HLA-B*44:05 bound to three different peptides are shown in Fig. 2
                        .

In all the simulations, structures are observed to reach equilibrium after approximately 5ns with respect to the starting structure. The rest of the calculations were based on the equilibrium parts of the simulations. Comparisons of peptide RMSF (Cα atoms) results based on the same peptide bound to different alleles are shown in Fig. 3
                         together with the parallel simulation results.

Peptide P1 (EEFGRAFSF) demonstrates the highest conformational fluctuations when bound to HLA-B*44:02 (1M6O) in both simulations, when compared with other HLA-peptide complexes (Fig. 3, A). This is similar to a previous finding by (Sieker et al., 2008), where B*44:02 was observed to display higher flexibility when compared to B*44:05. For the structures bound to peptide P2 (EEYLKAWTF), all the RMSF profiles display a stable behavior without much fluctuation. On the other hand, peptide P3 (EEYLQAFTY) demonstrates slightly higher conformational fluctuations in the mid-section of the peptide when bound to HLA-B*44:03 (3KPN).

RMSF analysis of the Cα atoms on the binding groove residues (1–180) suggest that the same residues (16, 41, 56, 90, 105, 128–148 and 177) display larger fluctuating behavior in all the alleles in all the conditions (shown in Fig. 4
                        ). These residues correspond to the loop regions in the structure, which are known to be the most flexible sections of a protein structure. On the other hand, the polymorphic residues (116 and 156) are found to be located at the local minima belonging to the less flexible part of the proteins with minimum fluctuation in time.

RMSF results demonstrate that the stability of the HLA-peptide complexes is affected from the peptides that they are bound to rather than the HLA allele type. As a generalization, for these peptides of interest, they all display the most stable behavior when bound to HLA-B*44:05. Previously, the conformational flexibility was related to Tapasin dependence of class I molecules (Garstka et al., 2011) as well. Being tapasin independent, B*44:05 is the less flexible and the most stable allele among the others. In another study by (Sieker et al., 2007), HLA-B*44:05 was shown to display a greater tendency to adopt the peptide bound state even in the unbound conformation. Tyrosine at 116 in B*44:05 creates a more hydrophobic F pocket and stabilizes the binding of the C terminus of the peptide (Sieker et al., 2007, 2008). This polymorphic effect, altering the peptide repertoire, might be the reason behind the stable peptide conformation.

Hydrogen bonding networks between the peptide side chains and the binding groove residues are responsible from the tight binding of the peptides to the molecules. In order to understand the reason behind the observed RMSF profiles, hydrogen bonding analysis was conducted. Hydrogen bonding interactions between peptides, P1 (EEFGRAFSF), P2 (EEYLKAWTF), P3 (EEYLQAFTY) and alleles of HLA-B*44:02, HLA-B*44:03, HLA-B*44:05 were determined by using VMD’s Hydrogen Bonds plugin. Hydrogen bonding maps were constructed based on the obtained data (Shown in Fig. 5
                        ). Hydrogen bond percentages between the peptide residues and HLA molecules were obtained as a result of the analysis. Average values are displayed and the results were compared accordingly.

For the alleles binding to P1 (EEFGRAFSF), peptide residue p2 forms hydrogen bonds with residues 9, 24, 45, 67 and 70 of the binding groove; however, the strength of the interaction is slightly less in B*44:02 (especially when binding to peptide residue p9). p2, which is the main anchor residue of the peptide, is highly responsible from the stability of the peptide. The decrease in the hydrogen bonding between this residue and a binding groove residue might lead to less tight binding, and hence a more fluctuating RMSF profile. Additionally, the interaction between p5 and 155 of the binding groove is not present in B*44:02, which might be an additional reason of the observed fluctuations in the RMSF profile. For the alleles binding to P2 (EEYLKAWTF), there are no significant differences in the hydrogen bonding network inline with the RMSF profiles. The only difference is observed between peptide residue p9 and binding groove residue 77. Although existing in B*44:03 and B*44:05, it is absent in B*44:02. Since it is not a very strong interaction, the effect is not reflected to the RMSF profile. For the alleles binding to P3 (EEYLQAFTY), interactions between peptide residue p3 and 156 is missing in B*44:03 (Leu156), however when this residue is Asp as in B*44:02 and B*44:05, there is a hydrogen bond formation. Asp156Leu polymorphism seems to affect the peptide binding stability and is reflected on the RMSF profiles of the peptide. At the main anchor position, the bonds between the peptide residue p2 and 67 and 70 are also missing in B*44:03 allele. Another effect of polymorphism is seen in this peptide for the bonding between P9 and the polymorphic residue, 116. When 116 is Asp, as in B*44:02 and B*44:03, there is an interaction between peptide residue p9 and 116 Asp. This interaction is not present in B*44:05 when 116 is Tyr.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study shows the characterization of HLA-B*44:02/HLA-B*44:03/HLA-B*44:05 alleles binding to three different peptides; EEFGRAFSF, EEYLKAWTF and EEYLQAFTY. We investigated the polymorphism effects on these alleles by using molecular dynamic simulation techniques. At the end of the simulations, Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) and hydrogen bonding interaction analysis were performed.

The previous studies mainly focused on the tapasin dependency and the differences between the structures in peptide unbound and bound forms. In this study, a full picture of the three peptides bound to three different alleles is studied in detail. As a main conclusion for the structures studied within the framework of this study; the peptide binding stability cannot be generalized for an allele type, but it is rather dependent on the peptide that an allele is binding to. A direct impact of the polymorphism could only be detected when the B*44 alleles are binding to P3 (EEYLQAFTY), where the interaction between peptide residue p3 and binding groove residue 156 is lost in B*44:03 due to Asp156Leu residue mutation and peptide residue p9 and binding groove residue 116 is lost in B*44:05 due to Asp116Tyr mutation. A complete understanding can be achieved by simulations including both tapasin and TCR together with the HLA-peptide complex. As a part of the future work, such systems will be constructed and evaluated in detail.
