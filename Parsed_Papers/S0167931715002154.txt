                  Defect assisted electron transfer processes in metal-oxide materials play a key role in a diverse range of effects of relevance to microelectronic applications. However, extracting the key parameters governing such processes experimentally is a challenging problem. Here, we present a first principles based investigation into electron transfer between oxygen vacancy defects in the high-k dielectric material HfO2. By calculating electron transfer parameters for defects separated by up to 15Å we show that there is a crossover from coherent to incoherent electron transfer at about 5Å. These results can provide invaluable input into numerical simulations of electron transfer, which can be used to model and understand important effects such as trap-assisted tunneling in advanced logic and memory devices.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Defect assisted electron transfer in oxides underpins a range of important effects of relevance for devices such as memories or transistors, including leakage current, bias temperature instability and breakdown [1–3]. First principles modeling of the properties of the participating defects can provide invaluable insight into such processes [4,5]. For example, calculation of the formation-, charge-transition- and ionization-energies of defects together with associated spectroscopic properties can help determine the nature of electrically active defects in real devices [6]. On the basis of such studies it has become clear that in a range of technologically relevant metal oxides (e.g. SiO2 and HfO2) oxygen vacancies are the primary defects responsible for charge trapping and trap assisted tunneling [7]. Kinetic simulations of defect-assisted tunneling processes such as stress-induced leakage current and its evolution to breakdown are also invaluable to deepen our understanding of these effects, which are challenging to probe experimentally [8]. However, such simulations involve a large number of parameters such as defect reorganization energies accompanying electron ionization or transfer, or parameters characterizing the radial decrease of wavefunctions associated with electrons trapped at defects. Since there a few first principles studies of defect-assisted electron transfer processes in oxides many of these parameters are determined on the basis of simple models or by comparison to experiment.

In this article, we employ a first principles approach to characterize electron transfer between oxygen vacancies in the wide gap metal oxide material HfO2. HfO2 finds important applications as a high-k dielectric in advanced logic devices and as the active material in resistive switching memory devices [9,10]. Our approach, which is based on constrained density functional theory (CDFT), was recently applied to model the transfer of electrons between oxygen vacancies in the simpler oxide MgO [11,12]. Here, we apply it to model the process of direct defect-to-defect electron transfer between two oxygen vacancies in HfO2 and determine activation energies and electronic coupling matrix elements for defects separated by up to 15Å which can provide input for simulations of defect-assisted electron transfer. Importantly, HfO2 has a smaller band gap and much higher dielectric constant than MgO so it is not clear whether conclusions made for MgO are transferable to HfO2. We consider electron transfer along the three principal crystallographic directions in order to investigate whether the layered structure of monoclinic HfO2 introduces any significant anisotropy in electron transfer rates. Our main result is the prediction of the distance dependence of reorganization energies and electronic coupling matrix elements, which indicate a crossover between coherent and incoherent electron transfer for defect separations larger than 5Å (with an activation energy in the large separation limit of 0.64eV). This study demonstrates the feasibility of first principles based modeling of electron transfer and similar approaches could be employed to model other fundamental electron transfer processes. Such results could provide crucial input into numerical transport models of leakage current, breakdown and forming in HfO2 films [7,13].

In the following we consider electron transfer between two oxygen vacancies in monoclinic HfO2 separated by a distance d in crystallographic direction [hkl]. The electronic properties and formation energies of the three-coordinated (3C) and 4C oxygen vacancies in HfO2 have been shown previously to be quite similar [4,6]. Owing to the computational expense of the calculations we focus here on electron transfer between 3C vacancies to provide some initial insight. We consider low bias conditions such that the oxygen vacancies are either neutral or positively charged and model the process:

which describes transfer of an electron from a neutral vacancy (labeled i) to an adjacent positive vacancy (labeled ii). This process is considered to be most relevant for typical mid-gap electrode band offsets (e.g. Si or TiN). For small conduction band offset, tunneling processes involving negative charging of vacancies may be more appropriate [6]

                      is the electronic coupling matrix element [14]. In the usual Marcus theory approximation the diabatic potential energy surfaces are assumed to be parabolic so that the diabatic activation energy is exactly equal to

                      is given by the off-diagonal element of the diagonalized Hamiltonian at the transition state geometry. Full details are given in Refs. [11,12]. The CDFT calculations [15] are performed using the Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) code [16]. This code employs a plane wave basis set for expansion of the wavefunctions and Goedecker–Hutter type pseudopotentials are employed to describe core electrons [17]. The 5d and 6s electrons for Hf, and the 2s and 2p electrons for O, are treated as valence. Plane waves with energies up to 70 Ry are included in the basis set. Supercells are constructed which contain two vacancy defects as shown in Fig. 2
                      for the case of defects separated in the [001] direction by about 15Å. Supercells for other defect separations take the form 2×2×2n (n
                     =1, 2, 3) corresponding to defect separations of approximately 5, 10 and 15Å in each of the crystallographic directions [100], [010] and [001]. These supercells ensure defects are separated from periodic images in the lateral directions by at least 10Å, which leads to minimal artificial defect–defect interactions as shown in previous studies [18]. The 2×2×6 supercell formed from the conventional HfO2 unit cell contains 288 atoms. The structures corresponding to the two charge localized states (a and b) are self-consistently optimized using the PBE functional and CDFT. This yields two symmetrically equivalent charge localized configurations associated with different atomic distortions around each vacancy. Subsequently, single point calculations are performed on the optimized structures using the hybrid PBE0 functional, which as we showed previously is important for accurate predictions [11,12].

                      is corrected for finite size effects as described previously for MgO [12] but here we find corrections are small (<10meV) and do not effect the main conclusions. The accuracy of CDFT electronic coupling matrix element calculations was benchmarked recently for molecular charge transfer and it was found that the results compare very favorably with correlated wavefunction methods [19,20].

@&#RESULTS@&#

First we consider how 
                        
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 ab
                              
                           
                        
                      varies with defect separation along the three principal crystallographic directions (Fig. 3
                     ). We find a rapid decrease with increasing defect separation which can be described approximately by a simple exponential decay i.e. H
                     ab
                     =
                     Aexp(−βd/2). Fits to the calculated data yield β in the range 0.86–1.10Å−1 corresponding to an average decay length scale of about 1.0Å. We note this is similar to the decay length scale of about 1.1Å found previously for MgO [11]. There does not appear to be any strong orientation dependence in the variation of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 ab
                              
                           
                        
                      with defect separation. The wavefunction associated with the transferred electron is comprised of a spherical s-state centered at the vacancy with Hf 5d -states in the tail dominating the contribution to the electronic coupling matrix elements. Since all Hf ions are equivalent in the monoclinic crystal structure this explains the fairly isotropic nature of the coupling.


                     Fig. 4
                      shows how the reorganization energy λ associated with electron transfer varies with defect separation and crystallographic orientation.

There is a gradual increase of λ with increasing defect separation consistent with mutual interaction of polarization fields which can be described by a Marcus-like functional form [i.e. λ
                     =
                     λ∞
                     (1−
                     C/d)]. The fits to the data suggest that the reorganization energy can be up to 40% smaller for defects at 5Å separation compared to well separated defects, contributing significantly to the separation dependence of electron transfer rates. Very similar trends were observed in our previous study on MgO [11,12]. The reorganization energy in the limit of well separated defects for HfO2 is calculated to be 2.56eV. This is slightly larger than the corresponding value determined for MgO – 2.10eV.

On the basis of the parameters determined above we are able to calculate the activation energies for each defect separation and orientation using Eq. (3). The key parameters and estimated electron transfer rates for a number of representative temperatures are summarized in Table 1
                     . Importantly, we find that the calculated adiabatic activation energy is found to be either negative or very small for defects separated by about 5Å or less. This indicates that electrons localized on a single vacancy are no longer stable at such small separations and instead the electron will delocalize between the defect pair (or cluster of defects if there is more than one vacancy within 5Å). Furthermore, it suggests formation of a continuous path of vacancies separated by 5Å or less linking electrodes will produce a coherent transport channel. A similar result was found for MgO [11]. Our results indicate significant incoherent defect-defect electron transfer rates even for defects at separations as high as 15Å.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this study we have modeled electron transfer between oxygen vacancies in HfO2 using a first principles CDFT approach. We have considered direct defect-to-defect electron transfer as an example process and have elucidated the variation of key parameters with defect separation and crystallographic orientation. We find localization of an electron at a single positive vacancy is only possible if there are no other positive vacancies within 5Å. A similar behavior was found previously in MgO but is not often considered in numerical simulations of electron transport. For example, the increased delocalization associated with electron trapping at defect pairs and clusters may affect defect ionization, which is another important defect-assisted tunneling pathway [8]. In particular, the thermal activation energy for ionization is governed by the relaxation energy associated with release of a charge from a defect, which will be reduced with increasing delocalization. The reorganization energy is also shown to vary significantly with defect separation giving an important contribution to distance dependence of electron transfer rates.

Our results suggest there is not a significant crystallographic orientation dependence of the electronic coupling matrix elements in HfO2 despite its inherently layered anion structure [18]. However, this is consistent with the fact that the overlapping electronic states are primarily of Hf 5d character. In this study we have considered electron transfer between three-coordinated oxygen vacancies but qualitatively similar results are expected for four-coordinated vacancies.

The approach described in this article can provide invaluable insight into electron transfer processes in oxides and parameters for direct input into numerical transport simulations. Due to the requirement for non-local hybrid density functionals and large supercell sizes these calculations are computationally demanding (necessitating significant resources on national supercomputer facilities). However, the development of more efficient approaches for large-scale hybrid density functional calculations may make such calculations a more routine prospect. The results we obtain for HfO2 are qualitatively similar to those reported previously for MgO suggesting some degree of transferability to similar wide gap metal oxide materials.
