@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Traditionally adopted fixed frequency allocation policy is not able to meet the insatiable demand of more spectrum. This leads to the development of cognitive radio (CR) which provides opportunistic access of licensed spectrum to the unlicensed users [1,2]. In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) scheme is introduced to combat the effects of fading, shadowing and the hidden layer problem occur in practical wireless environment [3]. In CSS, the local sensing results of secondary users (SUs) are combined at the fusion centre (FC) by two schemes; Hard decision fusion (HDF) [4,5] and Soft decision fusion (SDF) [6,7]. From the literature studies, it is found that SDF-based CSS schemes give better performance than HDF-based CSS schemes [6,7]. This mainly motivated us to formulate our resource allocation model in SDF-based sensing scheme.

Energy-efficient CRN design depends on the system throughput and power consumption by the sensing devices. Meanwhile, the sensing time must be chosen to maintain a trade-off between the spectrum sensing accuracy and system throughput [8]. The optimal power allocation is also necessary to restrict the unnecessary growth of transmission power that may introduce severe interference to the primary user (PU) [9]. Especially, in wireless environment, transmission power degrades with the distance raised to the power of path-loss factor. The reduced weak signal makes the SUs to falsely decide the absence of PU in the desired band and to transmit their data. More SUs lead to more energy consumption. So, exclusion of these shadowed SUs and inclusion of suitable (less spatially-correlated) SUs can improve the detection probability with less power consumption.

To preserve energy efficiency (EE), most of the papers in the literature have discussed power allocation algorithms with limited interference to the PU. Wu et al. maximised the EE by jointly optimising the sensing time and power allocation with the constraints of detection parameters and interference to the PU [10]. In [11], the authors proposed a power allocation algorithm by taking sensing error into consideration for OFDM-based cooperative networks. In [12], an energy-efficient model was suggested for multiple amplify-and-forward relays in single source-destination (S-D) CR environment. Here, the authors formulated EE maximization problem as a minimization of total energy consumption under the constraints of false alarm probability, probability of detection, data rate of SUs and minimum interference threshold. A novel iterative algorithm based on parametric transformation method was proposed in [13] for green CR under the constraint of interference to the PU, and was extended for decode-and-forward (DF) relay based green cooperative CR in [14] under both interference and SUs outage constraints. To derive the optimal power allocation strategies over different fading channels, Kang et al. considered the channel state information of PU and maximised the outage capacity at secondary network under the constraints of maximum transmission power from the SUs and outage probability of PU [15]. In [16], EE variation over sensing time was formulated as concave optimization, so golden section search method was employed to find optimal sensing time for maximum EE. Most of the papers are based on HDF-based CSS and do not consider the PU activity during the data transmission period while formulating the interference model.

The main objective of this paper is to maximise the EE with optimal sensing time and power allocation with limited interference to the PU and outage of SUs. The main contributions of our work are summarised below.

                        
                           a.
                           Firstly, we develop an interference-aware model considering the exponential transition probabilities of PU during the data transmission period.

Secondly, we propose SUs selection algorithm based on Hungarian method to select less spatially-correlated SUs.

Thirdly, we formulate this joint optimization using two approaches.
                                 
                                    •
                                    We propose a Novel Iterative Dinkelbach Method (NIDM) algorithm under the constraints of different parameters associated with the EE maximization.

At each iteration in NIDM algorithm, the sensing time is found by employing golden section search method for maximum throughput and the sub-problem associated with the power allocation is solved by employing Karush–Kahn–Tucker (KKT) condition on Lagrangian dual problem. Then, the complexity of our proposed algorithm is analysed.

Finally, the performance of our proposed scheme is presented and the effect of different system parameters on the simulation results is studied.


                     Table 1
                      summarises the main symbols and notations used in this paper. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the system model and the interference model. The EE maximization problem formulation is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, our proposed algorithms are discussed. We present the simulation results in Section 5 and finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6.

In this Section, we discuss the system model of SDF-based CSS scheme along with the frame structure, and provide the interference model to evaluate the total interference possible to the PU during the data transmission period.

We consider a CRN consists of K SUs which are uniformly distributed around the centrally located PU from which only M less spatial-correlated SUs are to be selected. They jointly perform spectrum sensing on the entire licensed band. The licensed band is then divided into M number of sub-bands so as to allow each SU to transmit its data separately in one of the sub-bands to its corresponding cognitive destination (CD). Let a CR system consists of Q number of frames each of length T as shown in Fig. 1
                        . Each frame consists of sensing slot of duration τs

                        . We assume that τr
                         is very less as compared to τs
                         and T
                        0, hence is neglected in further part of the evaluation.

All M SUs each with single energy detector (ED) receive PU signal and send their local sensing results to the FC as shown in Fig. 2
                        . If s(k) is the signal from the PU, then the received signal xi
                        (k) at ith SU in kth instant is formulated as two binary hypotheses tests

                        . During the data transmission period, interference to the PU may be expected in two possible scenarios. In the first scenario, SUs correctly detect the absence of the PU during sensing period but the PU makes a transition in the data transmission period. In this case, the possibility of PU being present during T

                        From (14), it is clear that longer sensing time reduces the data transmission period. If Rth
                         denotes the minimum achievable data rate of ith SU, then the minimum transmission power from each SU is expressed as

                           t, 
                        R(τs
                        ) is a unimodal function of τs
                        , it increases monotonically from 0 ≤ τs
                         < τs
                        * and decreases from τs
                        * < τs
                         ≤ T. So, there exist a unique value of sensing time τs
                        * at which R(τs
                        ) is maximum.


                        
                           Theorem 1
                           
                              R(τs
                              ) is a concave function of τs, where τs
                              * gives the maximum average throughput.


                        
                           Proof
                           Proof of Theorem 1 is given in Appendix A
                              .
                           

So, it is proved that R(τs
                        ) is a unimodal function in the range 0 ≤ τs
                         ≤ T. Hence, golden section search method is employed to get optimal sensing time for maximum throughput [18].

The second optimization problem is to maximise EE. In the CRNs, essentially the power is consumed during the spectrum sensing and data transmission, and it is obvious that sensing power is less than the data transmission power. So, the total power consumption in the CR system is given by (neglecting the circuit power consumption)

                         is the maximum allowable transmission power from the SUs and Ith
                         represents the interference power threshold. Represents the interference power threshold. The total interference power below Ith
                         will not affect the legitimate PU. Here, hspi
                         is the sub-channel gain between the ith SU and the PU.

In this Section, we develop a less spatially-correlated SUs selection algorithm to select M SUs out of the total K SUs. Then, the joint optimization of sensing time and transmission power is obtained through our proposed NIDM algorithm.

Shadowing produces spatially weak and correlated signals on the secondary networks. It has already been proved that less number of SUs in a large area is more effective than more numbers of SUs in a dense area [19]. These uncorrelated SUs can be selected adaptively [20] or from its normalised covariance matrix of received signal [21]. Let K be the total number of SUs present in a CRN, then the element in the correlation matrix E is expressed as [22]

                         represents the distance between the ith and the jth SU. ɛ is an environmental constant. ɛ ≈ 0.1209/m and ɛ ≈ 0.002/m in the urban environment and in the suburban environment, respectively. To avoid the effect of the spatial correlation, we propose a SUs selection algorithm which is based on Hungarian method [23]. The steps describing the algorithm are given as follows.

We adopt the nonlinear fractional or parametric programming to solve the objective function (23). As per parametric programming, if p(x) and q(x) are continuous and real valued functions and

                        * and Pt
                        * represent the optimal sensing time and optimal power allocation, respectively. Our proposed NIDM algorithm presents the steps for joint optimization of sensing time and power allocation with suitable selection of SUs from Algorithm 1.

According to Algorithm 2, at each iteration iter, Pt
                        (iter) is calculated from the sub-problems associated with the convex optimization which is given in the next sub-section. Then, for the given transmission power, sensing time is found out for maximum (20) by using golden section search method. Algorithm 2 is terminated when u(iter) converges. In Appendix B, we prove the convergence of such type of fractional programming transformation algorithm.

In (22), R(τs, Pt
                        ) is a concave and PT
                        (τs, Pt
                        ) is an affine function of SUs transmission power. Also the constraints given in (23a–23f) are either linear or convex. Hence, for the given τs

We have checked all the inequalities conditions given in (31a), (31b) and (31c). Also, we have evaluated the exact power allocations for these four cases. Then, we incorporate these four cases into a single Algorithm 3 to decide transmission power Pt
                         for Algorithm 2. For convenience, we consider that

In this Section, we present the extensive simulation results to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm over different system key parameters. We consider a CRN, where K SUs are distributed around the centrally located PU in a circular area of radius 1 km. We have assumed that K is 20, among them only suitable SUs (

                     Fig. 4 depicts the convergence comparison of our proposed scheme with Scheme I and Scheme II. In Scheme I, we jointly optimise the sensing time and transmission power allocation of SUs through the iterative process discussed in [13,14]. In Scheme II, the method of EE maximization problem formulation and the method of solving the power allocation through Lagrangian duality theorem are adopted from [10]. But the joint optimization of both sensing time and power allocation is done by using our Algorithm 2
                      instead of using two different algorithms as in [10]. In Scheme II, the exact power allocation for Step 3 in Algorithm 2 is directly obtained by solving (27) through KKT condition i.e

                     . But the complexity of our proposed scheme may be same or less than Scheme II depending upon the conditions given in Algorithm 3
                     . Though the complexity of our proposed method is more than Scheme I but in terms of performance our method gives significant improvement in EE with the same simulation parameters. Hence, both Algorithms 2 and 3 jointly provides better performance with considerably less complexity. The simulation parameters are same as the parameters used to obtain Fig. 4.
                  


                     Fig. 6 illustrates the optimal sensing time versus SNR for M = 6 (less spatial-correlated cooperative SUs) and M = 15 (randomly selected SUs). It is clearly noticed that SUs require less sensing time at high SNR values. Further, at SNR = −24dB nearly 3.4ms out of 10ms is spent for spectrum sensing, hence larger portion of the total frame period has been allocated for spectrum sensing leaving very less duration for data transmission. So, system capacity (SC) decreases at low SNR. Simulation parameters are same as Fig. 4

                      = 0.09 and Rth
                      = 2 bits/s/Hz. It is observed that with increase in Ith
                     , EE decreases and SC increases. Increasing in Ith
                      is not always benefitted for maximising EE though it enhances the SC. Because with increase in Ith
                     , the total transmission power boundary increases as per (23b), which ultimately maximises SC.

                      on the maximum EE and maximum SC for M = 6 and

                     bits/s/Hz. We observe that EE increases with increase in outage threshold but SC does not show very significant changes. Hence, more outage threshold provides a better framework for energy-efficient model keeping the system throughput almost unaffected.


                     Fig. 9
                      presents the effect of number of cooperative SUs on maximum EE, maximum SC and total transmission power for Ith
                      = −20 dBW and Ith
                      = −10 dBW. It is obvious that EE decreases with increase in the number of SUs but SC increases as total transmission power increases. More SUs lead to more power consumption. However, the rate of decrease in EE does not change significantly after a certain number of SUs though the transmission power increases. Hence, an energy-efficient model can be designed by selecting suitable number of SUs to avoid unnecessary growth of power consumption. For this figure, SUs are chosen randomly from K SUs. The other simulation parameters are same as the parameters used in Fig. 4.
                  


                     Fig. 10
                      shows the effect of Rth
                      on the maximum EE and maximum SC for Ith
                      = −20 dBW Ith
                      = −10 dBW. The simulation parameters are M = 6 and Γth
                      = 0.09. We observed that EE decreases with increase in Rth
                     . This is because as Rth
                      increases, minimum required transmission power increases which leads to minimisation of EE. Meanwhile, SC increases with Rth
                     .

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper focuses on improving the EE in the SDF-based CSS under the constraints of interference to the PU and secondary outage. In our approach, EE maximisation is guaranteed through the proposed NIDM algorithm which jointly optimises the sensing time and power allocation with less spatially-correlated SUs. The selection of eligible SUs was based on the Hungarian method. The non-convex EE maximisation problem was formulated by using parametric transformation which was then combined with the golden section search method and Lagrangian duality for obtaining sensing time and power allocation at each iteration in NIDM algorithm. The performance of our proposed scheme was validated by comparing with the other existing schemes, and it is deduced that our scheme can solve the EE maximisation problem with less complexity. Further, it can be concluded that EE increases with SNR and Γth
                     , and throughput increases with Rth, M and Ith
                     . So, proper selection of the system parameters could maintain a trade-off between EE and throughput in CRNs.

However, this paper does not consider any effects of malicious users in CR environment, which would be our future interest in order to ensure better performance with secure communication.
