                  Background
                  Changes in laryngeal airflow dynamics during episodes of vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) have not been well described. Very little is known about how inspiratory airflow is impacted when the vocal cords transition from normal inhalation state to a paradoxical adducted state; and how much change in laryngeal airflow and resistance occur before symptoms of stridor and air hunger emerge. This study provides new insight on the effects of VCD on respiratory airflow using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Computed tomography images of a subject with normal vocal cords opening at the time of scanning were digitally modified to mimic an episode of VCD. To quantify and compare changes in inspiratory flow during VCD attack and normal inhalation, steady-state, laminar simulations were performed for three different breathing rates.
               
               
                  Results
                  Pressure-flow analysis during VCD revealed that increasing inspiratory effort is not as efficient as in normal inhalation. Airflow resistance at the epiglottis was higher in the normal state (0.04Pa.s/mL versus 0.02Pa.s/mL) than in VCD; while resistance at the glottis and trachea remained roughly the same (0.04Pa.s/mL) during normal inhalation, it escalated during VCD (0.11Pa.s/mL and 0.13Pa.s/mL at the glottis and trachea, respectively). Peak airflow velocity and vorticity occurred around the glottis during VCD, and at the epiglottis during normal inhalation.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  This pilot study demonstrates that attempting to force more inspired air will yield greater glottal resistance during VCD. Furthermore, there were evidence of abrupt laryngeal pressure gradient, chaotic airflow and high concentration of shear stresses in the glottal region.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is a respiratory condition where the larynx exhibits intermittent paradoxical closure of the vocal cords during respiration; this condition is also known in the literature as “paradoxical vocal fold motion”, “paradoxical vocal cord motion disorder”, “episodic laryngeal dyskinesis”, “paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction”, etc [1–5]. Typical episodes of VCD last from seconds to a few minutes; occur primarily during inspiration and are felt around the upper respiratory tract (neck), resulting in symptoms identical to extrathoracic airway obstruction such as cough, choking, and shortness of breath [6–8]. VCD is often misdiagnosed as asthma which leads to inappropriate choice of treatment options for subjects with this condition [4–11]. Management of this disorder includes speech therapy; education and anxiolytics in severe cases; and inhalation of heliox mixture, particularly for acute episodes [4,7–9,11,12]. Though the prevalence of VCD in adults and kids is not clear, it is estimated that the rate of incidence is between 2.5% and 26.9% [4,7–9,13]. In addition, young females and athletes have been reported to have a higher rate of being diagnosed with this disorder [3–8,11–15].

When symptoms of VCD are suspected, it is important to complete a diagnostic work up to rule out pulmonary, cardiac, or other serious conditions that require medical treatment. VCD is not usually seen on exam after the episode, largely because it is intermittent. However, a continuous laryngoscopy during exercise test is the gold standard for medical diagnosis of this disorder since it allows direct visualization of the vocal cords to determine paradoxical motions with a high degree of accuracy [4,6,8–10,13,16]. As VCD is intermittent, it can be difficult to conduct laryngoscopic examination in the middle of an acute attack due to patient distress. For this reason, provocation techniques such as performing an exercise on a treadmill or bicycle, and noxious stimuli such as methacholine, odor irritant and ergometer stress are sometimes used to trigger VCD during continuous laryngoscopic examination [1,4–7,13,16]. Spirometric measurement of inspiratory and expiratory airflow volume is an additional diagnostic tool for VCD; spirometry is less invasive and easier to obtain than laryngoscopy [1,9,13]. However, this diagnostic tool may indicate flattening or attenuation of inspiratory flow volume loops due to factors unrelated to VCD [9,13,17]. Therefore, it is recommended that for diagnosis of this disorder, a careful history of the condition must be taken plus completion of both laryngoscopy and pulmonary function testing [1,6]. Another diagnostic tool that researchers are also using to document VCD is endospirometry, a technique that combines endoscopy with spirometry [8]. In addition, differential diagnoses of VCD worth mentioning include tracheal obstruction/stenosis, neuromuscular, asthma, exercised-induced asthma, congenital abnormalities, laryngeal collapse, subglottic mass, croup, panic disorder, laryngeal tumor, foreign body aspiration, and bronchial obstruction [4,8,9,11].

Nonetheless, there is scarcity of information in the literature addressing changes or disturbance in laryngeal aerodynamics during episodes of VCD. This lack of information is largely due to non-availability of a reliable clinical tool that can predict localized flow dynamics during paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques show significant promise in predicting both localized and global laryngeal aerodynamics. With CFD, airflow inside the larynx can be visualized, and localized flow variables such as velocity, vortex motions, pressure, and wall shear stress can be computed [18]. CFD methods have been used extensively by many researchers to investigate the effects of anatomic deformity on sinonasal airflow profiles [19–26]; topical drug delivery, and particle transport in the respiratory system [27–36]. CFD techniques have also been employed to study vocal cord vibration/displacement and flow dynamics in the larynx during phonation [37–41].

The aim of this pilot study is to quantify and compare both upstream and downstream changes in inspiratory flow patterns during a simulated episode of VCD and during normal inhalation (when the vocal cords are open) using CFD methods. To investigate the effects of VCD on laryngeal physiology, simulation results from three different inspiratory flow rates will be presented. CFD derived variables such as laryngeal resistance, wall shear stress, airflow pressure, velocity, and vortex motions will be computed and compared for each breathing rate. These variables provide preliminary understanding relating changes in aerodynamics with patient symptoms.

@&#METHODS@&#

This study was approved by the Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board for Clinical Investigations. Computed tomography (CT) images of a 28 year old male subject with normal vocal cords opening during inspiration at the time of scanning was digitally modified to mimic a mid-inspiratory vocal cord adduction with posterior chinking, observed in VCD attacks (Fig. 1) [2]. A medical imaging software, Mimics™ 16.0 (Materialise, Inc., Plymouth, MI) was used to create two three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the subject’s respiratory track (nasal passage to carina of trachea) from a CT scan containing 232 slices; with an increment of 1.0 mm; and a pixel size of 0.475 mm. The reconstructed 3D models (
                        Fig. 1) represented a normal airway (we will call this model “Normal”) and an airway showing virtual abnormal adduction of the vocal cords (we will call this model “VCD”).

Both 3D models were exported from Mimics™ in stereolithography file format into the CAD and mesh-generating software package ICEM-CFD™ 14.5 (ANSYS, Canonsburg, PA). To solve the equations that govern fluid flow, unstructured tetrahedral meshes were generated in ICEM-CFD™ with approximately six million graded elements; this is consistent with our mesh density study which showed that about six million elements will provide mesh independent numerical results (
                        Fig. 2). Mesh quality analysis was done to ensure that all tetrahedral elements had an aspect ratio greater than 0.3, to prevent distorted elements from affecting the accuracy of the numerical simulation.

Unsteady laminar inspiratory airflow was simulated using the CFD software package Fluent™ 14.5 (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, PA) to capture airflow dynamics from nostrils to outlet. Fluent™ uses the finite volume method to numerically solve the Navier-Stokes equations; the conservation of mass, and momentum for laminar incompressible flow are described, respectively, by the equations

                         kg/m-s. To simulate three breathing rates under physiologic pressure-driven settings the following boundary conditions were utilized.


                        Outlet: A pressure-outlet boundary condition at the outlet of the trachea with gauge pressure set to -6, -15 and -25 Pa, respectively, was specified. These pressure values were chosen in order to achieve low to moderate inspiratory breathing rates of 
                           ≤
                           25
                           
                        L/min, where the flow regime is laminar [42].


                        Inlet: A pressure-inlet condition at the nostrils with gauge pressure set to zero, to mimic pressure-driven flow rather than plug-flow condition.


                        Respiratory track: The airway walls in the respiratory passage were assumed to be stationary with zero velocity at the air-wall interface, as well as a no-slip shear condition

@&#ANALYSIS@&#

The following CFD biophysical variables were computed for each breathing rate: volume flow rate, flow pressure, laryngeal resistance, wall shear stresses, velocity, and vorticity. These variables will provide preliminary understanding regarding airflow changes and shear stresses the larynx undergoes during an acute VCD attack.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Volume flow rate from nostrils to trachea comparing both Normal and VCD models are shown in 
                     Fig. 3A. In the 6 Pa negative pressure set at the end of trachea simulation, flow rate in the Normal cavity more than doubles flow in the VCD cavity. At 25 Pa negative pressure, the flow rate during normal inhalation was about three times the flow during VCD attack. This figure also shows that the change in inspiratory flow between both respiratory passages increased steadily from 5.2L/min (for 6 Pa negative pressure at the trachea) to 13.0L/min (for 25 Pa negative pressure at the trachea). In addition, simulation results of localized pressure in the larynx (from epiglottis to trachea) revealed elevated laryngeal airflow pressure (approximately 400%) in the VCD model at every inspiratory breathing rate (Fig. 3B).

Effects of paradoxical vocal cord adduction on laryngeal airflow streamlines based on the nostril-surface reference points selected to compute flow patterns are shown in 
                     Fig. 4. During normal inhalation, an evenly distributed flow with moderate velocity was observed (Fig. 4A, left); and airflow was fastest around the nasal valve, and supraglottic to subglottic regions. Visualization results depicted a much slower flow above the glottal region in the VCD model (Fig. 4A, right), which then transitioned abruptly to a very fast flow in the glottis before gradually slowing down at the trachea. In addition, the flow appeared to be swirling inferiorly to the adducted vocal cords (Fig. 4A, right). Fig. 4B shows streamlines of the flow pressure gradient. In the Normal cavity, a gradual increase in pressure gradient from the nostrils to carina of trachea was observed (Fig. 4B, left), while the VCD model showed a more dramatic change in pressure occurring near the glottis (Fig. 4B, right).

Localized flow resistance computed for each breathing rate from nostrils to choana; nostrils to epiglottis; nostrils to glottis; and nostrils to trachea showed that airflow resistance was moderately higher in the Normal model from nostrils to the epiglottis region (
                     Fig. 5). However, resistance was more than two-fold higher at the glottis and trachea levels in the VCD model. Paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords in the VCD model may have produced the low upstream flow resistance and high downstream flow resistance seen in Fig. 5. Notice that the largest change in resistance during VCD attack occurred at the glottis; while airflow resistance was roughly at the same level from the epiglottis down to the trachea during normal inhalation.

Time-average velocity at four cross-sections (choana, epiglottis, glottis, and trachea) in the respiratory track showed that maximum velocity occurred around the glottis in the VCD model and at the epiglottis in the Normal model (
                     Fig. 6). As expected, 25 Pa negative pressure inspiratory effort produced the highest velocity in both models (5.3m/s in VCD and 2.1m/s in Normal). Interestingly, peak velocity (was 2.3m/s) in the VCD model at the lowest inspiratory effort (6 Pa) was greater than the maximum velocity (2.1m/s) computed during normal inhalation for every inspiratory breathing rate. Plots of time-average vorticity (Fig. 6B) at the choana, epiglottis, glottis, and trachea cross-sections followed similar pattern as time-average velocity at the same cross-sections.

Respiratory track wall shear stress contour in the VCD model indicated a high stress concentration around the posterior laryngeal wall starting from the glottis down to the trachea (
                     Fig. 7), while shear stress remained relatively low at other regions of the airway. In addition, peak shear stress during VCD attack occurred in the vicinity of the glottis. In the Normal model, shear stresses were evenly distributed around the walls; there were no regions in the respiratory track with abnormal high or low concentrations of shear stress (Fig. 7).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

VCD creates sudden paradoxical vocal cord movement toward the midline during respiration, creating partial extrathoracic airway obstruction [43]. As a consequence, normal physiological flow of air in the larynx is greatly disrupted, thus may incite dyspnea and stridor. Therefore, to objectively evaluate results from CFD models in the present study with symptoms associated with abnormal vocal cord adduction, laryngeal resistance, wall shear stress and airflow rate were estimated. Resistance is known to be affected by reduction in the cross-sectional area of the airway and may create a tightening sensation; while flow patterns and shear stresses could also be related to feelings of breathing difficulties and air hunger [21].

CFD analyses in the present study seek to provide important new insight into the impact of VCD on aerodynamics in the respiratory track (nostrils to trachea). As inspiratory effort increases, change in airflow (flow difference between Normal and VCD) between both models trended upward (Fig. 3). The amount of flow in the Normal cavity model grew to three times that of the VCD model at the highest inspiratory effort (25Pa negative pressure) indicating that increasing inspiratory effort during VCD may not yield corresponding benefit in airflow as observed during normal inhalation. Meanwhile, as localized air velocity increased around the posterior region of the larynx (Fig. 4A), higher levels of shear stress in the same region was observed (Fig. 7); indicating a relationship between localized shear stress and flow velocity [44].

Furthermore, by investigating changes in flow parameters beyond the larynx, additional phenomena regarding upstream and downstream effects of VCD on the respiratory airway were established. For instance, flow velocity and pressure in the nasal and upper pharyngeal cavities were much lower in the VCD model than during normal inhalation (Fig. 4). Similarly, flow resistance levels from nostrils to choana and down to the epiglottis were much lower in the VCD model, before escalating rapidly around the glottis and trachea regions (Fig. 5). The implication of such upstream and downstream effects is a very mild sensation of air in the nasal and upper pharynx; as flow reaches the obstructed glottal region, air speed and pressure increased rapidly and became chaotic. This sudden change in airflow dynamics due to paradoxical adduction of vocal cords may be felt in the larynx.

Quantification of airflow to confirm diagnosis of VCD is commonly done through pulmonary function testing to measure flow volume loops [4,6,9,13,17,43]. Patients with VCD typically demonstrate a flattening inspiratory flow volume loop during an episode [6,43]; in their 1995 article, Newman, Mason and Schmaling [45] reported that 23% of VCD patients with truncated inspiratory flow volume loop were not experiencing an acute attack at the time of pulmonary function testing. Some authors have suggested that attenuation of inspiratory flow volume loop may be related to poor patient compliance or effort rather than evidence of VCD [9,13,17]. A study conducted by Sterner and colleagues [17] revealed that the cause in 54 of the 123 patients who had at least one of three abnormal inspiratory flow loops was poor inspiratory effort rather than any underlying pathology. In addition, since it is almost impossible to measure the volume of respiratory air during an acute attack of VCD [8], better diagnostic tools to quantify airflow are needed. This study has shown that CFD models may have the potential to fill this gap. CFD computed airflow variable have the ability to detect localized changes in the larynx, as well as correlate with patient symptoms [19,21].

Although the results presented in this study provided some useful information on the impact of VCD, there are a number of limitations with our computational method. First, the model used to describe VCD was digitally modified to resemble the authors’ interpretation of a true symptomatic patient. Second, CFD modeling relies on 3D reconstruction of the respiratory track based on CT images; this means that to accurately utilize CFD in the study of VCD, CT scans of patients during an episode of this disorder have to be available. Third, since CT images only capture one time point, it is assumed that images at a specific time point adequately represent the respiratory anatomy during an acute onset of VCD despite the dynamic nature of the airway, including pliability of the vocal folds. Lastly, the implementation of CFD modeling is computationally intensive; approximately 48 man-hours were required to generate results for each set of CT scans.

In conclusion, this study investigates the impact of VCD on airflow dynamics in the respiratory system using CFD. Simulated flow results from a normal and digitally modified VCD airway models were analyzed to characterize changes in airflow resistance, streamlines of velocity and pressure, vorticity, as well as wall shear stress. Preliminary results showed that VCD attack can: (1) reduce airflow rate by more than 50%, (2) create disturbed flow with high velocity in the glottis, (3) incite elevated levels of shear stress on the posterior laryngeal wall, and (4) negatively impact aerodynamics beyond the larynx. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use CFD techniques to provide a quantitative assessment of VCD. Future directions include conducting CFD analysis in symptomatic patients, as well as study the effects of respiratory rate.
