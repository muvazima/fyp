                  Community question answering (CQA) services that enable users to ask and answer questions have become popular on the internet. However, lots of new questions usually cannot be resolved by appropriate answerers effectively. To address this question routing task, in this paper, we treat it as a ranking problem and rank the potential answerers by the probability that they are able to solve the given new question. We utilize tensor model and topic model simultaneously to extract latent semantic relations among asker, question and answerer. Then, we propose a learning procedure based on the above models to get optimal ranking of answerers for new questions by optimizing the multi-class AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve). Experimental results on two real-world CQA datasets show that the proposed method is able to predict appropriate answerers for new questions and outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years, Community Question Answering (CQA) services that allow users to ask and answer questions via the web have been successful on the internet. CQA portals such as Yahoo! Answers
                        1
                        
                           http://answers.yahoo.com.
                     
                     
                        1
                      and Tencent Wenwen
                        2
                        
                           http://www.wenwen.com.
                     
                     
                        2
                      (which is one of the leading CQA service providers in China) provide online platforms for users to post their questions and share their knowledge by answering others’ questions. Thousands of millions of questions have been resolved on these CQA portals. For example, in Tencent Wenwen, 207,469,570 questions have been resolved until October 30, 2012.
                        3
                        
                           http://www.wenwen.com.
                     
                     
                        3
                      Although these CQA portals have brought significant benefits to users, there are still several drawbacks in current CQA systems. The most prominent problem is that lots of new questions cannot be solved by other users effectively. Previous survey (Furlan, Nikolic, & Milutinovic, 2012; Li & King, 2010) showed that lots of new questions actually cannot be answered efficiently (within 24h). On the other hand, since the amount of new questions increases rapidly, it is inconvenient for the users who are usually expert in a few domains to find the questions, which they are able to answer. This leads to a low participation rate of users on CQA portals (Guo, Xu, Bao, & Yu, 2008).

To address this problem, several approaches have been proposed in both industry and academia. In the industry, for example Aardvark
                        4
                        
                           http://vark.com/.
                     
                     
                        4
                      is a social search engine which routes new questions to the person in the asker’s extended social network (e.g. Facebook,
                        5
                        
                           http://www.facebook.com.
                     
                     
                        5
                      LinkedIn
                        6
                        
                           http://www.linkedin.com.
                     
                     
                        6
                     ) who are most likely to be able to answer this question. The details of Aardvark are introduced in (Horowitz & Kamvar, 2010).

In academia, lots of methods (Dror, Koren, Maarek, & Szpektor, 2011; Guo et al., 2008; Li & King, 2010; Li, King, & Lyu, 2011; Liu, Liu, & Yang, 2010; Zhou, Cong, Cui, Jensen, & Yao, 2009; Zhou, Lyu, & King, 2012) have been proposed. Traditional methods often focused on semantic relations between questions and answerers via language model or topic model as shown in left side of Fig. 1
                     . Although such approaches could describe the answerer’s interests in questions or related topics, relations between asker and question, asker and answerer have not attracted enough attention. Actually, these relations indeed exist in online CQA portals. For asker and question, questions of the same asker are usually correlated. For example in Fig. 2
                      which is a snapshot of an asker’s homepage on Yahoo! Answers, all questions were talking about Chrysler car, in categories of Maintenance and Repair, Chrysler. Thus, the information of asker is useful to understand questions. For asker and answerer, similar to Facebook where users can see their friends’ news in their homepages, the asker’s fans/followers are easier to find his/her new questions and more likely to answer them. A related example is shown in Fig. 3
                     , which is a snapshot of a user’s contacts/friends webpage on Yahoo! Answers. Then in this paper, we incorporate the asker dimension as traditional topic-answerer model and propose a novel asker-topic-answerer model which is a 3-order tensor (Kolda & Sun, 2008; Lu, Plataniotis, & Venetsanopoulos, 2011) as shown in the right side of Fig. 1.

Furthermore, CQA services allow askers to select the best one among all answers given by answerers. The corresponding answer is called the best answer. Traditional approaches (Li & King, 2010; Liu et al., 2010) usually consider only the best answers and answerers, ignoring the other answers and answerers, or treating them as the same. However, the information of other answers is also beneficial to solve questions and produces much more training data for learning procedure, e.g. more candidate answerers for predicting. Therefore, in our approach, we consider both the best and other answers as shown in Fig. 4
                     . In the left side of Fig. 4 which represents the traditional approach, the blue grids show that asker2 was given two answers by the same answerer on two topics. There is no difference between these answers in traditional approach. However, actually the answerer achieved the best answer on the upper topic (symbol 
                        
                           ∘
                        
                     ) and other answers (symbol 
                        
                           ×
                        
                     ) on the below topic as shown in the right side of Fig. 4. It means this answerer may be more expert in the upper topic than the below one. Such useful information can be used to improve the ranking of answerers.

Thus our intuition is that if an answerer, u achieved many best answers in some topics of a specific asker (i.e. best answerer), u should rank higher than other answerers who gave non-best answers or no answers for new questions in this topic of the same asker. Furthermore, if u achieved many other answers, u should rank higher than the answerers who did not give answers (i.e. non-answerer). Based on this intuition and quality of answers, we classify users into three categories: best answerer, other answerer and non-answerer. As demonstrated in the previous work (Yan & Zhou, 2012), maximization of AUC (Area under the ROC curve) can be used to optimize ranking of two-class problem (answerer and no-answerer). Thus in this paper, it is reasonable to solve the ranking problem of three-class by maximizing multi-class AUC which has been studied in previous researches (Hand & Till, 2001; Marrocco, Duin, & Tortorella, 2008; Toh, Kim, & Lee, 2008). Now the problem mentioned above can be treated as answerer ranking problem.

In this paper, we formally describe the answerer ranking problem and propose a novel approach to learn optimal ranking for new questions effectively. The proposed approach consists of three stages: (a) learn topics of askers, answerers and construct asker-topic-answerer model; (b) optimize asker-topic-answerer model with tensor factorization by maximizing multi-class AUC; and (c) predict the final ranking of potential answerers for new questions. The main contributions can be summarized as below: (1) A novel model is proposed by combining tensor model and topic model to capture the latent semantic relations among asker, question and answerer simultaneously. (2) Based on this model, we propose a new learning approach with tensor factorization to perform the answerer ranking task, which outperforms previous related approaches on two real-world datasets.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present an overview of related work. Next, we formally describe the answerer ranking problem in Section 3. In Section 4, we describe the details of the proposed framework. In Section 5, we compare the proposed method with other baseline and state-of-the-art approaches and investigate the impact of model parameters. Finally, we draw conclusions and discuss the future work in Section 6.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

Community Question Answering (CQA) portals such as Yahoo! Answers and Tencent Wenwen have collected plenty of questions and related answers during the past few years. A lot of research work have been conducted on the CQA related data to address various problems (Adamic, Zhang, Bakshy, & Ackerman, 2008; Gazan, 2010; Gu & Zhou, 2009; Guo et al., 2008; Ko, Si, & Nyberg, 2010; Liu, Croft, & Koll, 2005; Radev, Fan, Qi, Wu, & Grewal, 2005; Qu et al., 2009).

Recently, several approaches (Dror et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2008; Li & King, 2010; Li et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2012) have been proposed to tackle the similar problem mentioned in Section 1 for CQA services. Zhai and Lafferty (Zhai & Lafferty, 2004) proposed a smoothing method for query likelihood language (QLL) model to improve retrieval performance. This method can also be adjusted to solve this problem by treating it as a retrieval task and often used as the baseline (Li & King, 2010; Liu et al., 2010). Guo (Guo et al., 2008) focused on recommending answer providers in order to increase the participation rate of users in CQA services. Zhou (Zhou et al., 2009) presented several approaches with language models to represent the expertise of users based on their previous question and answering activities and then pushed the new questions to the appropriate users in online forums. Liu (Liu et al., 2010) employed a probabilistic framework to model the answerer predicting problem and proposed several methods to predict the best answerers for new questions. One of these methods (QLDA) combines language model (QLL) (Zhai & Lafferty, 2004) and LDA model (Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003) to estimate the probabilistic distribution of users’ interests with queries of questions. Besides QLDA, another method (QLUC) not only includes the language model, but also additionally considers the authority and activity of users in the predicting process. Li (Li & King, 2010) proposed a Question Routing (QR) framework and several methods to perform this task that mainly focused on the quality of answer’s content when predicting appropriate answerers for new questions. The basic method (BQ) uses the quality of answers to estimate expertise of answerers. The quality of answers on new questions is estimated based on user’s previous answers. An improved method (SQ) uses the smoothing technique in estimating quality of answers. Furthermore, Li (Li et al., 2011) improved their previous work (Li & King, 2010) by adding information of categories (CQLL) and achieved better performance than BQ and SQ. Yahoo! Research (Dror et al., 2011) published their work which addressed the demands via a multi-channel recommender system associating questions with potential answerers. The system collected about 530 features and trained models by Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. Zhou (Zhou et al., 2012) treated this problem as a classification task. The method trained a SVM model based on question–answerer pair with lots of local and global features. Then the model predicted yes/no for each potential answerers for new questions.

The traditional approaches mainly focused on semantic relationship between questions and answerers. For example, in order to learn latent topics of questions, topic models based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths & Steyvers, 2004) have been extensively investigated (Guo et al., 2008). Different from previous methods, our approach not only focused on latent topics of questions which measure the semantic relationship (Moreda, Llorens, Saquete, & Palomar, 2011; Ni, Lu, Quan, Wenyin, & Hua, 2011) between questions and answerers, but also considered relations between askers and questions, as well as askers and answerers. Furthermore, we applied tensor model to capture relations among asker, question and answerer simultaneously. Although tensor factorization has been applied successfully to information retrieval and other fields (Lu et al., 2011; Rendle, Balby Marinho, Nanopoulos, & Schmidt-Thieme, 2009), it has rarely been explored in CQA.

A previous version of this paper was published in ECIR 2012(Yan & Zhou, 2012). This paper differs from it in the following ways.
                        
                           1.
                           The previous work optimized by maximizing AUC which only distinguished answerers and non-answerers, while this paper proposed a more general approach by maximizing multi-class AUC which additionally includes information of the best and other answerers.

We improved the evaluation by considering the best-answerer criterion, and our method outperformed the previous work considerably by using this criterion. It means that the ranking results of our method are more reasonable.

We crawled a new much larger dataset from Yahoo! Answers that covers six categories, and have carried out experiments extensively on this dataset.

Typically, Community Question Answering services consist of users, questions and answers, while users consist of askers and answerers. We define the set of all askers as 
                        
                           U

                                       u

In order to capture the latent semantic relation between user and question, we need to discover latent topics of questions. In this paper, we employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model (Blei et al., 2003) which has been widely applied for mining the topics of documents. The details are introduced in (Blei et al., 2003).

Different from normal documents, the content length of questions including title and body is usually short. This situation will lead to poor performance of LDA model. To address this issue, we construct a new corpus in which each document consists of the question and its corresponding best answer. Then we train LDA model on this new corpus with Gibbs sampling method. This method is reasonable because the best answer that is selected by asker is naturally supposed to share the same topic with the question. We define the set of all topics as

In this paper, we adopt an optimization criterion to learn model parameters

                         by maximizing multi-class AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) (Herschtal & Raskutti, 2004) as described in Eq. (4). AUC is an effective criterion to measure ranking quality of a two-class classifier as required in many real applications (Marrocco et al., 2008). The AUC equals the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance (Ferri, Hernández-Orallo, & Salido, 2003).

The training procedure consists of LDA training procedure and model learning procedure. Since the runtime complexity of LDA training procedure has been studied (Porteous et al., 2008), here we focus on model learning procedure as described in Section 4.4. Similar to the predicting part, the complexity of updating gradient for each dimension is

Since the datasets used in previous work (Li & King, 2010; Liu et al., 2010) are not publicly available. We have collected two real-world CQA datasets from Yahoo! Answers (YA) and Tencent Wenwen (TW) respectively. The YA dataset is crawled in August 2013 via Yahoo! Answers’ API
                           7
                           
                              http://developer.yahoo.com/answers/.
                        
                        
                           7
                         which covers six categories: i.e. Internet, Movies, Music, Sports, Travel and Health. The TW dataset is crawled from October 2010 to November 2010 in four categories, i.e. Computer/IT, Health/Medical, Education/Science and Social/Culture. The stop words in question and answer are removed for both YA and TW dataset. Notice that for TW dataset that is in Chinese we should perform Chinese word segmentation firstly.

In order to investigate the characteristics of the crawled datasets, Fig. 5
                        (a) shows the degree distribution of the number of questions answered by the same user in YA dataset, and Fig. 5(b) shows the degree distribution in TW dataset. Both axes of Fig. 5(a) and (b) are in 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    log
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         scale. We can see that both of them follow a Power Law distribution, which is a typical characteristic of social media.

After that, we use a p-core
                           8
                           The p-core of S is the largest subset of S with the property that every user, every item and every tag has to occur in at least p posts.
                        
                        
                           8
                         treatment for YA 3-core and for TW 3-core. P-core is usually applied in data mining and information retrieval to prune the raw crawled dataset to make it more reliable (Jäschke, Marinho, Hotho, Schmidt-Thieme, & Stumme, 2007). For example, when p-core is set to p-3, it means that the user should ask at least three questions and the answerer should answer at least 3 questions. The statistics of the final experimental datasets are shown in Table 1
                        .

We adopt four well known metrics to evaluate the performance of methods, namely Mean Multi-Valued Reciprocal Rank (MMVRR) which is a variant of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) when there are more than one relevant results for the query, Mean Average Precision (MAP), Precision, and Recall, which are widely used in information retrieval (Herlocker, Konstan, Terveen, & Riedl, 2004).

The compared approaches are described as follows:
                              
                                 •
                                 
                                    QLL: The query likelihood language (QLL) model which is proposed by (Zhai & Lafferty, 2004). We select this method as baseline in our experiments.


                                    QLDA: Liu et al. proposed this method by linearly combining LDA model and QLL model together to predict the best answerers (Liu et al., 2010).


                                    QLUC: This method is also proposed by Liu et al. which incorporates answerer’s activity and authority into the QLDA model (Liu et al., 2010).


                                    BQ: Li presented an approach which considers the answering quality of users (Li & King, 2010).


                                    SQ: This method is an improved version of BQ, and the details are introduced in (Li & King, 2010).


                                    CQLL: Li et al. add the information of categories to improve the model performance (Li et al., 2011).


                                    ATA: The method of our previously published work which is optimized by single AUC maximization (Yan & Zhou, 2012).


                                    MATA: The proposed method in this paper with multi-class AUC maximization.

In order to investigate the performance of methods exhaustively, we describe the evaluation scenarios in this section.

We split the dataset into training and test set based on each asker’s history of posting questions. In details, for each asker u in dataset S, we select the latest question posted by u to compose the test set 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                    
                                    
                                       test
                                    
                                 
                              
                           , then the groundtruth is the users who have answered these questions. Furthermore, the training set 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                    
                                    
                                       train
                                    
                                 
                              
                            consists of the other questions posted by u earlier and the corresponding answerers with their answers. Consequently, we train the proposed model on 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                    
                                    
                                       train
                                    
                                 
                              
                            and predict the ranking of potential answerers for each question in 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                    
                                    
                                       test
                                    
                                 
                              
                           .

For more reasonable evaluation of the proposed method, we propose two evaluation criterions based on Top-N prediction.


                           Answerer criterion (AC). This criterion evaluates the ranking list of answerers based on whether the Top-N answerers will answer the specified question. The groundtruth is the set of all answerers who have answered the questions in 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                    
                                    
                                       test
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . The answerers who rank higher are more likely to answer the questions.


                           Best-answerer criterion (BAC). Different from AC, BAC evaluates the ranking list of answerers based on whether the Top-N answerers are able to solve the given question. This means that his/her answer is the best answer selected by the asker. The groundtruth is the set of answerers who gave the best answer of the questions in 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                    
                                    
                                       test
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . The answerers ranking higher are more likely to give the best answer of the question.

At the first stage of the proposed framework, we need to learn the topic distribution of questions by LDA.

                         The number of topics K is set to 500. The other parameters of LDA model are: Dirichlet priors

                           Table 2
                            shows several typical topics of questions-answers discovered from YA and TW dataset by LDA. In each topic, the Top-10 words with highest probability are selected. From Table 2, we can see that for YA dataset YA-Topic-5 focuses on 
                              
                                 Internet

                            and YA-Topic-11 is highly related to 
                              
                                 Sports
                                 /
                                 Basketball
                              
                           . For TW dataset, we have translated the Chinese words into English for convenience. TW-Topic-16 is related to Human Body, while TW-Topic-47 is about Geography.

In this section, we show the performance comparison of methods on YA and TW dataset respectively.


                           Tables 3 and 4
                           
                            present the performance of the proposed method and other published approaches on YA dataset under both answerer and best-answerer criterions respectively. Tables 5 and 6
                           
                            present the performance of the methods on TW dataset under both answerer and best-answerer criterions respectively. Notice that in 
                              
                                 Yahoo
                                 !
                              
                            
                           Answers the number of the best answer for each question is exactly only one, while its upper bound is two in Tencent Wenwen. From these tables, we can see that QLUC outperforms QLDA and they are both better than QLL. This conclusion is consistent with the results in (Liu et al., 2010). Besides this, SQ is better than BQ which is also concluded in (Li & King, 2010).

From Tables 3 and 4 the proposed method MATA outperforms other approaches consistently in all metrics, MMVRR, MAP, PRECISION and RECALL (N
                           =100) on YA dataset. Notice that under answerer criterion, ATA model is almost the same as MATA model in the learning procedure. Thus the gap of performance between ATA and MATA under answerer criterion is relative small. On the other hand, it means that our MATA model not only maintains the advantages of ATA model, but also achieves significant improvement under best-answerer criterion.

Furthermore, from Tables 5 and 6, the proposed MATA method outperforms other approaches (including previous ATA method) consistently in all metrics. Since the information of questions’ categories is unavailable in TW dataset, we have neglected CQLL method in the comparison on TW dataset. In our evaluation, CQLL method does not perform very well. The reason may be that the categories in our YA dataset are not very similar with each other.

Besides the previous evaluation, we have additionally evaluated 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       F
                                    
                                    
                                       1
                                    
                                 
                              
                           -measure, MMVRR and MAP on TW dataset under both answerer and best-answerer criterions. The results are shown in Fig. 6
                           . The conclusion is similar to previous experiments. The proposed method approximately dominates the performance in most situations. Furthermore, QLUC’s performance is similar to SQ, while QLUC outperforms SQ in the Best-answerer criterion and performs worse than SQ in answerer criterion. QLDA is similar to BQ and these methods all outperform QLL.

To validate the impact of asker dimension, we have compared the proposed method with its variant which ignores the information of askers and treats them as anonymous askers. We ran this Anonymous variant with K
                           =500 and 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       k

                                 =
                                 {
                                 64

                            on TW dataset. The results are shown in the Table 7
                           . We have evaluated the results by using answerer criterion and the results show that the proposed model with the information of askers does improve the performance of model. Compared with Anonymous variant with

                                       dim
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 {
                                 64
                                 ,
                                 256
                                 }
                              
                           , the indices of MATA have been improved by at least 50% in the evaluation.

In order to investigate the impact of the topics K used in LDA model, we ran the proposed method with

                            show the results of performance compared in all metrics on YA dataset by using answerer criterion and best-answerer criterion respectively. Based on the results, we can find that there is unobvious relationship between K and the model’s performance. For example, the model with 
                              
                                 K

                            outperforms other parameters in MMVRR and MAP, while the method with 
                              
                                 K

                            on YA dataset outperforms others in PRECISION and RECALL. Therefore, we suggest that users should try a couple of parameters in their experiments on other datasets to achieve the optimal results. Based on our datasets and experiments, K
                           =500 is a recommended choice.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

In this paper, we formally described the answerer ranking problem and proposed a novel framework to learn the optimal answerer ranking for new questions effectively. We firstly learned the topic distributions of questions by LDA model, and constructed a 3-order tensor model based on the semantic relations among asker, question and answerer. Secondly, we adopted Tucker tensor decomposition to learn model parameters by maximizing multi-class AUC. Finally, we were able to predict the ranking of answerers for new questions. We conducted extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, which were crawled from Yahoo! Answers and Tencent Wenwen. The results showed that the proposed approach outperforms other previous methods in regards of four metrics, i.e. MRR, MAP, Precision and Recall. The generalizability of our approach is fairly well. Actually, this approach can be easily modified to solve any recommendation or prediction task which can be formulated as a multi-class (including two-class) ranking problem based on tensor model, such as interest-based friend recommendation, social tag prediction, etc. The main limitation of our method is that it is time consuming to deal with large-scale CQA forums, since the tensor model needs to process more parameters than traditional methods in the training process.

In future work, we plan to utilize more information such as the answer ratings provided by users in CQA, which is considered to be useful feedback concerning the answers’ quality. In addition, while the timestamp of users’ answering activities is ignored in our current model, we want to introduce such information to further improve the ranking performance of our method. Furthermore, we hope to do some work to improve the scalability of current model in real-world scenarios with massive users.
