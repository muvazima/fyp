                  Studies have widely used stochastic frontier models to assess financial efficiency; however, traditional static approaches do not take dynamic characteristics of financial systems into account. This article develops a dynamic stochastic frontier model to evaluate regional financial efficiency and provides an empirical test of the model by using panel data of 62 Chinese counties during the 2001–2010 period. The model measures the dynamic impact of the input–output variables and environmental variables on financial efficiency, and allows for the separation of technical change from the change in technical efficiency. The results show that the dynamic model provides a better fit to the data than the static model. In addition, a gradient difference emerges in the regional financial efficiency among the six major regions of China. The results offer practical implications for the development of regional financial services in China, as well as other developing countries and emerging economies.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In 2011, a financial crisis broke out in Wenzhou, one of the wealthiest cities in China, from underground banking activities (Martin, 2012). An unofficial media report revealed that gray lending activities involved approximately 80 percent of households in Wenzhou (Business Spectator, 2011). The crisis hit the press when a dozen of business leaders in Wenzhou fled overseas to hide from high-interest loans (Naughton, 2012). This crisis shows that financial resources are not being efficiently managed in some regions of China and that regional financial efficiency needs to be improved. Thus, it is critical to effectively allocate regional financial resources and strengthen the operation of the entire economy system in China.

In general, prior research on financial efficiency has used two types of samples, namely, country-level data and bank-level data. On the one hand, several studies have used country-level data to compare financial efficiencies among different countries (Andries, 2011; Borovicka, 2007; Pastor, Pérez, &#38; Quesada, 1997; Ruthenberg &#38; Elias, 1996; Weill, 2003). However, these studies are restricted by sample size (i.e., the number of countries) and exchange rate issues (Hasan, Koetter, &#38; Wedow, 2009). On the other hand, research has used samples of banks and branches to analyze financial efficiency (Berger, Hasan, &#38; Zhou, 2009; Chen, Skully, &#38; Brown, 2005; Heffernana &#38; Fu, 2010). However, their results are susceptible to the influence of the characteristics of various banks and branches, which may not prefectly reflect financial efficiency.

Therefore, in this study, we aim to use the intermediate level data (i.e., county-level panel data) to explore the regional financial efficiency of China. Specifically, first, county is a fundamental administrative unit in China, and thus can be considered as a representative region. In total, there are 2070 counties in China (including county-level cities), covering over 95 percent
 of the national territory. County-level finance is the basis of the macro-level state finance, as well as the integration of the financial activities of micro-level banks and branches in China. Second, China is the largest developing country in the world, which is currently faced with industrial transition and upgrade, and is in great need for financial resources. The successful practice and experience of China in regional finance will be of significant value to other developing countries or emerging economies which share many characteristics in common with China.

Choosing appropriate evaluation methodsis critical in the assessment of regional financial efficiency. According to Berger and Humphrey (1997), two major types of methods can be used to evaluate financial efficiency: non-parametric frontier approaches and parametric frontier approaches. Non-parametric frontier approaches cannot perform statistical inferences to analyze financial efficiency and its determinants, while parametric frontier approaches can resolve this issue, but they cannot separate technical change from the change in technical efficiency. For example, traditional stochastic frontier approaches are appropriate for the evaluation of static financial efficiency (i.e., the performance of financial institutions at single points in time). However, they cannot evaluate financial efficiency dynamically (e.g., financial institutions may adjust their financial strategies over time). In addition, a relationship between inputs and outputs of financial efficiency exists in certain financial ecological environments. Thus, to accurately evaluate financial efficiency, environmental variables must also be taken into account, which is useful to identify frontiers (Dietsch &#38; Lozano-Vivas, 2000).

As an improvement of traditional stochastic frontier approaches, Desli, Ray, and Kumbhakar (2003) develop a dynamic stochastic frontier model, which can address all these issues above. However, they neither provide an estimation method for the dynamic stochastic frontier model, nor conduct an empirical test of the model. Therefore, the contribution of this research is twofold. First, on the basis of Desli et al. (2003), we propose a dynamic stochastic frontier model for the evaluation of regional financial efficiency, and provide an estimation method and an empirical test of the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Desli et al. (2003)’s dynamic stochastic frontier model to evaluate regional financial efficiency, which makes a contribution to the literature of financial efficiency. Second, the findings yield insights into how developing countries and emerging economies can improve regional financial efficiency.

The rest of this article proceeds as follows: In the next section, we provide a review of the related literature. Then, we present a dynamic stochastic frontier model to evaluate regional financial efficiency. Next, we present the data and corresponding statistical tests and provide a detailed discussion of the empirical results. In the final section, we discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our results, provide the limitations of the study, and offer directions for further research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The paper is related to a large body of literature in financial efficiency, which is summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the literature can be divided into three major categories: (1) the approaches used to evaluate the efficiency of financial institutions; (2) the determinants of financial institution efficiency; and (3) the financial efficiency of Chinese commercial banks.

A comprehensive review of the literature in the first category is provided by Berger and Humphrey (1997). Among the 122 articles they survey, 69 use nonparametric frontier approaches, and 60 use parametric frontier approaches; several articles also use both approaches. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a representative nonparametric frontier approach, and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) is a representative parametric frontier approach. DEA has been widely used to evaluate the efficiency of financial institutions (Ataullah, Cockerill, &#38; Le, 2004; Bhattacharyya, Lovell, &#38; Sahay, 1997; Dekker &#38; Post, 2001; Drake &#38; Hall, 2003; Oral &#38; Yolalan, 1990; Pasiouras, 2008; Pastor et al., 1997; Ray &#38; Das, 2010; Saha &#38; Ravisankar, 2000; Sathye, 2001; Schaffnit, Rosen, &#38; Paradi, 1997; Sherman &#38; Rupert, 2006; Soteriou &#38; Zenios, 1999; Thompson, Brinkmann, Dharmapala, GonzalezLima, &#38; Thrall, 1997; Tortosa-Ausina, Grifell-Tatje, Armero, &#38; Conesa, 2008; Yang, Wong, Xu, Liu, &#38; Steuer, 2010; Yudistira, 2004). DEA is appropriate for the analysis of small samples (Maudos, Pastor, Pérez, &#38; Quesada, 2002) and does not need to assume the explicit specification of the form of efficiency frontier functions (Pasiouras, 2008; Tecles &#38; Tabak, 2010). However, DEA models attribute all deviations from production frontiers to technical inefficiency and do not consider measurement error in constructing frontiers (Berger &#38; Humphrey, 1997). Thus, with DEA, no statistical inferences can be made to analyze financial institution efficiency and its corresponding determinants.




Studies have also used SFA as a typical parametric frontier approach to analyze the efficiency of financial institutions (Battaglia et al., 2010; Behr, 2010; Bhattacharyya et al., 1997; Fang et al., 2011; Feng &#38; Zhang, 2012; Tecles &#38; Tabak, 2010). Compared with the DEA method, SFA assumes an explicit model for the underlying production relationship and allows for inefficiencies and random errors. SFA models also permit deviations from production frontiers to be attributed to both technical inefficiency and measurement error (Ondrich &#38; Ruggiero, 2001). SFA can also be used to make statistical inferences to further analyze financial institution efficiency and associated predictors. Thus, SFA is more appropriate than DEA in terms of model assumptions and applications (Kumbhakar, 1987, 1990). However, static SFA models do not consider the “time delay” effect in financial systems, which could yield large random errors. In this research, we use Desli et al.’s (2003) dynamic stochastic frontier model to assess financial institution efficiency.

From the methodological perspective, this study is closely related to Tsionas (2006), which uses a dynamic stochastic frontier model to evaluate the financial efficiency of American commercial banks. However, our work differs from Tsionas (2006) in the following four aspects. First, Tsionas (2006) focuses on the micro level financial efficiency (i.e., commercial banks), whereas the main focus of this study is on the intermediate level regional financial efficiency. Second, for the model setup, Tsionas (2006) considers a first-order autoregressive model with the logarithm of the error term, whereas this study considers a first-order autoregressive model with the error term based on Desli et al. (2003)’s theoretical framework. Third, Tsionas (2006) applies Bayesian methods organized around Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for parameter estimations, whereas this research uses the medium optimization method for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. Fourth, Tsionas (2006) considers the impact of relatively few factors (e.g., logarithm of assets and its square) on financial efficiency, whereas this study considers the effect of a variety of systematic factors (e.g., the number of financial institutions, the regional GDP, etc.) on regional financial efficiency.

The second category focuses on the determinants of financial institution efficiency. As shown in Table 1, the literature documents two major types of factors: input–output measures of financial institutions and environmental variables. Research has used two approaches to determine the input–output measures of financial institutions—namely, the “production” approach and the “intermediation” approach (Berger &#38; Humphrey, 1997; Kao &#38; Liu, 2014; Miller &#38; Noulas, 1996; Pasiouras, 2008). Both approaches view labor and capital as the input (Drake, 2001; Rezvanian &#38; Mehdian, 2002). Furthermore, for both approaches, a commonly used measure of the output is total loans (Berger &#38; Humphrey, 1991; Casu &#38; Molyneux, 2003; Lozano-Vivas et al., 2001; Maudos et al., 2002; Mukherjee et al., 2001), but such studies typically do not take the quality of bank loans into account. If loan quality is poor (e.g., there is a non-performing loan problem), it will distort the outcome of financial institution efficiency by selecting loans as the output.

The previous literature has identified a variety of environmental variables that influence financial institution efficiency, including financial ownership (Berger et al., 2004; Borovicka, 2007; Fries &#38; Taci, 2005; Liu &#38; Zhang, 2009; Weill, 2003), the size of financial institutions (Berger et al., 1993; Chen et al., 2005; Lin, Tsao, &#38; Yang, 2009; Tsai, Wu, &#38; Wang, 2011), external capital (Claessens et al., 2001; Laurenceson &#38; Qin, 2008), market conditions (Battaglia et al., 2010; Hahn, 2005; Pasiouras &#38; Kosmidou, 2007), gross domestic product (GDP) (Chunhachinda &#38; Li, 2010), interest rates (Drake et al., 2006), and exchange rates (Moshirian, 2001). More specifically, there are mixed findings for the effects of financial ownership and the size of financial institutions on financial efficiency. For example, research documents that private banks are more financially efficient than state-owned banks (Berger et al., 2004; Fries &#38; Taci, 2005; Liu &#38; Zhang, 2009), whereas private banks do not necessarily perform better than other banks in the German financial market (Altunbas, Evans, &#38; Molyneux, 2001). Similarly, several studies have shown that large banks have higher financial efficiency than small banks (Berger et al., 1993; Chen et al., 2005; Tsai et al., 2011), whereas small city banks perform slightly better than their large counterparts in China (Lin et al., 2009).

Finally, our work is also related to the literature that studies financial efficiency of Chinese commercial banks. Specifically, using the panel data of 14 Chinese listed commercial banks from 1999 to 2008, Luo et al. (2011) employ both the DEA and SFA models to show that the financial efficiency level of Chinese commercial banks had significantly improved during this period. By investigating 43 Chinese banks during the 1993–2000 period, Chen et al. (2005) find that large-scale state-owned banks and small-scale banks yielded higher financial efficiency levels than medium-scale banks. Berger et al. (2009) analyze the bank efficiency in China from 1993 to 2003 and suggest that minority foreign ownership increases Chinese bank efficiency. Similar result has been found in Liu and Zhang (2009) and Asmild and Matthews (2012), showing that state-owned banks generally were less efficient in China. On the basis of a stochastic distance function approach, Jiang et al. (2009) indicate that compared to state-owned banks of China, Chinese-foreign joint-equity banks had higher efficiency levels during the 1995–2005 period. In this study, we develop a dynamic stochastic frontier model to evaluate the regional financial efficiency in China, which makes a contribution to this stream of literature.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

The process involving financial activities that transform various inputs into outputs is generally dynamic and complicated. Therefore, it is not appropriate to examine financial processes and explore the relationship between financial inputs and outputs from a static perspective. In addition, doing so may create more random errors in the evaluation of financial efficiency without considering environmental variables of the financial systems. To address these issues, in this study, we propose a dynamic theoretical framework to evaluate financial efficiency, which incorporates inputs (independent variables), outputs (dependent variables), environmental variables (control variables), and the time delay effect of related variables. This dynamic framework constitutes an extension of the traditional static analytical framework by relaxing model assumptions, and thus it can better describe the operations of financial systems.

                        where the subscript i denotes the county (i = 1, 2,…, N) and t denotes the year (t = 1, 2,…, T). Note that Desli et al. (2003) use the constant term αi
                        . In this study, to save the degree of freedom, we assume that all the counties share the same constant term (i.e., αi
                         
= 
α, for all i = 1, 2,…, N). More specifically, by following the related literature discussed previously, we use financial and economic value-added (fevait
                        ) to represent the output (Aizenman, Pinto, &#38; Sushko, 2013; Neusser &#38; Kugler, 1998), which is measured by the value added by financial institutions directly to the economy through the compensation of employees, the operating surplus, the depreciation of fixed capital, and the taxes less subsidies on production (Everett, McNeill, &#38; Phelan, 2013; Park, 2013). We choose the number of employees in the financial industry (laborit
                        ) and the total assets of financial institutions (assetit
                        ) to measure the inputs of labor and asset, in line with prior research (e.g., Berger &#38; Humphrey, 1991; Casu &#38; Molyneux, 2003; Drake, 2001; Hancock, 1991; Mukherjee et al., 2001). Accordingly, fevai,t
                           −
                           1
                         represents the one-year delay output, and labori,t

                           1
                         and asseti,t

                           1
                         represent the one-year delay labor input and asset input, respectively. Among the environmental variables, financial ownership is an important factor. However, specifying financial ownership in regional financial systems is challenging and also lacks practical significance. Accordingly, we do not use financial ownership as an environmental variable in this study. Conversely, the number of financial institutions (AGENCYit
                        ) is an indicator of the density of financial networks and thus can influence financial efficiency (Fraser, Phillips, &#38; Rose, 1974; Kaufman, Mote, &#38; Rosenblum, 1984). For example, the previous literature suggests that the number of banks and branches is an explanatory variable of bank efficiency (Fraser et al., 1974) and positively associated with the quality of financial services (Okeahalam, 2008). Gross domestic product (GDPit
                        ) reflects the degree of economic growth and has an impact on financial efficiency (Chunhachinda &#38; Li, 2010). Interest rates play a role in financial efficiency because the difference between the deposit and loan interest rates (DLIRit
                        ) serves as the price indicator of financial assets and influences financial allocation efficiency (Drake et al., 2006). Another environmental variable is actually utilized foreign capital (FIit
                        ) that influences financial and economic value-added (Lu, Li, &#38; Wang, 2009; Ouyang &#38; Fu, 2012). Therefore, in this study, we use AGENCYit, GDPit, DLIRit
                         and FIit
                         as environmental variables. Finally, εit
                         is the random error term, and xit
                         is the term of technical inefficiency.

In addition, the term (yit
                         − δy
                        
                           i, t − 1) in Eq. (1) follows an MA (1) process, with (yit
                         − δy
                        
                           i, t − 1) ∈ ( − ∞, +∞) and xit
                         ∈ [0, +∞). In addition, the technical inefficiency term of the ith regional financial decision unit at time t is given by

As Desli et al. (2003) discuss, the dynamic panel data stochastic frontier model differs from the existing panel data models in three respects. First, the dynamic model allows the technical inefficiency in the previous period to affect the current output, which the traditional stochastic frontier models do not. Second, the dynamic model separates technical inefficiency from the time-invariant firm effect (αi
                        ), which some traditional stochastic frontier models consider time-invariant technical efficiency. Third, it enables us to separate technical change (i.e., ∂feva/∂t) from the change in technical efficiency (i.e., ΔTEit
                         = TEit
                         − TEi,t

                        ).

Although Desli et al. (2003) develop the dynamic panel data stochastic frontier model, they do not provide an empirical test of the model. Thus, we employ the dynamic stochastic frontier model to empirically examine regional financial efficiency based on county-level panel data in China. Specifically, we first solve the likelihood function of Eq. (1), use an appropriate approach to estimate the parameters in the likelihood function, and then assess technical efficiency. Following Desli et al. (2003), for a sample of N counties during a period of T, we can write the likelihood function of Eq. (1) as follows:

Note that the likelihood function in Eq. (4) can be maximized. This means that we can use the maximum likelihood estimation method to estimate the parameters in the function. However, because the likelihood function is highly non-linear and complicated, obtaining analytical solutions of the parameters to be estimated is challenging. Therefore, we use medium optimization to compute the likelihood function and derive the optimal solution for the estimation of parameters in the model and technical efficiency. Specifically, the algorithm for medium optimization is a quasi-Newton method called the “BFGS” method, and the step length is obtained by performing a one-dimensional search (i.e., cubic polynomial interpolation).

This study employs Chinese county-level data to empirically test the proposed dynamic stochastic frontier model for the evaluation of regional financial efficiency. In general, county-level financial institutions in China can be divided into the following five categories: branches of various major commercial banks, local rural commercial banks, small-scale local financial institutions (e.g., village and town banks, small loan companies, farmer fund unions), other non-bank financial institutions (e.g., securities companies, insurance companies), and other financial agencies (e.g., pawn shops, institutions offering financial guarantees).

Our sample is a panel that contains financial input and output data of 62 Chinese counties during the 2001–2010 period. As mentioned previously, obtaining county-level data is more difficult than obtaining national-level or province-level data. As a result, we collected the data through multiple databases and the county websites. The sources of the panel data mainly include the county yearbooks, the website of the County Bureau of Statistics, the County Statistics Bulletin of the National Economic and Social Development from 2001 to 2010, the Statistical Database of China Economic and Social Development, and the Rural Finance Distribution Charts by China Banking Regulatory Commission.


                        Table 2
                        presents the geographic distribution of the counties in the sample. In total, we collect the data of 62 counties, which cover the six major regions of China. Specifically, the sample consists of 14 counties in the Pearl River Delta area, 16 in the central area, 14 in the Yangtze River Delta area, 2 in the western area, 4 in the area surrounding the Bohai Sea, and 3 in the Northeast area. As such, we take into account the different levels of economic development across the regions to some extent, providing a representative sample of county-level financial data in China.





                        Table 3
                        reports the descriptive statistics of the sample in terms of the financial input and output variables. As Table 3 shows, on average, the financial and economic value-added (feva) is 481.366 million CNY, with a minimum of 4.08 million CNY and a maximum of 7212.4 million CNY. Similarly, the number of employees in the financial industry (labor) varies from 192 to 4767, with an average of 1237. The average of the total assets of financial institutions is 51,341.78 million CNY, with a minimum of 569.66 million CNY and a maximum of 522,000 million CNY.




Because of the long time span, we need to consider the influence of inflation on the data. Accordingly, we made some adjustments in terms of inflation on the original data. Specifically, we use the Consumer Purchasing Index of China to eliminate the impact of inflation on financial and economic value-added (feva), the total assets of financial institutions (asset), and county-level GDP, and we use the US inflation rate to deal with actually utilized foreign capital (FI). In addition, to mitigate the effect of heteroskedasticity and the difference in the magnitude on the empirical results, we take the logarithm value of all the variables in the model, except the number of financial institutions (AGENCY), the difference between the deposit and loan interest rates (DLIR), and the time (t). We also take the differential values of those variables, including the financial and economic value-added (feva), the number of employees in the financial industry (labor), the total assets of financial institutions (asset), and the number of financial institutions (AGENCY). Thus, we calculate actual data from 2002 to 2010, after taking differential values of corresponding variables.

SFA is essentially an econometric regression approach. When developing a stochastic frontier model, it is necessary to perform stationarity tests of input and output variables to avoid pseudo-regression. In this study, we conduct the panel unit root tests by using four types of tests: the Levin, Lin, and Chu t-test; the Im, Pesaran, and Shin W-test; the ADF-Fisher chi-square test; and the PP-Fisher chi-square test (Levin, Lin, &#38; James Chu, 2002). Table 4
                        presents the results of the panel unit root tests.




The results from Table 4 indicate that all four tests reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity. This implies that all three variables, including the financial and economic value-added, the number of employees in financial institutions, and total assets of financial institutions, are of zero-order integration. Therefore, the panel data are stationary.

The methods of panel cointegration tests can be divided into two major categories. The first category is based on Engle and Granger two-step estimation procedure (e.g., Kao test, Pedroni test), and the second category is based on Johansen test for cointegration. To examine the cointegration relationship between fevait
                         and laborit
                        , we first conduct the Kao test and Pedroni test and then perform the Johansen test. The results appear in Tables 5
                        and 6
                        , respectively. As the tables show, among the 62 counties, a cointegration relationship exists between the financial and economic value-added and the number of employees in the financial industry.





                        Tables 7
                        and 8
                        present the results from the Kao and Pedroni tests and the Johansen test for the cointegration relationship between fevait
                         and assetit
                        , respectively. Similarly, as the tables show, the results suggest that a cointegration relationship also exists between the financial and economic value-added and the total assets of financial institutions. In summary, we can avoid the pseudo-regression problem in the evaluation of regional financial efficiency by using the dynamic panel data stochastic frontier model.

We use the MATLAB software to code the empirically model and derive parameters to be estimated (N = 62, T = 9 in our sample). Table 9
                        presents the results of the parameter estimations in the dynamic stochastic frontier model. In addition, to compare the dynamic stochastic frontier model and the traditional static stochastic frontier model, we employ Battese and Coelli's (1995) framework to build a static stochastic frontier model to evaluate financial efficiency as follows:

                        , is defined by the truncation of the normal distribution with zero mean and variance σ2 and the definitions of other terms are the same as those in the dynamic model. The results of the comparisons appear in Table 9.

                        . When γ approaches 0, the gap between the actual output and the maximum producible output is mainly attributed to noise error caused by uncontrollable variables. Under this scenario, we can simply use the ordinary least squares method to obtain parameter estimates, rather than stochastic frontier methods. In contrast, when γ approaches 1, the gap between the actual output and the maximum producible output is mainly due to the technical inefficiency term xit
                        . Thus, it is appropriate to use stochastic frontier models for parameter estimations with larger values of γ. As Table 9
                        shows, the value of γ is 0.566 and 0.900 in the dynamic and static stochastic frontier models, respectively. This indicates that in both models, the technical inefficiency term can explain the majority of the variation in the model.

For the dynamic stochastic frontier model, the convergence of parameter estimations is determined by the value of gradient; that is, the closer the gradient is to 0, the better is the convergence of the model. The values of the gradients are all nearly 0 in Table 9, indicating that the convergence of parameter estimations is quite good for the dynamic stochastic frontier model. With respect to the static stochastic frontier model, the results of the t-tests show that the majority of parameter estimates are statistically significant, except for the estimate of an input variable (i.e., the number of employees in financial institutions). Therefore, the dynamic stochastic frontier model provides a better fit to the data than its static counterpart.

In the dynamic stochastic frontier model, the coefficients of GDPit
                         and DLIRit
                         are both positive (i.e., the model improves regional financial efficiency by increasing the volume of GDP and properly enlarging the difference between the deposit and loan interest rates). The coefficient of time (t) is positive, implying that technical change contributes to the improvement of regional financial efficiency to some extent. However, the number of financial institutions (AGENCYit
                        ) has a negative coefficient. This suggests that it is not useful to improve regional financial efficiency in China by expanding the size of the financial network; instead, it is more important to enhance and innovate finance services. Finally, the coefficient of foreign investment (FIit
                        ) is negative, which is surprising. A possible explanation is that to show their political achievements within a short period, many local governments in China choose to blindly introduce weakly profitable projects from foreign countries. To initiate these projects, local authorities usually require that regional financial institutions provide corresponding supportive loans. When these unprofitable projects fail, regional financial institutions have difficulty recalling the loans successfully, which in turn hurts regional financial efficiency.

As discussed previously, prior research has mainly focused on evaluating static financial efficiency (i.e., financial efficiency evaluated from the static stochastic frontier model). No research has applied Desli et al. (2003)’s dynamic stochastic frontier model to empirically measure dynamic financial efficiency. Table 10 reports the descriptive statistics of the dynamic and static financial efficiency in the 62 counties of China. On average, the dynamic financial efficiency level was 95.0 percent
, and the static financial efficiency level was 90.3 percent
. Paired t-tests revealed a significant difference between the dynamic and static financial efficiency (p 
< 
0.001). More specifically, among the 62 counties, the average dynamic financial efficiency was approximately 4.7 percent
 greater than the average static financial efficiency (i.e., the traditional static stochastic frontier approach underestimated county-level financial efficiency). This result is not surprising because the dynamic stochastic frontier approach assumes that the counties with technical inefficiency can adjust the determinants of technical inefficiency on the basis of their past business operating experiences. Consequently, in general, the determinants of technical inefficiency will continuously improve, which leads to relatively higher levels of financial efficiency.





                        Fig. 1
                        depicts the average dynamic and static financial efficiency in each year from 2002 to 2010. The figure shows a difference in the trend of the average dynamic and static financial efficiency among the 62 counties. Both the dynamic and the static financial efficiency fluctuate over time. However, the underlying causes of the fluctuations are different for the two variables. As mentioned previously, by incorporating technical change into the model, the dynamic stochastic frontier approach can separate technical change from the change in technical efficiency. In contrast, in the traditional stochastic frontier approaches, the change in financial efficiency consists of two components: technical change and the change in technical efficiency. However, the traditional static methods are not able to distinguish the two items. For example, although it might be assumed that an increase in static financial efficiency is caused by an increase in technical efficiency, it is instead attributed to the combining effects of technical progress and a decrease in technical efficiency. That is, no conclusions can unfold from the trend of static financial efficiency over time. Therefore, the results from the dynamic approach can describe the change in financial efficiency more accurately.


                        Fig. 2
                        presents the average financial efficiency across the six major regions of China. As the figure shows, the county-level financial efficiency was relatively high in the Pearl River Delta area, the Yangtze River Delta area, and the area surrounding the Bohai Sea because these regions are fairly well developed and prosperous. In contrast, the financial efficiency is relatively low in the Northeast area, the central area, and the western area. This result is consistent with the graphical distribution of economic growth in China.

As discussed previously, one advantage of the dynamic stochastic frontier model is that it can separate technical change from the change in technical efficiency. Specifically, technical change is measured by the term ∂feva/∂t (i.e., the estimated coefficient of the variable t in the model). Accordingly, technical change of the financial activities in the 62 counties is given by ∂feva/∂t = 0.0055, meaning that a positive 0.55 percent technical change was achieved annually. This indicates that financial activities in the 62 counties were in a good shape from 2002 to 2010 and technical progress contributed to the improvement in financial efficiency to some extent. The change in technical efficiency is measured by the term TEit
                         − TEi,t−1
                        . According to the analysis in the previous section, we can readily obtain the change in technical efficiency. Fig. 3
                        illustrates the change in the annual technical efficiency among the six major regions of China.

As Fig. 3 shows, the change in technical efficiency of financial activities differs among the 62 counties in the six major regions of China (e.g., the change in technical efficiency could increase or decrease during the entire period). Specifically, the change in technical efficiency of financial activities fluctuates considerably in the western area, indicating a high level of uncertainty in the county-level financial growth in that area. In the northeast area, other than the remarkable fluctuations in 2005 and 2006, the change in technical efficiency is relatively small. The change in financial efficiency only slightly varies for the remaining four areas. This further suggests that the efficiency of financial institutions is influenced by both technical change and the change in technical efficiency. Therefore, to evaluate financial efficiency accurately, it is important to separate technical change from the change in technical efficiency.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This article develops a dynamic stochastic frontier model to evaluate regional financial efficiency in China by using panel data of 62 counties. By first applying a dynamic stochastic frontier model to an empirical evaluation of regional financial efficiency, this article contributes to the literature on financial efficiency in the following three ways. First, the previous research in financial efficiency focuses on the macro-level financial industry and its interaction with economic growth, or the micro-level financial institutions. In addition, few papers study financial efficiency through a dynamic stochastic frontier model, except Tsionas (2006). In this study, on the basis of Desli et al. (2003)’s dynamic stochastic frontier model, we propose a theoretical framework to evaluate the intermediate level regional financial efficiency, which enriches the literature on the evaluation of financial efficiency.

Second, our results show that the dynamic stochastic frontier model can better reflect the actual changes in financial efficiency than the traditional static model. Though the parameters of the two models share consistent economic implications, there is a certain difference in parameter estimations between them. This is because the production function adopted in the static stochastic frontier analysis method may not match the real one well, for example, in the static method, efficiency in one period is not allowed to be affected by that from the past (Desli et al., 2003). By contrast, the dynamic stochastic frontier analysis method allows an inefficient firm to correct its inefficiency from the past (Desli et al., 2003). In addition, the dynamic stochastic frontier model not only involves the non-market factors, but also considers the delay effect of the time variable. Thus, the dynamic stochastic frontier model can provide a better evaluation of regional financial efficiency. In this study, we employ both the dynamic and static stochastic frontier models to evaluate the regional financial efficiency in China. Though the majority of the parameters are shown to be statistically significant in the static model, the coefficient of a key variable (i.e., labor) is not significant. In contrast, the dynamic stochastic frontier model can yield a better estimation of the production function by separating technical change from the change in technical efficiency.

Third, our results make a contribution to the evaluation of financial efficiency in emerging economies. Financial efficiency is influenced by both the internal and external environmental factors of a financial system. Different from the financial industries in the mature market of developed countries, emerging economies such as China, face an immature market. For emerging economies, there exist non-market factors in the market, e.g., the government gets involved in the financial market, borrowers are organized (Stiglitz, 1989; Stiglitz &#38; Weiss, 1981). It is difficult for the financial efficiency in emerging economies to reach the Pareto optimum completely through the immature market. Therefore, to better assess financial efficiency in emerging economies, this study considers a number of environmental variables, such as the number of financial institutions, the regional GDP, foreign investment, the difference between the deposit and loan interest rates, etc. By incorporating those “Chinese elements” into the model, our results suggest that there is a gradient difference in regional financial efficiency of China. The financial efficiency level is relatively high in the Pearl River Delta area, Yangtze River Delta area and the area surrounding Bo Sea, and relatively low in the Northeast area, Central area and Western area.

Our results offer several practical implications for the development and innovation of regional financial services in China, other developing countries, and emerging economies. First, as the largest developing country in the world, China is in the middle of industrial transition and upgrade, and needs strong support from financial institutions. The results of regional financial efficiency in this study are conducive to the understanding of the current status of financial activities among different regions and the future growth of financial industry in China. In addition, this research provides directions to the authorities of China for the reform of financial industry. Second, the model incorporates the impact of various environmental variables on financial efficiency, which yields insights into how the authorities can improve the financial environment. For example, we find that the difference between the deposit and loan interest rates is positively associated with regional financial efficiency. This suggests that the authorities of China can stimulate the initiative of regional financial institutions and improve the regional financial efficiency by appropriately increasing the difference between the deposit and loan interest rates. Third, our results offer managerial implications to potential foreign investors, especially foreign financial institutions that plan to launch in China. For example, by taking the results of this study into account, they may be able to make better decisions in terms of branch locations.

This study has several limitations. First, we use a sample of 62 counties in China for the empirical study. The sample size is relatively small considering the total number of counties in China, though the sample is representative insofar as it is in line with the principle of statistical sampling. Second, in this study, regional financial efficiency mainly focuses on technical efficiency and does not take into account economy of scale. Further research could evaluate regional financial efficiency by considering both technical efficiency and scale efficiency.
