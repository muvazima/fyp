                  The problem of integrating the rotational vector from a given angular velocity vector is met in such diverse fields as the navigation, robotics, computer graphics, optical tracking and non-linear dynamics of flexible beams. For example, if the numerical formulation of non-linear dynamics of flexible beams is based on the interpolation of curvature, one needs to derive the rotation from the assumed curvature field. The relation between the angular velocity and the rotation is described by the first-order quasi-linear differential equation. If the rotation is given, the related angular velocity is obtained by the differentiation. By contrast, if the angular velocity is given, the related rotations are obtained by the integration. The exact closed-form solution for the rotation is only possible if the angular velocity is constant in time. In dynamics of non-linear flexible spatial beams, the problem of integrating rotations from a given angular velocity becomes even more complex because both the angular velocity and the curvature need simultaneously be integrated and are both functions of space and time.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The problem of integrating the rotational vector from a given time-dependent angular velocity vector is met in such diverse fields as the navigation, robotics, computer graphics, and dynamics of rigid bodies. For example, in a strapdown inertial navigation system [1–5], the body-fixed gyroscopes measure the instantaneous angular velocity of a space vehicle, which is on-line numerically integrated to obtain the instantaneous coordinate transformation matrix between the body-fixed and the spatial coordinate systems needed to establish the attitude of the vehicle. Obviously, having an accurate, stable and computationally efficient integration is vital in controlling the spatial position of such systems in flight. The same integration problem must be solved in real-time optical tracking of a human body motion, which is related to problems in robotics and computer graphics [6,7].

A further significant example is met in computational structural mechanics in the study of non-linear dynamics of flexible beams if the numerical formulation is based on the interpolation of curvature as in, e.g. [8,9]. There one needs to derive the rotation from the assumed curvature field when given in terms of the arc-length parameter. This is essentially the same problem as described above, because the differential equations for both the angular velocity and the curvature in terms of the rotation are formally the same.

The relation between the angular velocity (or curvature) and the rotation is described by the first-order quasi-linear differential equation. When the rotation is a given function, the related angular velocity (or curvature) is obtained by the differentiation. When the angular velocity (or curvature) is given, the related rotations must be obtained by the integration. The exact closed-form solution for the rotation is possible for angular velocities and curvatures, respectively, only if some further conditions are satisfied; e.g. if the angular velocity is constant in time. An alternative solution in terms of an infinite series is known for any analytic angular velocity (or curvature), see, e.g. [1,10]. Such a solution is computationally inefficient. Various numerical time-integration schemes have been introduced and their performance discussed, see, e.g. [11,12] or [13,10] for the references related to the structural mechanics problems. In [14] it is investigated how the choice of the parametrization of rotations effects accuracy and computational efficiency of various numerical time-integration schemes by comparing three different rotation parameterizations, i.e. the rotational vector [15,16,8], the Argyris tangential vector [15] and the rotational quaternion [17], if combined with two alternative midpoint rules [13,14] or the classical fifth-order Runge–Kutta method. Andrle and Crassidis [11] employ the Crouch–Grossman geometric methods and compare their results with the Runge–Kutta algorithms. Chiou et al. [12] developed a family of general high-order numerical time integrators that exactly preserve the constraint of the rotational quaternion.

In dynamics of non-linear flexible spatial beams, the problem of integrating rotations from a given angular velocity becomes even more complex because both the angular velocity and the curvature need simultaneously be integrated and both are functions of independent variables x and t. As the angular velocity and the curvature are assumed to be analytic functions, they must satisfy certain integrability conditions to assure that the unique rotation is obtained from the two differential equations. Our objective here is thus to derive approximate yet closed-form solutions of the following problem: for a given curvature vector dependent on two variables, x and t, determine both the rotation and the angular velocity. In order to avoid the singularity of the kinematic relations [15,18], the quaternions are used for the parametrization of rotations in the present paper, and the integrations are partly performed in the four-dimensional quaternion space. The resulting closed-form expressions for the rotational and angular velocity quaternions could be used in refined, finite-element type of numerical formulations of the dynamics of flexible spatial beams as the interpolating functions.

Quaternions have recently often been discussed in structural mechanics literature, see, e.g. [19,20,17], so that only equations essential for the present study are given. A systematic presentation of quaternions can be found elsewhere [21,22].

                     This shows that both the left and the right multiplication with the unit quaternion represent the rotation of a quaternion in 4D. The resulting quaternions are not pure quaternions, however.

Similarly, the 3D rotation of a vector must result in a 3D vector whose length is preserved. Consequently, if a vector

                     , it should remain such in the rotated position. Hence, the 4D rotation of a pure quaternion should result in a pure quaternion. By performing explicit multiplications it can be shown that the following composition of two subsequent multiplications with the unit quaternion

                        Note that the variables in Eq. (36) are columns and matrices in the 3D space. Eq. (36) constitutes a quasi-linear inhomogeneous system of three scalar differential equations of the first order for

                        We must note that the integrals in Eq. (39) are generally not analytically solvable and are hence here solved numerically using the 2-point Gaussian integration. The second integral represents a nested integral with a running lower bound. It is evaluated for two lower bounds which are chosen as Gaussian integration points in interval

The above result for the angular velocity follows, if the curvature is given. When the angular velocity is given, the fully analogous derivation results in the solution for the curvature which is formally the same as the one presented in Eq. (39). As it can be constructed by analogy, we do not display it here.

The complete similarity between Eqs. (9) and (13) may suggest that the functional forms of the angular velocity and the curvature are the same. The solution (39) does not confirm this. If the curvature is, e.g. a linear function of x, the angular velocity appears to be some non-linear function of t.

The proposed approximate solutions (28), (29) and (39) will now be employed to test their validity, accuracy and stability. We will discuss both the integration of the rotational quaternion and the integration of the angular velocity from the given curvature.

In order to assess the present approximate solution (28), we choose an analytical expression for the rotational vector,

                         is not analytically integrable or is its analytical integral inefficient for the evaluation. To overcome accuracy and/or efficiency problems, we here employ the Gaussian numerical integration of an appropriate degree. The 2-point Gaussian integration is employed here since the curvature functions used in the subsequent numerical tests are only low-order functions within an integration step, although not necessarily polynomials. As it will become clear later on, this gives very satisfactory results.

                           Fig. 1 shows that the components of the rotational quaternion related to a constant curvature are simple harmonic functions of x. The figure compares the exact and the present results. They agree completely. This is to be expected because solution (28) is, for the present case of the constant curvature, exact for any step size. Thus any error could only occur due to machine round-off errors. This is also demonstrated in Table 1, where the maximum global errors in the rotational quaternion and all its components are shown to be smaller than

                           , 0.1 and 0.01. Note that the global round-off errors are generally about one order of magnitude larger for the smallest step size which is due to a substantially larger number of steps. One may observe from Fig. 2 that the absolute global errors in the quaternion components oscillate nearly periodically about the mean error where the period is roughly equal to 0.7 if 
                              
                                 Δ

                           . The period appears to be about the same for all quaternion components. This pattern of error behaviour is observed in all the subsequent numerical tests. Because our primary aim is to assess maximum errors, Fig. 3 depicts the evolution of the maximum global errors in the form of maximum envelopes. This form will, in what follows, become our standard to presenting the evolution of errors.

The graphs in Fig. 5 show the evolution of the maximum envelopes of the global errors in the rotational quaternion components and in the norm of the rotational quaternion. The general trend of errors is similar as in the previous numerical test, showing that the maximum global error soon remains nearly constant. This indicates the method’s good potential in solving long-range problems.

                            show the maximum envelopes of the global integration errors in the rotational quaternion components and

                           . It is clear that the maximum error envelopes of both the single components and the whole quaternion stay practically constant. This is a very desired property in solving long-range problems.

The accompanying Fig. 10
                            shows the maximum envelopes of the global errors in quaternion components and its norm. It can again be observed that the envelopes of the maximum errors remain practically constant with increasing x. The actual global errors of particular components of the rotational quaternion may, however, substantially differ for different x’s. This is also apparent from the results in [10].

The advantages of using the closed-form formula, Eq. (28), are that it automatically preserves the unity of the rotational quaternion and considers changing of the curvature within an integration step which both improve accuracy of the solution. Its less desired property is a higher computational demand. By contrast, the quaternion-based midpoint integration method, introduced and tested in [14], is computationally efficient in a step, yet it is less accurate globally and does not preserve orthogonality by the definition. Now we compare the two methods and the well known Crouch–Grossman methods [25,26] in their behaviour.

Let us assume that the curvature quaternion is the following linear function of x:

The results in Table 5
                            indicate that the maximum global error in the rotational quaternion norm exhibited by the MP-q method is very small for any step size, while the errors in particular components are large; in fact, they are much larger than those experienced by the EM4 method, see Table 6
                           . Recall also that the EM4 method is computationally more demanding than MP-q; e.g. for the data in Tables 5 and 6, the ratio of computing times was about seven; for the data in Table 8, discussed in the next sub-section, the ratio was about 2.5.

                            for various step sizes and the two methods. One can see that the maximum global error of the MP-q method increases with x even for a very small step size,

                            of the MP-q method approaches value 2. As the norm of the total rotational quaternion is constrained to be one, such a solution is wrong. Note that an artificial, brute-force normalization of the rotational quaternion after completing each step, does not help much because the norm of the quaternion is very close to 1 already.

                           . Consequently, the associated curvature is also an oscillating function, but the quadratic polynomial dominates the overall behaviour. The graphs of the related exact rotational quaternion components are shown in Fig. 15
                           . Because the frequency of oscillations increases with x, and, consequently, the graphs are gradually getting blurred, only the part related to a smaller interval

                            is plotted in Fig. 15. Again, the graphs of the exact and the numerical solutions match nicely.

Several different classical numerical solution methods presented in [14] were shown to be unable to obtain the solution of the present case due to increasingly fast oscillations of rotations. Unless sufficiently small step sizes were applied in [14], the local error was large and, consequently, the global maximum error was growing until the solution became unstable. On the other hand, if the step sizes were too small, the round-off errors accumulated and the solution diverged as well.

Data in Table 7
                            show that the MP-q method may produce large errors in components, although the global error in the norm of the quaternion is very small. The critical components appear to be

                            approaches value 2 for any step size employed. Such a wrong value of the component occurs due to the horizontal stretching of the graphs, which is followed by loss of convergence. By contrast, the EM4 solution displayed in Table 8
                            is stable and the accuracy is well improved by the decrease of the step size. The behaviour of the two solutions is also illustrated in Fig. 16

It is clear from Fig. 16 that the MP-q method results in the graph which is substantially horizontally stretched even for a very small step size 0.0002. Due to the horizontal stretch, the locations of the pick values of the exact and the approximate solutions are different, although the magnitudes of the pick values of the two methods almost agree, i.e.

                            approaches 1, the error approaches 2. Note from the figure that the EM4 method follows the exact graph perfectly.

Convergence properties of the two methods are further displayed in the right figure of Fig. 14. As no improvement in accuracy is achieved, if the step size is decreased (see Table 7), the MP-q method yields a completely wrong result at

                           . The EM4 method, on the other side, shows the quadratic rate of convergence in terms of the absolute error.

                            and the two methods indicate that the maximum error of the EM4 method remains small over the whole range. The one of MP-q is initially small, too (less than

Next, the results of the present method are also compared with those of the third and fourth order Crouch–Grossman (CG) Lie group methods CG3 and CG4 [25,26]. These methods are constructed using the concepts of the Runge–Kutta methods on the Lie groups. For example, the CG3 method is a three-stage algorithm to obtain the rotational quaternion,

                           Obviously, the CG3 method requires the evaluation of three matrix exponentials and their multiplications and is thus computationally much more demanding than EM4. Similarly, the CG4 method is a five-step method whose coefficients are provided in, e.g. [11,26]. The detailed description of methods CG3 and CG4 is presented in [25,26]. Note that the CG3 and CG4 methods preserve the unit norm by the definition.

                            are depicted in Fig. 17. It is clear that the CG3 method performs about the same as the EM4 method for larger step sizes,

                            and 0.0002. These differences are even larger for method CG4 (Fig. 17). Note also that the present excellent result for the CG methods is not in keeping with the results of Andrle and Crassidis [11] who stated that both CG3 and CG4 suffer from a considerable round-off error accumulation.

Three tests will be performed to validate the formula assumed in Eq. (39) and to assess its accuracy. We start with the assumption that the rotational quaternion is a given function of x and t, so that the exact closed-form expressions for the curvature and the angular velocity quaternions can be derived. The exact curvature quaternion is then employed to obtain the approximate values of the rotational and angular velocity quaternions, which are then compared to the exact ones. In the last test, we assume that the curvature rather than the rotational quaternion is given and evaluate both the rotational and angular velocity quaternions only numerically.

                           One can observe the co-linearity of the above two quaternions which is due to the fixed rotation axis. The conditions (24) and (25) are hence identically satisfied, see discussion in Section 4.2, so that Eq. (39) will, with the present choice of the rotational quaternion, yield the exact solution. This is confirmed in a square domain

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In dynamics of flexible spatial beams, the rotation, angular velocity and curvature vectors depend on both x and t. When the solution procedure is curvature-based, as e.g. in [8,9], the rotational and angular velocity vectors need to be obtained by the integration of the interpolated curvature. The paper employs the quaternion description to obtain an approximate, yet closed-form solution for the rotational quaternion which preserves the unity constraint exactly and makes possible to account for the actual curvature variation over the integration interval. In some rare cases, e.g. if the curvature is constant in x (although it may be an arbitrary function of t), the solution for the rotational quaternion is exact.

The curvature and angular velocity vectors must satisfy certain integrability conditions to assure that the unique rotational quaternion is obtained. They have here been deduced and integrated approximately for the angular velocity as a function of the curvature. This closed form solution needs a nested integral to be evaluated numerically. The assumed interpolation for the curvature components, and the derived closed-form solutions for the rotational quaternion and the curvature vector may then be used as natural interpolations in a refined finite-element formulation of spatial beams.

An extensive numerical study has been carried out where the numerical results have also been compared with the exact ones for a variety of oscillating rotations. The present rotational quaternion integration method has also been compared with the quaternion-based midpoint integrator [14] and two geometric Runge–Kutta-type of integrators of Crouch and Grossman [25,26]. It is confirmed that the present method results in a perfect agreement with the exact graphs of the quaternion components and preserves the unity of the rotational quaternion for a wide range of integration steps and oscillating functions. The Crouch–Grossman integrators CG3 and CG4 behave much alike to the present integrator and offer better accuracy, but are computationally much more demanding. This is to be contrasted to the results of the less accurate quaternion-based midpoint integration method [14] where often a significant horizontal stretching of graphs is exhibited even for very small step sizes. It must be noted that the horizontal stretching represents the main reason for an early and sudden instability of the midpoint integrator. The comparisons have also proved the validity of the proposed procedure for the angular velocity integration.
