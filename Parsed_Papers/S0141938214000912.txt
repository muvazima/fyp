                  In this paper we investigated the accuracy of center-to-center distance perception in near field augmented reality visual targets viewed by stereoscopic glasses. One real and one virtual targets were presented in four layout or target orientations (two horizontal and two vertical, by altering the relative positions of real and virtual targets) at three different parallax conditions (on screen, 5cm from screen and 10cm from screen) and four levels of scaled between targets’ distance (10–20cm, 20–30cm, 30–40cm and 40–50cm). The result revealed overall underestimation with an accuracy of about 84%. Interestingly, it was noticed that the main effects of layout, parallax and center-to-center distance were significant. Generally, accuracy improves when targets put vertical, close to observers’ position and smaller separation of targets. Significant interactions among the three main factors were also reported. The results are of great importance as it provides guide for the developers to decide where to present targets depending on the need for relative accuracy of judgment. Some engineering implications of the result are also discussed in this paper.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the spectrum of 3D stereoscopic vision, augmented reality (AR) lies between viewing completely real and completely virtual objects. In completely immersive virtual environment, the real object is completely replaced by the virtual 3D image and observers could not see their physical environment around. Whereas, in augmented reality the virtual 3D image will be integrated into the physical environment so that both can coexist and can be created by combining the virtual and real world environment using either the optical or video approaches [1,2]. Unlike virtual reality, AR aims at supplementing reality instead of completely replacing it [2]. For Nicolau et al., [3] any AR would fall in one of the four systems; video-based, see-through, projection-based or tracking; depending on the display technology employed. In optical systems, synthetic images are overlaid on the real object while in videos approaches the real object’s real-time image is recorded and displayed to the user after mixed with the virtual image. Displays, trackers, and haptic and force feedback are basic hardware components required to realize the augmented environment. Head mounted displays (HMDs) are the oldest and most commonly used display devices. Different types of HMDs are commercially available. Some models provide cameras embed with sensors that continuously track head movement and update scenes accordingly. Other commercially available displays that can also support augmented reality are see-through optical (OST) or video (VST) HMDs [4]. Handheld display devices (HHD) are also used where mobility is required as recent applications sees promises of broad users [5]. Integrating augmented environment on physical elements reportedly improve performance of operators in many of applications such as medical [2,4], manufacturing [2,4], maintenance [2,6], annotation and visualization [2], robot routing [2,4], military [2,4] and entertainments [2,4]. The current advances in mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets gave another dimension to AR applications such as tourism and entertainment [1,5,7]. Together with security and privacy issues as in Google Glass, enhancing felt realism and brain and sensory perceptions remained to be challenges of the current technology in building augmented reality [1]. The aim of this study is to explore the accuracy of exocentric distance perception which is an important component of interaction in near field synthetic environment.

Kurkovsky et al., identified three major challenges in recent AR, especially for handheld devices [5]. These are accuracy of navigation and tracking, where the user’s location should continuously be updated where the current handheld devices such as Smartphone use the GPS information with Wifi and limited CPU capability; the content adding and programming that is not easy for ordinary users; and the limited usability of the technology to simple areas. Literature provides some solutions for each problem, however, it is still an active area of research where creative solutions continue to be proposed. So far, the interaction is not yet natural and effective as most of the techniques well established are in the 2D environment [7].

The second major problem reported in the literature is fatigue and visual discomfort associated with viewing stereoscopic images. Stereoscopic motion images was found to induce fatigue [8]. Kooi and Toet [9] suggested three binocular asymmetry driven discomforts; optics-related, filters-related and stereoscopic-related. Optics-related problems refer to the shift, rotation or resolutions associated to the displays used. Filters-related asymmetric problems arise from difference in luminance, contrast, color, accommodations, or crosstalk of right and left displays. The third that originates from accommodation–convergence or parallax-convergence mismatches is referred as stereoscopic-related discomfort. In their review, Lambooij et al. [10] found similar problems in stereoscopic vision, discussed as, temporally changing demands of accommodation–convergence linkage, 3D artefacts resulting from insufficient depth information, and unnatural blur. Reichelt et al. [11] focused on distance cue factors that would cause discomfort, and concluded that motion parallax and oculomotor cues of vergence and accommodation contributed the most when not consistently provided.

Another limitation reported in a few studies is distance perception. Generally, the distance perception space can be classified as egocentric or exocentric. In egocentric distances, the observer is used as the center of reference and the distance measurement is made between the observer and the target, whereas in exocentric space distances are measured between two targets in the environment other than the observer but the center of reference is still the observer [12]. Compared to real world, egocentric distance estimation is inaccurate in augmented reality [13–17] Corujeira and Oakley [16] compared distance perception of real objects with that viewed in HMDs and 3D stereo displays and found underestimation in all conditions, while the compression is reduced in HMD and 3D stereo when the targets are displayed at lower viewing height. Similarly, Dey et al. [18] conducted four experiments to study effect of AR X-ray and display (size and resolution) on egocentric distances for handheld devices. Their result showed overall distance compression and the error increases with distance. They also reported compression is less in mobile phones compared with tablet, whereas, no difference caused by presence of AR X-ray. Underestimation was also reported in few other studies such as in [19]. Kuparinen et al. [17] replicated the method used by Lappin et al. [20] in real world to evaluate distance perception in tablet-based AR, and revealed mixed results; overestimation and underestimation at 15m and 30m respectively. Interestingly, in Singh et al. [15] AR estimations were observed to be accurate in near field distance when blind reaching was employed. However, in the same study, perceptual matching results in slight overestimation for AR while real world estimates were accurate. In general, in the domain of augmented reality, majority of the literature seemed to report compression of egocentric distance compared to the accurate estimates in real world environment.

The aforementioned cases were in the egocentric space. As for exocentric distance perception, a good number of experiments have evaluated the real world environment, however, literature reported only a few experiments in the stereoscopic viewing scenario, and most of them were in completely immersive virtual environments categories [21–25]. Despite the fact that the studies so far were not conclusive, compression looked to dominate the outcomes [22,25]. However, it is not yet known if underestimation holds in augmented reality because there are very few studies published in the domain of AR that conduct experiments to evaluate the accuracy of exocentric distance perceptions. Only recently, the first study reported in this realm was by Dey et al. [18]. Out of several experiments in the study, the fourth experiment evaluated exocentric distance perception in iPhone and iPad displays, and found overall underestimation with less underestimation in iPhone display condition. Despite the fact that a number of egocentric distance results are available, to the best of authors’ knowledge, exocentric distance accuracy in wide screen displays where observers wear stereoscopic glasses, were not reported so far. And yet, in the emerging AR applications, the relationship between objects is an important feature that needs to be addressed, and hence exocentric information should be provided accurately [18]. Therefore, this study aimed to contribute to the knowledge gap in this area.

In this experiment, we investigated the effect of layout (targets’ orientation) and parallax (distance between screen and targets) on accuracy of exocentric distance judgment in augmented environment. The experiment also evaluated the effect of between targets’ distance. The experimental tasks and protocols were defined under near field space, because there are no studies so far and it is important in terms of user-display interaction in which one is able to point to or reach for the object of interest. We developed a perceptual matching technique for observers to report perceived distance between two objects (real and virtual), by sketching. Sketching was used by Henry and Furness [22] and disclosed, accurate perceptions of real and compression of virtual distance in extrapersonal space. This result was consistent with Michael Geuss et al. [25] who used blind walking. As mentioned in section 2, only few studies available in exocentric spaces and even fewer in exocentric AR, none of them discussed the effects of orientation of targets or parallax.

Perceptual matching by sketching was employed to measure the distance between real and virtual targets. Fig. 1
                         shows the experimental settings for the two layout conditions (horizontal and vertical). Depending on the desired parallax condition, the distance between targets and the fixed screen was adjusted. Participants sat on adjustable chair, with chin fixed at 100cm distance from the screen, such that the center of eyes’ projection is the geometrical center of the two targets. The targets presented in various combinations of layout, parallax and between targets distance. The 3D projector was fixed above and just behind the observer at a distance of 153cm from the screen and at 135cm above the floor where the projector camera was kept at vertical and horizontal angle of projection of 22.52 and 31.97 degrees, respectively, from camera position. The observer’s task was to estimate the exocentric distance between targets by drawing a line, on paper provided by the experimenter, that she/he believed would match the perceived distance.

The observers viewed two yellow spheres – one real (tennis balls of 40mm diameter) and the other one its replica (virtual), in four different orientations and presented at three different egocentric distances from observers where the center-to-center distance varied as well in four levels. The virtual ball was drawn using Unity 3D (version 3.5.1) and run on ASUS computer (Pentium® Dual-Core, 3.20GHz), with the yellow color approaching the real ball as close as possible. The simulated targets were displayed on ViewSonic (3D DLP, Model VS14555, 120Hz) projector with interlaced 120×90 resolution of view, and viewed by NVIDIA 3D Vision Wired Glasses. A small 3.6m×3.2m×2.5m space partitioned by black curtain was used to create good stereoscopic vision, which was equipped with a desk, chair and stationary materials. The projection screen of 90cm×75cm was made from black paper with effective projection area of approximately 78.5cm×60cm. Before the experiment started, calibration was done for required virtual target size and center-to-center distance between the real and virtual targets by measuring, when virtual target displayed on the screen. In the process, the 3D projector was always kept fixed. After each experimental scene was displayed and the participant viewed and felt confident to start estimation, he/she turned away to the right side and began to draw a line for the perceived distance.

Ten graduate students aged between 23 and 27 (with a mean age of 24.6) were recruited from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (three females and seven males). Payment, credit or any other compensation was not given for their participation; they only volunteered for experiencing stereoscopic viewing. Each participant took part in all experimental conditions. All participants reported normal or corrected to normal visual acuity. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the university.

The first factor was layout which depicted how the targets were arranged. The layout shows the position of one target relative to the other. Four different arrangements were used; two in horizontal (V-R-H and R-V-H) and the other two in virtual orientations (V-R-V and R-V-V). The first letter in the designation represents the target either virtual or real displayed to the left (horizontal orientation) or at the top (vertical orientation). Similarly the second letter represents the right side (horizontal orientation) or the lower (vertical orientation) target. The third letter represents the type of orientation (i.e. H is for horizontal while V is for vertical). For instance, R-V-H describes the setup where targets presented horizontally, the real target placed at the left and the virtual to the right.

The second major factor that varies in three levels (on the screen, 5cm in front of the screen, 10cm in front of the screen) is parallax. The parallax defines the position of the targets relative to fixed screen position while observer was seated at a distance of 100cm away from screen. Therefore the targets are displayed on, 5cm, or 10cm distance from the screen (Fig. 1). The experiment considered only zero and negative (virtual object on or in front of the screen) parallax. Positive parallax (virtual object behind the screen) was not considered in this experiment due to technical limitations of displaying the real object behind the opaque screen, which could not be visible to the observer.

The last independent variable for this experiment was exocentric distance, which can also be defined as the center-to-center distance between the two targets. Four scaled distances were chosen to be assigned randomly for each trial. The ‘exocentric distance’ in Fig. 1 represented the center-to-center distance between targets, which, participants were asked to estimate. These distances were categorized by four scaled ranges of 10–20cm, 20–30cm, 30–40cm and 40–50cm, where the exact values for each trial in the range was picked randomly. Random variation of the distance within each category is done to avoid possible effect of learning or guessing over a fixed distance.

Participants estimated center-to-center distance between the two spheres (real and virtual) by sketching. After estimates were made, distances were measured and tabulated by the experimenter. From the response and corresponding reference distance, two dependent variables, accuracy and signed error (SE), were derived. Accuracy and signed error was previously used by Dey et al. [19] to report egocentric distance perception.

The closeness of judgment to the true value, the accuracy, was determined for each trial by equation below which can be defined as fraction of the actual distance:

                            was the corresponding actual distance.

SE was calculated using Eq. (2) as the difference between the ratio of perceived center-to-center distance and actual. The signed error varies between −1 and +1. Positive SE indicates overshoot of exocentric distance, while a negative SE indicates undershoot and zero when exact match.

Despite the fact that time to complete the trials was not measured, participants were instructed that their initial reaction with perceptual matching response was important and encouraged not to take too much time with any one of the trials.

Prior to conducting the experiment, we had the following hypotheses:
                           H1
                           Exocentric distance will be underestimated. In virtual environments, Guess et al. [25], and Henry and Furnes [22] reported underestimation. Therefore we expect similar results in the current experiment.

Accuracy of distance estimation will be better in vertical orientations compared to vertical. This hypothesis was based on the assumption of the first hypothesis and the theory that people perceive vertical dimensions to be longer than their horizontal matches. This theory is widely discussed especially in physical environments as horizontal-vertical-illusions [26,27].

Accuracy will be higher when targets are displayed closer to the observer. This is with the assumption that egocentric and exocentric distance affect each other and in majority of the studies, in physical and virtual reality, accuracy was higher in near field visual space [28].

Distance perception will be more accurate in the closer center-to-center distance between the real and virtual targets.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

The experimental result was analyzed with repeated measures design, where the experimental factors were completely randomized within subjects. Each participant tested through all experimental conditions.

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

First, participants gave their consent on a form that described the purpose of the study, instructions on experimental tasks, procedures and confidentiality of individual’s data sets. In the form observers were not only advised that there would be no any foreseen discomfort associated to the environment rendered, but also free to quit any time if they feel some. After reading the instructions, equivalent verbal description and demonstration of task was also presented by the experimenter. Each participant passed through training sessions to familiarize with the testing procedure. For the training session observers sat on a chair at the distance designated by cross marks on the floor, wore the 3D glasses and instructed to view the virtual environment. Observers were told to get a “good image” of the target in the environment to accustom themselves to surroundings (either real or virtual). Finally, observers estimated the distances between the two targets, and perceptually matched by drawing a line representing the perceived exocentric distance between targets on a piece of paper on their desktop. They performed one trial under each of the four scaled randomly assigned distance in order to become familiar with the experimental procedures. Once they are ready for the experiment, each trial began with no image on the display, then, when targets appeared, observers could view the displayed targets freely until they felt ready to make an estimate. They then turn sideways to draw the estimated line without looking at the display. Each trial lasted 5–10s. Each observer completed 48 trials randomly employing the three levels of parallax, two levels of layouts, and four scaled levels of exocentric distance. To complete all the trials, every participant needed, on average, about 30min.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Judgment accuracy and signed error were analyzed to identify the effects of layout, parallax and center-to-center distance of near field virtual and real targets in stereoscopic displays. The experiment was conducted considering four levels of layout, three levels of parallax and four levels of scaled between targets’ distance ranges. With ANOVA, the experiment was modeled as a repeated-measures design. Each participant made 48 (4×3×4) trials of which, based on the classified values, on average, 36 (SD=9.03) underestimations, 9.2 (SD=6.41) accurate and 2.8 (SD=3.05) overestimations were observed. The judgment was considered accurate if the signed error is between −0.01 and +0.01, because, even in real world some small error was evident [28]. It can generally be observed that exocentric distance was underestimated in all tested conditions where the accuracy of judgment was only 83.6% (SD=0.145). Fig. 2
                      clearly shows most of the observations reported underestimations in all conditions. Results of descriptive statistics, t-tests, repeated measures ANOVA, and post hoc analysis with respect to experimental factors are presented in the subsequent four subsections.

The first factor that was hypothesized to influence accuracy of exocentric distance was layout (arrangement of targets). The overall judgment revealed that the exocentric distance is underestimated in all the four conditions. Taken as a whole, the accuracy was 0.826 (SD=0.125), 0.821 (SD=0.124), 0.808 (SD=0.137) and 0.888 (SD=0.177) of the actual in VRH, RVH, VRV and RVV, respectively. The paired sample t-test revealed vertical orientation minimize the underestimation (t
                        239
                        =−2.384, p
                        =0.018). Using the repeated measures ANOVA, significant difference between arrangements (F [3,27]=8.592, p
                        <0.001) was also found. Post-hoc comparisons, using Tukey method indicated the mean score of accuracy for RVV was significantly better than the other three (See Fig. 3
                        ). But there was no difference observed among orientations in VRH, RVH, and VRV. Thus, the result can be summarized as, the center-to-center distance between the real and virtual targets in all the four layout conditions was underestimated and relatively, the underestimation is smaller in vertical orientations especially in RVV.

The effect of position of targets relative to the screen was also expected to influence the accuracy of distance judgment. Result obtained from all the ten participants indicated that the accuracy of estimations were 0.819 (SD=0.132), 0.821 (SD=0.120), and 0.867 (SD=0.174) at the screen, 5cm from screen and 10cm from screen, respectively. Repeated measures ANOVA identified that there exists significant difference between the relative locations of the targets from the screen (F [2,18]=9.722, p
                        =0.001). Grouping information using Tukey method picked out 10cm from the screen condition is different from the other two. From Fig. 4
                         and the grouping information, it can be said that when targets are presented closer to the observer, it would improve the accuracy of exocentric distance judgment. But the difference between at the screen and 5cm from the screen conditions was not statistically significant.

The four leveled distance between real and virtual targets was the third that was factor also expected to influence the accuracy. The mean accuracy of judgment for all ten participants were 0.918 (SD=0.199), 0.828 (SD=0.126), 0.812 (SD=0.110), and 0.785 (SD=0.087) for the distances of 10–20cm, 20–30cm, 30–40cm, 40–50cm, respectively. Repeated measures ANOVA identified that there exists significant difference between the four conditions (F [3,27]=9.04, p
                        <0.001). Tukey method for grouping found 10–20cm was different from the other three distance ranges. As shown in Fig. 5
                         and the grouping information, the performance in shortest between targets distance range was better than all the rest. Therefore, the result can be summarized that the distance is underestimated in all four conditions, with the 10–20cm between targets distance being more accurate compared to the other three at a similar level of accuracy.

The result of repeated measures ANOVA also revealed that there are significant interactions between layout and parallax (F [6,54]=2.59, p
                        =0.028), layout and distance (F [9,81]=2.25, p
                        =0.002), and parallax and distance (F [6,54]=4.15, p
                        =0.002). Fig. 6
                         showed the interaction of layout and parallax. From the figure, it appeared the RVV orientation resulted in better overall performance over all the other conditions. Tukey’s method revealed the difference is significant only at 10cm from screen condition. It is also found that when targets are displayed at 10cm from screen and the orientation is RVV gave more accurate judgment than when displayed on the screen. But, the accuracy at 5cm from the screen is not different from on the screen or 10cm from the screen, in all four layout conditions.

Similarly, Fig. 7
                         presented the interactions between layout and distance between targets. Post hoc analysis also picked out the source of difference at 10–20cm with the RVV layout condition where the accuracy of judgment is better than the other three orientations. However, there was no difference due to orientation observed at 20–30cm, 30–40cm and 40–50cm. With regard to distance, 10–20cm distance range perform better than all the other three when the orientation was RVV; and estimations at 40–50cm were poor compared with that of 10–20cm range of distance. However, there was no significant interaction difference observed between layout and distance, in all the other combinations.

Furthermore, the interaction of parallax and the distance ranges is shown in Fig. 8
                        . The result from post hoc analysis found difference in judgment of distance when separation between targets was 10–20cm as 10cm from screen parallax condition was more accurate than the other two; whereas no significant effect of parallax interaction observed in the rest of the three center-to-center distance regions. As the targets are displayed on the screen, accuracy of judgment in 10–20cm was found to be different from 20 to 30cm and 40 to 50cm. Also at 10cm from the screen condition, 10–20cm gave the highest accuracy compared to all of the other ranges. No difference due to between targets’ distance was observed when the targets location was 5cm from the screen.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

We investigated exocentric distance perception for real and virtual targets displayed in personal space presented in see through stereoscopic glasses. Three factors namely layout, parallax and center-to-center distance, were tested for their effect on the accuracy of exocentric distance judgment. Within each experimental trial participants estimated the distance using perceptual matching task by sketching.

The overall result showed underestimation in all conditions, where the judgment accuracy was about 83.6% (SD=0.145) of the actual between targets distance. Comprehensive literature review in virtual environment found compression of egocentric distance [29]. Similarly, underestimation were reported in completely immersive exocentric space [22,25]. It is also interesting to observe egocentric distance seemed compressed as indicated by a few recent augmented reality studies [16,18,19]. Surprisingly, our exocentric result also found underestimation which might be vital indication that the compression is at both frontal and depth planes, in both immersive and augmented reality.

Vertical orientation was hypothesized to minimize underestimation. This was because of the horizontal-vertical-illusions (HVI) theory [26,27], where distance estimation, in real world, was reported to be larger in vertical arrangements compare to the horizontal. The result supported the hypothesis as vertical conditions result better estimations (See Fig. 7). Furthermore, the result also showed vertical orientation when the virtual target presented at the lower (RVV), the overall accuracy was higher than the rest. This may be related to the result from Corujeira and Oakley [16] that reported, in egocentric space, reduced underestimation in low eye height. Since the virtual object placed on the lower half, the egocentric distance improvement might have helped the exocentric distance accuracy. The result could be an interesting indication that HVI may hold in stereo environment even though, it is early to conclude so since there are not many studies to compare with.

The relative position of target with respect to the observer and the fixed screen position, defined as parallax, were also studied to affect the accuracy of judgment. In egocentric space, closer targets were reported to be estimated more accurately. Three parallax conditions were compared; on the screen, 5cm from screen and 10cm from screen. Our result supported the hypothesis, especially for the 10cm from the screen condition, which is the nearest to the observer portrayed better accuracy compared to the other two conditions. However, there was no difference between on the screen and 5cm from the screen conditions. This may be because the difference was not large enough (only 5cm) for observers to differentiate, especially when the depth was larger (targets farther). It is interesting to see that parallax is an important factor on distance judgment accuracy and there exists relationship between egocentric and exocentric spaces. This might be an indication that the compression is not only in the depth axis but also in the planar plane. However, additional studies will be required if the shape is systematically compressed in stereoscopic viewing. Interestingly, underestimation was observed on the screen condition opposed to real world studies and this might be because, even though the virtual target was at zero parallax, it was still presented in stereoscopic environment.

Another important factor expected to influence distance perception was center-to-center distance between the real and virtual targets. Four scaled distance between 10 and 50cm were tested and found significant result of accuracy where the smallest between targets distance (10–20cm) was accurate compared to underestimations in the other three cases. The result is in line with the hypothesis that the accuracy gets worse as the separation between targets increases. The hypothesis was derived from the Weber’s law [30,31], which stated as the error magnified for separation between targets increases, and was tested and proved true in various real world experiments. This can be an indication that the stereo vision is also governed by Weber’s law. But it was not clear why there was no difference observed among the other three distance conditions (20–30cm, 30–40cm and 40–50cm). Probably, the center to center distance was not large enough to cause a significant difference.

In addition to the main effects of layout, parallax and distance, significant result was found for the interaction of layout and parallax, layout and distance, and parallax and distance. At 10cm from the screen coupled with RVV layout condition, the result indicated accurate estimations compared to compression reported by all other combinations. However, on the screen and at 5cm from screen, there was no effect of layout observed. This means when targets were presented very close to the observer in vertical orientations, the accuracy was improved, which can be a very important implication for developers where spatial information is critical. The phenomenon can also be explained by the combination effect of HVI theory and the possible effect of egocentric distance on exocentric distance perception. The interaction effect of between targets distance and layout was observed with accurate estimations in RVV orientation at 10–20cm between objects distance condition, which was unique in comparison to underestimation of all the other combinations. Similarly, for the interaction between parallax and center-to-center distance, at 10cm from screen, 10–20cm center-to-center condition portrayed accurate estimation compared to the other conditions of distance where accuracy was poor and no difference existed among themselves. Also, on the screen, the accuracy at 10–20cm was better than 20–30cm and 40–50cm conditions, though all underestimated. With compression already reported in egocentric space in previous studies, the current finding posed important issue of systematic compression in all planes of the stereoscopic space. This preliminarily signifies the notion of targets might appear smaller than they actually are, in augmented reality. Moreover, the study clearly indicated that the accuracy can be improved by proper orientation of targets in augmented reality in addition to the possible causes attributed to hardware or human’s perception in various studies of completely immersive virtual environment [29].

Accurate distance perception has been reported in the literature for real world exocentric space estimation but studies showed compression in completely immersive virtual reality [22,25]. The underestimation prevailed in the current study, where mixed real and virtual targets were presented, triggers an interesting question to human perception whether virtual displays dominates the effect of perception or cognition when both virtual and real environments are mixed. Since few research has investigated the mixed scenario, more studies to look into this hypothesis is recommended.

In this study, we conducted an experiment and compared distance estimation accuracy in augmented environment where two targets (one real and one virtual) presented in four layouts, three parallax and four center-to-center distance scenarios within controlled near field space using perceptual matching by sketching. The result revealed overall underestimation of between targets’ distance where all main effects were significant, consistent with the hypothesis. There was also interaction effects observed between layout and parallax, layout and distance, and parallax and distance. Vertical orientation was relatively accurate compared to horizontal, especially when the virtual target is presented at the lower half of the field. In the negative parallax, the accuracy was better for 10cm from the screen than the 5cm from the screen and on the screen conditions. This means as the targets presented closer to the observer, the accuracy improved which is consistent with the depth perception in egocentric peripersonal space. It can also be observed that the accuracy improves, as the separation of targets decreases, with the smallest (i.e., 10–20cm) distance provides accurate judgment. The results are of great importance since they can help decide where to put targets with their relative importance of accuracy of judgment. Generally, if accuracy of distance perception is important, the separation between real and virtual objects shall be kept as small as possible and near to the observer when appropriate.

The study is only limited to near field visual objects with in 100cm distance. Further study will be required to address the accuracy problem in extrapersonal environment. Our future study will attempt to investigate accuracy of exocentric distance perception in far field space and the relationship between exocentric and egocentric distance judgment in stereoscopic environment. With evident underestimation phenomenon, engineering solutions such as calibration of stereoscopic glasses to fit individual requirements would be required for better interaction. Automatic feedback mechanism would also be interesting for real time correction. If the interaction issues are sufficiently addressed, these display devices will step forward in existing and more recent advancing visual devices such as smart glasses. In general, further studies should find more explanation on why the inaccuracy is apparent in virtual and augmented environments compared to the more accurate real world perception.
