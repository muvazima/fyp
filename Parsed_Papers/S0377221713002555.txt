                  Every item produced, transported, used and discarded within a Supply Chain (SC) generates costs and creates an impact on the environment. The increase of forward flows as effects of market globalization and reverse flows due to legislation, warranty, recycling and disposal activities affect the ability of a modern SC to be economically and environmentally sustainable. In this context, the study considers an innovative sustainable closed loop SC problem. It first introduces a linear programming model that aims to minimize the total SC costs. Environmental sustainability is guaranteed by the complete reprocessing of an end-of-life product, the re-use of components, the disposal of unusable parts sent directly from the manufacturers, with a closed loop transportation system that maximizes transportation efficiency. Secondly, the authors consider the problem by means of a parametrical study, by analyzing the economical sustainability of the proposed CLSC model versus the classical Forward Supply Chain model (FWSC) from two perspectives: Case 1, the ‘traditional company perspective’, where the SC ends at the customers, and the disposal costs are not included in the SC, and Case 2, the ‘social responsibility company perspective’, where the disposal costs are considered within the SC. The relative impact of the different variables in the SC structure and the applicability of the proposed model, in terms of total costs, SC structure and social responsibility, are investigated thoroughly and the results are reported at the conclusion of the paper.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recent legislation, social responsibility, corporate image and customer awareness are forcing manufacturers not only to provide more environment friendly products, but also to recover used products at their end-of-life. In the electric/electronic sector, the WEEE European Directive (Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment) of February 2003 requires the collection and recycling of such equipment (Directive 2002/96/EC), and defines the individual obligation of each manufacturer in these activities. The draft directive addresses collection and treatment requirements and sets re-use, recycling and recovery targets (50–80%, depending on the type of equipment and whether it is recovered or recycled/reused) (Rosenbach and Lindsay, 2002). According to the recovery activities of the recent recast of the WEEE directive (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/index_en.htm), the demands are more pressing. The proposal is clear:
                        
                           •
                           Art 5.2: when supplying a new product, distributors shall be responsible for ensuring that such waste can be returned to the distributor.

Art 7.1: producers/third parties acting on their behalf achieve a minimum collection rate of 65%.

Art 8.3: producers/third parties acting on their behalf, in accordance with Community legislation, set up systems to provide for the treatment of WEEE using best available treatment, recovery and recycling techniques. The systems may be set up by producers.

Art 128: each producer is responsible for financing the operations of recovering and re-using products relating to the waste from his own products.

In the last decade, other countries (Japan, USA) have tried to adopts similar approaches (Rosenbach and Lindsay, 2002), and the strategies adopted by manufacturers and distributors, for the recovering of used products, are applicable in other industrial sectors, following specific directives provided by the legislation.

According to Daniel et al. (2003), the recovery of used products after the end of their life cycle is a mean for environmental protection and a source of business profit through their handling. This has increased the importance of the reuse and remanufacture of used products, so reducing the utilization of materials. Consequently, manufacturers have turned to a better design of their products for maximum material reuse and recycling. This includes the concept of the ‘green supply chain’ design that, according to Tsoulfas and Pappis (2006), is influenced by different principles of environmental sustainability: product design, packaging, collection and transportation, recycling and disposal, greening the indoor and outdoor environment and other management issues. A system is sustainable if it has the ability to endure. Planning a ‘green supply chain’ requires the additional function of recycling and thus, reverse logistics is a necessary infrastructure for material flow (Wang and Hsu, 2010). In addition, if the returned products are not handled or transported efficiently, manufacturers incur larger costs that can increase the cost of the new products (Mutha and Pokharel, 2009). Tsoulfas and Pappis (2006) affirm that “by extending the useful life of equipment items, additional raw materials are not needed to produce new items. Primary raw materials should be used only in cases where there would be no stock of secondary ones.” and that “transportation and the consequent environmental effects can be significantly limited if the recovery of used products can occur at the same time or in combination with the distribution of new products”.

In accordance with these concepts, this paper proposes a sustainable CLSC in which all end-of-life products return to the plants, where all the reprocessing activities take place. Some parts will be reused as raw materials and components for new products and the other parts will be transported to be disposed properly. On one hand, the reuse of end-of-life products reduces the need for raw materials, improving the economical sustainability of the process. On the other hand, it allows for a reduction of the quantity of disposable products, by improving their environmental sustainability. Economic and environmental sustainability are also guaranteed by the use of closed loop shipments, in which the collection of end-of-life products occurs at the same time as the delivery of new products. According to Yildiz et al. (2010) the unit cost (i.e. cost per pound per mile) of round-trip carriers is significantly less than the one-way unit cost: the model considers that the reverse routes are the same as the ones in forward flow, including the same transportation model. This reverse transportation model is already widespread in some SCs: for example, in the automotive industry, high value, used spare parts (such as engines and transmissions) are collected and returned to the manufacturers by the same vehicles with closed loop shipments, and are destined for regeneration purposes, allowing economies of scale benefits through the use of the same vehicle, without designing specific reverse logistics, but having, instead, a reverse SC integrated with a forward one (Kannan et al., 2010).

The main objectives of this paper are to define the following issues:
                        
                           •
                           What is the mathematical model that aims to design such SC?

Is this design model economically sustainable?

From what company perspective it could be sustainable?

What are its critical aspects for its sustainability in respect to classical SC design?

The study considers an innovative sustainable closed loop SC problem. It first introduces a linear programming model that aims to minimize the total SC costs. Later, authors analyze the problem in a parametrical study, benchmarking the proposed CLSC structure, where all the products at their end-of-life are returned and reprocessed as described before at the production plant, with the Forward Supply Chain (FWSC) structure seen from two different standpoints: the case of a ‘social responsibility company perspective’, whereby the disposal costs are considered inside the SC, and the case of a ‘traditional company perspective’, where the SC ends at the customers, and the disposal costs are not considered in the SC, as normally happens with companies. This second part of the study aims to:
                        
                           •
                           Define the function of the two analyzed perspectives, in terms of which factors and how they combine impacts on SC costs in case of CLSC and FWSC structure.

Define, using a parametrical analysis, a decision making tool that, for a given product and network with certain specific characteristics, allows a decision on whether it is possible to modify the classical forward SC structure to a ‘Green Closed Loop SC’.

Study what are the elements that influence the choice of SC structure and details of in what way and how these factors influence each level of the CLSC, in terms of number and location of elements.

The next section presents a brief review of the existing literature on SC, focusing of CLSC and its environmental impact from a generic and cost point of view. Section 3 introduces the proposed CLSC design model, concluding with an applicative case derived from an industrial application in Northern Italy. In Section 4, the authors analyse the problem by using a parametrical study, benchmarking the proposed CLSC structure with the FW structure, illustrating the most relevant results. Our conclusions wrap up the paper in Section 5.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The problem of locating facilities and allocating customers covers the core elements of distribution system design. Klose and Drexl (2005) stress that the existing literature on the location–allocation problem is very broad, with many model formulations and solution algorithms. They suggested a classification that would distinguish between continuous location models, network location models, mixed-integer programming models and their applications. This classification was repeated in Melo et al. (2009), where the authors observed that the full integration of forward and reverse activities in SCM requires more attention.

Some interesting studies into forward distribution were described in Battini et al. (2007) and Amiri (2006). The first considered the optimization of goods delivery policies in a distribution network, and proposed a new iterative procedure, based on a linear programming model, in order to plan goods distribution inside the supply chain, under critical constraints. Amiri (2006) studied the location problems and the best distribution strategy, proposing a mixed integer model. Other examples of mixed integer models are provided in Wu et al. (2006) and Melo et al. (2005). In Manzini et al. (2008) the authors introduced a basis for the development of an innovative decision support systems platform, capable of integrating design, management, control and optimization activities for a supply chain system. The authors expanded their theories in Manzini and Bindi (2009).

In regard to reverse logistics (RL), Pokharel and Mutha (2009) investigated the current developments in research and practice through content analysis of the published literature, while Fleischmann’s studies on the subject are extensive: in Fleischmann et al. (2001) they presented a generic facility location model and discussed the differences with traditional logistics settings, proceeding to analyse the impact of product return flows on logistics networks. Fleischmann and Kuik (2003) considered a stochastic inventory model encompassing random item returns, where the returns were independent of past demand and might be directly reused. Zhou and Wang (2008) tried to extend the model proposed by Fleischmann et al. (2001). Salema et al. (2007) proposed a generalization of the Fleischmann’s model. Salema et al. (2009) proposed another mathematical model, in which strategic and tactical decisions were integrated. An extension of a facility-location MILP-model in a reverse logistics context was proposed by Lieckens and Vandaele (2007), while Lu and Bostel (2007) proposed a two-level location model in which ‘forward’ and ‘reverse’ flows are simultaneously considered, and demonstrated that reverse flows influence their decisions about location and allocation.

Many articles have focused on case studies on various aspects of RL, for example, Daniel et al. (2003) examined the recovery of old batteries using life cycle inventory analysis (LCIA), while Kannan et al. (2010) considered a case of battery recycling, and proposed a closed loop supply chain network. Another case study was proposed in Alshamrania et al. (2007), where the authors examined the blood distribution of the American Red Cross. Several articles explain different environmental consideration without proposing any supply chain mathematical model optimization. Autry (2005) examined the relationships between formalization, liberal policies, and related capabilities and the overall effectiveness of reverse logistics programs. Sarmento et al. (2005) evaluated the industry’s behavior regarding the environment and explained the correlation between financial accounting harmonization and environmental pollution. Nakamura and Kondo (2006) defined life-cycle costing (LCC) as a tool to assess the cost of a product over its entire life cycle and present a hybrid LCC methodology. While Ciliberti et al. (2008) and Kammerer (2009) proposed a study on Logistics Social Responsibility (LSR), for developing a taxonomy of the LSR practices adopted by firms, and an analysis about the influence of customer benefit and regulation on environmental product innovation. Liu et al. (2009), presented an economic evaluation of three typical recycling processes for the five main types of waste electronic home appliances (EHA), classified optional recycling processes for the targeted waste EHA, and evaluated their economic feasibilities.

Other well known studies proposed mathematical models for the impact of environmental issues on long-term behavior of a single product supply chain with product recovery. Hammond and Beullens (2007) presented a variation inequality approach to strategic modeling of oligopolistic closed-loop supply chains under legislation. Georgiadis and Vlachos (2004) examined the firm’s ‘green image’ effect on customer demand, the obligation to ‘take back’ imposed by legislation, and the state campaigns for proper disposal of used products. Also, Wang and Hsu (2010), Sheu et al. (2005) and Ortolani et al. (2009) proposed studies concerning the integration of logistics operations and green supply chain design and management. Sheu (2007) introduced a conceptual framework that describes the process of multi-source hazardous-waste return flows in proposed coordinated reverse logistics (CRL) system, formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Bojarski et al. (2009) addresses the optimization of SC planning and designs considering economical and environmental issues. Also Lee et al. (2009) and Mutha and Pokharel (2009) proposed mathematical models for the design of a RL network, while Cruz and Wakolbinger (2008) developed a framework for the analysis of optimal levels of corporate and social responsibility (CSR) in a multi-period supply chain network.


                     Table 1
                     , where a classification of scientific literature dedicated to SC design is summarized, is organized by aspects considered in the design models, developing highlights that recent research about SC has not yet focused on the closed-loop supply chain, and critical issues that require investigation. Only a few authors analyze the CLSC related to economical and environmental sustainability, focusing more on the environmental consideration than on costs and benefits inside the SC. Moreover, most authors do not consider these aspects in their mathematical design model of the SC.

The proposed model of CLSC developed in this paper can be formulated as follows:


                        
                           
                              •
                              The model considers that handling costs (in direct and reverse flows) are a direct function of the volume moved and are dependent on the characteristics of the product. As a consequence, unitary handling costs will be expressed in Euro per cube meter.

The product delivery is made by third part logistics, which guarantees the right fleet.

According to Battini et al. (2007) the transportation costs (in direct and reverse flows) include all the costs involved in the movement or transport of a shipment, which are typically defined by third part logistics and vary considerably with the volume and weight of each shipment, distances, transport mode, etc. Four correlated factors make up the transportation costs considered in this model:
                                    
                                       1.
                                       goods delivery quantities,

physical characteristics of goods delivered,

transportation mode,

distance.

The model developed is based on an average unitary transportation cost data, obtained by combining the four factors described above and expressed in Euro per kilometer per cube meter of goods.

The unitary inventory costs are calculated as a percentage of the considered product value according to the inventory cost rate. It considers capital costs, which is the return a company could make on the money tied up in inventory; inventory service costs, which includes insurance and taxes on inventory; storage space costs, which include those warehousing space-related costs relative to level of inventory; damage risk costs. The unitary disposal costs are calculated as a percentage of the considered product value.

The inventory costs at each level of the supply chain are functions of the rotation index of the inventory and of the safety stocks.

The inventory costs in the production plants are considered negligible, because the finished products are directly shipped. For this reason the handling costs at the production plants are considered to be included in the production costs.

The total annual demand for product p from customer l is assumed to include normal distribution. A part of this demand can be unsatisfied, which creates an unsatisfied demand, and the model will optimize the satisfied demand level for each customer/product combination. The annual demand at the other nodes at the other levels of the SC (Plants, DCs, Distributors) is derived by the demands of each served node.

The unitary unsatisfied demand costs are functions of the considered product. They are typically very high, taking into account not only the direct cost derived by a lack of turnover, but also the indirect cost related to the company image, the future customer orders, etc.

In the forward flows the first level (plants) can ship to all the other levels, the second level (DCs) can ship to the third and fourth level, and so on.

The route in the reverse flow is the same as the one in the forward flow, including the same transportation model. For that reason the distance between each couple of SC actors is equal in both directions. In this way it is possible to benefit from the economies of scale when using the same vehicle, optimizing the transportation costs, avoiding empty trips and granting more effective material handling, all without designing a specific reverse logistics. This transportation cost optimization results are highlighted and confirmed in Faccio et al. (2011)
                              

As shown in Fig. 1
                                  all the end-of-life product are returned to the production plants and a percentage of these are reused, reducing the quantity of raw material necessary for the new products. The remained quantity is shipped to the disposals.

The r index defines the number of stock turns over times during the year and evaluates the efficiency with which the inventory is managed. In the proposed model this depends on decision variables, in the sense that it is fixed at the beginning by a decision process made by the managers of the distribution networks in order to obtain the desired level of efficiency. Once fixed at the beginning of the CLSC design process it is considered as a parameter, that pulls the transportation flows with respect to the annual demand required by the customers.

At the end of this section, the mixed integer linear programming closed loop supply chain model is applied to a logistic case in the electric motor sector. The analyzed network consists of (Fig. 3
                        ):

In this applicative case we considered six different product families p, with an average supplying lead time (LT
                        
                           p
                        ) of one week (1/52year), equal for all the level of SC (j, k, l). We imposed a minimum service level to all SC equal to 85%, which corresponds to k
                        
                           p, j
                        , k

                         which is equal to 1 (2).

In the applicative case, the standard deviation at the customers’ level was fixed to σ
                        
                           p.l

                        ∀p. In order to simplify the data, using a cautionary approach, the standard deviation at the other nodes of the SC has been expressed as a function of the demand at that node, considered as 20% of the demand at this node.

                         indicates the average inventory rotation index imposed at the beginning of the CLSC design process at the different levels of the SC.

The facilities installation costs and their maximum storage capacity are defined in Table 6

This applicative case considers the possibility of transporting by rail and by road, since the transportation mode can change in function of the level of the supply chain involved in the shipment:
                           
                              •
                              train, m1, can be use on the route from plant i to the DC j or to the distributors k; with a volume capacity limit of 65 (cubicmeter);

road, m2, is used on the routes from plant i to the DC j; with a volume capacity limit of 90 (cubicmeter);

road, m3 is used on the routes to the distributors k; with a volume capacity limit of 35–50 (cubicmeter);

road, m4 is used on the routes to the customers l; with a volume capacity limit of 15 (cubicmeter);

The unitary transportation costs are calculated using (1) and considering:
                           
                              •
                              The volume capacity limits of each transportation mode reported previously.

The average value of saturation level for shipments with a destination DC, a distributor and customers equal to 80%, 75% and 70%. These values are assumed in function of the products category and the typical mix of products shipped.

Consequently, for example, the unitary transportation costs for a shipment from plant I2 to DC J1 are calculated considering:
                           
                              •

The model described above is implemented in GAMS software (www.gams.com), and the results of implementing a SC design model for CLSC with end-of-life product returns, reuse and disposal directly to the production plants, with closed loop routing, are illustrated in Fig. 4
                        .

In this section the problem is analyzed in order to investigate the economical sustainability of the proposed CLSC model versus the classical Forward Supply Chain model (FWSC).

The parametrical analysis has been developed analyzing the impact of different parameters, changing its input data from the basic value defined in the applicative case of Section 3, inside a range of variation in accordance with the case study and with the literature review (Table 8
                     ).

The parameters to study have been chosen according to the environmental principles applicable to SC design as defined by Tsoulfas and Pappis (2006), in order to obtain environmental sustainability. In fact, they stress the importance of the reverse flow and of the reuse of end-of-life products, “… by extending the useful life of equipment items, additional raw materials are not needed to produce new items. Primary raw materials should be used only in cases where there would be no stock of secondary ones.” In the parametrical analysis this element is represented with Reporc/Tot%, Pc/Val% and Rm/Pc% parameters. The authors continue “As in the phase of collection and transportation, recycling and disposal may significantly contribute to the total environmental gain and the attainment of the environmental goals of a company”. This element is expressed with Dc/Val%, CT% and Distance parameters. In addition, they highlight that “transportation and the consequent environmental effects can be significantly limited if the recovery of used products can occur at the same time or in combination with the distribution of new products. The theoretical minimal average transportation distances can be determined using a tool for allocation.” This element is expressed with Distance and Type of SC, within the CLSC structure. The analysis is developed from two different standpoints: case 1 is from a “traditional company perspective”, where the SC ends at the customers, and the disposal costs are not considered, and case 2 is from a “social responsibility company perspective”, where the disposal costs are considered inside the SC.

From this perspective, the proposed CLSC is compared to the classical FWSC, characterized by no reverse flows and cost of disposal activitiesy is not considered. Companies that do not reprocess products define the SC limits at the customers, who are responsible for the disposal.

Thanks to the ANOVA analysis in Fig. 5
                         and to the main effect plot in Fig. 6
                        , it is fairly easy to identify what factors/correlations influence the system response in term of TOTC (total supply chain costs) and how great is such influence. The ANOVA test is used to determine the impact independent variables have on the dependent variable in a regression analysis. The analysis in fact emphasizes the relevance of two variables:
                           
                              1.
                              
                                 Type of SC (0=
                                 FWSC;1=
                                 CLSC).


                                 Reporc/Tot%, (percent of reused products with respect to the total).

For the Type of SC, the analysis shows that FWSC structure is much more effective from this perspective than a CLSC and, moreover, the Type of SC is the most relevant factor in differencing TOTCs. Reporc/Tot% shows that the increment in the percentage of reused products averagely decreases the TOTC, with a more than linear trend, which means that the benefit of a product end-of-life reuse has a more than linear benefit for the TOTC, stressing the importance for companies of designing and managing products in a modern SC with recycling targets. Fig. 6 shows that, from this perspective, it is necessary to reuse at least 80% of the products in order to reach a condition of identical performance of the two SC structures, according to many industrial cases with similarity of quantity of material recycled (i.e. automotive for engines and transmission remanufacturing) or product value recycled (i.e. electronic industry with copper recovering). These findings are in accordance with the conclusions proposed by Fleischmann et al. (2001). These authors studied how robust traditional logistics networks are when it comes to addressing product recovery activities, concluding that forward flows dominate the network design until the economic incentive for product recovery and its effect on the reverse flows become significant.

Delving into the comparison between the two SC structures in this perspective, Fig. 7
                         shows a part of the parametrical study of Case 1, where, in order to have a convenient CLSC (bold blue
                           1
                           For interpretation of color in Fig. 7, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.
                        
                        
                           1
                         istogram) versus FWCL (red line) the Reproc/Tot% has to be at least 80%. In case of a lower Reproc/Tot%, even when all the other factors are favorable, FWSC will remain a preferable solution.

Comparing Figs. 7 and 8
                         (Reproc/Tot%=80%) it is clear that CLSC does not necessarily have a lower TOTC than FWCL. If the disposal costs are not sufficiently low, i.e. 35% (Fig. 8) instead of 10% (Fig. 7) the CLSC is not convenient when compared to the traditional FWSC. These findings confirm that, in a classical perspective of SC, if returned products are not managed efficiently from a reusing and disposal point of view, companies would incur to larger costs than a classical FWSC (Mutha and Pokharel, 2009).

As demonstrated by the results, if the disposal phase is not considered inside the boundary of the company’s perspective, the proposed CLSC model with complete reprocessing of end-of-life product is hardly applicable. These results otherwise highlight the importance of an integrated SC design that considers the classical and environmental sustainability factors together with the supply chain structure.

From this perspective, the proposed CLSC model is compared to a FWSC to a FWSC, with no reverse flows, and the costs of disposal activity are included in the TOTC (i.e. customers and the disposals are inside the SC structure from a company costs point of view). Figs. 9 and 10
                        
                         investigate the factors/correlations influencing TOTC from this second perspective. The ANOVA analysis demonstrates that the most relevant factors are:
                           
                              1.
                              
                                 Reporc/Tot%, (percentage of reused products with respect to the total).


                                 DC/Val%, (percentage of disposal cost with respect to the product value).

The combination of these two factors.

Firstly, the Type of SC (0=
                        FWSC; 1=
                        CLSC) involves variable evidence that, from this perspective, CLSC is averagely better than FWCL, but it is no longer one of the relevant factors. The most relevant factor for TOTC is not the network structure, but the percentage of reused products (Reporc/Tot%=0 means FWSC). This point highlights that, from this perspective, for a sustainable SC, not only the closed-loop design is a better choice than the classical SC models. However the percentage of end-of-life product reuse is a very important factor for a successful sustainable SC. Reporc/Tot% shows that increasing the percent of reused products averagely decreases the TOTC, again with a more than linear trend in the CL structure.

In a different way from Case 1, Reporc/Tot% is the most relevant factor in respect of TOTC. The second most relevant factor is DC/Val%, which shows and high and linear relations compared to TOTC. The third factor is the combination of the first two.

                         analyse the constrains between FWSC and CLSC structure in the social responsibility company perspective. When the Reporc/Tot%> 20%, all the other factors do not influence the possibility to adopt the introduced CLSC model, this is always convenient when compared to the FWSC model. When the Reporc/Tot%=10%, and DC/Val%=30% (or higher), CLSC becomes more convenient, independently of all possible variations of the other factors (Fig. 11). On the other hand, with a DC/Val%=10%, all the other factors, such as CT% and RM/PC%, influence the results with a trend clearly illustrated in Fig. 12.

Finally, it is considered how the classical and sustainability parameters influence the CLSC design approach in terms of TOTC and network structure. Figs. 13 and 14
                        
                         analyze the main effect plot and the Pareto classification of the parameters, highlighting how this SC design model is widely influenced by the sustainability (reused products, disposal cost), compared to the classical parameters (production cost, distance, etc.).

Considering the network structure, in terms of number of plants, the number of DCs and the number of distributors, and what facility to open in which location, Fig. 15
                         describes how the Reporc/Tot% factor has a substantial impact on the structure.

Relatively to the SC structure it is possible to evidence the following global results:
                           
                              •
                              A number of plants are largely influenced and inversely correlated with the % of reused products (Fig. 16
                                 ). In fact, as the end-of-life product reuse increases the disposal flow decreases, allowing a centralization of the production plants in the distribution zone, without considering the disposals’ location and with lower installation costs. The decision about which plant to open and its location is determined by a combination of distance and the % of reused product factors (Figs. 17–19
                                 
                                 
                                 ).

The number of DCs is greatly influenced by the reverse transportation costs and the correlation between the % of reused product and the number of DCs at the increasing of the reverse transportation cost (Fig. 20
                                 ).

The number of Distributors is influenced instead more by distance and reverse transportation costs, which is a typical design approach for a classical FWSC network (Fig. 21
                                 ).

This analysis gives an important result: the proposed CLSC model, could substitute for an existing and well designed FWSC, simply by changing the structure of the first and second portions of the SC. The analysis evidences that it is possible to maintain a great portion of the existing downstream SC. In fact, Distributors are mostly influenced by the classical (i.e. FWSC) parameters like distance or transportation costs. On the other hand if the Disposal locations are close to the production plants, it is possible to maintain a large portion of the initial SC (Plants), that are influenced by the flows through disposals.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The study considers an innovative sustainable closed loop SC problem. It first introduces a linear programming model that aims to minimize the total SC costs, whereby the elements of sustainability are the complete reprocessing of end-of-life product and disposal of unusable parts directly from manufacturers, with a closed loop transportation system that maximizes transportation efficiency. Secondly, the authors consider the problem in a parametrical study, analyzing the economic sustainability of the proposed CLSC model versus the classical Forward Supply Chain model (FWSC) from two perspectives: Case 1, the ‘traditional company perspective’, whereby the SC ends at the customers, and the disposal costs are not included in the SC, and Case 2, the ‘social responsibility company perspective’, where the disposal costs are considered within the SC.

The principal results were:
                        
                           1.
                           From a ‘traditional company perspective’, where the SC ends at the customers, and the disposal costs are not considered in the SC, the proposed CLSC model is preferable compared to the classical FWSC if few conditions are met, independently from other parameters: a percentage of reused end-of-life products of at least 80%, and optimal reverse transportation costs and disposal costs. This conclusion is confirmed by recent literature (Fleischmann et al., 2001; Mutha and Pokharel, 2009) and by different industrial applications where for quantity of material recycled (i.e. automotive for engines and transmission remanufacturing) and product value recycled (i.e. electronic industry with copper recovering) where there are high levels of product reusability.

From a ‘social responsibility company perspective’, where all the disposal costs are considered inside the SC also in the FWSC, the economic and environmental sustainability of the proposed CLSC model, compared to the FWSC, is already realized with 10% of reused end-of-life products. However this perspective is not typical for most companies, and for this reason, government directives (i.e. European Union WEEE Directive, 2007) or customers’ sensibility should act as a demanding factor that should lead to changes in such a direction.

It is important to observe how, in a CLSC structure, the element of % of reused end-of-life products is a critical factor with respect to its influence on the total cost of the SC, and on the other environmental protection (Daniel et al., 2003). An increase of the percentage of reused end-of-life products gives a more than linear reduction on total costs. This focus on the point in the product design enforces the design for reusability concept.

From a SC structure point of view, the results demonstrate that ‘sustainability factors’ such as the percentage of reused end-of-life products and disposal costs influence the CL model, more in the initial portion of the SC (plants) than in the final part (DCs and distributors). Distributors are mostly influenced by the classical parameters of distance or transportation costs. This means that, for an existing, well designed SC, with the classical approach, it is possible to pass to a CLSC structure, maintaining the distributors’ facilities. With sufficient economies of scale in the reverse transportation, DCs structure could be also maintained. For the production plants, due to the high flows through the disposal, the structure could be maintained if there is a very high reusing of end-of-life product, or if the disposal facilities are located close to the production plants.

As shown in Fig. 22
                     , looking at the average cost situation given by the parametrical analysis, if all the costs of the SC are considered, and the disposal costs in case of FWSC (social responsibility perspective) are included, it is clear that the proposed CLSC gives better results. On the other hand, from a traditional company perspective, looking at the average result, the classical FWSC produces lower costs than the proposed CLSC, and is competitive only in few cases (i.e. few industrial sectors according the parametrical analysis).

The white–gray average disposal costs are mostly paid by society. The results demonstrate that, in the industrial sectors where there is low end-of-life product reusability, the European Union legislation, should introduce economic incentives, in order to encourage the manufacturers to take a direct role in the recovery of the end-of-life products. This should facilitate reaching a win–win situation with respect to the traditional end-of-life product management, with a total costs reduction for both companies and society. The main limitation of the proposed model involves considering and analyzing the case of a single company that manages the entire product life cycle. This approach is already used in some sectors and for some kinds of products (i.e. automotive). The second step of the research would be to extend the analysis to the possibility to managing end-of-life products, and reprocessing and disposal phases through companies’ consortia.
