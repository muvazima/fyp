                  We consider a Cournot duopoly under general demand and cost functions, where an incumbent patentee has a cost reducing technology that it can license to its rival by using combinations of royalties and upfront fees (two-part tariffs). We show that for drastic technologies: (a) licensing occurs and both firms stay active if the cost function is superadditive and (b) licensing does not occur and the patentee monopolizes the market if the cost function is additive or subadditive. For non drastic technologies, licensing takes place provided the average efficiency gain from the cost reducing technology is higher than the marginal gain computed at the licensee’s reservation output. Optimal licensing policies have both royalties and fees for significantly superior technologies if the cost function is superadditive. By contrast, for additive and certain subadditive cost functions, optimal licensing policies have only royalties and no fees.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A patent grants an innovator monopoly rights over an innovation for a given period of time. It seeks to provide incentives to innovate as well as to diffuse innovations. Licensing is a standard way of diffusion of innovations. Initiated by Arrow (1962), the study of different aspects of patent licensing has constituted an important area of modern industrial economics. Comparing a monopoly with a perfectly competitive industry, Arrow argued that perfect competition provides a higher incentive to innovate. Licensing in oligopolies was first studied by Kamien and Tauman (1984); 1986) and Katz and Shapiro (1985); 1986). Since then, the literature has been extended to address issues such as informational asymmetries (Choi, 2001; Gallini & Wright, 1990), product differentiation (Faulí-Oller & Sandonís, 2002; Muto, 1993), incumbent innovators (Kamien & Tauman, 2002; Marjit, 1990; Sen & Tauman, 2007; Wang, 1998) and intertemporal aspects (Avagyan, Esteban-Bravo, & Vidal-Sanz, 2014; Jensen, 1992; Saracho, 2004).

In spite of its richness, the existing literature has been restrictive in regard to one important aspect of production: returns to scale. The vast majority of the papers in the literature assume that firms operate under linear cost functions.

                           Sen and Stamatopoulos (2009) is an exception. This paper analyzes licensing in a Cournot duopoly with an outside patentee, quadratic cost functions and linear demand.
                      The current paper seeks to expand the literature by studying licensing between rival firms operating under general cost functions. Our motivation is based on theoretical and also on empirical grounds. On the one hand, we are interested in seeing how the general properties of cost functions (e.g., subadditivity, superadditivity) affect licensing policies, in particular the diffusion of new technologies and the optimal combination of fees and royalties. On the other hand, empirical data shows that licensing policies vary from industry to industry. Given that modern industries differ also in the degree of returns to scale in production, our second goal is to bring forward the latter as an empirical factor that potentially interacts with actual licensing policies.

We carry out our analysis in a Cournot duopoly with a general demand function. Initially both competing firms produce under the same cost function. One of the firms obtains a patent on a technological innovation that changes this cost function. The patentee firm can either use the new technology exclusively or license it to its rival. The licensing policies available to the patentee consist of all combinations of linear royalties and upfront fees (two-part tariffs). The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows:

                        
                           1.
                           A drastic technology
                                 3
                              
                              
                                 3
                                 A cost-reducing technological innovation is drastic (Arrow, 1962) if it is significant enough to create a monopoly if only one firm has the new technology; otherwise, it is non drastic.
                               is licensed and both firms are active in the market if the cost function resulting from the new technology is superadditive. If the cost function is additive or subadditive, then a drastic technology is not licensed and the patentee becomes a monopolist.

A non drastic technology is licensed if at the licensee’s reservation output (i.e. its equilibrium output without a license), the average efficiency gain from the technology is (weakly) higher than the marginal gain.
                                 4
                              
                              
                                 4
                                 At any output the average efficiency gain from the technology is the difference between the pre and post innovation average costs, while the marginal gain is the difference between the corresponding marginal costs.
                              
                           

Whenever licensing occurs, it is always optimal to set positive royalties. Furthermore if the technology is significantly superior, upfront fees are also positive for superadditive cost functions. For additive cost functions, licensing involves only royalties and no fees and the same conclusion holds for subadditive functions under certain additional assumptions.

To see the basic intuition behind these findings, consider first a drastic technology. Under subadditivity (increasing returns to scale), the maximum profit attainable in the industry is the monopoly profit. As the patentee can become a monopolist by exclusively using a drastic technology, it has no incentive to license such a technology to its rival. Under superadditivity (decreasing returns), the monopoly profit might no longer be the maximum attainable profit. In this case higher cost efficiency, and consequently higher industry profit, is achieved when both firms are active. As a result, licensing occurs and the market is not monopolized.

In the case of a non drastic technology, there is a specific rate of royalty that induces a market equilibrium which replicates the equilibrium under no licensing (i.e., market prices are the same under the two regimes). Under this royalty, the market profit of the patentee is the same as its profit under no licensing. Adding the royalty revenues tilts the scale in favor of licensing. The assumption that the average efficiency gain from the new technology is higher than the marginal gain guarantees that the licensee accepts this policy.

Optimal royalties are determined by two factors. First, the patentee intends to create a relatively inefficient rival and second, it has to consider how the rival’s efficiency affects its own marginal cost. Under increasing returns to scale, these two factors work in the same direction. A less efficient rival implies larger output and lower marginal cost for the patentee. Hence, the patentee has incentives to restrict the rival’s output under increasing returns, which is achieved by setting higher royalties. Under decreasing returns, the two factors do not work in the same direction, as creating a less efficient rival results in larger output and higher marginal cost for the patentee. For this reason the patentee is inclined to set lower royalties (and higher fees) under decreasing returns.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. The results are derived in Section 3. The last section concludes.

The set of licensing policies we consider is the set of all combinations of royalties and upfront fees (two-part tariffs) of the form (r, α) where r ≥ 0 is a unit royalty and α ≥ 0 is an upfront fee.

A1–A5 are standard assumptions which guarantee uniqueness and stability of Cournot equilibrium (see, e.g., Gaudet & Salant, 1991; Kamien, Oren, & Tauman, 1992; Vives, 2001) under any licensing configuration.

In this paper we consider three classes of cost functions: superadditive, subadditive and additive. Superadditivity represents production technologies characterized by decreasing returns to scale in production whereas subadditivity represents increasing returns. Additivity corresponds to constant returns.

                               An additive cost function thus results in constant marginal cost of production. If the initial technology 0 and the new technology ε both have additive cost functions, then the magnitude of the cost reduction from the new technology for every unit of production is

The strategic interaction between the two firms is modeled as an extensive-form game G that has three stages. In the first stage, firm 1 decides whether to license the new technology ε to firm 2 or not. If firm 1 decides to license, it offers firm 2 a licensing policy (r, α). In the second stage, firm 2 decides whether to accept or reject any licensing policy offered. Finally, in the third stage the two firms simultaneously choose quantities q
                     1, q
                     2 in the Cournot duopoly.

If firm 2 has a license of technology ε under a policy (r, α), it pays firm 1 the upfront fee α and in addition pays royalty r for every unit it produces. If firm 2 does not have a license, it produces with technology 0. Let λ be the indicator variable with

                        To find SPNE of G, for every r ≥ 0 and λ ∈ {0, 1}, we need to determine Nash equilibrium (NE) of the corresponding Cournot duopoly where firms 1, 2 choose q
                        1, q
                        2 to obtain profits given by

                           7
                           Since α is a lump-sum transfer paid upfront, it has no effect on the outcomes of the Cournot duopoly. As firm 1’s choice of q
                              1 does not affect its royalty revenue λrq
                              2, this revenue can be left out from the profit of firm 1 at the Cournot stage. However, for firm 2, its choice of q
                              2 does affect its royalty payments λrq
                              2, so these payments are part of its cost function in the Cournot duopoly.
                         
                        (3). As the cost functions of both firms satisfy A3–A5, existence and uniqueness of NE of the Cournot duopoly is guaranteed under both cases of licensing and no licensing. The notion of drastic technology (Arrow, 1962) will be useful for our analysis.

                           Definition 3
                           The new technology is drastic if it is significant enough to create a monopoly when only one firm uses it; otherwise, it is non drastic.

                        Lemma 2 characterizes Cournot equilibrium and delivers the standard comparative statics results. When there is no licensing, expectedly the quantity of firm 1 increases in the quality of the new technology ε. Our assumptions guarantee that standard effects will then follow: A2 implies that best-replies are negatively sloped, hence quantity of firm 2 falls in ε. A5 implies that the net effect of ε on industry output is positive.

                        ε(r) is negative. The last part of the lemma identifies two specific thresholds of royalties: one that equates firm 2’s Cournot profits with and without a license and the other one that equates its Cournot outputs. These thresholds will be useful to determine licensing policies that are acceptable to firm 2.

                         We are now in a position to determine optimal licensing policies for firm 1.

The following general result shows that royalties must be positive whenever licensing occurs.

                           Proposition 1
                           
                              If firm 1 offers a license to firm 2, it is always optimal to set a positive royalty.
                           

See the Appendix.□


                              Proposition 1 holds under A1–A5 without any further assumptions. However, setting a positive royalty may not necessarily be optimal for a patentee firm when it competes in an oligopoly of size n ≥ 3. In the duopoly model firm 2’s reservation payoff 
                                 
                                    
                                       π
                                       ^
                                    
                                    
                                       ɛ
                                    
                                    2
                                 
                               (i.e., its payoff when it does not have a license) is independent of the rate of royalty r. But in an oligopoly of general size, if a specific firm is without a license, some other firms might have a license; so the reservation payoff of a non-licensee does depend on r. This may lead to a conclusion different from Proposition 1 (see, e.g., Sen & Stamatopoulos, 2009).

Further characterization of optimal licensing policies depends on whether the new technology is drastic or non drastic.

Consider a drastic technology ε. For this case, if firm 2 does not have a license it exits the market and firm 1 becomes a monopolist, i.e.,

                           . Proposition 2 shows that firm 1’s decision to license or not depends crucially on the nature of new technology. It should be also noted that these results do not require any additional assumption on the initial technology 0 apart from A3–A5.

Under additivity or subadditivity of the new technology (constant or increasing returns to scale), the maximum achievable payoff is the monopoly profit

                            Since firm 1 can obtain the monopoly profit by using a drastic technology exclusively, licensing does not occur. Under superadditivity (decreasing returns), the monopoly profit is no longer the upper bound of industry profit, as production of output by a single firm creates cost inefficiencies. For this case firm 1 has an incentive to keep firm 2 active in the market. The presence of two active firms increases efficiency and results in higher surplus than the monopoly profit, which firm 1 extracts via a fee.

We note that the result that a firm might sell a drastic technology to its rival has been obtained in a different context by Faulí-Oller and Sandonís (2002) who analyzed licensing in a differentiated goods duopoly under constant returns to scale. In that framework, a patentee transfers a drastic technology to its rival as it does not want to close the rival’s profitable market. Proposition 2 brings forward an alternative motive of licensing of a drastic technology, namely, cost efficiency under decreasing returns.

                            holds for the standard case studied in the literature where both new and initial technologies have constant returns. The conclusion of part (I) is the same as the result of Sen and Tauman (2007) for a Cournot duopoly with an incumbent patentee.

                            is the threshold that separates non drastic and drastic technologies. Part (II) of the proposition shows that if technology ε
                              D
                            has a superadditive cost function, then for all sufficiently significant non drastic technologies (i.e., technologies ε that are close enough to ε
                              D
                           ) any optimal policy has both royalty and upfront fee.

Note that interval-wise decreasing property at x

                                 0 < y, but it does not specify any order between f(x), f(y) when x, y are both lower (or both higher) than x
                                 0. We shall use this concept to impose further structure on a cost function. Note from Lemma 2 that when there is licensing with zero royalty, both firms produce the same Cournot output. Denote this output by q

Thus, interval-wise decreasing property of the marginal cost at a certain point is a weaker requirement than concavity of the cost function.

In particular, if c
                           ε(q) is subadditive and satisfies the conditions of Proposition 4, then pure royalty emerges as the unique optimal licensing policy. Putting together the results of Propositions 3 and 4, the general conclusion is that for non drastic technologies a patentee licenses to its rival by setting the maximum possible royalty and zero upfront fee for constant or increasing returns (subject to some additional structure on the cost function). By contrast, for decreasing returns, royalties are set lower and there are positive fees.

The result that royalties tend to be higher under increasing returns seems to be consistent with some real life observations on royalty rates in various industries. A recent survey by Held and Parker (2011) computed the average royalty rates in some major industries in USA and Canada for the period 2008–2011. The higher average royalty rates were found in sectors such as aerospace (commercial and military), transportation and information technology and equipment, i.e., sectors usually associated with increasing returns to scale. Of course, one needs to look at industry-specific data for a better understanding of the observed licensing policies. Still, some sort of association between returns to scale and optimal licensing policies seems to be in place.

This paper has analyzed optimal licensing policies of a cost-reducing innovation in a market with general cost functions. In a Cournot duopoly with one of the firms as a patentee, we have derived a fairly complete characterization of licensing policies under a general setting. We have shown that if licensing occurs, then royalties must be positive (Proposition 1), licensing of drastic technologies depends on whether the cost function generated by the new technology is superadditive or subadditive (Proposition 2), licensing of non drastic technologies depends on the relation between the marginal and average efficiency gains obtained from the superior technology (Proposition 3), for significantly superior technologies, superadditivity ensures that fees are positive (Proposition 3) and subadditivity or additivity results in maximum possible royalty and zero fees (Propositions 3 and 4).

In conclusion, we suggest some extensions. The analysis of licensing in a market with n ≥ 3 firms operating under general cost functions is the most natural direction for future work. Another interesting direction is to consider markets where firms compete in prices under non-constant returns. This case is interesting not only for licensing but also from a market equilibrium viewpoint: it is known that a multiplicity of price equilibria emerges when two firms operate in homogeneous goods markets under decreasing returns (Dastidar, 1995). The introduction of licensing changes the objective function of the incumbent patentee in the price stage of the game from

                        We prove the result when c(q) is superadditive. The proofs for subadditive and additive cases follow by similar reasoning. Fix any q > 0. By superadditivity, for any δ > 0, we have

                     Lemma A1 lists the comparative statics properties of outputs and profits of firms with respect to the parameter t. We shall apply these results in specific cases of interest.

                           2(t) and π
                           2(t) are both increasing in t, i.e., the NE output and profit of firm 2 in (a) are higher than the output and profit in (b).□

Since for any λ ∈ {0, 1} and r ≥ 0, A3-A5 hold for cost functions of both firms in (3), the existence and uniqueness of NE follow by A1-A5 (for a proof see, e.g., Gaudet & Salant, 1991). Note from A1–A3 that at the NE, the industry output must be positive and lower than Q
                           0. The following observations will be useful to prove (i) and (ii).□

                                     Hence Q(r) > q(0). Interval-wise decreasing property then implies c′(Q(r)) < c′(q(0)). As ∂Q(r)/∂r < 0, the second term of (10) is bounded below by zero. Since the first term is positive, we conclude that ψ
                                    ε(r) > 0.
