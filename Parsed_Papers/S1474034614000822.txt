                  Most of the assessment of creativity in product design is based on the outcome, not the design process from which the creative ideas are derived. In this paper, we revealed the correlation coefficient of 20 factors critical in the product design process and the quality of design creativity via investigation of the design processes and outcomes of 30 senior student designers. Six closely related factors were identified as variables to calculate the design creativity. An assessment formula was proposed: the corresponding correlation coefficient is the weight factor of each variable, and the sum represents the design creativity degree. Our quantitative approach can improve the validity and reliability of assessment of creativity in product design.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the most important criteria for the quality of performance in design is the creativity applied to the product [19]. Many researchers have developed methods to assess the creativity of product design [27,19,20,51]. However, these subjective and qualitative judgments, in relation to the traditional measurement of creativity, have proved to have insufficient validity and reliability [16]. In most traditional product design studios, assessment of design creativity is based on consensual agreement among evaluators. Aside from the issue of subjective judgment, the selection of appropriate evaluators is a great challenge. Expert judges are difficult to find, and they may develop rater fatigue after a certain number of ratings. In academia, the traditional way that teachers assess creativity has often relied on the assessors’ subjective judgment along with a tacit understanding of what is creative. Commonly, there are not enough raters involved in one class, which makes the practice inappropriate from a quality assurance perspective [57,58]. The students may argue that the teacher cannot recognize their creative efforts. Hence, it is urgently needed to build an objective and unified standard for assessment of creativity in design so that the validity, reliability and applicability of assessment can be improved.

Furthermore, creativity is more likely to emerge from the design process, in what is often characterized by the occurrence of a significant event, a ‘creative leap’ [27]. However, to date, evaluators of creativity are not always well informed of how a design developed, or they are apathetic about the extent to which a final outcome reflects the reasoning of the designer throughout the design process [16]. In other words, most of the assessment of creativity in design is based on the design outcome instead of the design process [26,52]. In recent years, computational creativity has provided a computational perspective on human creativity, but the notion of evaluation is still based on the judgment of whether an idea or artifact is creative or not [60]. The existing method for assessing creativity in design is insufficient, without consideration of the design process.

To address these issues, the purposes of this research were to:
                        
                           •
                           Investigate the product design process, and consider it as an evaluation criterion in assessment of creativity in product design.

Reveal the correlation between the quality of design creativity and the product design process.

Propose a quantitative approach to assess creativity in product design, in order to provide a rigorous method and tackle the constraint of subjective opinions of experts.

In order to achieve these goals, the methodology in this paper was divided into four parts. First of all, stages and steps in the product design process were identified based on a literature review, and the creativity-related factors in the design process were summarized according to previous endeavors in the literature. Second, 30 design-cases were collected and the verbal protocols were analyzed based on the above-mentioned factors of the design process. Third, the quality of design-creativity of the 30 cases was evaluated by eight experts using the Consensual Assessment Technique. Last, Statistical analysis were employed to calculate the correlation coefficients of all the factors in the product design process and the quality of design creativity. Based on this analysis, an assessment formula was proposed: the corresponding correlation coefficient is the weight factor of each variable, and the sum represents an estimate of the design creativity. Moreover, another experiment was conducted for the evaluation. The result proved that our quantitative approach can reflect the relationships between the crucial factors of the design process and the quality of creative performance. From this, we now believe that this objective method can improve the validity and reliability of assessment of creativity in product design.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we looked at previous studies for understanding creativity in product design, and assessment of creativity. Our methodology is explained in detail in Section 3. In Section 4, we describe our experiment, including the participants, the procedure, the data analysis, and the representation of our approach for the assessment of creativity. We conclude, in Section 5, with a discussion of the potential implications of our approach, and the limitations as well.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

This research is concerned with assessment of creativity in both the product design process and the design outcome. We undertook a critical review of the literature on product design process analysis and creativity assessment methods in order to place our research on creativity assessment within the context of product design.

Having a full understanding of the process that leads to creative designs is of great interest to both academia and industry. For our research, we referred to the literature relating to two aspects: defining the product design process, and the creativity-related factors in the design process.

First of all, we clarify the scope of our research on product design. We argue that product design can be split into two distinct but connected disciplines, engineering design and industrial design. Engineering design concentrates on the factors in product design which concern the product functions. In other words, it aims to make the product work using scientific material and manufacturing knowledge [59]. Moreover, industrial design addresses more the form of the product. It aims to satisfy the customer with its human centered approach [37].

From this, we informed the design process models from both of the two disciplines. Most of the models can be distinguished into descriptive models and prescriptive ones [22]. A generic descriptive model developed by Cross [22] represented the principle of these models. The descriptive models reflected the ‘solution-focused’ nature of design thinking: identify the needs, and then explore alternative solutions (evaluate, refine, and develop solutions). Sometimes, evaluation highlights problems with the initial solutions, then a new design concept will be generated, and the process starts again. The design process is an iterative loop of design activities [73,64].

On the other hand, the prescriptive models are often regarded as providing a particular design methodology by offering more algorithmic and systematic design procedures. Such models also suggested the basic structure of the design process: analysis-synthesis-evaluation, which were defined by Jones [46]. Archer [5] also developed a three-phase prescriptive model of the design process (Fig. 1
                           ); including interactions with the world outside of the design process itself, such as the designers’ training and experience, and information sources. Six types of designer activities were identified. Activities related to analysis, synthesis, and development, were considered the Creative Phase.

Howard et al. [43] analyzed the commonalities of, and differences between, the phases that the previous engineering design processes contain. The general agreement among the authors is that the design stages, are summarized as four major design phases: analysis of task, conceptual design, embodiment design, and detailed design [43].

In product design, ‘creative’ is often taken as a qualification of a final outcome, but cognitive psychology associates it with activity and certain processes that have the potential to produce ‘creative’ artifacts while designing [34,78]. Therefore, some design processes aimed at improvement of creativity have been proposed in the literature, for example, Hsiao and Chou [44] suggested a creativity-based product design process including three essential stages: divergence; transformation; and convergence.

The factors which can affect creativity in the design process are also discussed a lot. Studies of expert and outstanding designers suggest that problem framing ability [70] is crucial to high-level performance in creative design [24]. Ennis and Gyeszly [30] noted that acquisition of information was an integral part of the product design process. The C–K theory [39,40], which describes design as a process of movement between a concept space and a knowledge space, assumed that a certain quantity of knowledge must be gained during each phase of the process in order to complete a design [43]. In a study of 50 designers, Fricke [33] concluded that ‘solid’ background knowledge and high heuristic competence were significantly correlated with design quality. Those students who had more transitions along the steps in the design process, proved better performers regarding design quality [54]. In summary, the creativity-related factors reviewed in the literature include:
                              
                                 •
                                 
                                    Design process: the time arrangement of the design stages and the steps within the stages, and the transition between them.


                                    Information gathering: the amount and the categories of information requisition.


                                    Alternative solutions: the amount of alternative solutions generated during the design process.

Based on these three aspects, we would define crucial factors in product design process in order to investigate and present the design process precisely.

Since Eastman’s pioneer work studying interior design in the late 1960s [28,29], protocol analysis has become one of the well-established empirical research tools in the field of design research [21,23,31].

Design protocols are usually in the form of recordings of designer’s overt behaviors, like verbalization, sketches and audio-visual recordings captured by cameras [1]. The ‘think aloud’ technique is typically used, in which designers are requested to verbalize their thoughts as the work proceeds on a given task. The verbalization can slow down the design process moderately, but the requirement of concurrent verbalizing does not disturb working memory, nor change the sequence of a designer’s thoughts [31]. A number of protocol studies have investigated the cognitive activities and processes of single designers [35,47]. For example, Atman et al. [6] collected the verbal protocol of 26 freshman and 24 senior engineering students as they performed an open-ended design problem, and compared the differences between their design processes by measuring the design process and the design product quality. In this study, we refer to the method of Atman et al. for measurement of the design process, and customized our coding scheme based on their earlier endeavor.

Design and creativity are inseparably connected to each other. Because of its important status, creativity has been discussed many times in the field of product design research. Most of the research can be divided into two areas: creativity in the process of product design, and creativity in the design outcome – results of the design process [74]. From the process point of view, the studies emphasized rational decision-making in finding a design solution within “a problem-solving process” [71]. Protocol analysis was also used widely to inform cognitive features of the creative design process [23]. Numbers of creative design process model were developed for different objects. Ullman et al. [75] described the Task Accumulation Model of mechanical design to explain the behavior of designers, while Pease and Colton [60], Maher et al. [53] proposed a creative design model based on the “co-evolution” of the problem space and the solution space in the design process, to validate a computational model of design exploration. Lawson [50] proposed a model of the design process to reveal how designers think. Based on these endeavors, many frameworks and computational models of the design process were then developed to stimulate or enhance creativity; however, there was a serious lack of adequate, systematic and controlled evaluation of these efforts [68]. Design outcomes (product or ideas) have usually been investigated to evaluate creativity in product design for novelty and practicality – the criteria offered by Sternberg and Lubart [72].

Psychometric methods are predominant in the assessment of creativity, and have been applied to the creative process, personality and behavioral correlates of creativity, characteristics of creative products and attributes of creativity fostering environments. Several metrics for creativity have been used in design domain, with some focused on the person and others on the product, artifact or system concerned. The Creative Product Semantic Scale [13,56] measures product creativity by scoring novelty, resolution and style. Redelinghuys [61] proposed an equation for the explicit quantification of product creativity. The product design characteristics, quality, design expertise and creativity were mathematically interrelated, and a creative effort-quality-expertise (CEQEX) diagram was introduced for the measurement of creativity. Creative Product Analysis Matrix was established as a framework for measuring the creativity manifested in many different kinds of products [14]. More recently, Horn and Salvendy [42] investigated the composition of product creativity by examining the elements of products from the consumer’s perspective. Six main product-creativity dimensions and the percentages of the total variance accounted for by each were identified (resolution 27%; emotion 9%, centrality 8%; importance 8%; desire 7%; and novelty 6%). Casakin and Kreitler [16] reported the use of the criteria for evaluating creativity in architecture design. The first four variables were the standard variables proposed by Guilford [36] dealing with fluency, flexibility, elaboration, and innovation. The second set of four variables, considered as essential in the domain of architecture, included: mastery of aesthetic skills for design representation, fulfilling design requirements, usefulness, and consideration of the provided physical context.

In summary, to date there is no unified method for measurement of creativity in product design, and none of the existing approaches is able to make a clear and objective assessment of creativity in a product design with consideration of both the design process and the design outcome.

The Consensual Assessment Technique was first proposed by Teresa Amabile in 1982 and further developed by her and other researchers in the last quarter century [2–4,7,8,10,41,48]. It has become a new, well validated tool for assessing creativity.

Rather than measuring things that might be associated with creativity, the CAT goes right to the heart of creativity by looking at the products that subjects produced. As Csikszentmihalyi [25] claimed: “Originality, freshness of perception, divergent thinking ability are all well and good in their own right, as desirable personal traits. But without some sort of public recognition they do not constitute creativity.” The CAT is based on the rather simple idea that the best measurement of the creativity of a work of art, a theory, or any other artifact is the combined assessment of experts in that domain. In fact, we never compute a creativity score by filling some checklist or a general creativity-assessment rubric in real life, no matter if it is the Nobel Prize being considered, or an informal classroom competition [47,49,48].

The most common kinds of creative tasks evaluated have been the writing of poems or short stories, but the potential range of creative products that can be used in CAT is quite wide. Its widest use is in research, for instance, Baer [7,9] studied the effects on creativity of teaching different skills and content knowledge; Runco [65] and Ruscio et al. [67] tested the degree to which creativity is either a general or domain-specific skill; Hennessey [41] investigated the relationship between process and product in creativity. CAT can also be used for school-based tasks such as selecting highly creative students for special programs. For example, the Governor’s School of the Art and some art-centered schools like Julliard have employed CAT for creative performance ratings [11].

The procedure for using the CAT is simple and feasible. First, subjects are asked to create something (e.g., a poem, a short story, a collage, a composition, an experimental design). Second, experts in the domain are asked to evaluate the creativity of the things that the subjects have made. The experts work independently and do not influence one another’s judgments in any way. They are simply asked to use their expert sense of what is creative in the domain in question, to rate the creativity of the products in relation to one another. The average number of expert judges reported [4] in the previously cited studies was just over ten. For most purposes, five to ten experts represent a sufficiently large group [48].

Inter-rater reliability using the CAT is typically estimated using Cronbach’s coefficient alpha, the Spearman–Brown prediction formula, or the intra-class correlation method. These methods generally yield similar inter-rater reliability estimates [48].

CAT has been called the “gold standard” of creativity assessment [12] for these reasons:
                              
                                 •
                                 CAT is independent of definitions of creativity. Unlike the divergent thinking tests, CAT is not tied to any particular theory of creativity. It “mimics the way creativity is assessed in the ‘real world’ [11]”.

CAT is based on complete products or performances rather than elements.

CAT uses the comparative ratings of experts, as is standard in most domains.

We chose CAT as the creativity assessment method of design outcome in our study for the same reasons.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

In this study, we proposed a quantitative approach for creativity assessment using experimental methodology composed of three parts (as shown in Fig. 2
                     ). After we defined the scope of creativity and product design for this research, we conducted design experiments to investigate creativity in the design process and for the design outcome. Protocol analysis was employed for quantification of the design process, and the creative quality of the design outcome was evaluated by Consensual Assessment Technique. Next, the correlation coefficient of the factors in the product design process, and the creativity quality of the design outcome was revealed by the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient to identify the crucial factors in the product design process. And the degree that the factors influence the design creativity was calculated via regression analysis. Finally, a quantitative approach was proposed with the weighted value of each crucial factor in the design process, with the summation used as the comparative creativity quality. Details follow.

For appropriate and repeatable evaluative practice, it is necessary to state clearly what standards are used for evaluation or assessment. In this study, we defined creativity in product design within two aspects – the design outcome and the design process. For the outcome, we adopted [66] definition, scoping creativity as ordinary creativity, and the core components are originality and effectiveness/usefulness. On the other hand, creativity is associated with the process which has the potential to product ‘creative’ artifacts; we define the creativity as the crucial factors in the design process which are closely related to the design outcome.

Furthermore, because the core of this research is the creativity in product design, which is believed to emerge more in the conceptual stage of design [18], so the product design process in this study is actually the front-end process [76]: the design planning, concept development, system-level design and detail design stages of the whole product development process. We defined the product design process based on the product concept development process we surveyed in the literature review (see Section 2.2.1).

Three design stages including eight design steps are defined in this study, as shown in Fig. 3
                        .

The entire process rarely proceeds in purely sequential order, completing each step before beginning the next. The steps may be overlapped in time and iteration is necessary in practice. The dashed arrows in Fig. 3 reflect this uncertain nature of the product design process. At almost every stage, new information may become available or results learned which can cause the designer to step back to repeat an earlier step before proceeding. This information is acquired by the designers with different kinds of design considerations or requirements. In this study, we sort the design consideration into four categories: functional analysis, appearance consideration, users’ experience analysis, and product elements analysis.

Identifying the problem is an integral part of the overall process and is most closely related to design concept generation and concept selection. The goal of this stage is to understand users’ needs and to effectively generate and evaluate the design concepts in the next stage. The output of this stage is a set of carefully constructed users’ need statements and a list of problem specifications. The output of this stage can ensure the concept exploration is focused on the users’ needs, and provide a fact base for justifying the concepts and decision making. Three steps are included in this stage:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Identify users’ needs: Most of the design process begins with an initial statement of a ‘need’. According to the requirement of the design task, designers will assume the users’ needs based on their expertise and experiences.


                                 Define the problems: a precise description of what are the problems that the product has to solve. It consists of developing a general understanding and then breaking the problem down into sub-problems if necessary.


                                 Gather information: collect information to specify the users’ need and design problems as the requirements which will be embodied in the solution and also about the constraints.

The second stage of the product design process is developing alternative solutions. In this stage, designers will thoroughly explore the design space of product concepts that may address the users’ need and solve the defined problems. A design concept is an approximate description of the users’ need, form of the product, and the technology. It is usually expressed as a sketch accompanied by a brief textual description. The result of this stage is usually a set of design concepts, typically represented by a sketch and brief descriptive text.
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Generate design concepts: this step begins with a set of users’ need and design problem specifications and results in a set of product concepts from which the designer will make a final selection.


                                 Feasibility analysis: this step is the process of evaluating the concepts with respect to the pre-defined users’ need and design problems, comparing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the concepts, and selecting one or more concepts for further investigation, testing, and development. The number of concepts selected for further review is supposed to be limited by the resources (time, money) and the designers’ preference.


                                 Test concepts: Concept testing is essentially an experimental activity which addressed the questions: which of the several alternative concepts should be pursued, and how can the concept be improved to meet the users’ needs.

After the design concepts have been tested according to the problem specification set earlier in the design process, once the designer is satisfied with the understanding of each design concept and its relative quality, he/she will decide which concept is to be selected for further refinement and analysis. The design proceeds to the last stage – project realization.
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Decision making: the final selection is not simply choosing the concept that achieves the highest ranking after the first evaluation in the process. Rather, the designer should explore the concept space through several circulation of the former two stages in the design process, and then generate the optimized design concept.


                                 Implementation: designers complete the design process by making information-intensive drawings of the final concept. It documents the details of the design, including functionality, features, sizes, colors, and key dimensions, and depicts the product in use.

Thus far, the whole design process is completed, including three stages which are composed with eight design steps.

In addition, the designer may require and acquire information, change their design focus in almost any stage of the design process according to their design considerations. Except the steps of the product design process, we also wanted to explore what kind of design emphasis would result in more creative design outcomes. For this purpose, four categories of design considerations are defined in this study.
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Functional analysis: the designers perform the design task with regards to the function of the product. The overall function of the design can be broken down into a set of essential subfunctions depends on different designers’ different interpretation. The essential function that a design solution will be required to satisfy is more useful for product design [22].


                                 Appearance consideration: the designers perform the design task focusing on the appearance of the product, including the form, color, and surface treatment.


                                 Users’ experience analysis: the designers perform the design task with the consideration of users’ experience, including user product interaction (users’ emotional and behavioral experience), the usability of the product, and the accessibility of the product.


                                 Product element analysis: the designers perform the design task concerning about the economics and manufacture elements of product, including the materials, budget, production technology.

We defined the design process specifically. And the next step, we tried to analyze the practical design process and quantify the process precisely in order to provide an objective and rigorous evidence for the investigation of creativity-related factors in the design process.

After we defined the creativity for this study, and clarified the steps and stages of the design process, we conducted an experiment to investigate the correlation of the design process and creativity of the design outcome. There is no direct measure of the thinking processes of designers. In our study, all the designers’ behavior and verbal expression during the experiments were recorded, and we used a verbal protocol analysis to understand and describe the process of product design.

In order to quantify the design process, we developed multiple measures to describe the product design process, based on the creativity-related factors that we summarized from the literature (see Section 2.2.2). Five categories, including twenty factors were investigated precisely (Table 1
                           ).

Numbers of alternative solutions (F

First of all, we assumed that the main external difference in the design processes was the arrangement of time for each step and stage. Therefore, we precisely recorded the total time for each participant and the time spent in each design step and stage. Then we calculated the percentage of time spent in each step and stage for the purpose of quantifying the differences in the design processes of the various participants.

Second, since the design process is a cyclic, iterative procedure [45], the transition that the participants made as they went through the design steps and stages was another focus for analysis of the design process. The number of times that participants moved from one step or stage to another was recorded.

Third, we checked the number of criteria the participants considered in their design process. We categorized such design considerations into four clusters: function, appearance, user experience and product elements. This helped us figure out what kind of design consideration would bring out the more creative design outcome.

Fourth, information acquisition was identified as an integral part of the design process [30]. We tallied the number of explicit requests for information and the number of information categories that were covered by the requests.

Finally, to reflect divergent thinking, the number of alternative solutions the participants generated during their design process was examined. Divergent thinking has been viewed as a means for measuring creative thinking abilities for nearly a century, and it is presumably useful for measuring the ability to generate new ideas, directly and effectively [38].

In the design experiments, we collected concurrent protocols using the think aloud method, which is widely used for collecting data from a single designer’s activities and speech about thoughts or feelings. The think aloud protocols are unstructured data for a single designer’s thinking process and contain no self-interpretative information in the verbalization [77]. Therefore, the main task of the protocol analysis is to structure the information [55]. We developed a customized coding scheme referring to the research of Atman et al. [6], and then the transcripts of the audio-and videotaped protocols were segmented into units in preparation for coding and quantification. The segmented transcript was then imported into Nvivo 8 for data analysis.

Four variables were taken into account in our coding scheme (Table 2
                           ). First, design stages and design steps used for the analysis were defined based on the common agreement of the design process in the literatures. Second, activity identified the behavior of the participants, such as reading related information or calculating the product dimensions. Third, the amount of design consideration, such as function, appearance, which the participant performed in each design stage was calculated. And last, the information processed identified the types of information that the participants addressed in the segment.

In this part of the study, we aimed to investigate the correlation of the design process and the design creativity. The measure of creativity was implemented through the use of the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT). We modified the CAT so that it would relate more directly to a product, to address the specific focus of our research. The CAT method assesses the areas of creativity, aesthetics and technical quality separately. We asked the raters to estimate these three aspects in order to prevent the creativity score given from being mixed with the judgment of other aspects.

The scores of these three categories were derived from the raters’ personal definition of creativity, aesthetics and technical quality. Creativity is supposed to include the degree to which the idea was novel or unusual, and the feasibility of the concept. The aesthetic score may consist of the overall aesthetic appeal, and the appearance of a pleasing product. Technical quality can be assessed by the degree to which the concept considers the technical requirements, and how well those needs were met. After we collected the responses from all the raters, Cronbach’s coefficient alpha was used to examine the inter-rater reliability of the CAT scores.

In addition, it has been proven that students who have mastered graphic skills are frequently assessed to be more successful [79]. To avoid the effect of presentation skills on assessment of creativity, all of the design outcomes – the participants’ submitted sketches – were redrawn in a uniform style by another designer. Examples are shown in Fig. 4
                        . The design explanation of each work was hard-printed on another paper and attached to the sketches.

Once we quantified the product design process and got the creativity score, we were able to figure out the relationships between design creativity and the 20 factors of the design process. We ranked the creativity score and the data of each factors (Fig. 5
                        ), and then calculated the correlation coefficients. A positive result indicated a positive correlation between this factor and design creativity, and a negative coefficient meant a negative correlation.

The Spearman Rank Correlation was employed for our purpose because most of the data we collected from the design process was not normally distributed. Spearman Rank Correlation is a non-parametric measure of statistical dependence between two variables (Eq. (1)). It assesses the strength of the relationship between two variables, and describes the association by a monotonic function.

Then we identified the factors closely related to design creativity. At last, we used regression analysis to investigate the potential that the factors could produce creativity outcome.

Thirty-two senior student designers from a school of art and design at a Chinese national university were recruited for the study. Thirty-two sets of raw data were collected in case of some accidental situations. Afterwards, 30 samples would be analyzed as valid data. Statistically, “large collections of random samples of at least 30 follow a normal curve pattern” [32]. Thirty valid samples were collected for the empirical study in this research, to ensure the validity of the correlation coefficients of factors of the product design process and design creativity. The participants were all Chinese. Among them, there were 14 females and 16 males, and the average age was 21.8 (SD 1.76). The participants were all studying in the product design department, and had experience of involvement in design projects or had been interns at design companies. This ensured that the participants had mature enough design education to fulfill the design task, as well as the experience necessary to make the study meaningful.

The task developed for these studies was designed to be challenging, realistic, appropriate for the participants, feasible in the time available and within the sphere of knowledge of the researchers. The assignment was to create a concept for a ‘portable communication device’, which is typical as far as product designer practice in concerned. Meanwhile, it can call for the integration of a variety of aspects, such as ergonomics, construction, engineering, aesthetics and business aspects. We specified the design target as university students, a target familiar to the student designers, so they could fulfill the user study more realistically and comprehensively.

In addition, the participants were given 90min to finish their design task, which is the same time constraint for classroom project development as in their compulsory major courses.

Furthermore, no indication was given to the participants of the creativity score that would be assessed after the design task because of the participant bias. In creativity research, the instructions of an experiment or test given to participants usually ‘deliberately leave out the real reason for doing the experiment’ [15]. If the participants know the reason, they will adapt their performance in ways they think appropriate to the aims, rather than behaving as they did normally. For the authenticity of the design process, we adopted this established convention.

The experiment was composed with four phases: introduction phase, design phase, data collection phase, data analysis phase, as shown in Fig. 6
                           , the detail of each phase was explained in the following.

Before the design task began, we organized an introduction phase. Brief instructions similar to those of Ericsson and Simon [31] were used to introduce the procedure of the experiment to the participants. Also, the participants got ‘think aloud’ practice in the introduction phase. We also prepared all the necessary information in advance and handed out the information sheet before the design task. The information included technical information about materials and production techniques, and also a survey of mobile phones. If a designer required information not available on the sheet, a nearby experimenter was able to answer questions.

Instructions for the design task were handed out before the participants launched their design process. The design brief outlined the design problem: design a portable communication device, the stakeholder: a medium-sized telecommunication equipment company, and the designer’s position.

In the design phase, each designer performed the design task individually. And she/he was asked to think aloud as they solved the design problem. The designers were asked to report as continuously as possible what they were thinking as they carried out the design task. When the designer did not speak for over 1min, she/he was reminded by the experimenter to verbalize her/his thoughts. The experimenter stayed behind the video recorder to observe and capture the whole design process, not interfering with the designers. But the experimenter should answer the questions with regard to the design requirements during the design phase.

To ensure the quality and accuracy of the design protocol, we implemented the experiment rigorously, one designer at a time. The concurrent protocol was collected for further analysis. When each designer finished the design task, the materials he/she should submit are: the design solution – final design concepts, general embodiment (material, construction), idea explanation, 1:1 sketch views. At the end of data collection phase, we asked another product designer beyond the experiment participants to redraw all of the design outcomes into a unified style. The standardized thirty sketches were then regarded as the valid data of design outcome in our study.

Next, the audio- and videotaped protocols were then transcribed. The transcripts were segmented into units for coding and quantitative analysis. Meanwhile, the design outcomes of the thirty participants in a random order were sent to eight experts in product design domain. The experts rated the creativity, aesthetics and technical quality of the design outcome using the Consensual Assessment Technique.

Finally the correlation coefficient of the twenty crucial factors in the product design process and the creativity score was calculated. The factors which are closely related to creativity were identified. The degree the factors would affect the design creativity were calculated as the weight value.

The experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions (Fig. 7
                              .) because the data of the whole design process needed to be recorded precisely and completely. In addition to the information sheet, free-hand sketching tools were provided.

After the protocol collection, we transcribed the verbal data. Then the transcripts of the audio-and videotaped protocols were segmented into units in preparation for coding and quantification. The segmented transcript was then imported into Nvivo 8 for coding and further data analysis.

The segmentation was done independently by two lecturers in the same school. The reliability of the segmentation and the coding was measured by calculating the Kappa values between the results. The average reliability for segmentation was 91.1%. One lecturer and one associate professor in the school coded the protocols independently. The inter-rater reliability of the coding was 89.7%. Afterwards, the two coders compared their codes and resolved inconsistencies.

We used the graphical analysis method to visualize the sequence of the design process and to estimate the pre-defined 20 factors of the design process precisely. Fig. 8
                            shows the participant first segment durations of eight design steps, which visualized the arrangement of the design process and the frequency of step transitions over the timeline.

Once we got the data and generated the design process sequence graphics, we rigorously quantified the design process of each designer. The statistics table for two design cases is shown in Table 3
                           .

Eight expert designers were invited as raters for the study. Four were professors in the product design departments of two different universities, and four were product designers working in the design department of an international company. All of the raters had at least eight years professional experience in product design. Raters were instructed to look at all the sketches prior to starting the review, and to grade the sketches in a random order with standardized review forms. Three items: creativity, technical quality and aesthetics, were assessed on a 1.0 to 10.0 scale. Raters worked independently, and ranked the sketches based on their personal interpretation of creativity.

The inter-rater reliability of the scores is estimated using Cronbach’s coefficient alpha. We got a reasonable reliability as 0.82 in this study. The final score of each participant is the mean of the grade given by the eight raters. The CAT score is shown in Figs. 9 and 10
                           
                           . In this study, we proposed to develop an approach for assessment of creativity, so we only used the creativity score for our purpose. The aesthetics and technical quality scores may be used to explore the correlation of the design process and other factors in the subsequent work.

The highest creativity score 8.2 goes to participant 24. And participant 19 got the lowest creativity score 3.1. The average creativity score is 5.8, which means that the raters graded the creativity of the student designers strictly, and the score are a little lower.

Correlation coefficients were calculated to specify the relationships between the design process and design creativity. The thirty valid samples collected in our experiment ensured the reliability of the correlation coefficients. The collected data were input into SPSS v.19.0 to calculate the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient. The coefficient of design creativity and the 20 factors in the design process is shown in Table 4
                           .

Those coefficients with absolute values greater than 0.5 are defined as closely related factors. Hence, we found that the transition behavior (F
                           12, F
                           13) in the design process is positively correlated with the design creativity score, especially the stage transitions. Other relevant factors were time spent generating design ideas (F
                           4), time spent gathering information (F
                           3), the number of information requests (F
                           18), the number of categories of the information requested (F
                           19).

Six crucial factors (F
                        3, F
                        4, F
                        12, F
                        13, F
                        18, and F
                        19) are identified as the variables of the design process, and in the next step, we explored the methodology to specify the weight factor of each variables. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is generally used to find out the strength of a relationship between two variables X and Y, whether they are closely correlated or not. But it cannot estimate the relationship among variables, which is how well we can predict Y from X. In this study, our formula is a predictable assessment of creativity; we should know how well each of the six factors can affect the design creativity. Regression analysis is a statistical technique which is widely used to tackle this issue. Concerning the weight of the variables, we reviewed the relationships of the six factors and design creativity by regression analysis.

The regression analysis used the creativity score as the dependent variable and the six factors which are correlated with creativity as the independent variables. Table 5
                         shows the result of multiple regression analysis. Within the regression analysis, a regression model was also developed through the calculation of IBM SPSS 19.0.

Then, a regression model is generated from the analysis (Eq. (2)).

                        The correlation coefficient (R) and coefficient of determination (R
                        2) for the regression is 0.855 and 0.731 respectively. This suggests a strong positive relationship between the factors and creativity score. The standardized coefficients describe the degree of influence that the factors performed on the design creativity. The factor which affects the design creativity most is F
                        13, the transition between the design stages. The least impact comes from F
                        18, the number of times that the designers request for information. The F
                        =10.885 with the significant value (Sig.) 0.000, which indicates that the regression equation is of great significance statistically, and the independent variables can be used to predict the outcome.

Then, we defined the weight of each variable according to the regression model, and the six crucial factors as the variables of the design process to propose a computational method for assessing the creativity in product design. The design creativity score is composed with the six sets of parameters. Consequently, a formula of creativity assessment was proposed (Eq. (3)).

Since the dimensions of the variables were different with each other. F
                        3 and F
                        4 are the percentage of time, and F
                        12, F
                        13, F
                        18, and F
                        19 are numbers. Thus we cannot merely sum up them directly for the creativity assessment. The creativity measurement is the comparison of the six parameters from a holistic point of view. For the ultimate aim of our study, we should find an appropriate method to transform them to the dimensionless parameters, thereby compare them as an integration which is defined as the representation of design creativity.

Fortunately, the regression analysis actually provides us a more convenient method to solve this problem. On one hand, the standardized coefficients (Beta) from the multiple regression analysis can be directly and readily compared to one another. The higher the Beta value, the stronger the relationship the respective independent variable has with the dependent variable. On the other hand, the unstandardized coefficients (B) allow us to understand the theoretical importance of an independent variable. B expresses the potential effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable in their original units of measurement. Therefore, the B is relatively easy to interpret when variables are measured in concrete units like numbers, percentages, or years. And B values are then used in formulating a multiple regression equation. Consequently, with the unstandardized coefficient calculated in the regression analysis (bold values in Table 5), we can use the raw data of the six factors instead of the dimensionless parameters. Therefore, our creativity assessment formula is Eq. (5):

@&#EVALUATION@&#

A formula for assessing creativity in product design is developed based on the abundant experimental results. It is necessary to evaluate the authenticity and validity of our formula. A small-scale experiment was organized for the evaluation. Let us call the original experiment as experiment1 and the evaluation experiment as experiment2 in order to explain the study clearly.

The identical experiment set-up and procedures as experiment1 were arranged for the evaluation experiment. In experiment2, we only recruited two senior students (Pa and Pb, both male) in the same school, and we selected other two sets of experimental data (P2 and P23) from our experiment1. So, we got four sets of data in experiment2, including the design outcome, the results of protocol analysis, the CAT score. Then, we calculated the creativity degree of the four designers using our creativity assessment formula. The consistency of the calculation result and the CAT score given by the eight experts would verify the validity of our formula. The specific data in the evaluation session are shown in Table 6
                        .

The results of the calculation are that C

                        =10.85, C

The rank of the creativity score calculated by our formula is in conformance with the result of creativity degree evaluated by eight experts in product design domain. Therefore, we can conclude that the creativity assessment formula is effective and reliable for most of the product design cases.

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

In this study, we investigated the correlation coefficient of the design process and the creativity of the design outcome in the context of product design. The data of the experiment showed some important and unexpected results. These are discussed from the five aspects of the design process that we measured precisely.

The time arrangement of the stages in the design process did not affect the design creativity as we expected. Furthermore, the coefficient of the problem defining step was 0.032, meaning that more time spent on framing the problem did not guarantee a higher creative outcome. The most closely related factors were time spent gathering information and time generating design concepts. As aforementioned, the generation of design concepts is a reflection of the designer’s divergent thinking, and this result also supports the statement.

The transition between the design stages and steps is evidence of the designers’ active thinking skills. The transition behavior both between design steps and design stages were closely related to design creativity. We propose that the more transitions that appeared in the three design stages, the more complete circulation in the design process, and consequently, the more creative design ideas produced.

We found that the focus of the designer’s consideration cannot decide whether the design outcome will be creative or not. Even excessive attention on product elements may reduce the creativity. Another relatively highly related factor was user experience. User experience may illuminate the designer’s creativity beyond the designed product itself.

For each set of the design process data, we counted the number of the information request and the number of information categories that were covered by the requests. The data shows that the more information the designer required, and the more kinds of information gathered, the greater the creativity achieved. The result supported that information seeking plays a key role in engineering design practice [62,63]. Further, we found that information seeking is essential for design creativity. This association should be studied deeply. The visual information analysis [17] suggested methods to analyze the information seeking in the product design, which would benefit us in the understanding of the design activities in design process in our future work.

The fact proves that the number of the alternative solutions generated during the product design process slightly correlated to the design creativity. As the proverb says, the quantity does not equal to quality. The designers who develop a lot of alternative solutions may not generate a really creative design outcome finally. On the contrary, the designers who develop a limited number of design concepts, if they cope with their design task in a creativity-oriented way, can achieve better results.

In summary, we identified six crucial factors in the design process, and a quantitative approach for assessment of creativity was therefore proposed using a combination of the six factors and their corresponding correlation coefficients. Assessing the degree of creativity is necessary to help select the most creative product [69]. This also helps to assess the degree of innovation taking place in design firms and could help identify better inventors and designers.

In addition, several limitations existing in this study we would list here.

Firstly, we set up the experiment with the time constraint in order to control the size of the protocol data. And we found that all of 32 the participants completed the design task within the time constraint-90min. The differences among their time cost were no more than ten minutes. So, in the result, the rank of the absolute time of the design steps and stages were exactly same with the rank of the relative time. The correlation of the total time cost and design creativity is ignored in our experiment. But we assume that the situation would be different in the real design project. Even the designers will get the design task with a certain time limitation, it will not be as strict as in our experiment; designers may take different time to finish the same task, and the difference may be notable. Although the relative time is more reasonable for analyzing the correlation of design sequence and the design creativity, whether the long period of design can produce the more creative design outcome should be investigated. Another experiment without time constraint will be conducted to examine these issues.

Secondly, the quality of design creativity rated in this study is the CAT score of design outcomes instead of investigating the emergence of creativity in the whole design process. Because the identification of a thought process as creative would finally depend on “the fruit of the process – a product or response [4]”. We believed that the correlation coefficient of the product design process and the creativity quality of design outcome could reveal the relationship of creativity and product design process more objectively and systematically.

We described the product design process in a quantitative and objective manner, and we assessed the quality of design creativity via CAT by eight expert raters’ subjective judgment. This combination of objective and subjective methods occurred for two reasons: First, the creativity measurement cannot be achieved by objective analysis alone; it also requires some type of subjective assessment [4]. The second reason concerns the vague and disagreeable definition of creativity, which is clearly avoided in the direct and unveiled assessment technique -subjective measure.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The significance of this research lies in its empirical examination of the correlation coefficients between factors of the product design process and quality of design creativity, with the consequent proposal of a quantitative approach for rigorous assessment of creativity in product design. The contributions of this study are outlined as follows:
                           
                              •
                              Filled a gap in the existing research on creativity assessment – the separation of the design process and design outcomes.

Provided empirical evidence for the correlation of the product design process and the quality of design creativity.

Proposed a rigorous and quantitative method to measure creativity in product design in an effort to establish a standard for assessment of creativity in product design for both industry and academia.

Provided a basis for future research into the correlation of other aspects of product design and creativity.

We believe that we can identify the more creative designers, products and concepts by this formula if the design process were recorded precisely. Although this approach may be tedious and time consuming, however, with the widely used statistic software, such assessment work can be done by computer. Instead of the protocol analysis, the visualization and representation of the design process has become more efficient and intelligent with the use of the thriving computer aided design tools. For example, Kim and Kim [49] developed a computational tool named DesignScape to capture and visualize the design process. Exploring a method to embed our approach into the design process capturing tools is the focus of our follow-up work. In summary, our future work includes three critical parts. The formula will be further refined through the analysis of design process without time constraint. We will examine the generality of the formula by implementing it to the designers in other countries. Moreover, we will develop the embedded creativity assessment tool in the computer aided design software which can capture and visualize the design process accurately. Eventually, our approach can be developed and used as a rigorous and powerful creativity assessment tool.
