                  For hexagonal cells, we obtain a geometric criterion characterizing the failure of the interpolation property. As a corollary, we conclude that a hexagonal cell such that its six interior edges lie on three lines fails the interpolation property if and only if the cell is projectively equivalent to a regular hexagonal cell. Along the way, we obtain an explicit basis for the vector space

Suppose that A is a finite set of points in 
                        
                           
                              R

                     . The condition that a polynomial of a fixed degree vanishes on A can be expressed as a system of linear equations in the coefficients of the polynomial. A classically studied problem asks under what conditions on A are these equations linearly independent. One example of a (classical) answer to that question appears in Fact 2.3. We consider a version of this problem, replacing polynomial functions with splines.

                        6
                     , Alfeld et al. (1987) show that if

                      is the triangulation of a regular (up to an affine transformation) hexagon such that its 6 interior edges lie on 3 lines, then

                      fails the interpolation property (and thus is unconfinable). But it was not clear, for instance, whether this is the only example of a hexagonal cell with an unconfinable interior vertex. The problem was mentioned again in Alfeld (2000).

We show in Corollary 2.8 that if

                      is a triangulation such that all of its interior edges lie on three lines, then 
                        
                           
                              Δ

                      fails the interpolation property if and only if the hexagon is regular up to a projective transformation. We obtain the corollary as a consequence of a more general characterization in Theorem 2.2. Both the corollary and the theorem allow us to describe new classes of hexagonal cells with an unconfinable interior vertex. It is worth noting that the characterization of the interpolation property we find has a distinct geometric flavor; this was also the case in the study of interpolation properties of linear splines (see Davydov et al., 2000, and references therein).

Section 2 contains the statements of the main results: Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.8. The proof of Theorem 2.2 is also in Section 2, modulo the proofs of two lemmas. We chose to separate the proofs of the two technical lemmas to Section 3 to make the structure of the main argument more transparent. Corollary 2.8 is proved in Section 4.

                            that satisfies (1) and (2) of Proposition 1.1 will be called a basic spline.

The proof will consist of two parts: we first establish the existence of a single basic spline under a technical assumption about the angles between certain edges (Lemma 1.4). We then show in Lemma 1.5 that one can always label the boundary vertices so that the technical assumption is satisfied for sufficiently many edges.

For Lemma 1.4, we will need the following identity.

                        Remark 1.6
                        There are interesting connections between the basic splines described in this paper and the locally linearly independent basis splines studied in Davydov (1998) and Davydov and Schumaker (2000). Namely, the locally linearly independent bases for cells that appear in Davydov and Schumaker (2000, Section 4) satisfy the property in Proposition 1.1(1). By Lemma 1.4, the locally linearly independent basis splines supported on three triangles in Davydov and Schumaker (2000) are, up to a constant multiple, the splines described in Lemma 1.4(II).

The paper Davydov (1998) presents locally linearly independent bases for the splines of degree at least 5. We are grateful to the referee for pointing out that, due to the isomorphism between the Bernstein–Bezier nets of

Here is the plan for the proof. First we establish that if Δ does not have the interpolation property, then the boundary vertices of Δ must lie on a conic (this follows from a classical result, for example, Fact 2.3 below); and no four points are collinear (Lemma 2.4). After that, we obtain the needed characterization of the failure of the interpolation property for hexagonal cells, the boundary vertices of which lie on a conic with no four boundary vertices collinear.

Thus, six points will fail to impose independent conditions on quadratic polynomials if and only if the six points lie on a conic (if any 4 points are collinear, then the set of 6 points will lie on a conic). If Δ fails the interpolation property, then, in particular, the boundary vertices do not impose independent conditions on quadratic polynomials; so the boundary vertices must lie on a conic. The next step is to establish that if the interpolation property fails for

                           If Δ does not have the interpolation property for its boundary vertices, then no four of the boundary points are collinear.
                        

The proof of the lemma is in Section 3. The lemma allows us to focus on the hexagonal cells such that the boundary vertices lie on a conic and no 4 vertices are collinear. Let us call such cells conic cells. The following proposition characterizes the failure of the interpolation property first in terms of linear algebra, and then the linear algebra condition is translated into the geometric characterization in terms of cross-ratios.

For a class of hexagonal cells, the geometric condition takes a particularly clear form. Call a hexagonal cell concordant if all six interior edges lie on three lines. For such cells, we have a particularly easy to state characterization of the interpolation property.

                        Remark 2.9
                        We note that there are non-concordant hexagonal cells that fail the interpolation property (and so their interior vertices are unconfinable). Let us describe a family of such cells. The interior vertex is at the origin, and the boundary vertices are all on the unit circle.

It is easy to check that each such cell will fail the interpolation property. When

                              =

                              3
                           , we get the regular hexagonal cell (which is, of course, concordant); but if 
                              α
                              <
                              π
                              /
                              3
                           , then the cells are not concordant.

It would be interesting to obtain a complete description of all the hexagonal cells that do not have the interpolation property.


                     
                        Proof of Lemma 2.4
                        Suppose at least four boundary vertices are collinear; we show that Δ does have the interpolation property. Since Δ is an interior cell, the boundary vertices are not all collinear. Thus we have two cases: exactly 4 points are collinear or 5 points are collinear. The arguments for the two cases use different ideas, both of which will be also used later.


                           Case 1, four collinear vertices. Suppose that exactly four of the boundary vertices lie on a line L. In this case, the boundary vertices impose 5 independent conditions on the space of quadratic functions (we can select 5 boundary points no 4 of which are collinear and apply Fact 2.3). We are trying to establish that the vertices impose 6 independent conditions on 
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                                 
                                    1

                              Δ
                              )
                           ; thus, it remains to find a spline whose values at the boundary vertices are not interpolated by any quadratic function.

                        1

                        (
                        3
                        )
                      gives the Corollary. Throughout, we are working in the projective plane. Before stating the proposition, we give an example that will motivate one of the conditions equivalent to the failure of the interpolation property.

                            is clear because projective transformations preserve conic sections and concurrent lines remain concurrent. The vertices of the regular hexagon described in Example 4.1 are on the unit circle and each set of lines

                            requires some work. The main idea is this: we show that a concordant cell satisfying (2) is completely determined by a certain set of four points, and these four points form a projective frame. It is well known that for any pair of projective frames there is a projective transformation taking one frame to another (and thus taking the given cell to a regular hexagonal cell).
