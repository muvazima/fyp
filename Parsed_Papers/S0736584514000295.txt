                  Cable winding is an alternative technology to create stator windings in large electrical machines. Today such cable winding is performed manually, which is very repetitive, time-consuming and therefore also expensive. This paper presents the design, function and control system of a developed cable feeder tool for robotized stator cable winding. The presented tool was able to catch a cable inside a cable guiding system and to grab the cable between two wheels. One of these wheels was used to feed cable through the feeder. A control system was integrated in the tool to detect feeding slippage and to supervise the feeding force on the cable. Functions to calculate the cable feed length, to release the cable from the tool and for positional calibration of the stator to be wound were also integrated in the tool. In validating the function of the cable feeder tool, the stator of the linear generator used in the Wave Energy Converter generator developed at Uppsala University was used as an example. Through these experiments, it was shown that the developed robot tool design could be used to achieve automated robotized cable winding. These results also complied with the cycle time assumptions for automated cable winding from earlier research. Hence, it was theoretically indicated that the total winding cycle time for one Uppsala University Wave Energy Converter stator could be reduced from about 80h for manual winding with four personnel to less than 20h in a fully developed cable winding robot cell. The same robot tool and winding automation could also be used, with minor adjustments, for other stator designs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Energy conversion to and from electric energy through electric motors and generators is an essential component of modern society. With the introduction of electric energy conversion from new energy sources, such as wave energy, and increased use of electric motors in the industry, it is likely that the development of such large and medium size electrical machines will continue. An alternative generator design, which will be explored in this article, is the Very High Voltage machine, also known as the Powerformer or Motorformer concept, developed at ABB. The main mechanical difference between this technology and conventional large electrical machines is the cable winding in the stator. Traditionally, the stator winding is made from copper bars or strands of induction wire. Cable wound machines have some significant advantages compared to other technologies, including higher operating voltage level, reduced system losses and fewer winding production steps [1–5]. The design might also be more suitable for harsh off-shore environments where maintenance is complicated and expensive [6]. Some interesting application areas for cable wound machines are in high-voltage motors [7], wind power [8], hydropower [9] and wave power [10].

Manufacturing automation is an important tool in large scale production, especially to be competitive on a global market and to create and keep new industries in countries with higher personnel costs [11–13]. Electric machine assembly has historically become highly automated and efforts are continuously put into find more effective and flexible assembly methods [14–19]. However, an automation method for the stator winding of cable wound generators has not been developed yet. Today, cable winding of electrical machines is done manually in very small series, sometimes with the help of cable feeder tools [20]. This manual assembly is very repetitive, time-consuming and therefore also expensive. Developing a flexible cable winding automation is hence an important step towards wider use of cable wound machines. Within manufacturing automation, industrial robots are rapidly growing in numbers. Less expensive robots with higher performance, easier programming and improved offline simulation software, together with smaller product series, enable automation of complex tasks. Some of these tasks have clear similarities to cable winding [21–23].

An example of a device where cable wound generators are used is the WEC

                     [10,24], see 
                     Fig. 1. The UU WEC uses a direct-drive linear cable wound generator, connected to a point absorbing buoy. The stator of the generator is split in four 2m long and 0.5m wide stator sections. Each stator section has a 15 degree angle in the middle, so the full stator has eight sides towards the translator. The stator is wound with 16mm2 PVC-insulated multi-thread standard installation cables. 
                     Fig. 2 shows a UU WEC cable wound stator section which is mounted inside the generator housing, before the translator is mounted. 
                     Fig. 3 defines some key parts of the UU WEC stator section design.

For the UU WEC concept to be competitive on the global energy market, automated large scale production is required to keep down the cost per WEC unit. A bottleneck in assembling the generator is the stator winding. So far, all UU WEC generator prototypes have all been wound by hand. Such manual winding with four personnel require 20h work per stator section. However, a fully automated stator cable winding method for the UU WEC generator stator has been suggested in previous research [5]. This method uses four industrial robots equipped with cable feeder tools, (see 
                     Fig. 4). The robots work in pairs, positioning against the stator sides to push and pull the cable back and forth through the slot holes of the stator according to a defined winding pattern. As the first robot has grabbed the cable, it positions against the first stator slot hole to be wound. The second robot is simultaneously positioned at the corresponding slot hole on the opposite side of the stator. Thus, the cable can be fed between the robots through the stator. Subsequently, the second robot positions against the next slot hole while the first robot drops the cable and positions on the opposite stator side. This procedure is repeated until the whole stator is wound. For one stator section, 24 cables, each about 25m long, are used. The total cable feed length per robot pair and stator section is about 2500m. A procedure for measuring the exact position of the stator to be wound using a proximity sensor on the robot-held tool has also been developed in previous research [25].

The aim of this paper is to describe and evaluate the design and implementation of a robot held cable feeder tool, designed for robotized cable winding. This tool has been designed specifically for robotized cable winding and is, besides the robot itself, the heart of the cable winding automation. A cable feeder prototype tool has been designed and experimentally validated using the UU WEC generator as an example. However, the same tool principal design can be used for different stator designs, including rotating machines and other cable dimensions.

In the following, Section 2 presents the methods used to design and evaluate the cable feeder tool. Section 3 then describes the design of the final tool design and Section 4 describes the final experimental results. The results are discussed in Section 5, along with suggestions for future work. Finally, a conclusion is given in Section 6.

@&#METHOD@&#

In designing the cable feeder tool, an iterative work method was used. First, the demands on the tool were decided from manual winding experience and experiments. These demands were then translated to mechanical properties. A 3D CAD software was used to create an initial tool design, which was then validated together with the robot cell in an industrial robot offline simulation software. Using this robot simulation software setup, properties such as the robot reach over the stator side, the mounting position of the tool on the robot and tool positioning during winding operations such as twisting and dropping the cable could be investigated. The tool design was then adjusted until a satisfying result was found. From this design, two tool prototypes were constructed. While assembling and testing these tools, new design adjustments were made. Next, the feeder tools were tested on two industrial robots. Finally, further tool adjustments were implemented from the results of the robot winding experiments.

An essential design parameter for the feeder tool was the frictional coefficient between the feeding mechanism in the cable feeder and the winding cable. The value of this parameter was decided by pulling the winding cable through a prototype feeding mechanism with a well defined normal force between the cable and the feeding mechanism. The force required to pull the cable loose by slipping against the feeding mechanism was estimated using a dynamometer. 
                        Fig. 5 shows the experimental setup.

From the experimental results, the static frictional coefficient could be calculated knowing that

                        where F
                        
                           f
                         is the frictional force, μ
                        
                           s
                         is the static frictional coefficient and F
                        
                           n
                         is the normal force between the surfaces.

Another important parameter for the cable feeder tool was the maximum feeding force that can be transferred to the cable. When a cable, which was fed through the stator by one robot, had to be pulled through the stator from standstill by a second robot, a high start-up feeding force was required. To determine the maximum start-up pulling force from the feeder, different well defined gravity masses were attached to a winding cable and then pulled upwards by the feeder. The experimental setup is shown in 
                        Fig. 6.

As the cable feeding had been accelerated to the intended velocity, the feeding force on the cable and the cable feeding velocity were interesting parameters. To measure this feeding force, a load cell was used. In this experiment one side of the load cell was attached to a fix table and the other side was attached to a damping spring. A cable feeder tool was mounted on an industrial robot and positioned so that the feeder could pull the winding cable from the free end. Starting with a cable loop between the feeder and the load cell, the cable feeding was accelerated to the desired velocity. The damping spring was then stretched until either the motor torque or the frictional force between the cable and the feeder limited the feeding force. The pulling force on the cable as the spring was stretched was recorded from the load cell. Simultaneously, the rotational velocities of the upper and lower wheels in the cable feeder and the cable slippage signal from the cable feeder tool control system were recorded. Thus, the maximum cable feeding force could be measured for different cable feed velocities. 
                        Fig. 7 shows the full experimental setup before and after the cable is pulled by the feeder.

The cable feeder tool prototypes were mounted on two ABB IRB4400/60kg S4C+ M2000 robots. These robots were mounted according to the suggested cable winding robot cell layout [5]. A 0.5m stator section prototype part was assembled by splitting 2m long left over UU WEC stator sheets. During the cable winding experiments performed in this setup, the cable was automatically delivered to the robots from a side equipment setup. This was achieved by having a simplified cable feeder tool pulling cable from a cable drum. The cable drum feeder pulled the cable from the drum, through four guiding rollers, a steel tube and two feeding wheels. The cable end was finally delivered to the robots through a short steel tube. A circular air blow nozzle was also integrated in this setup to blow off dirt from the cable. The experimental setup is shown in 
                        
                        Figs. 8 and 9.

In this section, the demands on the cable feeder tool and the resulting design choices for the final tool prototypes are presented.

The most important demands on a robot held cable feeder tool for automated cable winding for the UU WEC stator are summarized below. These tool demands originate from manual winding experience and experiments, from designing, simulating and evaluating the automated robot cell and the tool prototype and from the results presented in [5].
                           
                              •
                              The tool should be able to catch, hold and drop the winding cable.

Dropping the cable should be completed within 2s.

Catching and grabbing the cable should be completed within 1s.

Pushing and pulling the cable through the stator requires about 150N cable feeding force.

Cable feeding through the stator should be done with about 0.5m/s cable velocity.

Whilst positioning with high accuracy against the stator side, the tool must be able to push away earlier created winding loops that cover a slot hole.

Measuring and adjusting to the exact stator position is required.

High accuracy measuring of the cable feed length is required.

Cable twisting must be avoided.

Errors in the winding procedure, such as slipping on the cable while feeding and slipping in the tool feeding mechanism, must be detected quickly and avoided if possible.

The tool design should be simple, robust, easy to adjust and maintain and not unnecessarily expensive.

The tool should be possible to mount on and able to communicate with an industrial robot.

From the demands on the cable feeder tool presented in Section 3.1, two tool prototypes were designed and constructed. One of the constructed cable feeder tool prototypes is shown in 
                        Fig. 10. 
                        Fig. 11 presents the main components of the tool. Most parts of the tools were made from high-strength aluminum, in order to minimize the tool weight. The tool housing was built up and screwed together from mostly flat parts. Hereby manufacturing of the tool was facilitated. Step motors were used to control the tool mechanisms.

The component cost per constructed cable feeder tool was approximately 7000 EUR. Some components that are subjected to wear, such as the feeding wheel, might need to be changed at certain intervals. Most of the tool programming can be reused for several tools.

The main function of the cable feeder tool is to feed cable. This was done with a feeding wheel directly coupled to a step motor. Another wheel, freely rotating, was mounted beneath the feeding wheel. The cable was positioned between the two wheels and squeezed as the lower wheel was pushed upwards. Thus, a well-defined normal force was created between the cable and the feeding wheel. To transfer a high torque to a high feeding force on the cable, a high normal force and a high frictional coefficient between the feeding wheel and the cable were required. The normal force was controlled through the mechanism moving the lower wheel. A high frictional coefficient was reached by adding high friction rubber layer to the feeding wheel, (see 
                           Fig. 12). By shaping the rubber layer concavely, the contact surface between the cable and the feeding wheel was maximized. The torque from the step motor could thus be converted to a linear feeding force knowing that

The mechanism pushing the lower wheel against the feeding wheel was controlled by another step motor. This motor was connected to a ball screw unit which converted the motor torque to a linear force. The ball screw nut and the lower wheel were mounted on the same miniature linear guiding system, but separated by a damping spring. Thus, the step motor operation could be adjusted to give an accurate normal force between the cable and the feeding wheel. The damping spring also compensated for small variations in cable diameter. With this setup, the desired normal force between the lower wheel and the cable could be converted to a torque from this step motor knowing that

Being able to catch, direct, hold, grab and drop the winding cable are other essential functions for the cable feeder tool. This was done with a tube-shaped cable guiding system, stretching about 200mm from both sides of the feeding mechanism. During winding, the tool was positioned with the guiding tube ends against the slot holes on the stator sides to catch and feed the cable. One side of the guiding was used to catch a cable end that was fed through a stator slot hole. This part had a funnel on the receiving end that directed the cable into the guiding as well as a narrowing cone inside the feeder to steer the cable between the two wheels. The other side of the cable guiding started with a funnel after the feeding wheels. Thus the cable was steered back into the guiding system. On the feeding end of the cable guiding, a narrowing cone shape was used to direct the cable with high accuracy into a stator slot hole. To prevent the cable from buckling inside the guiding, the inner diameter of the guiding tube was less than 1mm larger than the average cable diameter.

The cable guiding system could either be opened, to allow dropping the cable, or closed. To accomplish this, the guiding system was split in an upper and a lower part. The upper part was fixed to the feeder housing, while the lower part was mounted on a miniature linear guiding system. This guiding system was mounted parallel to the linear movement of the lower wheel in the feeding mechanism. Two damping springs, with much lower spring constants than the feeding wheel spring, connected the lower guiding part to the wheel. When the feeding wheels were closed, the guiding tubes met and close the guiding system before the two wheels grabbed the winding cable. As the guiding system was completely closed and the feeding wheels grabbed the cable, the guiding tubes remained closed. Thus, the tool was able to allow a winding cable being steered through the guiding system with the feeding mechanism open and passive. When the cable then was positioned inside the tool, the feeding wheels could be closed to grab the cable. A retracting spring was mounted on the guiding system to maintain its function regardless of how the tool was rotated. 
                           Fig. 13 shows the operating states of the cable guiding system.

As the winding cable was grabbed by the feeder tool, the cable could not rotate inside the tool and cable twisting was thus prevented. To drop the cable from the tool after feeding a cable through the stator, the feeding mechanism was first opened to allow the robot to move a short distance away from the stator while following the cable. Then the guiding system was completely opened with the feeder tilted forward before the feeder was then moved upwards to release the cable. If a cable end winding loop covered a stator slot hole during winding, the guiding tubes were designed to be stiff enough to be used to push away and bend down the loop. Between the cable feeding wheels and the cable guiding system, a nozzle for blowing compressed air on the cable was mounted. This air blow was used to remove dirt from the cable.

In positioning the cable feeder tool against the stator side, two different TCPCS

                            were used. These TCPCS were placed at the receiving and feeding ends of the cable guiding system. A third TCPCS was placed at the detecting distance front of the center of the proximity sensor and used during the initial positional calibration measurements. The placements of the three TCPCS are shown in 
                           Fig. 14.

For the cable winding automation to function, it is necessary that the robots know the exact position of the stator. This positional calibration was performed using a cylindrical proximity sensor mounted on the top of the cable feeder tool. The robot used the sensor to take measurements on the stator surface, see 
                           Fig. 15. These measurements were then used to adjust a WOCS

The cable feeding and cable guiding system operations of the cable feeder tool were programmed directly on two step motor drives, mounted in a control system housing box on the tool together with a PLC unit, Fig. 11. This equipment was monitored in the robot cable winding programming, which was done in ABB RAPID on the robot controller. All communication between the tool and the robot was done through DI/DO signals. Power supply lines and compressed air were also connected to the tool through the robot. Communication between the robots during the winding was done by hand-shaking and via supervised DI/DO signals. The cable drum feeder side equipment was controlled from one of the robot controllers through DI/DO signals. The operator user interface of the programming consisted of a simple users interface on the robot teach pendant of one of the robots and a signal tower. Finally, the tool and robot control systems were connected to an external computer. The control system layout is presented in 
                           Fig. 16.

Using step motors to control the feeding wheel and the guiding system provided high control of these functions at a reasonable cost. Hereby synchronized feeding of the cable through the stator, using both feeder tools to push and pull the cable through the same slot hole, could be achieved. However, with step motors the available torque typically declines as the rotational velocity is increased. Also, the motor acceleration must to be taken into account to ensure that the start-up torque is sufficient to overcome the required start-up force and reach the desired rotational velocity. These parameters had to be taken into account when choosing the motors and programming the tool functions.

Two incremental rotational sensors, connected to the PLC unit, were used on the cable feeding mechanism, see Fig. 11. One of the sensors was mounted on the shaft of the freely rotating wheel. Since this wheel rotated with the cable passing through, the information from the rotational sensor could be used to supervise the fed length and feed velocity of the cable. The second sensor was mounted on the shaft of the feeding wheel. The information from this sensor was used to discover step motor slipping. Further, by comparing the pulses from the two rotational sensors, slipping between the feeding wheel and the winding cable could also be supervised. When slipping was detected, the control system was able to either reduce the feeding velocity, to decrease the sensitivity of the slip detection or to combine these alternatives when restarting the feeding, depending on the operator׳s choice. Hereby winding failures due to that the cable got stuck while fed through the stator could be limited, while keeping a relatively high default feeding velocity. To be able to pull the correct length of the end windings, a procedure where the cable was pulled through the stator until a certain pulling resistance force was reached was used. As an end winding was finished, the operator was asked to approve the result. If the result was unsatisfying, the operator could instruct the feeder to either increase or decrease the end winding length by pushing or pulling the cable a small distance. If needed, the feeding velocity and/or the sensitivity of the slip detection was then also be adjusted. Through this setup, a lower accuracy of the cable feed length measurements could be accepted.

In order to control the operation of the cable guiding system, two miniature snap-action limit switches were used. One limit switch was used to detect when the guiding system was completely opened and the other to detect that both the guiding and the feeding wheels were completely closed. To enter the third operation mode, when the feeding mechanism was open but the guiding system remained closed, the second limit switch described above was used as a reference while opening the feeding wheels a predefined distance. Moreover, close to the feeding wheels on the two cable guiding tubes, two photocell sensors were mounted. The information from these sensors was used to determine if the winding cable was in position inside the guiding system. Hereby winding failures, such as the cable not being fed correctly through the feeder or not being completely dropped from the feeder, could be detected. If the cable was not dropped correctly, the robot was instructed to try to shake loose the cable. Also, theses sensors were used to improve the cable feed length measurements by repetitively recalibrating to the position of the cable end.

Supervised error handler functions in the robot programming were used to detect and react on errors in the tool function and during winding. Different error functions were activated and reset depending on the current winding task. These error functions supervised digital input signals from sensors and the PLC as well as some important tool operation cycle times and compared them to expected values. When an error state was detected, all robot movements and tool operations were immediately stopped for both robots. The winding operation parameters were however saved to facilitate restarting of the program. The most important errors that could be detected were cable feeding slippage, step motor slippage, failures in catching or dropping a cable, failures in opening or closing the guiding system and some sensor failures. Some of these errors, such as when the cable dropping or the cable loop pulling failed, were completed with manual supervision.

The robot winding programming was based on basic winding parameters describing the winding scheme and the stator geometry. Different programming functions were used to e.g. control the cable guiding system operation, position the cable guiding feeding end against a slot hole and dropping the cable. During winding the cable feeder was positioned with a TCPCS on the tool relative to different positioning targets in the WOCS. Assuming high geometrical accuracy of the stator, a programming function was used to create these positioning targets relative to specified stator slot holes. With this flexible parameter-based programming approach, the program could easily be adjusted for different winding patterns and stator designs.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

This section presents the final results from experiments with the constructed cable feeder tool prototypes. The same experiments were used in an iterative design process to reach the final tool prototype design.

In the start-up cable pull force experiments, the start-up cable pull force from the cable feeder tool on the cable was decided to be about 150N. It was also observed that with a higher cable pull force, the actual cable feed velocity was reduced, even though the same feeding wheel rotational velocity was used, (see 
                        Fig. 17). This result was used in adjusting the feeder wheel slipping supervision.

From the cable feeding force experiments, the maximum feeding force was reached at about 0.35m/s feeding velocity and decided to about 240N. For cable feed velocities below about 0.5m/s, the limiting factor on the feeding force was the slipping between the feeding wheel and the cable. As the cable feed velocity was increased and the available step motor torque declined, the feeding force was instead limited by the feeding step motor performance. 
                        Fig. 18 shows the maximum feeding force on the cable from the feeder tool for some different feeding wheel feed velocities.

In 
                        Fig. 19, the result of a representative single feeding force and cable slippage measurement at about 0.5m/s cable feed velocity is shown. The slip-stop detection function was adjusted to allow deviations in the feeding wheel and lower wheel rotations until a feeding force of about 150N was reached and cable slippage was assumed to begin. Note that the lower wheel diameter was somewhat larger than the feeding wheel diameter. 
                        Fig. 20 shows the result of the same experiment but with the slip stop function adjusted to react earlier on slipping and thus to stop the feeding wheel at about 110N feeding force resistance.

The initial frictional experiment between the feeding wheel and the winding cable resulted in a static frictional coefficient close to 0.9. Knowing that the normal force between the cable and the wheel was about 250N and using Fig. 18 and Eq. (1), the static frictional coefficient between the feeding wheel of the final tool prototype and the winding cable could be calculated to be about 1.

Through robotized cable winding experiments with the cable feeder tool prototypes, the tool and control system functions were validated. In these experiments, the cable end was prepared manually by first stretching the cable insulation somewhat over the end threads. The end insulation was then melted using a heat gun and formed into a conical top. During winding, the cable was temporarily fed out on the floor on the sides of the stator, before fed through the next slot hole. With this setup different winding patterns, stretching over several slots and slot hole levels, were automatically performed. 
                        
                        Figs. 21 and 22 show a robot wound two-phase winding pattern over ten stator slots and four stator slot hole levels. The default cable feed velocity during the winding was 0.5m/s. To drop the cable from the feeder took about 4s, whereof about 1.5s were needed for positioning of the robot and for the guiding system operations required about 2.5s. The extra shaking movement with the robot, used if the cable was not immediately released from the feeder, took about 1s extra time. Grabbing a cable with the feeding mechanism after the cable had been fed through the guiding system took less than 1s, while directing the cable into and through the feeder required no extra time. The cycle time for complete stator section calibration with both robots with a full size stator section was estimated from the cable winding experiments to about 250s.

During these winding experiments, tool functions such as cable pushing and pulling through the stator, catching and dropping the cable, measuring the cable feed length, pushing away end windings, pulling end windings, detecting and avoiding cable slippage and offset positioning programming were tested and confirmed. The implemented positional calibration of the stator section, using a proximity sensor, was validated by measuring different stator section positions and positioning the feeder using the calibrated WOCS during the winding experiments. Due to the placement of the robots relative to the stator, positioning the tools from the side relative to the stator improved the robot reach over the stator side but resulted in 180 degrees cable twisting and thereby uncontrolled end windings, (see 
                        Fig. 23). By instead positioning the tool from above relative to the stator, the rotation of the cable could be preserved and cable twisting was avoided, (see 
                        Fig. 24). Winding with the tool positioned from the side and from above relative to the stator is explained in 
                        Fig. 25.

During the winding experiments, the most common causes of stops related to the feeding tools were feeding or motor slippage while pulling the end windings of the top slot layers and that the cable was not dropped completely from the tools. The slipping related fault occurred mainly for the top two slot hole levels and resulted in longer end windings. For the cable dropping, the fault frequency was limited to about 5%. By introducing manual supervision, with the possibility to influence the shaking movement of the robot, this fault was fault state was however eliminated and a reduced shaking movement could be used as default. The frequency of other robot tool related stops were negligible in comparison.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The presented cable winding experiments with the constructed cable feeder tool prototypes, presented in Section 4, validated the basic functions of the tool. Most of the requirements on the tool, presented in Section 3.1, were also fulfilled. The only demand that was not completely met was for the tool to be able to drop the cable within 2s. The developed cable feeder tool could be used for different winding patterns and stator designs, including circular stators for rotating machines. Winding cables with other dimensions require adjustments to the feeding wheel and the cable guiding system, while the same general tool design could be used.

As the functions of the cable feeder tool prototype design thus has been validated for robotized cable winding, the design could of course be improved and optimized in many ways. Even though the frequency of stops during the winding experiments was constantly reduced through calibration and manual supervision, it was concluded that some tool properties should be adjusted and some side equipment is needed to further improve the robustness of the automation. The most important changes would be to increase the feeding force on the cable, to improve the cable dropping function in order to reduce the need for manual supervision, to hold up the end windings while being pulled and to implement a better system to decide the length of the pulled end windings. Regarding cable twisting, experiments with longer cables wound through more slot holes in a longer stator are needed to fully determine the eventual need of side equipment to take care of the cable instead of feeding the cable being pulled through the stator out on the floor. With these improvements, it is likely that the presented cable feeder tools can be integrated for automated cable winding in an electrical motor assembly line.

Since a strong majority of the stop causes were related to cable or motor slippage, replacing the feeding motor with a stronger drive unit and increasing the frictional force between the feeding wheel and the cable should be given the highest priority. A feeding wheel design with a grooved steel surface could result in less wheel wear, higher friction against the cable and a more controlled feeding velocity and would therefore be motivated to evaluate regarding the risk of increased the cable insulation wear. By replacing the step motors in the cable guiding system with stronger and faster drive units, the cycle times for opening and closing the tool and thereby also for dropping the cable could be reduced. A mechanism to ensure that the cable is completely dropped from the tool, e.g. using mechanical actuators to push out the cable, would improve the robustness of the automation, reduce the need for manual supervision and decrease the total winding cycle time. The cable feed length supervision and the feeding slippage control could be improved by e.g. integrating the control and drive systems directly into the robot controller. A torque sensor could also be used on the shaft between the motor and the feeding wheel to improve the control. In pulling the end windings, it is important to leave the right cable loop lengths. Using the feeding slip detection function to pull the end windings with a predefined force had to be completed with manual supervision to achieve sufficient accuracy. Two alternative methods to improve pulling of the end windings could be to improve the accuracy of the cable feed length supervision and use this information to pull accurate cable length or to use a laser scanner system to visually detect when the end winding loop length is correct. Such a laser scanner could possibly be mounted on the robot tools and used by the tool not pulling the end winding. As the end windings were pulled, it turned out to be a problem that the new end winding hooked into earlier created end windings. Two methods to avoid this could be to hold up the cable instead of pulling the cable directly from the floor and to push down all earlier created end windings before the new end winding is pulled. Both these operations could possibly be performed either using the robot tool or with external equipment. A possibly faster, but also more expensive and perhaps less robust, alternative to using a proximity sensor for the positional calibration of the stator could be to use a camera based vision system. However it should be noted that considering the complete cable winding automation, the suggested positional calibration method does only make a small contribution to the total cycle time.

From the cable feed force experiments, it was observed that the actual cable feed velocity declines with rising resistance forces in the feeding, even though the feeding wheel rotational velocity is constant. The main explanation for this behavior was that the rubber surface of the feeding wheel was stretched tangentially as the required feeding force on the cable was increased. When the rubber was stretched backwards at the feeding surface, the peripheral wheel surface velocity was reduced somewhat at the feeding point and the feed velocity was reduced. The deformed rubber surface did then retain its nominal shape before it again reached the cable surface. At the same time, as the feeding wheel rubber was stretched, the local radius of the feeding wheel was slightly reduced and the cable feed velocity was thereby somewhat further reduced. Two other explanations might have been that the winding cable insulation was locally and temporary stretched when in contact with the feeding wheel and that some cable slipping occurred.

The results from the initial frictional experiment and the cable feed force experiments on the final tool prototype were similar. The slightly larger value for the static frictional coefficient between the feeding wheel and the winding cable from the second experiment could possibly be explained by some minor improvements to the feeding wheel design. This improved wheel design included a smaller concavity radius of the rubber surface and adding supporting iron plates to the sides of the wheel. Thus the cable was squeezed inside the rubber concavity of the wheel and the resulting normal force between the wheel and the cable was thereby increased. With this design however, the feeding wheel wear was also slightly increased.

Electric cables are deformable objects which are hard to control and might behave differently from time to time, in unexpected ways. Hence, it is likely that the cable sometimes will get stuck somewhere, including on the feeder tool itself. This is a serious fault state that if not detected might damage the feeder tool due to high robot movement forces. Manual supervision, perhaps in combination with high accuracy process force monitoring using a force control feedback system mounted between the robot and the robot tool, could be used to detect such errors. Cable wear during the stator winding will always be present using the investigated assembly method. However comparing the presented cable winding experiments using cable feeder tools to manual cable winding indicated that the cable wear can be reduced with automation. The main reasons for this were that buckling of the cable was avoided with the tool cable guiding system and the high accuracy positioning against the slot hole to be wound. However, since cable feeder tools can provide much higher feeding forces on the cable, the risk of damaging the cable if getting stuck inside the stator during winding increases. High accuracy stator stacking and feeding force feedback turned out to be important to avoid such damage. Through visual inspection, it was indicated that the cable itself was not damaged from being fed through the feeder tools as long as feeding slippage could be avoided. Monitoring insulation damages to the cable while being fed through the feeder tool could be very useful, but is likely to be hard to implement with high reliability.

In the presented cable winding experiments, a less stiff cable with higher surface friction was used for the bottom winding layers. This cable was also used in the preliminary manual experiments on deciding the feeding force requirement for the cable feeder tools. For the top winding layers in the same experiment, a stiffer cable with lower surface friction was used. In Fig. 22 it can be seen that the end windings of the above layers was not pulled as tight as for the lower layers. The reason for this was that a higher pulling force was needed for the stiffer cable and that the feeder was not able to achieve as high feeding force with this cable due to the lower cable surface friction. For the cable feeder tool to be able to use different cables with remained high performance, it would therefore be favorable to increase the feeding force from the feeder.

The results presented in this paper can be compared to the theoretical results on cable winding cycle times for the UU WEC stator section according to [5]. It is thereby indicated that about 250min total winding cycle for a complete UU WEC stator section could be met using the constructed tools, by assuming an average cable feed velocity of 0.5m/s and an average winding positioning time of 5s. However to achieve this, some new external equipment must be designed and implemented in the cable winding robot cell. Some of the above suggested improvements to the cable feeder tool could then also be implemented. To accurately determine the winding cycle time does hence require further experiments with a complete robot winding cell. From the presented results with the cable feeder prototype, it should also be noted that manual supervision of the cable dropping and of the pulling of the end windings prolongs the total cycle time somewhat, even if the number of failures during automated winding thereby could be reduced. Further, the cycle time for the positional calibration of the stator section was not included in the theoretical cycle time results. Nor was downtime in the winding automation due to winding operation failures.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A cable feeder tool for robotized cable winding of electric machine stators has been designed, constructed and tested. The tool fulfilled the requirements to be used in robotized cable winding automation and its function has been validated through robotized cable winding experiments on a UU WEC stator section. These winding experiments showed a good correlation with the theoretical results presented in earlier work [5]. Through manual inspection it was observed that robotized winding resulted in less wear of the cable, both in terms of cable buckling and insulation wear, compared to manual winding, providing that the stator sheets were stacked with high accuracy. Using manual supervision and feedback, it was possible to achieve similar accuracy of the length of the cable loops compared to manual winding. An obvious but important advantage with robot winding was the elimination of errors in the winding pattern. Thus it has been demonstrated that automated cable winding using industrial robots can be achieved, even though implementation in a production line require some improvements of the tool performance as well as construction of and integration with side equipment according to the results from earlier work. Comparing the presented experimental results for robotized cable winding, using the presented cable feeder tool design, with one supervising personnel to manual winding with four personnel, the total winding cycle time for one UU WEC generator could theoretically be reduced from 80h to less than 20h. This indicates substantial cost savings for large scale production of cable wound generators. The presented robot tool design can easily be adjusted to different winding patterns, cable dimensions, stator sizes and stator designs, including round stators for rotating machines.
