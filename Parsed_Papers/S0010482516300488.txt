                  New-generation high-throughput technologies, including next-generation sequencing technology, have been extensively applied to solve biological problems. As a result, large cancer genomics projects such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium are producing large amount of rich and diverse data in multiple cancer types. The identification of mutated driver genes and driver pathways from these data is a significant challenge. Genome aberrations in cancer cells can be divided into two types: random ‘passenger mutation’ and functional ‘driver mutation’. In this paper, we introduced a Multi-objective Optimization model based on a Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to solve the maximum weight submatrix problem, which can be employed to identify driver genes and driver pathways promoting cancer proliferation. The maximum weight submatrix problem defined to find mutated driver pathways is based on two specific properties, i.e., high coverage and high exclusivity. The multi-objective optimization model can adjust the trade-off between high coverage and high exclusivity. We proposed an integrative model by combining gene expression data and mutation data to improve the performance of the MOGA algorithm in a biological context.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cancer is a complex disease that is highly driven by somatic mutations, such as single-nucleotide mutations, larger copy-number aberrations, and structural aberrations [1]. The hallmarks of cancer, including a limitless replicative potential and self-sufficiency in the growth signals of cancer, hinder its effective treatment. The researchers also found these cancer cells can invade other tissues and organs via the lymphatic system or blood circulation [2]. Thus, cancer is considered to be one of the most serious diseases to inflict human beings.

Researchers should understand the molecular mechanisms of cancer prior to exploring the effective treatment of cancer. Therefore, one of the remaining challenges is to identify functional mutations, which are referred to as “driver mutations”, that confer a selective growth advantage during the development of cancer, and filter random “passenger mutations”, which are neutral to the proliferation of cancer cells [3]. With the development of sequencing technologies, especially next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, large-scale genomic projects of cancer disease, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have provided a vast number of profiles of samples for different types of cancers [4–6]. Recent studies revealed that the theories of carcinogenesis are primarily attributed to the disruption of cellular signaling and regulatory pathways. Thus, the design of an effective method for identifying the driver pathways in carcinogenesis process, which is helpful to personalized medicine programs, is important [7,8].

On the gene level, several studies have been devoted to identify genes with significantly higher mutation rates across samples than the background mutation rates in a vast number of samples. Some important gene mutations in cancer progression have been reported in these studies. However, minimal overlap among genome aberrations is observed even if cancer genomes originate from the same cancer [9,10]. The majority of these methods are unable to identify the heterogeneity of gene mutations.

Researchers have also realized that one driver pathway may be caused by different mutations [11,12]. Pathways rather than individual genes are considered to govern cancer progression. Therefore, it is necessary to shift the point of view from the gene level to the pathway level and it is critical to capturing the heterogeneous phenomenon in cancer [13,14]. The majority of studies have focused on analyzing known information about driver pathways and the detection of the significant pathways. The enrichment of somatic mutations is a routine method in most of studies [10,15]. The disadvantage of this method is that the background knowledge of pathways remains incomplete, and existing pathway databases have distinct limitations because they frequently contain overlap and unavailable data [16–18]. Considering these limitations, it is indispensable to develop new methods to identify driver pathways without relying on prior knowledge.

A vast number of gene sets exist when exhaustively testing in the entire genome. For instance, more than 1026 sets of seven human genes exist [19]. Therefore, the detection of mutated driver pathways seems implausible due to the vast number of gene sets to enumerate. In recent years, some methods have been developed to solve this problem [20]. Researchers have discovered two constraints on the combination patterns of the mutations of cancer. First, they determined that a driver mutation is rare, that is, a single mutation in one group can sufficiently perturb one pathway. Driver mutations are mutually exclusive. This property is referred to as high-exclusivity. Second, a pathway that is important to cancer frequently applies to the majority of patients. Thus, mutations in a driver pathway should be contained by most patients, which is referred to as high-coverage. Recently, some new gene sets have been identified in several studies using these rules [21–23]. A novel scoring function that is based on these two properties, which is employed to identify the mutated driver pathway, has been defined by Vandin et al. [19]. It is a new and effective method that applies the somatic mutation data detected by next-generation DNA sequencing technologies. They defined the maximum weight submatrix problem as a problem in which the scoring function is maximized and solved this problem using a stochastic search algorithm. However, the solution of this problem is difficult due to the complex computations that are required. No effective measure is available to adjust the trade-off between coverage and exclusivity in this study.

To adjust the trade-off between higher coverage and higher overlap in the identification of gene sets for solving the maximum weight submatrix problem, we proposed a novel multi-objective optimization model that is based on a genetic algorithm (MOGA) for driver pathway detection. We integrated differential expression data to improve the performance of our MOGA in a biological context. The results show that the proposed MOGA method is effective and the integrated model can detect biologically significant gene sets.

The remainder of our paper is divided into three sections. In Section 2, the methods that was utilized in this study are briefly introduced. In Section 3, to assess the performance of our MOGA method, we apply MOGA to two biological data sets to compare our results with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Section 4 briefly outlines our MOGA method in future studies.

For the glioblastoma and lung datasets, all genes with non-synonymous single nucleotide mutations or small indels in at least two patients were used. For glioblastoma dataset, copy number variants (CNVs) were included. If a gene had a CNV of the same type (amplification or deletion) in at least 90% of the patients with a CNV, we add a CNV type for the gene. More details about the pipeline for building mutation matrices from somatic mutation data are prepared was discussed in Ref. [24].

In recent years, researchers have employed two important characteristics to detect mutated driver pathways. They transformed this problem into the maximum weight submatrix problem by considering two constraints, i.e., ‘high coverage’, which indicates that the majority of patients have a minimum of one mutation in a driver pathway, and ‘high exclusivity’, which indicates that the mutations in one pathway should be heterogeneous [19]. The identification of driver pathways is extremely difficult because the maximum weight submatrix problem is NP-hard. Considering this point, they proposed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which is based on these two properties, to detect effective gene sets. A binary mutation matrix

Gene set D may be identified using genetic algorithm (GA) and MCMC, whereas the heterogeneity of D is small because both the MCMC method and the GA did not value the trade-off between high coverage and high exclusivity. Thus, some researchers attempted to solve this problem using a modified scoring function

                        ) is designed to adjust the trade-off between high coverage and high exclusivity [24]. The results are insufficient because high coverage and high exclusivity are mutually exclusive with regard to biological data and no method exists to calculate the parameter 
                           α
                        . To consider both properties, a multi-objective optimization model is designed in this study.

In a practical application, many multi-optimization problems (MOPs) can be characterized by multiple objectives that sometimes conflict. Numerous multi-optimal methods have been suggested to solve the MOPs. Generally, a simple single-objective optimization problem could be formulated as

The maximum weight submatrix problem is a multi-objective problem. Hence, we proposed the multi-objective optimization model to adjust the trade-off between coverage and exclusivity. In previous decades, evolutionary algorithms have shown powerful ability in solving MOPs. As Zhao et al. [26] discussed, a genetic algorithm (GA) is an effective stochastic method for solving the maximum weight submatrix problem. To obtain the optimal value of each single objective, we adopt a GA [26] in our multi-objective optimization model. First, we could obtain an optimization value of

                         was employed to calculate the quality of our results. Note that a local search strategy was utilized to prevent the phenomenon that is referred to as “premature”.

The details of our implementation, named Multi-Objective Optimization Method (MOGA), for the maximum weight submatrix problem are described as follows:
                           
                              Step 1: Generate the initial population randomly. The population size p=n and the mutation rate p
                                 m=0.1 were used in this study.

Step 2: Use the GA method to calculate the optimal value for the two constraints of high coverage and high exclusivity.

Step 3: All the parents and offsprings are ranked by their scoring value and the next generation will be made up by the best P individuals.

Step 4: Run local search if the minimum scoring value does not reduce in two consecutive iterations.

Step 5: Continue in this way until stopping criterion is met (the current scoring value dose not reduce in 10 iterations).

Because noise such as overlap and unavailable biological data always exists, the optimal solution calculated by the algorithm (with a minimum 
                           
                              ψ
                              [
                              f
                              (
                              x
                              )
                              ]
                           
                        ) may not yield the best results in a practical background. Researchers have recognized that the integration of data is a useful method for reducing noise. Numerous studies have demonstrated the power of data integration [27]. Zhao et al. [26] tried to integrate the gene expression data to identify driver pathways. However, the downside of their design is that expression data is calculated independently of the mutation data.

In this study, we contracted a binary mutation matrix by considering whether each gene is mutated or normal. Different genes serve different roles in the procession of cancer. Vandin et al. [19] pointed out that additional information about the functional impact or expression status could be used to weight the mutation matrix. Some effective methods are proposed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among groups [28,29]. We downloaded gene expression data, including data on Glioblastoma cancer patients and normal patients from TCGA. By comparing the two groups, we identified 79 DEGs from 178 genes by using the t-test method. Here 178 is a dimension of matrix A (84*178) of GBM. A p-value for each gene was obtained, and a threshold of 
                           
                              p
                              ≤
                              0.001
                           
                         was employed to filtrate the differentially expressed genes. Representing each mutation in a pathway by one value is problematic as there may exist a one-to-many relationship between encoding genes and the fold-change value was used to weight the so called Node_value introduced in [30]. Similarly, in this paper, because of the small size of patient samples, it is not accurate to use the fold-change of each gene to weight the matrix A. Here we tried to set a parameter 
                           λ
                         to distinguish the DEGs. Generally, a 1.5-fold (or 2-fold) is often used to distinguish DEGs from those unchanged (non-significant). When 
                           
                              λ
                              >

                              2
                           
                        , we found that the optimal solution is clearly not idea. Thus the parameter 
                           
                              λ
                              =

In this paper, a permutation test method was employed to evaluate the significance as follows: the mutation matrix datasets are permuted

                         times randomly, and the MOGA method is run on the N randomly generated matrix. We tested the significance of the results, which is defined as the degree that the results deviates from the theoretical optimal solution. The p-value is calculated as follows:

In this section, MOGA was applied method to real biological data sets to solve the maximum weight submatrix problem. To detect the cooperative pathways, we verified the second optimal patterns, which moved the ‘optimal’ submatrix, and detected the ‘optimal’ results in the new matrix. The pipeline of the MOGA method is shown in 
                     Fig. 2.

First, we applied our MOGA method to the lung adenocarcinoma dataset to test the performance of our new model compared with the MCMC methods. Our MOGA can obtain optimal results in less than 10s, whereas the MCMC method obtains the solutions in more than 60s. We applied our integration model on the glioblastoma dataset.

MOGA algorithm was employed to analyze a dataset of 1013 somatic mutations that were identified in 623 sequenced genes in 188 lung adenocarcinoma samples from the tumor sequencing project [9].

First, we employed the MCMC method to identify gene sets of size

                        . When 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              2
                           
                        , the pair (EGFR, KRAS) was selected with mutation in 90 samples and no coverage overlap. When 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              3
                           
                        , the most significant triplet is (EGFR, KRAS, STK11). When 
                           
                              k
                              ≥
                              4
                           
                        , all identified gene sets are sampled with frequency <0.3%. MCMC cannot achieve an effective solution with 
                           
                              k
                              ≥
                              4
                           
                        . We applied our MOGA method on the lung adenocarcinoma dataset and identified the gene pair (EGFR, KRAS) as the optimal result when 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              2
                           
                        . The triplet (EGFR, KRAS, NTRK3) is obtained as the optimal solution when 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              3
                           
                        . The gene pair (EGFR, KRAS) is the most mutually exclusive solution reported in Ding et al. [9]. This result shows the effectiveness of our model. Then we analyze the statistics of the gene pair (KRAS, STK11) obtained using MCMC and GA methods. KRAS mutated in 60 samples and STK11 mutated in 34 samples while the coverage between KRAS and STK11 reaches 27.7%. it is obvious that the trade-off between high coverage and high exclusivity is not handled in GA and MCMC methods. The MCMC and GA methods cannot adequately adjust the trade-off between the high coverage and the high exclusivity. In the MOGA method, the pairs (EGFR, KRAS) and (EGFR, NTRK3) are significant pairs in the mutual exclusivity test that was employed by Ding et al. [9]. To assess the quality of gene sets obtained with MOGA, we expect to minimize the fitness function 
                           ψ
                        . 
                        Table 1 reports the results obtained with the the MOGA and the MCMC (GA), where 
                           
                              ψ
                              1
                           
                         and 
                           
                              ψ
                              2
                           
                         represent the fitness value of the sets obtained by the MCMC (GA) and the MOGA. The 
                           ψ
                         value for the gene sets obtained with the MOGA is smaller than the 
                           ψ
                         value obtained with the MCMC and GA methods.

A permutation test was used to assess the significance of our results. The p-value of the gene pair (EGFR, KRAS) and the p-value of the triplet (EGFR, KRAS, NTRK3) are both less than 0.01. Thus, the triplet (EGFR, KRAS, NTRK3) is significant as the gene pair (EGFR, KRAS) and it may be a novel potential discovery. Note that the tyrosine kinase domain of the NTRKs genes are frequently mutated in human lung adenocarcinomas [9]. The EGFR and the NTRK receptor families show significant exclusivity. NTRK3 is reported as one of three high-affinity neurotrophin receptors, which regulate cell growth and the necrosis of neurons [31]. Mutations of NTRK3 may serve a very important role in the neoplasia of lung cancer [32].

The MOGA algorithm was applied to identify additional gene sets after removing the gene pair (EGFR, KRAS). In the remaining matrix, we obtain the gene pair (ATM, TP53) as the optimal result when 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              2
                           
                        . The gene pair (ATM, TP53) mutated in 76 samples. Because the p-value of the pair is less than 0.01, this gene pair is significant. Previous studies have shown that the ATM and TP53 genes serve an important role in cell cycle progression, are involved in cell cycle checkpoint control and engage in direct interaction [33,34].

The gene sets (EGFR, KRAS, NTRK3) and (ATM, TP53) mutated in 123 samples. The pair (NF1, STK11) covers 40 patients of all patients that were identified after we deleted the 123 samples. The coverage is small, which suggests that these two genes do not comprise a complete driver pathway. Note that STK11 and NF1 are both tumor suppressor genes in lung adenocarcinoma [35]. The pair of genes serves an important role in proliferation and protein synthesis. The relationships of gene sets (EGFR, KRAS, NTRK3), (ATM, TP53), (NF1, STK11) are shown in 
                        Fig. 3, and only cancer patients were contained. Meanwhile several significantly mutated pathways in lung adenocarcinomas were identified, including MAPK signaling, p53 signaling, Wnt signaling, cell cycle, and mTOR pathways (
                        Fig. 4).

Our MOGA was also employed to analyze the dataset of somatic mutations that was identified in 601 sequenced genes in 84 glioblastoma multiform samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). GISTIC 2.0 was utilized to transform copy-number variation (CNV) data, as described in the previous paper [36].

In this experiment, we applied the MCMC method to analyze the mutation matrix. When 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              2
                           
                        , the pair (CDKN2B, CYP27B1) is the optimal result. For 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              3
                           
                        , the most significant gene set is (CDKN2B, CYP27B1, RB1). Note that the same gene sets are obtained with the GA method. In Vandin et al. [19], the authors noted that an important copy-number aberration was previously reported, in which the targeted gene is CDK4; this copy-number aberration also affects CYP27B1. Thus, they considered that the gene triplet (CDKN2B, CDK4, RB1) may be the gene set of interest with prior knowledge. Because some passenger mutation with high coverage will affect the accuracy of our method, we proposed an integration model to enhance the performance of the MOGA algorithm. Both the MCMC and GA methods cannot exclude the passenger gene CYP27B1, whereas the driver genes CDKN2A and TP53 can be directly obtained using the integrative model. The results for the GBM (Glioblastoma), which were obtained with

                         and 
                           
                              k
                              =

                        , are listed in 
                        Table 2. After using the integration model, we can directly obtain (CDKN2A, TP53). The gene set (CDKN2B, RB1, CDK4, ERBB2) was identified after removing the gene set (CDKN2A, TP53) when 
                           
                              k
                              =

                        . This pair is part of the RB signaling pathway (
                        Fig. 5A). The gene set (CDKN2A, TP53) is part of the p53 signaling pathway (Fig. 5B). We can also detect the optimal gene pair (NF1, EGFR) after removing the gene set (CDKN2A, TP53, CDKN2B, CDK4, RB1, ERBB2). NF1 and EGFR mutated in 52 samples (with the coverage overlap of 1). The p-value is also less than 0.01. The gene pair (NF1, EGFR) is part of the RTK pathway (Fig. 5C), which serves an important role in the procession of proliferation, survival and translation. The gene sets (CDKN2A, TP53), and (EGFR, NF1), (CDKN2B, ERBB2, CDK4, RB1) shown in Fig. 5 only contains cancer patients, and significantly mutated pathways in glioblastoma are identified (
                        Fig. 6).

In biomedicine, the analysis of cancer genome data to detect a mutated driver pathway for the treatment of cancer is essential. In this paper, we attempt to distinguish the driver genes from the passenger genes that are relevant to the development of cancer using a novel algorithm, which is referred to as the MOGA, without relying on prior knowledge. Somatic mutation data from Vandin et al. [19] was employed in our paper, and we also used the gene expression data from TCGA to improve the performance of MOGA method.

Compared with the MCMC and the GA method, our MOGA method shows credible performance. Compared with (EGFR, KRAR, STK11) detected with GA and MCMC methods in lung adenocarcinoma, a gene set (EGFR, KRAS, NTRK3) with high exclusivity is the optimal result for MOGA method, while the coverage between KRAS and STK11 reaches 27.7%. The multi-objective model shows more credible performance on adjusting the trade-off between high coverage and high exclusivity. Gene set of (NF1, STK11) is a new discovery, and NF1 and STK11 are mutual exclusive. We also discovered the significance of integrating gene expression data into the multi-objective model. In previous studies, mutations were considered to be one of two-states: mutated or normal. To effectively distinguish driver mutations from passenger mutations, gene expression data downloaded from TCGA was employed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to weight the driver genes. For example, with MCMC and GA methods, (CYP27B1, CDKN2B) is the optimal gene set before prior knowledge was used to filter the passenger gene CYP27B1. The integrative model can identify CDKN2A and TP53 and eliminated CYP27B1 directly by weighting the matrix A. Additional functional information was employed in the integrative model to identify the more significant gene sets in a biological context.

The MOGA algorithm could be improved in several ways. First, it has confirmed that driver mutations should be caused by multiple pathways. For example, researchers have reported the acute myeloid leukemia is caused by CBF translocations and kinase mutations [37]. We need to point out that the assumption of mutual exclusivity occurs only in the same driver pathways. In the further study, it makes sense to explore the co-occurring mutated driver pathways. Second, to detect those pathways most relevant to pathophysiological process, pathway topology could be added to inform the scoring system. A topology-based score for pathway enrichment has been reportd in a recent study [38].
