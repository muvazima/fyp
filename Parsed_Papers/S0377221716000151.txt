                  Sorting methods, in particular ELECTRE Tri methods, are widely used in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding to deal with ordinal classification problems. Problems of this kind encountered in practice involve the evaluation of different alternatives (actions) on several evaluation criteria that are structured in a hierarchical way. In order to deal with a hierarchical structure of criteria in decision problems, Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP) has been recently proposed. In this paper, we apply the MCHP to the ELECTRE-Tri methods. In particular, we extend ELECTRE Tri-B, ELECTRE Tri-C and ELECTRE Tri-nC methods. We also adapt the MCHP concept to the case where interaction among evaluation criteria has either strengthening, or weakening, or antagonistic effect. Finally, we present an extension of the SRF method to determine the weights of criteria in case they are hierarchically structured.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) methods deal with three major types of problems: choice, ranking and sorting (for a collection of surveys on MCDA see Figueira, Greco, and Ehrgott (2005)). Given a finite set of alternatives, choice problems consist in choosing a subset of best alternatives among the considered ones; ranking problems consist in rank ordering all the considered alternatives from the best to the worst, while sorting problems consist in assigning each alternative to one of the predefined and ordered categories (decision classes).

Among the best known sorting methods, there are the ELECTRE Tri methods and, in particular, the ELECTRE Tri-B (Yu, 1992), the ELECTRE Tri-C (Almeida Dias, Figueira, & Roy, 2010) and the ELECTRE Tri-nC (Almeida Dias, Figueira, & Roy, 2012) methods (for other sorting methods see Moscarola and Roy (1977); Nemery and Lamboray (2008)).

                      is delimited by two reference profiles

                     . They are limiting category Ch
                      from the bottom and the top, respectively. In ELECTRE Tri-C and ELECTRE Tri-nC methods, each category is characterized by one reference profile or more than one reference profile, respectively which correspond to some typical objects of this category. In all three methods, the assignment of alternatives to categories depends on the comparison of these alternatives with the reference profiles corresponding to the categories, the comparison that takes into account the whole set of criteria. It is worth mentioning that the assignment of one alternative is not influenced by the assignment of another alternative. Recently, Bouyssou and Marchant investigated in Bouyssou and Marchant (2015) the relationship between ELECTRE Tri-B and ELECTRE Tri-C, providing also another variant of ELECTRE Tri-B. On one hand, they demonstrated that some sorting assignments obtained by ELECTRE Tri-B cannot be obtained by fixing adequate profiles in ELECTRE Tri-C and viceversa; on the other hand, the authors adapted ELECTRE Tri-B so that the pessimistic and the optimistic recommendations can be obtained one from the other by a transposition operation.

                        According to Bouyssou and Marchant (2015), the transposition operation consists in inverting the direction of preference on all criteria and in inverting the ordering of the categories.
                     
                  

In all known sorting methods, all evaluation criteria are considered at the same level. However, practical decision problems often require consideration of a hierarchical structure of the set of criteria. Considering a hierarchy of criteria is also a way of decomposing complex decision problems involving criteria referring to various levels of detail in the evaluation. For example, let us consider a council that evaluates a set of projects with respect to different aspects: economic, environmental, social, etc. In order to make these evaluations, the council has to consider several indicators for each macro criterion, and each indicator is composed, in turn, of other subcriteria, and so on. Even if global evaluation of a single project is well appreciated, members of the council would appreciate having an insight into partial evaluation of the projects, referring to a greater level of detail, e.g., with respect to economic, environmental or social aspects considered separately. The Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP) has been recently proposed for this purpose. It deals with decision problems where criteria are structured hierarchically, and at each level of the hierarchy, they are aggregated using one of available aggregation methods: either those involving additive (Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012) or non-additive (Angilella, Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2015) value functions, or those involving outranking relations (Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2013b).

The three main novelties introduced in this paper are the following:

                        
                           •
                           MCHP has been applied to ELECTRE Tri-B, ELECTRE Tri-C and ELECTRE Tri-nC in a way which permits to sort the alternatives into different categories not only in the root, at the comprehensive level, but also with respect to a lower level criterion, represented by an intermediate node of the hierarchy tree. In the ELECTRE framework, we take into account three different outranking relations based on the concordance and non-discordance tests; we specify two coherence properties that should hold for outranking methods applied to problems involving criteria organized in a hierarchical way, and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the cutting of the credibility of outranking, such that these two properties are satisfied. Moreover, some theorems show the relationship between the assignments done by ELECTRE Tri-B at different levels of the hierarchy, using both the pessimistic and the optimistic assignment procedures. We show that in case of a flat structure of criteria, the proposed methods boil down to the classical ELECTRE Tri methods and, for this reason, they can be considered their generalizations;

The Simos–Roy–Figueira (SRF) method (Figueira & Roy, 2002), used to determine the weights of criteria in the classical ELECTRE methods, has been extended to handle criteria organized in a hierarchical way. In this case, following a top-down procedure, the weights of all criteria in the hierarchy, starting from the root criterion to the elementary criteria, are obtained. Even if the extension of the SRF method has been proposed in this paper to deal with sorting problems, it can be applied to choice and ranking problems involving criteria organized in a hierarchical way if these problems are solved using methods in which weights are interpreted as in ELECTRE methods, for example, when using PROMETHEE methods (Brans & Vincke, 1985);

A methodology for dealing with different types of interactions between criteria organized in a hierarchical way has been proposed; extending the proposal of Figueira, Greco, and Roy (2009), in this paper we explain how to deal with decision making problems in which criteria organized in a hierarchy can present different types of interactions, such as synergy, redundancy, and antagonistic effects. Also in this case, even if this methodology has been proposed for dealing with sorting problems, it can be applied to choice and ranking problems approached by methods in which importance of criteria is interpreted as in ELECTRE methods.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 recalls the basic concepts of MCHP and ELECTRE Tri methods; in Section 3, we specify some coherence properties that should hold for hierarchical multiple criteria ELECTRE methods, as well as theorems ensuring them; in Section 4, we describe the application of MCHP to ELECTRE Tri methods, as well as their extension to the case of interacting criteria; an example of application of the proposed methodology to a real world decision making problem is presented in Section 5, while some concluding remarks and further directions of research are pointed out in Section 6.

In MCHP (Corrente et al., 2012), we consider a set of criteria structured in a hierarchical way, i.e., criteria are not considered at the same level, but they are distributed over l different levels; 
                        G
                      denotes the entire set of criteria considered at all levels; 
                        
                           I
                           G
                        
                      is the set of indices of particular criteria representing positions of criteria in the hierarchy; G
                     
                        r
                      is a generic symbol of criterion from any level of the hierarchy; n(r) is the number of subcriteria of G
                     
                        r
                      in the subsequent level, i.e., the direct subcriteria of G

                        r

                     ; LBO is the set of indices of all subcriteria located at the last but one level of the hierarchy and LB(G

Let us mention that, in the following, we shall suppose without loss of generality that all elementary criteria have an increasing direction of preference (the greater the evaluation of an alternative on an elementary criterion, the better the alternative is), and that when

                        Note 2.1
                        Let us stress that, as we shall explain in Section 4, in ELECTRE Tri methods the assignment of an alternative to one of the considered categories depends on the comparison of the alternative with the reference profiles separating the categories. As the reference profiles can be seen as fictitious alternatives, the indices that we shall define in the following lines, are valid also for the comparison between two alternatives. For this reason, in defining these indices, by a and b we mean two alternatives or, an alternative and a reference profile.

In all considered adaptations of ELECTRE Tri methods to MCHP, we shall define the following indices:

In order to design an assignment procedure of ELECRE-Tri type, we need, moreover, a cutting level λ
                     
                        r
                      on the credibility of outranking with respect to each criterion G
                     
                        r
                      in the hierarchy, except the elementary criteria.

In addition, two assumptions should be made:

The first outranking relation is based only on the reasons in favour of the outranking of a over b, while the second and the third outranking relations are defined taking into account simultaneously the reasons in favor and the reasons against the outranking of a over b in two different ways.

Coherence property (C1) states that if a outranks b on all subcriteria of G
                     
                        r
                      in the subsequent level, then a should outrank b on criterion G
                     
                        r
                     , while coherence property (C2) states that if a does not outrank b for all subcriteria of G
                     
                        r
                      in the subsequent level, then a should not outrank b also on criterion G
                     
                        r
                     . To motivate this property, let us suppose that we compare students a and b with respect to mathematics, and that algebra and geometry are direct subcriteria of mathematics. Coherence property (C1) ensures that if student a outranks student b on algebra and geometry, then a outranks b also on mathematics; analogously, coherence property (C2) ensures that if a does not outrank b neither on algebra nor on geometry, then a does not outrank b on mathematics.

Considering the outranking relations (O1) and (O2), we look for some conditions on the parameters of the model and, in particular, on the cutting levels, such that coherence properties (C1) and (C2) are satisfied. Theorem 3.1 provides necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring that the coherence properties (C1) and (C2) hold.

Let us observe that Theorem 3.1 is really important, not only because it provides necessary and sufficient conditions on the cutting levels, such that coherence properties (C1) and (C2) are satisfied, but also because it provides a hint on how to fix the cutting level λ

                           (r, j) and that the presence of at least one pseudo-criterion among the elementary criteria of G

Two things should be noted in this case:

                              
                                 1.
                                 Since all elementary criteria are quasi-criteria, the partial concordance index can only get value 0 or 1. Therefore, in sets YS
                                    (r, j) (analogously, in sets NS
                                    (r, j)), we have to take into account the coalitions of elementary criteria descending from G
                                    (r, j) such that the sum of the importance coefficients is at least equal (smaller than) the cutting level λ
                                    (r, j).

We have to consider case (*) only, because in this case, NS
                                    (r, j) is composed of a finite number of elements and, consequently, it has always a maximum.□


                           If all elementary criteria are pseudo-criteria (0 ≤ q

In the following, we shall suppose without loss of generality that all elementary criteria are pseudo-criteria and that coherence properties (C1) and (C2) are satisfied. From Corollary 3.2 it follows that

                        Note 3.3
                        Let us observe that Theorem 3.1, as well as Corollaries 3.1 and 3.2, do not hold for hierarchical versions of ELECTRE Tri sorting methods only, but also for hierarchical versions of other ELECTRE methods dealing with ranking and choice problems. In general, the coherence properties (C1) and (C2) hold for the outranking relation considered in a hierarchical setting.

In this section, we shall apply MCHP to the three considered ELECTRE Tri methods, and we shall explain how to extend the concordance indices previously defined to the case of interacting elementary criteria.

The following example confirms and explains the strange situation observed in Note 4.1 due to the property of the optimistic classification procedure proposed by the authors of ELECTRE Tri.

Inspired by Belton and Stewart (2002), let us suppose that a USA company decides to open an office in Europe and, for this reason, the managing director has to decide the best location for it. Each possible location is characterized by two main factors that are business potential (G
                        
                           1
                        ) and staffing issues (G
                        
                           2
                        ); in particular, the public sector business potential (g
                        (1, 1)) and the private sector business potential (g
                        (1, 2)) are elementary criteria of G
                        
                           1
                        , while the attractiveness to USA staff (g
                        (2, 1)) and the availability of staff (g
                        (2, 2)) are elementary criteria of G
                        
                           2
                        . The hierarchy of the considered criteria is shown in Fig. 1.

Let us suppose that each considered location has to be assigned to one of the following categories of suitability: “Bad” (Cl
                        1), “Medium” (Cl
                        2) and “Good” (Cl
                        3). Let us also focus on the optimistic assignment of a single location a with respect to criteria G
                        
                           1
                         and G
                        
                           2
                        , as well as with respect to the comprehensive level G
                        
                           0
                        . The evaluations of a and those of the reference profiles b
                        1 and b
                        2 separating the categories “Bad–Medium” and “Medium–Good”, respectively, are provided in Table 1
                        (a). The elementary criteria are supposed to be equally important and, therefore, the weight assigned to each elementary criterion is equal to 0.25. Moreover, the indifference and preference thresholds are fixed to be 1 and 3, respectively, for all elementary criteria, while the cutting levels for subcriteria G

                         and, consequently, the cutting level for criterion G

The above example concerns the problem of sorting, however, an analogical situation may also happen when alternatives are compared pairwise, like in the choice or ranking problem in the presence of hierarchical criteria, and subject to interpretation of both outranking and inverse outranking relation on a pair a, b that gives preference, or indifference, or incomparability. Indeed, even if alternative a is not preferred to alternative b with respect to any of the subcriteria

                         We deferred to the Appendix B, the formal explanation of the reason for which the strange situation highlighted in Note 4.1 can occur.

The reader could argue that more than being strange, the previous situation should not occur in practice since it may seem inadmissible that an alternative a is assigned on criterion G
                        
                           r
                         to a category lower than the minimum category to which the same alternative is assigned on the subcriteria directly descending from G
                        
                           r
                        . For this reason, we propose a new procedure that avoids this strange situation. The proposed modification of the optimistic procedure is composed of the following steps:

                           
                              
                                 step (1)
                              
                              compute the optimistic assignment of alternative a with respect to subcriteria

Indeed, the rules defined for the extensions of ELECTRE Tri methods to the case of hierarchy of criteria are exactly the same as the rules defined for ELECTRE Tri methods considering a flat structure of criteria, excepting that in these rules we consider a particular criterion in the hierarchy only.

A typical approach to determine the weights of criteria in the ELECTRE methods is the Simos–Roy–Figueira (SRF) method that has been proposed by Figueira and Roy (2002), improving the original proposal of Simos (1990a, 1990b). Using the SRF method, each criterion is written on one card, and there are also empty cards. The DM is asked to put the cards in a rank order from the least important to the most important. Criteria that are considered as equally important are getting the same rank. Moreover, the DM can put one or more empty cards separating some criteria in the rank order. Each empty card is put in one rank. The greater the number of empty cards separating two sets of indifferent criteria, the greater is the difference of importance between these sets of criteria.

The following example illustrates the application of the SRF method to a hierarchy of criteria. Let us suppose we have a set of criteria organized in two different levels, as shown in Fig. 2
                        .

Suppose that the DM orders before the first level criteria, and then the second level (elementary) criteria. The ordering always starts from the least important to the most important criterion in the considered set. In our example, the DM put the first level criteria in the following order: G
                        
                           1
                        , G
                        
                           3
                        , G
                        
                           2
                        . Moreover, he put one empty card between G
                        
                           1
                         and G
                        
                           3
                        , and two empty cards between G
                        
                           3
                         and G
                        
                           2
                        . For him, G
                        
                           2
                         is ten times more important than G
                        
                           1
                        , so 
                           
                              z
                              =
                              10
                           
                        . By applying the SRF method to this set of criteria we get the following weights:

                        . After that, the DM gave the following order of subcriteria from G

                        .

Let us observe that the proposed extension of the SRF method can be applied not only to ELECTRE methods dealing with sorting decision problems but also to all other hierarchical MCDA methods where it is meaningful to use criteria weights having the interpretation of relative voting power in non-compensatory aggregation, and not of substitution rates like in the weighted sum.

In the classical ELECTRE methods, it is supposed that there is not any significant interaction between criteria but, in many real world decision problems, the evaluation criteria could present a certain degree of interaction that, according to Figueira et al. (2009), can be of three types: mutual strengthening effect (synergy), mutual weakening effect (redundancy), and antagonistic effect. For example, when evaluating sport cars, the criteria maximum speed and acceleration may be considered redundant because, in general, speedy cars have also a good acceleration. Therefore, even if these two criteria can be very important for a DM liking sport cars, their comprehensive importance is smaller than the sum of the importance of the two criteria considered separately. On the other hand, the criteria maximum speed and price contribute to a synergy effect because a speedy car with a low price is very well appreciated. For this reason, the comprehensive importance of these two criteria should be greater than the sum of importance of the two criteria considered separately. Besides, when evaluating a car having good price but bad safety, the weight of criterion price can be reduced because even if the DM appreciates the low price she is really concerned about the safety of the car. In the latter case, the two criteria are antagonistic.

In this section, we shall describe how to deal with the interaction between any two criteria in case of the MCHP applied to ELECTRE Tri methods.

                        . Note, moreover, that Condition 4.2 has to be satisfied when hierarchy and interaction of criteria are considered simultaneously in any type of decision problem, i.e., not only sorting but also choice and ranking.

In order to take into account the possible interactions between criteria in the application of MCHP to ELECTRE Tri methods, it is sufficient to replace the comprehensive and partial concordance indices by the one given in Definition 4.2.

In this section, we shall present the application of the hierarchical ELECTRE Tri-B method to a real world decision problem. In the year 2000, the Transport Infrastructure Regional Study (TIRS) has been undertaken in the context of the stability pact under the lead of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Union (EU) to evaluate the feasibility of the realization of 223 projects regarding roads, ports and airports in the Balkans area and, in particular, in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia and Romania. The different projects have been evaluated with respect to 11 elementary criteria (see Transport Infrastructure Regional Study for further details on TIRS). Taking into account the nature of the elementary criteria, one can build the hierarchy of criteria shown in Fig. 3. Two macro-criteria are considered at the first level of the hierarchy tree:

                        
                           •
                           the socio-economic return on investment (G
                              
                                 1
                              ),

the functionality and coherency of the
                               network (G
                              
                                 2
                              ).

Macro-criterion G
                     
                        1
                      aggregates the social subcriterion (G
                     (1, 1)) and the economic subcriterion (G
                     (1, 2)), while Macro-criterion G
                     
                        2
                      aggregates the functionality of the network subcriterion (G
                     (2, 1)) and the coherency of the network subcriterion (G
                     (2, 2)). Under these four subcriteria, 11 elementary criteria are considered:

                        
                           •

The scores given to the projects by the team of experts on the 11 elementary criteria range from F (the worst) to A (the best). To simplify the definition of reference profiles and comparison thresholds, the qualitative scale F–A was converted to the interval scale 0–10. In Table 3, we provide performances of some of the 223 projects.

Comparing to the original TIRS study, we shall consider only three, and not four categories, to which each project can be assigned with respect to its feasibility of realization. We shall denote them by Cl
                     1, Cl
                     2 and Cl
                     3, and they will contain, respectively, projects to be discarded, projects requiring further investigation for a final decision, and projects which may be funded and implemented rapidly.

In Table 4, we show the performances of reference profiles on the 11 elementary criteria and the corresponding indifference, preference and veto thresholds. Having three categories, we need to define only two profiles, and we suppose that they have the same indifference, preference and veto thresholds on all elementary criteria.

We decided that each cutting level λ
                     
                        r
                     , r ∈ LBO, is equal to 70% of the sum of weights of elementary criteria descending from G
                     
                        r
                     .

In Table 6, we report the classifications of some projects with respect to all criteria and subcriteria in the hierarchy, considering both, optimistic and pessimistic assignment procedures.

Let us observe that when one is using the optimistic assignment procedure, even if project a
                     211 is assigned to category Cl
                     2 with respect to criteria G
                     (1, 1) and G
                     (1, 2), it is assigned to category Cl
                     1 with respect to criterion G
                     
                        1
                     . As already observed in Section 4 and deeply investigated in Appendix B, the reason is that profile b
                     1 is not preferred to a
                     211, neither on criterion G
                     (1, 1) nor on criterion G
                     (1, 2), however, it is preferred to a
                     211 on criterion G
                     
                        1
                     .

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we presented an extension of the very well known family of ELECTRE Tri sorting methods, ELECTRE Tri-B (Yu, 1992), ELECTRE Tri-C (Almeida Dias et al., 2010) and ELECTRE Tri-nC (Almeida Dias et al., 2012), to decision problems with multiple criteria structured in a hierarchical way. To this end, we applied the Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP) proposed recently in Corrente et al. (2012). Application of MCHP permits to get recommendations on the assignments of alternatives not only at the comprehensive level but also in all particular nodes of the hierarchy tree until the last but one level. In particular, regarding the extension of the ELECTRE Tri-B method, we introduced two properties of coherence for outranking with respect to a given criterion, taking into account outranking on criteria immediately descending from it. In this context we singled out some conditions on the cutting levels that proved to be necessary and sufficient to ensure the consistency of the outranking in the hierarchy.

In the paper, we considered only the case where the DM is able to provide a direct preference information, that is, she can give values to all involved parameters (weights of criteria, indifference, preference and veto thresholds, as well as cutting levels). In this context, we showed how to fix the cutting levels so as to respect the coherence properties (C1) and (C2). We provided a theorem specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for these two properties to be satisfied. It is worth stressing that coherence properties (C1) and (C2) do not hold for hierarchical versions of ELECTRE Tri sorting methods only, but also for other types of ELECTRE methods applied within the MCHP framework to choice and ranking problems. We took into account the possibility of handling interactions between criteria in a way similar to Figueira et al. (2009), and we extended the SRF method (Figueira & Roy, 2002) to compute the weights of criteria when they are organized in a hierarchical structure. The presented extension of the SRF method can be applied to all types of decision problems (choice, ranking and sorting problems) with a hierarchical structure of the set of criteria aggregated in a non-compensatory way. The proposed methodology has been illustrated by a didactic example where we applied the hierarchical ELECTRE Tri-B method to a real world decision problem.

In a future study, we plan to take into account the indirect preference information elicited by the DM in terms of some decision examples. To this end, we plan to apply the Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) (Corrente, Greco, Kadziński, & Słowiński, 2013a; 2014; Greco, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2008) that considers simultaneously all sets of preference model parameters compatible with the preference information provided by the DM. Moreover, other interesting directions of research could be:

                        
                           •
                           investigation of the relationship between the assignments obtained by the hierarchical ELECTRE Tri-B and ELECTRE Tri-C methods, similarly to what has been already done in Bouyssou and Marchant (2015) in case of a flat structure of criteria,

generalization of the SRF method to the case of group decision making and, in particular, to problems with a hierarchical structure of criteria. This could be useful to deal with real world group decision making problems as that one recently considered in Morais, de Almeida, and Figueira (2014), where the SRF method has been applied to obtain the weights of criteria for each DM.

Indeed, as we shall show in the following, in general, the fact that a is not preferred to b on all subcriteria G
                     (r, j) of criterion G
                     
                        r
                      implies that a is not preferred to b on criterion G
                     
                        r
                     . Only in two cases, nothing could be said about the preference of a over b on criterion G
                     
                        r
                     . Let us analyze in which cases it could happen.

Remember that not(a≻(r, j)

As a consequence of this analysis, we underline that two cases could be “troublesome”, that are cases γ
                     6) and γ
                     7) and thus, the hypotheses of cases γ
                     6) and γ
                     7) are not in contradiction with the fact that a≻
                        r
                     
                     b. Indeed, in one case, if a is incomparable with b for some subcriteria G
                     (r, j) and a is indifferent to b for some subcriteria G
                     (r, j), it is still possible that a is preferred to b on criterion G
                     
                        r
                     . Analogously, even if a is indifferent to b for some subcriteria, incomparable for others, and there is a strict preference of b over a on some others, it is still possible that a is preferred to b on criterion G
