                  The main obstacle in development of intelligent autodiagnosis medical systems based on the analysis of phonocardiography (PCG) signals is noise. The noise can be caused by digestive and respiration sounds, movements or even signals from the surrounding environment and it is characterized by wide frequency and intensity spectrum. This spectrum overlaps the heart tones spectrum, which makes the problem of PCG signal filtrating complex. The most common method for filtering such signals are wavelet denoising algorithms. In previous studies, in order to determine the optimum wavelet denoising parameters the disturbances were simulated by Gaussian white noise. However, this paper shows that this noise has a variable character. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is adaptation of a wavelet denoising algorithm for the filtration of real PCG signal disturbances from signals recorded by a mobile devices in a noisy environment. The best results were obtained for Coif 5 wavelet at the 10th decomposition level with the use of a minimaxi threshold selection algorithm and mln rescaling function. The performance of the algorithm was tested on four pathological heart sounds: early systolic murmur, ejection click, late systolic murmur and pansystolic murmur.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Despite a significant decrease in the mortality rate of people suffering from heart diseases in the European Union countries (in past decade about 30% [1]) cardiovascular pathologies are still the main cause of death [1]. Therefore, there is a need to find new and to improve existing auto-diagnostic and treatment methods. In our opinion, one of such methods, which in the future can improve the process of medical diagnosis by building intelligent cardiac monitoring systems, is phonocardiography (PCG). This method, thanks to a high availability and simplicity attracted attention of both cardiologists and engineers, who want to develop medical diagnostic systems.

Nowadays, technological development provides new tools able to eliminate noise from the signals with overlapping spectra (like in the case of real phonocardiography signals). Among them, wavelet denoising algorithms can be placed at the first place as the most widely used and giving encouraging results. In general, the origin of signal distortions can be divided into two groups – external and internal [2]. The external disturbances include a wide frequency and intensity spectrum of noise caused by speech and noise caused by motion, whereas the group of signals with internal origin disturbances consists mainly signals caused by digestive and respiratory processes. Moreover, there are many other types of noise, which during the measure may occur occasionally, such as vocal (coughing, laughing), physiological (muscle movements, swallowing), sensor (rubbing) and ambient (knocking at the door, ambient music, phone ringing, footsteps) [3]. On the other hand some of the heart sounds, which have similar character to noise, such as the late systolic murmur or the pansystolic murmur, the diastolic rumble, the ejection click, etc. may indicate the occurrence of a heart disease [3]. Therefore, the development of precise noise removal algorithms, capable to work in noisy environments is of great importance and is the research subject of many scientists.

One of the first attempts to eliminate signal disturbances was made by Khan et al. who on the base of an adaptive filter principle build a multi-microphone array system [4]. This system, by measuring the intensity of breath and removing it from PCG signals, significantly improved the quality of the signals. However, its major drawback was the size of devices and the number (up to three) of additional sensors placed around the patient׳s neck. A similar approach was made by Zia, Griffel and Semmlow, who in order to remove the digestive sounds placed a microphone on the patient׳s stomach [5]. However, setting the microphone on the patient׳s body proved to be as uncomfortable as placing sensors around the patient׳s neck. Such solution may be problematic during designing home healthcare systems [6,7]. A huge impact on the development of effective home healthcare systems had a series of publications published by Naseri et al. [8–10]. In their first work, based on a wavelet-based thresholding algorithm and baseline wander removal, a binary quality assessment algorithm (accepted/rejected) was developed [8]. Later, technique of noise/spike detection based on a cyclic random process with a non-stationary period intervals ensuring sensitivity of 91.41% and positive predictive value of 92.86% were developed [9]. In their last work a system for recognition of S1–S4 heart sounds was worked out [10]. In preprocessing, to improve the quality of the signal, they used wavelet-based noise cancelation using desired coefficient and wavelet-based thresholding [10].

Further studies were focused mainly on the development of adaptive filtration methods [11]. One of the latest was a passive fatal monitoring system, which is based on adaptive wavelet denoising method [11]. A new dynamic PCG model combined with the Kalman filter was developed by Almasi et al. [12]. An advanced PCG system based on a two-channel recording process was developed by Várady et al. [13]. However, as the authors observed [13], a comprehensive evaluation and clinical validation is still needed. A wavelet shrinkage denoising method described by Zhao was able to remove noise from non-stationary PCG signals from clinic patients tests [14].

However, the most common methods and giving best results are the wavelet based denoising algorithms [15–18], widely used in electrocardiography signal filtration [19,20], PCG signal analysis [21,22], PCG feature extraction [23,24], and structural health monitoring [25,26]. A wavelet denoising method developed by Messer et al. [15] enabled independent manipulation on the recorded PCG signal and required no additional measuring operations. Therefore, the measuring device could be reduced in size and during examination, the patients were in comfort. Simulation studies [15–18] showed the advantage of the wavelet denoising methods over other adaptive algorithms. In the Messer, Agzarian and Abbott studies, the best parameters of wavelet denoising algorithms were specified as: Coif (4 and 5), Daubechies (11, 14, and 20), and Symlet (9, 11, and 14) wavelets, 5th decomposition level, Rigruse threshold selection algorithm and sln rescaling function [15]. In order to eliminate power and mechanical noises Liu, Wang and Wang use a wavelet thresholding algorithm [16]. They found that best removing noise was Coif wavelet basis at 8th decomposition level and the minimaxi threshold selection algorithm [16]. The results were also tested on pathological heart sounds [16]. Cherif, Debbal and Bereksi-Reguig noticed that the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) more efficiently removes clicks and murmurs from PCG signals than the Packet Wavelet Transform (PWT) [17]. Recent research in this area was focused on the development of new wavelet basis functions capable to denoise fatal phonocardiography signals (fPCG) [18].

Based on the parameters of the wavelet denoising algorithm determined by the Messer et al. [15], expected results during filtration of the real PCG signals recorded by mobile devices in a noisy environment were not achieved. The recorded PCG signals and the denoised signals are presented in 
                        Fig. 1. It can be easily observed that both waveforms are identical and each part of the signal is classified as noise. This may be caused by the nature of interferences, which were assumed to have a Gaussian white noise distribution [15]. In fact, these disturbances have no white noise distribution, what is shown in the further part of this paper. The noisy environment refers to the fact that during the recording no special attention was paid to eliminate environmental disturbances. During the measurement a TV set and a PC computer generating about 65 and 60dB noise, respectively, were switched on.

Referring to the problem mentioned above, the research question of this paper may be formed as an attempt to adapt the wavelet denoising algorithm for effective interference rejection (both, of external and internal origins) for real measurements of PCG signals recorded by mobile devices in noisy environments. It is crucial to consider the nature of the disturbances occurring during such measure.

@&#METHODS@&#

The process of denoising PCG signals is divided into two parts. In the first, a signal acquisition system and preliminary stage of PCG signal processing, are presented. A wavelet denoising algorithm is described in the second part. Its main function is to remove the remaining noise (of internal and external origins) overlapping the spectrum of heart tones.


                        
                        Fig. 2 shows a measurement device, which allows heart sounds recording with the use of a mobile device. It is designed on the base of a classic acoustic stethoscope, Exacta, produced by Yavit Company [27] and a smartphone. In both stethoscope olives MIC 111 microphones [28], were placed. They are characterized by a bandwidth of 10Hz–16kHz and sensitivity of 58dB±2dB [28], which allows to record heart sounds effectively. Signal from the microphones are combined by a headphone splitter 1/8″ TRS and are recorded by a smartphone. Later, the signals are stored on a computer and subjected to further processing (low pass filtering and wavelet denoising) in Matlab 2012R software, aimed to improve the quality of the signals.

The frequency range of human heart tones is between 10Hz and 800Hz [8,29]. Therefore, to remove noise above the spectrum of heart tones it is necessary to use a low-pass filter. Due to the stability and linearity of the phase (
                        Fig. 3), a finite impulse response (FIR) filter was implemented. Because the attenuation of the Hamming window is higher than the sound level recorded by the device, the Hamming window method was chosen. A transition bandwidth was set on 50Hz, whereas the order of the filter was selected as 80 and designed based on the (8πM−1) relation.

The purpose of wavelet denoising is to remove from decomposed PCG signals the coefficients below a determined threshold. The wavelet denoising technique is based on the fact that some of decomposed wavelet details are connected with the average value of noise, while others are related to ‘clean’ PCG signal. Therefore, if ‘unimportant’ details will be removed, the original signal can be reconstructed on the base of remaining coefficients, without any loss of significant information contained in the signal [15,30]. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), in comparison to the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), is characterized by lower computational complexity and similar quality of filtration [15]. Because, Cherif et al. [17] proved that DWT better reject the clicks and murmurs over the Packet Wavelet Transform (PWT), the authors decided to use only the DWT in the presented study.

In order to achieve satisfying results of denoising, determination of all the parameters used by wavelet denoising algorithm, such as the type of wavelet, decomposition level, threshold selection rules and threshold rescaling option, is of a great importance.

The Wavelet transform has been developing for more than 20 years. During this time several wavelets families were designed. However, in order to obtain best results only orthogonal wavelets should be considered [15,31]. In previous studies, best results were obtained by the Coif (4 and 5) [15,16], Daubechies (11, 14, and 20), and Symlet (9, 11, and 14) wavelets. Therefore in this study only those wavelet basis functions are considered [15] (
                        Fig. 4).

The next important step is to choose an appropriate threshold selection algorithm. 
                        Table 1 presents four algorithms available in Matlab, and considered in the paper.

The first method (Rigrsure) uses a type of selection based on Stein’s unbiased risk estimate (SURE). In this case the risk estimate for threshold x
                        0 is minimalized by changing x
                        0. In the second (Sqtwolog) method the constant threshold is calculated [15,32] according to the relation:
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 T
                                 =
                                 
                                    
                                       2
                                       
                                       log
                                       (
                                       l
                                       e
                                       n
                                       g
                                       t
                                       h
                                       (
                                       X
                                       )
                                       )
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        Threshold (T) is equal to the square root of two decimal logarithms of the signal length (X). Next threshold selection method (Heursure) is a combination of Rigrsure and Sqtwolog methods. If the SURE estimate is noised and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, then Sqtwolog method is chosen. The fourth method (Minimaxi) uses a constant threshold value calculated according to the minimaxi principle of the mean square error. This principle is widespread in statistic and is applied to determine the minimum value from the maximum mean square error [15].

The noise removing method in the wavelet denoising process can be described by the following equation:
                           
                              (2)
                              
                                 S
                                 (
                                 n
                                 )
                                 =
                                 f
                                 (
                                 n
                                 )
                                 +
                                 σ
                                 e
                                 (
                                 n
                                 )
                                 
                              
                           
                        where S is the produced signal, f is denoised signal, e is noise; its strength is marked as σ, and n is a randomly distributed value [15,30,31]. The purpose of the algorithm is suppression of the disturbance e allowing to obtain the original signal. In order to properly implement this process three threshold rescaling options are considered: one, sln and mln 
                        [15,30].

The one threshold rescaling option uses a basic white noise model described by formula (2), whereas the sln is associated with the basic noise model and uses an unscaled white noise algorithm with single estimation of the noise level. The mln threshold rescaling option refers to a noise model with a non-white noise algorithm. In this case the rescaling option depends on the level of the noise estimate [15,30,31].

Parameters of the wavelet denoising algorithm determined by Sheil Messer et al. [15] were implemented as a base for searching for the best parameters allowing for denoising signals recorded in a noisy environment. Therefore, following the simulation, Rigrsure threshold selection algorithm and sln rescaling function (which use the basic white noise model) were chosen. The decomposition process was performed with the use of coif 5 wavelet. According to authors [15] the optimal decomposition level depends mainly on the power of noise. If its level in signal is significant then the level of wavelet decomposition should be consistently increased. Therefore, since the objective is denoising of PCG signals recorded in a noisy environment, the highest (10th) decomposition level was applied.

In Fig. 1 it is presented that both waveforms (original and denoised) are identical and any part of the signal is classified as noise. A crucial issue during wavelet denoising of real PCG signal disturbances is the threshold rescaling option, which does not consider the real nature of noise (different from white one). During simulation made by Messer et al. [15] to ‘clean’ heart sounds an uncorrelated Gaussian white noise was superimposed. Whereas in the case of real PCG signals recorded in a noisy environment the white noise character of distortions was not observed (
                        
                        Figs. 5 and 6).

Moreover, the signal spectrum presented in Fig. 5 beside the two heart sound picks contains an unevenly spread noise with an increased power in low frequency band. It is more evident in Fig. 6 where the comparison between the power spectral densities (PSD) of white, red, and pink noise and the PSD of noise registered during real PCG signal measurements are presented. It can be observed that the PSD of phonocardiography signal noise is very similar to the PSD of red or pink noise. The energy of the white noise is uniformly distributed over the whole frequency interval, whereas the energy of pink and red noise or noise of PCG signal, decreases with an increase in the frequency. Therefore, the character of noise should be considered as colored rather than white. It should be noted that previous studies showed that also heart beat rhythms may have a pink noise character [33,34], which may be modeled as 1/f process [33,35].

In practice all frequencies in white noise are of the same energy and its power spectral density is calculated by the formula:

Pink noise (also named as fractal noise or 1/f noise) is widely found in many biological and physiological processes and is characterized by the same energy per octave. Its PSD is determined by the following relation [33]:

The occurrence of pink noise was observed in electroencephalographic rhythms, heart rate variability and respiratory intervals [33,36].

In order to find optimal wavelet denoising parameters for signals recorded in noisy environment, to clean PCG signals (from online database [38]) various doses of red and pink noise were added, what is presented in 
                        Fig. 7. Because the wavelet denoising algorithm performs similarly, regardless of the color of noise (
                        Fig. 8), in the further part of the paper only pink noise, leading to slightly worse results, is considered. In order to evaluate the algorithms the most commonly used signal-to-noise ratio, defined as the relation between power of signal (P

                        where f
                        1 is a ‘clean’ signal without noise, f
                        2 is the denoised signal and n is the signal length. Basically, it is coefficient of determination [39] normalized in the range from 0% to 100%, and can be defined as the ratio of the explained variation (given as a relation between data set and proposed model [39]) to the total variation. It is widely used in statistic and automatic control to evaluate how well data fit the proposed model. Lastly, a normalized determination coefficient was successfully used to evaluate wavelet denoising algorithms of electrocardiography signals [19]. This coefficient provides important information about morphological changes of the signal f
                        2 and varies from 0%, when signals are mismatched and information is lost to 100%, when perfect fit between the signals can be observed.

The first step is the determination of a wavelet basis that remove noise the most accurately. 
                        Table 2 presents a comparison of the algorithm performances for the specific wavelet basis presented as best in previous studies, that is Coif (4 and 5), Daubechies (11, 14, and 20), and Symlet (9, 11, and 14) [15,16]. The decomposition was made at the 10th level and the threshold was calculated by the use of minimaxi threshold selection algorithm and mln rescaling function. It can be observed that higher order of wavelets leads to much higher accuracy. The best performance of SNR was given by the wavelets Daubechies (especially the Daubechies 20). However, the fit coefficient indicates that during filtration important information can be lost. Wavelet Symlet 14 and Coif 5 give comparable SNR, however, coif 5 gives a much higher fit coefficient. Therefore, the Coif 5 can be considered as wavelet removing noise in the most precise way and was used in further studies.

The next step is determination of the decomposition level. The signal-to-noise ratio and the fit coefficient calculated for the signal contaminated by pink noise of 5, 10, 15, and 20 dBs are presented in 
                        Table 3. During the decomposition coif 5 wavelet was used. The value of the threshold was calculated with the use of minimaxi threshold selection algorithm and mln rescaling function. It was expected that lower levels of decomposition did not allow to remove the noise as precisely as the higher orders. The highest SNR, as well as the fit coefficient, are calculated for the 10th decomposition level. The worst results are obtained for the 4th decomposition level.

Since the decomposition parameters – coif 5 wavelet and the 10th decomposition level – are determined, the next step is to define the value of the threshold (details below this value are removed). In 
                        Fig. 9 a comparison of the threshold selection algorithms for different values of pink noise is presented. Simulations were performed by the use of mln rescaling function. Despite the fact that for small intensity of noise (up to 10dB) the highest fit coefficient is calculated by Rigrsure method, the highest value of noise leads to worst results. Moreover this algorithm provides also the lowest SNR. Therefore, it may be found as the worst algorithm for removing pink noise. The best signal-to-noise ratio is obtained by Sqtwolog algorithm, however in this case the fit coefficient indicates that too much information is removed. The results of SNR by Heursure and Minimaxi algorithm are very similar and the value of the fit coefficient indicates the superiority of Minimaxi algorithm.

The following step is to find an optimum rescaling function. For this purpose in 
                        Fig. 10 a comparison of SNR and the fit coefficient of mln, sln, and one algorithms is presented. The decomposition was made by the use of Coif 5 wavelet at 10th level. The threshold was calculated using Minimaxi algorithm. Overall one algorithm removes noise most rigorously and hence some information about patient’s health can be lost. The best algorithm for removing white noise – sln, removes pink noise insufficiently. The best results are obtained by mln rescaling function.


                     
                     Fig. 11 presents the best results of the wavelet denoising algorithm applied to the phonocardiography signal recorded by mobile devices in a noisy environment. The noisy environment refers to the fact that no special attempt was made to eliminate environmental disturbances during recording. During the measure a TV set and a PC computer generating about 65 and 60dB, respectively, were switched on. The best results of wavelet denoising are obtained by the use of wavelet coif 5 at the 10 decomposition level, minimaxi threshold selection algorithm and mln rescaling option.

In order to find whether during filtration any of frequency contents of the recorded signal is lost, a comparison of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms for various window sizes, is presented in the Fig. 11. When STFT spectrograms for short windows accurately present the time when disturbing frequency in the signal appear. Then, spectrograms of long windows accurately correspond to the values of these frequencies. It can be found that in both parts, a and b, the same frequencies can be observed when S1 or S2 heart tones appear. Therefore, it can be concluded any important frequency contents of PCG signal were lost during filtration. That is to say the optimal wavelet denoising parameters (coif 5 wavelet, 10th decomposition level, minimaxi threshold selection algorithm and mln threshold scaling option) allows to remove noise effectively from PCG signal recorded by mobile devices in noisy environments.

Furthermore, the algorithm was also tested on some pathological heart sounds, which are presented in 
                     Fig. 12. In order to find whether during filtration the morphology of the signals is preserved, on the left hand side of the figure a comparison of the original and the denoised signals is presented. On the right hand side a comparison of the noised and the clean signals, showing the efficiency of the algorithm performance is presented. The chosen level of noise power corresponds to the power level of pathological sounds. Despite small distortions in the signal introduced by the filtration algorithm the quality of the signal was significantly improved for both pathological sounds: short time (early systolic murmur, ejection click) and long time (late systolic murmur, pansystolic murmur). After filtration it is easy to find the pathology even without the use of special tools. Further research should be focused on performance of the algorithm in the case of patients presenting various cardiac diseases.

Moreover, an attempt to combine wavelet transforms with artificial intelligence methods (e.g. the neural networks) may enable remote threshold adaptation, what significantly improves the signal quality. Furthermore, such an adaptive algorithm should be resistant to alterations in the character of noise and should perform well regardless of the noise color.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

An attempt to develop a simple mobile-based measuring device allowing to record phonocardiography signals in a noisy environments, has been achieved. In order to remove noise from PCG signals wavelet denoising algorithm was used. It was shown that due to the variable character of noise it is necessary to modify algorithm parameters determined by Messer et al. [15].

One of the greatest benefit of the wavelet denoising algorithm developed is its possibility of immediate processing of recorded PCG signal. In the future the mentioned advantage may enable device miniaturization resulting in elimination of additional sensors. Future systems based on wavelet denoising algorithms could enable examinations for a longer period of time, not affecting the patient’s lifestyle adversely. It could also lead to the development of a system capable to find the diseases occurring incidentally (like arrhythmias).

According to a World Health Organization report [40], in typical day the power of noise can reach even 55dB. The presented research proved the effectiveness of the wavelet filtering process, in spite of hard measurement conditions. This system is of great applicability. By obtaining LPC coefficients it may lead to development of a neural network classifiers [41]. The authors believe that in the future such systems will facilitate situation of people directed to hospitalization.
