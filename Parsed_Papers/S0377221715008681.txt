                  This paper studies strategic decentralization in binary choice composite network congestion games. A player decentralizes if she lets some autonomous agents to decide respectively how to send different parts of her stock from the origin to the destination. This paper shows that, with convex, strictly increasing and differentiable arc cost functions, an atomic splittable player always has an optimal unilateral decentralization strategy. Besides, unilateral decentralization gives her the same advantage as being the leader in a Stackelberg congestion game. Finally, unilateral decentralization of an atomic player has a negative impact on the social cost and on the costs of the other players at the equilibrium of the congestion game.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This paper introduces strategic decentralization into composite network congestion games, and studies its properties in a specific subclass of such games. A player decentralizes her decision-making if she lets each of her deputies decide independently how to send the part of her stock deputed to him from its origin to its destination. A unilateral decentralization can be beneficial or deleterious for the decentralizing player herself, and it also has an influence on the other players’ utility and the social welfare as well. This paper provides a detailed analysis of these problems in the case where all the players have the same binary choice.

In a network congestion game, i.e. routing game, each player has a certain quantity of stock and a finite set of choices. A choice is a directed, acyclic path from the player’s origin to her destination. A player with a stock of infinitesimal weight is nonatomic. She has to attribute her stock to only one choice. A player with a stock of strictly positive weight is atomic. She (more rigorously, her stock) is splittable if she can divide it into several parts and affect each part to a different choice. She can also be non splittable, which is the case originally studied in the seminal work of Rosenthal (1973) on congestion games. This paper considers only the splittable case so that the word splittable is often omitted. A path is composed of a series of arcs, and the cost of a path is the sum of the costs of its component arcs. The cost entailed to a user of an arc depends on the total weight of the stocks on it as well as on the quantity of that user’s stock on it. A player wishes to minimize her cost, which is the total cost to her stock. A game with both nonatomic and atomic players is called a composite game. An equilibrium in a composite congestion game is called a composite equilibrium (CE for short) (Boulogne, Altman, Kameda, & Pourtallier, 2002; Harker, 1988; Wan, 2012; Yang & Zhang, 2008). An equilibrium does not necessarily minimize the social cost, i.e. the total cost to all the players.

In a composite congestion game, an atomic player of weight m decentralizes if she is replaced by a composite set of players called her deputies (i.e. n atomic players of weight

Here is an example of advantageous decentralization. Two atomic players both have a stock of weight

                              )

                      respectively. At the equilibrium, both players send weight 
                        
                           2

                      on the first arc and

                      on the second one. The cost is 4.14 to both players and the social cost is 8.28. If player 1 deputes her stock to two atomic deputies both of weight

                      then at the equilibrium of the resulting congestion game, both deputies send weight 
                        
                           1
                           44
                        
                      on the first arc, while player 2 sends weight 
                        
                           1
                           4
                        
                      there. The cost is 2.06 to both deputies of player 1. Hence player 1 gains by decentralizing because her current cost 4.12 is lower than 4.14. However, player 2’s cost is now 4.59 and the social cost is 8.71, both higher than before.

Assuming that the arc cost functions are convex, strictly increasing and continuously differentiable in congestion, this paper obtains the following properties of unilateral decentralization in composite congestion games with binary choice or, equivalently, in a two-terminal two-parallel-arc composite routing game:

                        
                           (i)
                           For the atomic player who decentralizes unilaterally, all her decentralization strategies are weakly dominated by single-atomic ones which depute her stock to at most one atomic deputies in addition to nonatomic ones (Theorem 2.1). A fortiori, she possesses an optimal decentralization strategy (Theorem 3.1), which depends on her relative size among all the players.

Unilateral decentralization gives an atomic player the same advantage as being the leader in a Stackelberg congestion game (Theorem 3.2).

After the unilateral decentralization of an atomic player, the social cost at the equilibrium increases or does not change, and the cost to each of her opponents increases or does not change (Theorem 4.1).

Although the above results are obtained in the specific settingf of binary choice games, the goal of this paper is to introduce the notion of strategic decentralization into composite congestion games, to point out its significance, and to initiate a systematic study of its properties.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model, defines decentralization, and shows the special role of single-atomic decentralization strategies. Section 3 proves the existence of an optimal unilateral decentralization strategy, and shows that unilateral decentralization gives an atomic player the same advantage as being the leader in a Stackelberg congestion game. Section 4 focuses on the impact of unilateral decentralization on the social cost and the other players’ cost. Section 5 concludes. The proofs and auxiliary results are regrouped in Section 6.

The “inverse” concept of decentralization – coalition formation or collusion between players – has been extensively studied. Hayrapetyan, Tardos, and Wexler (2006) first define the price of collusion (PoC) of a parallel network to be the ratio between the worst equilibrium social cost after the nonatomic players form disjoint coalitions and the worst equilibrium social cost without coalitions. Bhaskar, Fleischer, Huang, Eisenbrand, and Shepherd (2010) extended this study to series-parallel networks. (A series-parallel network can be constructed by merging in series or in parallel several graphs of parallel arcs.) This index is closely related to another important notion: the price of anarchy (PoA), which is introduced by Koutsoupias, Papadimitriou, Meinel, and Tison (1999) (and Papadimitriou, 2001) as the ratio between the worst equilibrium social cost and the minimal social cost in nonatomic games. Cominetti, Correa, and Stier-Moses (2009) derive the first bounds on the PoA with atomic players. For a specific network structure, one can deduce the PoC by the PoA with atomic players and the PoA with nonatomic players. Further results on the bound of the PoA with atomic players are obtained in Harks (2011), Roughgarden and Schoppmann (2011) and Bhaskar et al. (2010). Roughgarden and Tardos (2002) and Correa, Schulz, and Stier-Moses (2008) provide fundamental results on the bound of the PoA with nonatomic players. PoA in nonatomic games with asymmetric costs or elastic demands is studied in Perakis (2007) and Chau and Sim (2003), among others.

Beyond the coalitions formed by nonatomic players, Cominetti et al. (2009), Altman et al. (2011), and Huang (2013) consider those formed by atomic players. Their results can be interpreted as the impact of certain kinds of collusion and hence, the “inverse” of it, decentralization, on the social cost. Wan (2012) studies the impact of coalition formation on the nonatomic players’ cost outside the coalition in parallel-link networks. In terms of the impact of coalition formation on the cost of the coalition members themselves, Cominetti et al. (2009), Altman et al. (2011) and Wan (2012) provide examples in different contexts of disadvantageous coalition formation for the members themselves. These are actually examples of advantageous decentralization. Finally, for works on strategic decentralization, one can cite Sorin and Wan (2013) in integer-splitting congestion games, and Baye, Crocker, and Ju (1996) in industrial organization (where they call the strategic decentralization of a firm “divisionalization”).

Finally, let us point out that the above-mentioned coalition formation is studied by the approach of comparative statics in a noncooperative game setting. It is different from the cooperative routing games studied in Quant, Borm, and Reijnierse (2006) and Blocq and Orda (2014).

Like all composite congestion games taking place in a two-terminal parallel-arc networks, game Γ(T) always admits a unique CE. The reader is referred to Richman and Shimkin (2007) or Wan (2012) for a proof. For the uniqueness of equilibria in congestion games with different types of players and in more general networks, see, for example, Meunier and Pradeau (2014)

One can prove that cases (i) and (ii) correspond to the situation where arc 1 is less costly than arc 2 at the CE x of any composite congestion game taking place in this network with the total weight of the players being M (cf. Lemma 6.1), whereas cases (iii) and (iv) correspond to the inverse.

According to Theorem 2.1, if N has an optimal decentralization strategy, there must be an equivalent SA strategy of her. Therefore, instead of studying the existence of an optimal strategy in

                           R

                           N

                                       (nontrivial). Atomic player N has at least one optimal strategy which is not necessarily nonatomic or trivial in the remaining situations.
                                    

Some remarks on the profitability of strategic decentralization of atomic player N are necessary here. It is known (Orda, Rom, and Shimkin, 1993; Wan, 2012, also see Lemma 6.1) that smaller players are more likely to free ride by using the least costly arc(s). The bigger a player is, the more she tends to use the more expensive arc to internalize the negative externality of her choice on her own stock. Accordingly, as Theorem 3.1 shows, the optimal choice of atomic player N also depends on her relative size among all the players. In the nonatomic case, either atomic player N is too small compared with her atomic opponents, or all the players are small. Then, she can never change the outcome of the congestion game by unilateral decentralization, because she and her potential deputies always behave like free-riders. In the trivial case, atomic player N is very big compared to her opponents. If she decentralizes, she cannot free ride on them to her advantage because they are too small. Moreover, since her deputies are not internalizing enough their externalities, she actually loses by decentralizing. In the non trivial case, atomic player N is neither too small to be always a free-rider, nor big enough to be dominating. In this case, by some appropriate decentralization, she manages to free ride on her atomic opponents.

Besides, let us point out that although the paper studies a one-person decision problem where atomic player N chooses how to decentralize, an alternative formulation of the problem as an extensive form game is also possible. By the definition of N’s cost

                                 α
                                 ,

                                 )
                              
                           
                         induced by her choice α, the problem can be considered as a two-stage game called unilateral decentralization game. In the first stage, only N makes a move by choosing a decentralization strategy. In the second stage, her deputies created by this choice as well as the players in

                         play a composite congestion game. Then, an optimal decentralization strategy α of atomic player N and the corresponding CE zα

                                    N
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                         constitute a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the unilateral decentralization game. Theorem 3.1 shows that an SPNE exists in this game.

However, this unilateral decentralization game is not precisely a Stackelberg game in the sense that the leader, atomic player N, moves in the first stage and the followers, 
                           
                              
                                 T

                                    N
                                 
                              
                              ,
                           
                         move in the second stage. As a matter of fact, by decentralizing unilaterally in the first stage, player N creates new players, i.e. her deputies, who will participate in the second stage. Hence, while making her choice in the first stage, player N should anticipate not only the action of her opponents 
                           
                              T

                                 N
                              
                           
                         but also that of her own deputies in the second stage.

This subsection compares the advantage of being able to decentralize unilaterally and that of being the leader in a Stackelberg congestion game. Stackelberg-type behavior in routing is studied in Karakostas and Kolliopoulos (2009)

Obviously, player N cannot do worse in the Stackelberg game than in the unilateral decentralization game, because she can always do by herself what she anticipates her deputies to do. On the contrary, there can be a strategy (x
                        1, x
                        2) of player N in the Stackelberg game that cannot be “mimicked” by a decentralization strategy. In other words, no decentralization strategy α satisfies that, at the CE of the induced congestion game, the aggregate weight of player N’s deputies’ stock on arc r is exactly xr
                        . However, such a strategy (x
                        1, x
                        2) cannot be optimal as the proof of the theorem shows.

One should not deduce from Theorem 3.2 that the study of unilateral decentralization is useless because, once being the first mover, an atomic player need only do what her optimal deputies would have done. As pointed out in Sorin and Wan (2013), in a congestion game, a player’s choice has an influence on other players’ costs not via her identity (i.e. anonymously) but via the weight of her stock attributing to each particular choice. The behavior of decentralization is thus feasible in terms of strategies and undetectable to the others. These two features distinguish decentralization, as a strategic opportunity, from the first mover’s advantage in a Stackelberg congestion game.

This section studies the impact of atomic player N’s unilateral decentralization on the other players’ costs and the social cost. Recall that the trivial decentralization strategy 
                        
                           α

                      corresponds to not decentralizing. Thus one has only to compare the cost to the players in

                           In addition, equalities hold only in the nonatomic case, i.e. when the assumptions in the first case of 
                           
                              Theorem 3.1
                            
                           hold.
                        

Recall that the smaller a player is, the more she tends to free ride by using the less costly arc (cf. remark after Theorem 3.1) and exerts a higher externality on the other players. By decentralizing, atomic player N lets her deputies, who are smaller than her, free ride more aggressively. In other words, her deputies put more weight on the less costly arc, arc 1, than she herself would have done. Not only do these deputies of N increase the cost of the less expensive arc for its users, they also drive the others to put more weight on the more expensive arc, arc 2. In this way, the unilateral decentralization of N increases the social cost as well as her opponents’ costs.


                     Meunier and Pradeau (2015, Theorem 3) recover a particular case of Theorem 4.1 concerning social cost and without nonatomic players. They show that in an atomic game taking place in a two-terminal two parallel-arc network with increasing, strictly convex and differentiable arc cost functions, if an atomic player i transfers some of her stock to a smaller atomic player j (Tj
                      ≤ Ti
                     ), then the social cost at the CE increases or remain constant after the transfer. In particular, when taking 
                        
                           
                              T
                              j
                           
                           =
                           0
                           ,
                        
                      this transfer of stock is equivalent to the decentralization of atomic player i who deputes her stock to two atomic deputies.

This paper first introduces strategic decentralization behavior into composite congestion games. Then, in the particular setting of binary choice case, it shows (i) the existence of optimal unilateral decentralization which depends on the relative size of the decentralizing player, (ii) the “equivalence” between being the only player to decentralize and being the leader in a Stackelberg game, and (iii) the negative impacts of unilateral decentralization on the others.

With more general network structure, Theorem 4.1 is no longer valid.

In the setting of single OD (where all the players share the same origin and the same destination), Huang (2013) provides the following example adapted in our language. In the network shown on the left hand side of Fig. 2, the social cost at the unique equilibrium with two atomic players of weight 200 and 21 respectively increases when the atomic player of weight 21 deputes her stock to two atomic deputies of weight 20.9 and 0.1 respectively.


                     Cominetti et al. (2009) provide the following example in a multiple OD game. The network is shown on the right hand side of Fig. 2. Only arc

                      has non constant cost function. A group of nonatomic players and an atomic player both have weight 1. The nonatomic group has OD pair (A, B) and available paths

                           ,
                        
                      while the atomic player has OD pair (C, D) and available paths 
                        
                           C

                      and

                           −
                           D
                        
                     . The social cost at the CE is 3.89. If the atomic player deputes her stock to a group of nonatomic players, the social cost at the new CE is 3.8, lower than 3.89. Altman et al. (2011) provide an example of multiple OD game, where the decentralization of an atomic player to several atomic deputies increases the social cost.

These examples show that our result concerning the social cost can neither be extended to single OD games with more than two parallel arcs, nor to multiple OD games even if each OD pair is linked by two parallel arcs. The validity of the result concerning the opponents of the decentralizer remains an open question.

Besides, this paper only considers unilateral decentralization. Decentralization games in which all the atomic players decentralize simultaneously are worth examining. Another potential extension follows Sorin and Wan (2013), where a deputy can also decentralize, and his deputies as well, and so on. In their case, a player has a finite integer weight and can only have deputies of integer weight. Therefore, sequential decentralization will terminate after a finite number of steps. In the setting of this paper, however, an atomic deputy of any size is able to decentralize. A possible approach consists in studying the asymptotic behavior of a sequential decentralization process. A first attempt to study one-shot simultaneous decentralization games as well as sequential decentralizing processes is made in Wan (2012), with two atomic players and affine arc cost functions.

In the nonatomic case, atomic player N’s all decentralization strategies, including the trivial one (not decentralizing), result in the same outcome. Hence, the other players’ costs and the social cost never change after the decentralization.
