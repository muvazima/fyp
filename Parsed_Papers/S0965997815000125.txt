                  As a method for surface severe plastic deformation (S2PD), ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM) enhances metal surface properties through striker peening, a metal dimpling process driven by ultrasonic vibration energy. UNSM treatment introduces residual stress, surface hardening, and nano-crystalline structures into metal surfaces which are beneficial for reducing wear, fatigue, and corrosion properties. In this paper, the process of UNSM is described and a simplified physical model created using the equivalent static loading method is presented. Along with the simplified physical model, a finite elements simulation model was developed. Effective plastic strain was considered as a parameter for evaluating the level of work hardening produced in the simulation. The dynamic processes and energy dissipation were also examined, and it was found that different kinds of energy dissipation occur during UNSM treatment. Comparisons between the processing parameters (processing velocity, static load, and feed rate) were performed using a simulated example of UNSM linear processing. The results show that the linear processing produces a uniform region containing identical distributions of residual stress and effective plastic strain. The effects of the parameters on the processing results (residual stress, plastic deformation and work hardening) were likewise studied using UNSM linear processing. Compared to processing velocity, a high static load produced more work hardening and higher compressive residual stress. Surface deformation and residual stress results were also more sensitive to static load than processing velocity. Feed rate was found to be an important parameter as well, greatly influencing both surface deformation and work hardening.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Surface deterioration is one of the most common causes of metal failure, which includes loosening of metal parts due to wear, surface breakage induced by corrosion, and fatigue fractures. Because the occurrence of all of these faults is closely connected to metal surface properties, surface enhancement is often performed to improve the surface properties of metal products. Increasing surface roughness, strength [1,2], abrasion resistance, corrosion resistance [3–5], residual stress [6–12], and fatigue properties [8,9,13] are all types of surface enhancement that can be achieved using various technological means. Compared to other methods for improving the longevity of metal materials, surface treatment is a promisingly low-cost and particularly effective process that enhances the overall quality of metal materials. New surface treatment techniques continue to be developed in order to save energy and shorten processing time, and the discovery of highly efficient and quick techniques will remain an important area for future study.

The S2PD process was initially proposed by Lu [14] as an effective surface treatment for generating nano-crystalline structures on a material’s surface using the method of surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT). In Lu’s study, spherical balls composed of different materials (such as steel, glass, or ceramic) were vibrated over the surface of a target material using a vibration generator, forcing the balls to impact the target material. A subsequent method for S2PD was carried out where a large number of balls were fired at the specimen surface from random directions and at high strain rates, introducing severe plastic deformation and grain refinement to the surface layer [15]. In both cases, enhancement of surface layer was produced without a chemical reaction on the material’s surface or changing the material’s chemical structure.

A great number of alternative S2PD methods have been invented and implemented to improve the surface properties of bulk materials: ultrasonic peening (UP) [4], laser shock peening (LSP) [16,17], improved methods of SMAT [18,19], ultrasonic shot peening (USSP) [20], ultrasonic surface rolling processing (USRP) [6], surface mechanical grinding treatment (SMGT) [21], and ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM) [22,23]. With work process principles varying, different levels grain refinement, depth of the processing layer, and size of refined grains differ across methods.

One method of S2PD, UNSM [8,24–28], has been used to enhance surface properties by producing gradient changes in the grain refinement of a material’s surface. In terms of equipment, UNSM requires an ultrasonic generator, an air compressor, a control card, and a guide unit (Fig. 1
                     ). UNSM is powered by the ultrasound transducer, which produces tens of thousands, even up to millions, of mechanical ultrasonic waves per second. However, because the ultrasound transducer can generate only a few micrometers of amplitude directly, an acoustic horn is frequently employed to magnify the amplitude. The amplified mechanical ultrasonic wave then used to drive a tip ball so that it strikes the surface of a target material, inducing severe surface plastic deformation on the specimen. Compared to the ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT), UNSM has several advantages. One is its low energy consumption; UNSM has an output power of approximately 1kW. However, the most notable advantage of UNSM is that the use of static loading during surface treatment ensures uniformity of processing. These advantages have led to the increasingly wide application of UNSM and, for this reason, the processing characteristics of UNSM and the working process employed by UNSM to machine materials must be presented.

In recent years, many numerical studies [10–12,29–50] of S2PD have been published on simulations designed to examine the process parameters of a developed S2PD model. Dai and Shaw [51] studied effect of ball diameter and velocity on impact peening and explained how process results varied using different levels of kinetic energy. Achintha [30,46] developed a hybrid explicit finite element-eigenstrain model to investigate the parameters of LSP and found that the study’s simulated results corresponded well with its experimental results. Other process parameters and results such as shot peening coverage [42], surface roughness [37], residual stress [30,34,38,39,52], and process angle [49] have been successfully simulated and studied. The simulation of S2PD to produce surface nano-crystallization was investigated by Bagherifard et al. [53], while other studies found that element size is sensitive parameter in the simulation results [35]. Liu et al. [39] developed a dynamic finite element model for the simulation of USRP using the governing equations ABAQUS/Explicit. USRPed parameters were evaluated according to the study conditions, which stipulated that an effective plastic strain equal or greater than 8 had to be used to form a nanostructured layer. Liu found the parameters required producing a nanostructured surface layer, and also that effective plastic strain is a reliable means of predicting the generation of nano-sized grains.

Taking into account the unique features of UNSM and its similarities with SP and SMAT, in this study, a simplified physical model of the UNSM process was created using the equivalent static loading method. A finite elements simulation model was then developed to investigate the dynamic processes of and energy dissipation during the processing process. Comparisons of different processing parameters—namely, processing velocity, static load and feed rate—were performed using the simulated results of UNSM linear processing. The effects of different parameters on the processing results (residual stress, plastic deformation and work hardening) were then studied using the UNSM linear processing model.

The process UNSM is driven by an ultrasound transducer that produces tens of thousands mechanical ultrasonic waves per second. However, because only a few micrometers of amplitude can be generated by the ultrasound transducer directly, an acoustic horn is frequently is used to magnify the amplitude by dozens, or even several hundred, microns. The amplified mechanical ultrasonic wave is then used to propel a strike pin, so that it strikes the surface thousands of times per second with constant pressure, inducing severe surface plastic deformation. In this study the tungsten carbide (TC) was chosen as the strike pin as the properties of high hardness and high friction resisting. Small mechanical wear can ensure the working accuracy and system stability. A static load produced by air pressure is used to control the level of pressure with which the tip ball contacts the specimen surface. After UNSM treatment, the original grains of the specimen’s surface layer have been refined into nanometer-sized grains by severe plastic deformation (SPD). In our study, this entire process was carried out using an ultrasonic generator (30μm amplitude and 20kHz), and air compressor devices producing the static force and amplitude of the dynamic load. The TC ball strikes the material surface of a rotating specimen traveling across its length, s, in a horizontal direction (Fig. 2
                        ).

Using the linear velocity of the rotating specimen and the feed rate of the strike device shaft, the number of strikes to the specimen surface per mm2 can be calculated with Eq. (1):

                                       ν
                                       ∗
                                       s
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        where N is the processing density (mm−2), f is the frequency of the ultrasound transducer, ν (mm/s) is the speed to specimen surface as it rotates, and s (mm/rev) is feed rate.

In Fig. 3
                        a, the UNSM-processed specimen is shown with processing marks produced by axial movement with a constant feed rate of 70μm and a static load of 60N. Notably, it can be seen that in the end of processing, a large groove approximately 500μm, much larger than the feed rate of 70μm was formed. During the UNSM process, the strike pin was moved along the axial direction by a guide unit so that uniform processing could be achieved on the metal surface as the specimen rotated. The UNSM process results along the axial direction are shown in Fig. 3b. With the completion of each round, a new process groove was formed. The plastic extrusion visible in Fig. 3b was caused by the depth, h, of the processed surface being less than the depth, H, of the UNSM groove. Therefore, to obtain a smooth processing surface, it is important to use the proper UNSM parameters so that extrusion is limited during the surface treatment.

Based the description of the UNSM process, it is clear that the static load is a key parameter in UNSM treatment. A higher static load can produce deeper deformations and a stronger work hardened layer. However, the surface roughness becomes more sensitive to the static load as larger deformations are produced. The nature of the force load between the strike pin and target material has been studied by several researchers [23,39], who found that the dynamic impact force can be expressed as a typical wave. This wave can be described with the following equation:

                         is the load produced by the ultrasonic generator, which changes with processing time (ω is 2πf, where f is processing frequency), and Fm
                         is the sum of Fs
                         and Fa
                        sin(ωt). Fig. 4
                         shows the results of Eq. (2) with an amplitude of 30μm and considering the separation between the strike pin and the target material, the force load between strike pin and metal surface, and the active period, which is represented by the shaded area. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that in regards to static loading, the force load Fm
                         is higher than the static load and that Fa
                        , induced by the ultrasound transducer, is approximately 2–5 times Fs
                         
                        [23].

In the course of carrying out the UNSM process, it was found that it is difficult to set the load of the strike pin as the variable determining the type of contact interface resulting from surface deformation. To simplify this process, the equivalent static loading method was employed in this study’s model [54,55]. With the physical model of UNSM and the equivalent static loading method, the force load between the strike pin and target material was converted for use with thousands of strike pins operating at a certain initial velocity. Owing to the nature of the resulting strike process, a plastic zone was produced on target surface (as shown in Fig. 5
                        ) during surface plastic deformation treatment. Though the strike pin was impacting a semi-infinite target, only the target material was deformed during the UNSM process due to the extreme hardness of the strike pin (made of tungsten-carbide).

According to Newton’s second law, the equation of motion during contact between strike pin and target material is

                         is the mean normal pressure on the surface of target, and A (approximately πa
                        2) is the contact area between the strike pin and the target at t. As only elastic–plastic deformation was produced during the surface treatment, the stress wave was mainly composed of elastic–plastic waves. Following the Eqs. (4) and (5) 
                        [24–27], the speed of elastic stress wave and plastic stress wave can be calculated within different materials. Ce

With a specimen of S45C steel, the elastic stress wave was 4912m/s, which was higher than the plastic stress wave, 3864m/s. The size of the plastic stress wave was primarily hindered by the plastic deformation that occurred during processing. Therefore, Pm
                         was considered 3 times the yield stress σ
                        0, or approximately 3σ

Based on the above analysis of the impact process, the action time of plastic deformation at each time t is less than that of an entire UNSM cycle. The parameter F in the Eq. (9) can be set as the maximum value for Fm
                        . Using the equivalent static loading method, the equivalent velocities of different static loads under these controlled conditions can be determined, as shown in Table 1
                        . With this physical model, the velocities of strike pins can be obtained and would be used in the following finite element model.

To investigate the process of UNSM, a three-dimensional finite element analysis model was developed with Ls_dyna software. A 6mm∗6mm∗1.5mm S45C steel block (Fig. 6
                        ) was built as the target body and studied with results from a simulated linear processing UNSM treatment. Plastic-kinematic material parameters for the target material were used and set as following: yield stress (σy
                        ): 800Mpa; Tangent modulus: 100Mpa; Young’s modulus (E): 210Gpa; Poisson’s ratio (υ) 0.3; and density (ρ): 7830kg/m3. Tangent modulus is the slope between the yield limit and ultimate strength and is taken as a modulus in the range of inelasticity limit. Strain rate hardening was neglected in this model. As contact friction occurred during the interaction between the strike peening and target materials, the friction coefficient μ was set as 0.2. To avoid the influence of stress reflection between the tip ball and the specimen, a non-reflection face was used as a boundary. Using the Ls_dyna software, all surfaces, excepting the top surface, were set as non-reflection boundaries. This model was then used to simulate linear processing in the UNSM process (Fig. 7
                        ) and thousands of strike pins were set to strike the target S45C steel model.

Eight-node brick elements with reduced integration and hourglass control, which can alleviate the “mesh-locking” problem caused by plastic incompressibility over-constraint, were chosen for the target. Also, to simplify the model, the strike pin was set as a rigid body, while the shell elements were used for meshing. The size of the smallest element of the target and shot peening are most sensitive to simulation results, so using “zero element size” was proposed to obtain the maximum value of effective plastic strain [35]. However, in explicit simulations, the smallest element size determines the solution time, with small elements requiring more time. Therefore, an appropriate element size should balance calculation accuracy and calculation time. In this study, the smallest element size, approximately 1/20th of dimple diameter, was set at 25μm in the main impact zones, a 3mm∗1mm∗0.25mm area on the top surface of target and a 1mm diameter circle on the tip surface of strike pin. To control the processing linear velocity, the distance d between adjacent strike pins was calculated using Eq. (10). Here, ν is the linear velocity between the target and strike pin (Fig. 2) and f is the working frequency of the UNSM equipment. With the distance d and different fixed heights, strike pins impacted the target surface in a specific order with the specific initial velocity calculated from Eq. (9), and simulation of the UNSM process was successfully achieved:

Following S2PD, a surface-hardening layer can be produced on the top surface of the target material. Many studies have focused on the development of the work hardening layer and found that severe plastic deformation can be produced within this layer. Additionally, even within the top surface layer, grains can be refined into nano-size and hardness can be enhanced. In a series of studies by Umemoto [57–59], it was found that the key condition for obtaining nano-sized grains is an effective plastic strain is close to 8. Using simulation models, many studies have estimated grain refinement level and found that the effective plastic strain is a practical method for predicting grain refinement results [35,39].

                         are the plastic strain, strain, and elastic rates respectively. It was found that the effective plastic strain corresponded with the generated level of plastic deformation within grains.

Various S2PD surface treatments can induce plastic deformation behavior and dislocation activity in metals and alloys, but this ability strongly depends on lattice structure and stacking fault energy (SFE). The mechanisms of grain refinement in several metals and alloys, including iron (SFE about 200mJ/m2) [5,60,19], copper (SFE, 78mJ/m2) [61], aluminum (166mJ/m2) [62], and others [6,63–67], have been investigated, demonstrating that the grain refinement mechanism varies by target material. With iron, the grain refinement mechanisms are the formation and transformation of dense dislocation walls (DDWs) and dislocation tangles (DTs) in original grains [19]. In contrast, for copper, dislocation manipulation and rearrangement, deformation twinning to form nano-scale twin/matrix lamella bundles, and shear banding in the twin/matrix lamellae are the mechanisms of grain refinement [61]. In the refinement of AISI 304 stainless steel planar dislocation arrays and twins, the grain refinement mechanisms are the intersection of multidirectional twins leading to grain subdivision and a martensite transformation [67]. With double phase materials, it has been found that the softer phase refines first, while dissolution occurs in the second phase [63–65]. Regardless of the mechanism, dislocation and nano-grains effectively enhance a processed surface. However, the density of dislocation and size of refined grains are closely related to and improved by the amount of effective plastic strain. Though there are no reports on the relationship between work hardening and effective plastic strain, the amount of effective plastic strain is an effective assessment parameter for predicting the level of work hardening.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

To study the characteristics of UNSM treatment, energy dissipation was performed for a single simulated impact process. The history of energy dissipation during the simulation is shown in Fig. 8
                        . It can be seen that within the overall system, energy can be divided into seven parts: artificial strain energy (ASE), frictional dissipation (FD), internal energy (IE), kinetic energy (KE), plastic dissipation (PD), strain energy (SE), and viscous dissipation (VD). In the explicit dynamic analysis energy output is particularly important in checking the accuracy of the solution. “Artificial” strain energy was always associated with constraints used to remove singular modes (such as hourglass control), or with constraints used to make the drill rotation follow the in-plane rotation of the shell elements. To ensure the accuracy of the solution the “Artificial” strain energy should be quite small and can be negligible compared to “real” energies such as the strain energy (SE) and the kinetic energy (KE). Viscous dissipation is the energy dissipated by viscous effect which produced by the viscous friction within materials. Frictional dissipation is the energy induced by the friction between strike pin and target material. Kinetic energy is the total kinetic energy of total model, plastic dissipation is the energy dissipated by plasticity, strain energy is the applied elastic strain energy and internal energy is the remaining energy within materials. During the impact process, the kinetic energy of the strike pin is translated into the internal energy of the target, which is mainly composed of plastic dissipation, strain energy, and frictional dissipation. Plastic dissipation and strain energy make up the main body of dissipated energy. Thus, during the impact process, the main energy of the ultrasound transducer is translated into surface plastic deformation and residual stress, which stores the strain energy.

This study also investigated energy dissipation during continuous impact. Fig. 9
                         shows how plastic dissipation and strain energy during continuous impact change with number of impact times. The periodical change of energy dissipation emerged as a key feature. The results of continuous impact in the same place are shown in Fig. 9a, from which it can be seen that as the number of impact times increases the plastic dissipation reaches a maximum value of approximately 2.24mJ, meaning that no plastic deformation is produced by the increasing impact after 12 times in the with static loading of 50N. As the change of static loading the number of processing times in the same place, after which no plastic deformation can be produced, has a small change. This is the reason of different levels of work hardening produced by the previous impact. Up to that point, however, the results show that during continuous impact with a linear velocity of about 20mm/s, a steady increase of the plastic dissipation is found after the initial impact. With each impact, the energy steadily increases by about 0.045mJ, which is much smaller than the first impact of 0.49mJ. Low energy consumption is achieved during the UNSM treatment because the pre-work hardening is induced by continuous impacting.

The analysis results of energy dissipation show that the stable plastic dissipation required for continuous impacting at a fixed linear velocity is produced. A line about 2mm in length was processed in the model using continuous impacting, resulting in the uniform region that can be seen in Fig. 10
                        . Within the uniform region, both the identical distribution of residual stress σxx
                         and effective plastic strain can be observed via the cross section. Compared to shot peening, in which balls impact a target surface at random positions and sequence, with UNSM, the strike pin impacts a metal surface in a consistent pattern and in one direction. In the simulated linear processing UNSM treatment, the impact process was based on the one described in the previous section because the work hardening induced by the former process will impact the latter, such little plastic deformation and storage stress strain is produced. As the impact number increases, the increment becomes a constant value, prompting constant plastic deformation. As mentioned above, no plastic deformation can be produced in the same place on the target surface after it has been struck 12 times, as saturation of the plastic deformation has occurred.

The effects of the parameters on the processing results—residual stress, plastic deformation, and work hardening—were studied by examining the uniform region produced by the UNSM linear processing model. Fig. 11
                         presents a cross-section of the surface deformation parameters and the paths tracked to investigate. The parameters h, H and D are the extrusion parameter, indentation depth and indentation width, which are all closely related to the surface roughness results. These parameters also represent the characteristics of UNSMed groove. To investigate work hardening, residual stress, and surface deformation, simulation results were extracted along Path 1 and Path 2 and these extractions were then studied.

During UNSM treatment, the processing linear velocity is the moving speed between target surface and strike pin. A lower linear velocity produces more strikes on the surface than a higher linear velocity within the same processing distance. In a previous study [24,28], we found that a higher strike number refines the grain of the S45C steel surface more, resulting in a smaller grain size. To avoid over-severe plastic deformation, which can produce mesh distortion and unsatisfactory results, large velocities, 20, 40 and 80mm/s, were studied with a static load of 50N. The results of these tests are shown in Fig. 12
                        . In Fig. 12a, how the effective plastic strain varies according to increases in depth (Path 1) is shown. Plastic deformation layers of the same depth, approximately 0.4128mm, are produced by the three different processing linear velocities. Excepting the top surface results, higher maximum effective plastic strains are obtained with lower velocities: 0.5729mm/mm for 20mm/s, 0.5391mm/mm for 40mm/s, and 0.4536mm/mm for 80mm/s. Residual stress σxx
                        , both in-depth and on-surface, is presented in Fig. 12b and c. Little difference was found between the distributions of residual stress according to the different velocities, except for the results in middle-top surface zone. The average depth of compressive residual stress zone is 0.325mm, and compressive residual stress primarily distributed on the top surface. Surface deformation results, which are closely related to surface roughness, were also measured and are shown in Fig. 12d. With the static load of 50N, the extrusion h ranges from 8.64μm to 9.64μm, the indentation depth H ranges from 12.1μm to 12.43μm, and the indentation width D ranges from 0.4822mm to 0.5224mm. Overall, using the three different processing linear velocities produces only small differences in UNSMed groove parameters. As the above results demonstrate, reducing the processing linear velocity focuses the energy of UNSM treatment on the plastic deformation produced within the top surface layer, resulting in work hardening and a smaller sized nano-grain on the top surface. In our previous study [28] high process density (means lower processing linear velocity) can induce higher surface hardness and smaller surface grain size. With the XRD test these results were validated.


                        Fig. 13
                         presents the results of the effective plastic strain, residual stress σxx
                        , and surface deformation studied using static loads at 30N, 40N, 50N and 60N with the processing linear velocity set at 40mm/s. From Fig. 13, it can be seen that static loading greatly influences UNSM results. The work hardening results (Fig. 13a) show that both the depth of hardened surface and top surface hardness are considerably improved by using a higher static load. As the static load increases from 30N to 60N, depth increases from 0.268mm to 0.4598mm, and the maximum value of effective plastic strain from 0.2828mm/mm to 0.6208mm/mm. With residual stress σxx
                        , it was found that a higher static load produces a deeper and larger zone containing compressive residual stress (Fig. 13a and b). The depth of the compressive residual stress zone was enhanced from 0.2186mm with 30N to 0.3602mm with 60N. No improvement in maximum compressive residual stress was observed. In the top surface, a higher static load enlarges the compressive residual stress zone. The groove parameters with different static loads were also measured (Fig. 13d). Compared to processing linear velocity, static loading has great influence on the groove parameters. The measured results show that h is 4.55μm, H is 6.11μm and D is 0.361mm with 30N. However, with 60N, the groove parameters are 10.75μm for h, 15.04μm for H and 0.5804mm for D. The reason for these results is that the force load Fm
                        , produced by the ultrasound transducer is approximately 2–5 times the static load. At the same time, the higher extrusion produced by 60N worsens the surface roughness and can even destroy the metal surface [28].

From the results of Figs. 12 and 13, it can be found little difference between the max residual stress. The difference of the max residual stress in Fig. 12b is not significant as the reason of the discrepancy only about 30MPa with different processing linear velocities. During the surface impact treatment the residual stress is sensitive to many parameters such as processing process, materials characteristics and other. So in this study we think this discrepancy is not significant as reason of the parameters of UNSM we chosen. The results of residual stress may change obviously in other conditions, however in the range of UNSM machining little effect can be found for the max residual stress. On the other hand we think the depth of residual stress is an significant for UNSM machining with various parameters and which has a close connection with the surface properties of materials. Static loading plays an important role in surface treatment results comparing with the processing linear velocity.

In addition to being moved up and down during the UNSM process, strike pin is also moved horizontally along the specimen to obtain a uniform treatment. Therefore, the feed rate is also an important parameter in the UNSM process. To investigate the effects of feed rate on UNSM linear processing, two feed rates (100μm and 200μm) were used in the double linear processing model. Fig. 14
                         provides an illustration of the double linear processing results and the effects of the different feed rates on each run. The distance, s, produced by the second double linear processing run, is the feed rate in the practical processing process. For comparison of the results with different feed rates, results were extracted along Path 2.


                        Figs. 15 and 16
                        
                         provide the results of the distribution of effective plastic strain and residual stress σxx
                         in cross sections of the uniform regions produced using different feed rates. The processing linear velocity was 40mm/s and static load 50N. Compared to the no feed rate results (Figs. 15a and 16a), the double linear processing processes conducted at different feed rates redistributed the effective plastic strain and residual stress. After the second linear processing process, a higher effective plastic strain was produced. The results along Line 2 on the top surface in Fig. 14 were measured (Fig. 17
                        a), demonstrating that during the second linear processing process, the position of the maximum effective plastic strain moved along the feed path from about 80μm (feed rate 100μm) to about 178μm (feed rate 200μm). The maximum value for effective plastic strain was improved from 0.5278mm/mm to 1.04mm/mm and 0.9974mm/mm. Additionally, the residual stress along the Line 2 was measured as shown in Fig. 17b. Combined with the stress nephogram (Fig. 16), we found that the second linear process outperformed the previous processes, producing a higher and larger zone of compressive residual stress with a maximum of approximately −819Mpa. Moreover, compared to the 100μm feed rate, the 200μm feed rate produces a higher and larger zone of compressive residual stress.

The surface deformation along Line 2 was also measured (Fig. 18
                        ) to investigate the effect of feed rate on surface roughness. Fig. 18 presents the deformation results along the Z-axis. It was found that different deformation results were obtained with each of the two feed rates. Though a groove depth of approximately 15.5μm of was produced using the 100μm feed rate, a lower extrusion was produced on both sides using the 200μm feed rate. The second linear process with the 200μm feed rate produced an especially a small groove extrusion with a depth of approximately 5.7μm. This small groove could easily lead to stress concentration during stress loading and cause fatigue crack initiation.

With above studies on the effect of the UNSM parameters to the processing results, it can be found that the static loading is an important parameter in surface treatment results. A higher static load produces a deeper work hardening zone, higher compressive residual stress, and larger surface deformation. So during processing of UNSM, high static loading can produce nanocrystalline surface easily. And for the low static loading low processing linear velocity may also induce the refinement of grains in the top surface. However thinner nanocrystalline layer and shallow compressive residual stress can be produced compared with high static loading. For the surface roughness results the static loading and feed rate have a greater influence than the processing linear velocity. During the UNSM treatment low static loading and feed rate can prevent the material surface from surface destroy. In the practical processing the parameter selection must follow the actual demand: for good surface roughness, low static loading, low feed rate and modest processing linear velocity can ensure the results of surface roughness; for the improvement of fatigue properties of surface layer, the highest possible static loading, modest processing linear velocity and feed rate must be chosen to produce deeper compressive residual stress and work hardening zone, at the same time smaller surface nanocrystalline which restrain fatigue crack initiation.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, the process of ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification was studied and an analytical model based on fully plastic contact theory was developed. With a finite element model, the effect of processing parameters, including processing velocity, static load, and feed rate, were investigated by performing a simulation of UNSM linear processing. The effects of the parameters on the processing results residual stress, plastic deformation, and work hardening were analyzed. The following conclusions drawn from the study results:
                        
                           (1)
                           The process of UNSM treatment was analyzed and studied. With the analysis results of the contact force and interaction process between strike pinning and metal surface, a simplified physical model was built by the equivalent static loading method and the static load can be transform into velocities. With this model the UNSM process can be simplified as thousands of strike pins with initial velocities.

A finite element model was built following the physical model. The dynamic process and the energy dissipation during the process of UNSM was investigated and found that: During UNSM treatment, plastic dissipation and strain energy play important roles in energy dissipation, and low energy dissipation occurs during continuous impacting.

A uniform region is produced during linear processing, and identical distribution of effective plastic strain and residual stress are found in this region. The processing linear velocity has little effect on residual stress distribution and surface deformation and lower processing linear velocity produces severe work hardening in the top surface region. A higher static load produces a deeper work hardening zone, higher compressive residual stress, and larger surface deformation. With a larger feed rate, work hardening and enhancement of the compressive residual stress zone is achieved. However, a larger feed rate can also produce a larger plastic extrusion and worsen surface roughness.
