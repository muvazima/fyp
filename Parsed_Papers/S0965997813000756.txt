                  This paper describes the calibration process for the uncoupled material model of ductile damage designed by Bai and Wierzbicki. This problem has been investigated within the project “Identification of ductile damage parameters for nuclear facilities”. The project includes material experiments, designing the shape of the samples, and using the samples for calibrating the material constants of selected ductile damage models. The calibration process for the Bai–Wierzbicki material model is based on fifteen tested samples corresponding with the literature. In this paper, we discuss some promising modifications of basic calibration approaches for uncoupled models. These modifications are based on variants in the formulation of the target function expressing the calibration error. The result of the calibration process was verified through FE simulation of a comparison of each specimen with experimental data. A material model with a description of the ductile damage in a wide range of stress states was searched within the project. For this purpose, the model was tested on some other specimens which exhibit higher stress concentration and showed the limitations of the Bai and Wierzbicki uncoupled model.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Ductile damage is the process of damage to a metallic material that propagates together with the plastic strain in conditions of monotonic loading, and ends in fracture of the component. Problems of ductile damage are found in a wide range of technical applications. Ductile damage plays a significant role in industry, for example in the optimization of technological processes, in safety evaluations in the automotive and aeronautic industry, in the nuclear industry, in the analysis of steel civil structures, etc. Complex material models of ductile fracture require a cost calibration process based on extensive experimental tests, and also involve extensive computational costs. Thanks to progress in computational methods, namely FEA, models of this type can nowadays be used in engineering.

Phenomenological material models describing ductile damage in continuum mechanics mostly introduce an extension of plasticity models. Two types of material models can be distinguished. Uncoupled models describe plasticity, and ductile damage separately. Mechanical response is elastic–plastic until the ductile damage criterion predicts material failure according to loading history. Coupled models couple the description of plasticity and failure. The porous Gurson, Nedleman and Twergaard [1] model is a representative of coupled models. Although these models have huge potential, there have been few practical applications due to the difficulty of the calibration process. An easier calibration process is an essential advantage of uncoupled material models, where the process for calibrating the plastic response and the ductile damage can be separated. The calibration process is distinctly easier if an uncoupled material model is used.

From the point of view of interpreting the real process inside the material, ductile damage material models can be classified as phenomenological or micro-structural models. Micro-structural models try to describe damage in a natural way. Damage occurs on the basis of two different mechanisms. In domains with triaxial stress, damage is caused by the initiation, growth and connection of micro-cavities. These micro-cavities are often initiated on the borderline between material inclusions and the basic material matrix. The load-carrying cross section is reduced by this damage process and finally leads to failure. Some micromechanical continuum models have been derived in the basis of both analysis of representative volume with cavity and stress homogenization ([2,3], etc.). Models based on this damage concept exhibit an unrealistic response in the pressure and shear stress dominant domains. In this case, the material is damaged by the localized shear strain in the plane of maximal shear stress that is at an angle of 45° with first principal plane.

Phenomenological models are used for describing both of these two mechanisms. These models do not have a physical meaning, and try to best capture the behavior of the real material on the basis of empirically designed relations. These models should be based on the parameters that are assumed to have the main influence on the ductile damage. The parameters are usually designed on the basis of experience or intuition, or can be deduced from micromechanical continuum models. The substantial influence of stress triaxiality was recognized in a micromechanical continuum model. Another crucial point with phenomenological models is the formulation of the failure criterion to provide an efficient description of the damage process. An advantage of these models is the acceptable description of the response in the case of the materials for which they were designed and calibrated. A disadvantage of empirical equations is the cost of the experimental calibration tests and the high level of uncertainty when they are applied to a different type of material.

The material model discussed in this paper is based on both a classical incremental model of the plastic response with isotropic hardening and the phenomenological concept of damage in continuum mechanics. This model supposes isotropic behavior of the material, and for a description of the stress state in material point uses von Mises stress q, triaxiality stress η and the normalized Lode angle

                      is reached. The fracture locus has the physical meaning of the accumulated plastic strain at the instant of ductile failure initiation in hypothetical loading process during that both triaxiality and normalized Lode angle are constant. In such a loading process, the damage at failure has the value ω
                     =
                     ω

In this paper, the Bai–Wierzbicki material model [4] is employed to describe ductile damage. The model is based on exponential dependence of the fracture locus on stress triaxiality. This dependence (2) was extracted from material models, see [2,3], that are based on a description of the growing micro-cavities in the basic material matrix.

Xue and Wierzbicki [6] expanded the dependence of the fracture strain on triaxiality by a third invariant of the stress tensor. This invariant was included in the form of the Lode parameter. Xue and Wierybicki used an elliptical function to describe the dependence of the fracture locus on the Lode parameter. They defined the fracture locus as a symmetric function that shows the same dependence of tension (

A further generalization is introduced in the Bai–Wierzbicki model [4] which expects the fracture locus to be generally asymmetric, see Fig. 1
                     . The dependence of the fracture locus on the third invariant of the stress tensor introduced using the normalized Lode angle has the form of a parabolic function. The influence of stress triaxiality is described as an exponential form (2). Fracture locus is expressed using round bar tension (

The Bai–Wierzbicki material model was implemented into Abaqus/Explicit FE software, which has a suitable toolset, including linear damage accumulation. The artificial degradation function described by the degradation parameter is implemented in Abaqus software, and is created to prevent a stepped loss of stiffness in the whole element at the instant when the failure criterion is reached. The difference between the damage and the degradation lies in the dependence on the fracture strain. The degradation is not included as a material parameter, and it is therefore not included in the calibration process. Nevertheless the results of numerical simulation can be affected by the choice of degradation. Since failure is indicated in the element of the FE mesh, degradation manifesting itself as a decrease in the elastic modulus E is started

After the critical value D
                     =1 is reached in an element, it is removed from the FE mesh. The damage process can be controlled in various ways in Abaqus. In our work we use the description based on Hillerborg’s fracture energy

The calibration process for the material parameters is based on comparing the fracture strain measured response of experimental specimens with the results of FE simulations. For example, the response means the dependence of the load caused by the testing machine and the extension measured using an extensometer in the case of a bar specimen in tension. The aim of the calibration process is to achieve material parameter values such that the simulated response and the experimental response are as close together as possible. For the announced plasticity model, it is necessary to calibrate the dependency of the actual yield stress on the accumulated plastic strain

(7) lose their validity. The stress in the necking domain is no longer uniaxial, and the plastic part of the tensile curve must be modified using a suitable correction (for example Bridgman [7]), or iteratively with the use of FE simulation (for example Ling [12]). In [8], necking of the smooth round bar starts at the time when the maximum force is reached during the experimental test. This force corresponds with the plastic strain

The Bai–Wierzbicki material model contains six material parameters. At least six specimen types with different values both for stress triaxiality and for the normalized Lode angle at anticipated locations of ductile fracture should be used for successful calibration of this model. Because it is in most cases impossible to use simple formulas to determine the course of quantities

                      during loading, specimens have to be analyzed via FE. The calculated course of these quantities serves as an entry into the calibration process. It is essential to determine fracture strain

However, this is really expensive, and not all specimens have a fracture that starts from the surface. The critical extension ΔL

The critical extension can be determined e.g. via direct surface observation and detection of the first individual cracks. This approach is not universal, for the same reasons as in the case of digital image correlation. Critical extension is identified on the basis of a sudden decrease in loading force in the force–displacement record.

In the literature, two approaches are widely cited for use in the process for calibrating the uncoupled ductile damage model. The first approach is based on averaged values for stress triaxiality and for the normalized Lode angle [4]. Averaged values for stress triaxiality η

                     is the modified target function that Bai and Wierzbicki used in their work [4]. The individual deviations are weighted by the fracture strain.

The optional application of least squares, enabling the use of linear regression, is an advantage of this approach (for example, material model (2) can be calibrated by linear regression), resulting in high effectiveness of the calibration process and guaranteed existence of the global extreme. Material models can sometimes be modified so that linear regression can be used partially. When calibrating the Bai–Wierzbicki material model (3), exponents D
                     2, D
                     4 and D
                     6 have to be determined using some standard procedure minimizing target function (e.g. the simplex method). The remaining parameters D
                     1, D
                     3 and D
                     5 can be solved by linear regression. An optimization problem that must be solved iteratively is reduced to three exponents D
                     2, D
                     4 and D

The second approach defines the target as the deviation of damage ω integrated up to fracture strain from ω

This approach eliminates averaging (11), but the calibration costs are higher than for the first approach. In addition there is higher global minimum uncertainty in this case. For these reasons, fine tuning of the parameters found using averaging quantities is the preferred application. This approach was used for example in [10].

The disadvantage of both approaches mentioned here is that the target function does not directly use critical extension ΔL
                     
                        f
                     , which is employed to determine the fracture strain. This deficiency has an effect namely in cases when specimens of more than one type are lying near to each other in the space stress triaxiality-normalized Lode angle. Significant differences in the fracture strains of such specimens result in compromises in calibration. Both of the previous calibration methods were modified for this reason.

Material calibration of the Bai–Wierzbicki model was carried out for austenitic Cr–Ni–Ti steel that is often used in the nuclear industry. A portfolio of fifteen calibration specimen types for quasi-static loading was designed for fracture locus calibration. The distribution of the individual specimen types in the space of stress triaxiality and the normalized Lode angle is shown in Fig. 4
                     . It is based on averaged values of η
                     
                        av
                      and

                                       ¯

A substantial subset of the calibration portfolio is based on a special specimen with double curvature (a butterfly, Fig. 6), which was introduced in [4,11]. An essential advantage is that we can cover a wide range of stress triaxiality and the normalized Lode angle with common specimen geometry. Different stresses are caused by loading in different directions (Fig. 5
                     , Table 1
                     ). The advantage is that the damage initiation is always in the center of the specimen. A special testing device was developed to perform calibration tests using a uniaxial loading machine (Fig. 7
                     ). It was shown during the testing verification phase that the experimental data was distorted due to non-negligible friction in the guiding rods of the device. For this reason, a simplified FE model of the whole device (Fig. 7) was used in a numerical simulation of the butterfly specimen. The friction coefficient in the guides μ
                     =0.15 was determined iteratively to obtain correspondence with the experimental data. A disadvantage of this specimen type is its shape complexity. The geometric inaccuracy may cause scattering between the experimental data and the FE simulations. Thanks to its symmetry, it was possible to measure the basic configuration of the butterfly for angle position 0° (Fig. 5) without using the device, and an undesirable friction effect was removed. FE models of the specimens use C3D8 linear volume elements with uniform edge size 0.2mm in the damaged domain. In basic position 0°, two modifications of the butterfly with double thickness (T2) and with triple thickness (T3) were additionally measured without the device.

The second subset of calibration specimens consists of notched round bars with different sizes of the notches (Fig. 8
                     ). The specimen damage develops in conditions of constant normalized Lode angle value 
                        
                           
                              
                                 θ
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                           =
                           1
                        
                     . Each of these specimens was designed in such a way that the fracture first occurs in the center of the specimen. We used bilinear CAX4 axisymmetric elements of uniform size 0.2mm in the damage domain. The last calibration experiment is a so-called small punch test. This type of test has been under intensive study in recent years. The test uses a miniature flat circular specimen through which a small steel ball is pushed (Fig. 9
                     ). This experiment is used to verify the material properties of structures in operation, from which a small piece of material is cut off without loss of functionality. Specimen diameter 8mm and specimen thickness 0.5mm is used in our implementation. The loading of the specimen corresponds with the biaxial tension. A disadvantage of this test is the dependence on friction between ball and specimen. The friction coefficient that affects the place of damage initiation is uncertain. CAX4 bilinear axisymmetric elements of global size 0.05mm in the damage area were used for FE simulation of the specimen.

The Bai–Wierzbicki material model was calibrated using modified target functionals (20), (22). The calibration process was based on a portfolio of 15 different specimen types (Fig. 4). The resultant fracture locus is shown in Fig. 10
                     . Short bars with symbols introduce the fracture strains of individual specimens. The symbol associated with the specimen is plotted at position. The dependence of the quadratic Lode angle (3) in the Bai–Wierzbicki model is not an optimal approximation in this case. For this reason, a modification of the model was tested. The quadratic form (3) was replaced by a fourth order polynomial function in the form

                     =0.01Nmm−1) lose toughness more rapidly than in the experimental tests. This effect manifests itself namely in the case of butterfly specimens. The fracture energy was changed to a value of G
                     
                        f
                     
                     =20Nmm−1 to make the simulations closer to the experiments. However, mesh density dependence is introduced into the simulations by this step. As the meshes of all specimens except the small punch specimen are of uniform density with the same edge length 0.2mm in the domain of interest, this value is correct for all except the small punch specimen, which uses a four times denser mesh. For this reason, the fracture energy value for the small punch specimen was recalculated according to Eq. (6).

The results of the FE simulations for both fracture loci used here (Bai–Wierzbicki and Modified Bai–Wierzbicki) are shown in Figs. 13–22
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     . For most of the specimens, the response of the modified Bai–Wierzbicki material model is closer to the experiments than the original response. An exception is the notched round bar R4 (Fig. 20). The fracture of this specimen is initiated earlier in the modified than in the original Bai–Wierzbicki model. Simulation with modified Bai–Wierzbicki material model exhibits misplaced fracture initiation in the notch instead of in the axis of the specimen. Metallographic observation of specimens that were damaged but not fractured (Fig. 21) proves that cavity growth begins from the center of specimen. This is in agreement with the material model based on the original Bai–Wierzbicki fracture locus. It can be said that both models achieve acceptable agreement with the experimental data. Significant differences occurred in the butterfly T3, butterfly 90° and butterfly 100° specimens. A configuration with butterfly 120° was also tested, but this specimen did not exhibit fracture until the limits of the device had been reached, which manifests itself as a step in the experimental loading curve in Fig. 17.

Calibration of the Bai–Wierzbicki material model was performed using fifteen different specimens. The calibration showed that the ductile fracture of the tested material is dependent on stress triaxiality and the normalized Lode angle. The resultant fracture locus is compatible with the literature. As a material model valid within a wide range of stress states is of interest, the Bai–Wierzbicki model was tested on some other specimen types with locally high stress concentration. The series of notched round bars was extended by new notched round bars R1 and R2 (Fig. 23
                     ). An axially loaded axisymmetric staffed cylinder was used for shear loading testing (Fig. 23). Further specimens typically used in fracture mechanics-CT without a pre-crack (Fig. 24
                     ) and a three-point bending specimen (Fig. 25
                     )-were also employed. A comparison of the experimental response of the specimens with the FE simulations using the Bai–Wierzbicki material model and the Modified Bai–Wierzbicki material model is presented in Figs. 26 and 27
                     
                     . The notched round bars R1 and R2 (Fig. 26) show more significant differences than the specimens used for calibration. The shear specimen in Fig. 27 exhibits acceptable correspondence. FE simulation of CT or three point bending gives completely wrong results in comparison with the experimental measurements (Figs. 28 and 29
                     
                     ). There was no fracture during the experimental loading. However, the FE simulations for both specimens have rapid damage and the crack was propagated throughout the specimen (Fig. 29).

                      for the additional specimens are plotted in the fracture loci (Fig. 30
                      The average stress triaxiality and the normalized Lode angle values are calculated in the domain where the damage occurred during the FE simulation. This place corresponds with the notch root near the surface where the stress field approaches the plane stress. This is why the fracture points of additional specimens approximately follow the course of the plane stress (Fig. 30). The points associated with both the CT specimens and the three-point bending specimens cannot be marked as fracture points since no fracture strain was achieved experimentally. The maximum plastic strain reached in the FE simulation is used instead of the fracture strain.

The material model discussed in this paper was not able to provide a successful description of the localized strain concentration, as shown in Fig. 30. The values determined for these specimens are in conflict with calibration specimens butterfly 0°, 30°, 45°. The nonlinear damage accumulation was tested in the calibration process, but the local strain concentration was not successfully resolved. Uncoupled ductile damage models based on a fracture locus that is dependent only on stress triaxiality and the normalized Lode angle seem to be unable provide us with correct fracture predictions in the case of high strain concentration.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The calibration process and the results of an uncoupled phenomenological ductile fracture model in Abaqus FE software have been discussed. A key advantage of uncoupled models is that the calibration of the plastic response and the calibration of the damage can be performed separately. This has a positive effect on the calibration costs, which increases the usability of uncoupled models in practical applications.

This paper has presented the design of an efficient calibration method for the von Mises plasticity model. Our method extends the functionality of the model beyond necking. The calibration method is based on a plastic curve consisting of two parts. The first part applies before necking occurs, and is achieved as a smoothed regression of the experimental data. The second part applies after the necking point, and is approximated by a suitable analytical function that fulfills the condition of the smooth continuation of plastic curve beyond the necking point and is calibrated using tensile test.

A phenomenological Bai–Wierzbicki model was used to describe a ductile fracture. A generalized asymmetrical fracture locus is expressed as a function of stress triaxiality and the normalized Lode angle. Six material parameters had to be calibrated. The fracture strain was calculated on basis of a critical extension of the specimen in which ductile fracture was reached. The critical extension was determined using the decrement of the load response of the specimen, and could had been found with a higher or lower rate of error. The success of the calibration process was evaluated for most of the cases by the relative difference between the experimental and simulated extensions at which ductile fracture occurred. The classical target function of the calibration method was modified to employ the measured critical extension value directly. Element deletion was controlled using the Hillerborg fracture energy, which was calibrated iteratively.

A portfolio of quasi-static calibrating tests was designed. Experiments on a special specimen with double curvature (a butterfly) which is loaded in different directions provided us with a wide range of stress triaxiality and the normalized Lode angle. A special device allowing different loading angles had to be manufactured for this type of specimen. In basic position 0° two modifications of the butterfly with double and triple thickness were also measured. The second subset includes tensile tests of notched round bars. We used round bars with different notches resulting in variable stress triaxiality at the center of the specimen. The last calibration experiment to be performed was a small punch test. The miniature flat axisymmetric specimen was loaded in conditions of biaxial tension.

The calibration process was carried out on a material that is normally used in the nuclear industry. Both the original Bai–Wierzbicki ductile fracture model and the modified Bai–Wierzbicki ductile fracture model were implemented and calibrated for this kind of material. Results providing a more accurate description of the ductile damage for a butterfly specimen were obtained, but incorrect prediction of the domain of damage initiation was predicted in one of the notched round bars when the modified model was used. The correspondence between the FE simulation of the calibration tests and the experimental data is well acceptable for both material models. The material models successfully describe the ductile damage to calibration specimens that is often presented in the literature. Our paper has introduced material model tests on specimens that showed local strain concentration. The notched round bars with a sharp notch showed non-negligible differences. Ductile fracture failed completely for CT and for three-point bending when using both of the Bai–Wierzbicki ductile fracture models No fracture was reached during the experimental measurement, whereas the simulations showed rapid damage and fracture propagation. Uncoupled ductile damage models based on the fracture locus seem not to be applicable to cases of local plastic strain. Coupled ductile fracture material models [6], gradient models, stochastic models [9], etc. may deal effectively with high strain concentrations.
