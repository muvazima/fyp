                  In this paper a new class of relaxed sequencing games is introduced: the class of Step out–Step in sequencing games. In this relaxation any player within a coalition is allowed to step out from his position in the processing order and to step in at any position later in the processing order. First, we show that if the value of a coalition in a relaxed sequencing game is bounded from above by the gains made by all possible neighbor switches, then the game has a non-empty core. After that, we show that this is the case for Step out –Step in sequencing games. Moreover, this paper provides a polynomial time algorithm to determine the values of the coalitions in Step out–Step in sequencing games.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper one-machine sequencing situations are considered with a queue of players in front of a single machine, each with one job to be processed. Such a situation specifies for each player the processing time, time the machine takes to process the corresponding job of this player. In addition, it is assumed that each player has a linear cost function specified by an individual cost parameter. Moreover, there are no restrictive assumptions as due dates, ready times or precedence constraints imposed on the jobs. To minimize total joint costs, Smith (1956) showed that the players must be ordered with respect to weakly decreasing urgency, defined as the ratio of the individual cost parameter and the processing time. Assuming the presence of an initial order, this reordering will lead to cost savings. To analyze how to divide the maximal cost savings among the players, Curiel, Pederzoli, and Tijs (1989) introduced cooperative sequencing games. They show that sequencing games are convex and therefore have a non-empty core. This means that it is always possible to find a coalitionally stable cost savings division.

Several classes of sequencing games have been discussed before. These classes are all based on different features of the underlying sequencing situations, for example grouping of jobs, stochastic data, dynamic/multistage situations, multiple jobs and/or machines. Both Gerichhausen and Hamers (2009) and Grundel, Çiftçi, Borm, and Hamers (2013) applied grouping of jobs, but in a different way. Gerichhausen and Hamers (2009) considered partitioning sequencing games where jobs arrive in batches and those jobs that arrive in earlier batches have some privilege over jobs in later arrived batches. Grundel et al. (2013) introduced family sequencing situations and included the concept of set-up times in their model. Alparslan-Gök, Branzei, Fragnelli, and Tijs (2013) and Klijn and Sánchez (2006) considered stochastic data in sequencing games. Alparslan-Gök et al. (2013) considered sequencing games where uncertainty in the parameters (costs per time unit and/or processing time) is involved by means of interval data. Klijn and Sánchez (2006) considered the arrival pattern of the jobs to be stochastic, so they assumed that no initial order is specified. In multi-stage sequencing situations, the order arrived at after each stage becomes the starting order for the next stage. Multi-stage sequencing situatons are for example considered by Curiel (2015). In Lohmann, Borm, and Slikker (2014) another type of dynamic sequencing situations is considered, in which a player enters the system at the moment the player starts to prepare the machine for his job (there is a predecessor dependent set-up time) and leaves the system as soon as his job is finished. Çiftçi, Borm, Hamers, and Slikker (2013) considered machines which can simultaneously process multiple jobs. Multiple machine sequencing games are for example discussed in Estévez-Fernández, Mosquera, Borm, and Hamers (2008), Slikker (2006a) and Slikker (2005). Key questions in all of the above literature are finding optimal orders, allocation rules and properties of the corresponding cooperative games.

A common assumption underlying the definition of the values of the coalitions in many sequencing games is that two players of a certain coalition can only swap their positions if all players between them are also members of the coalition. Curiel, Potters, Prasad, Tijs, and Veltman (1993) argued that the resulting set of admissible reorderings for a coalition is too restrictive because there may be more reorderings possible which do not hurt the interests of the players outside the coalition. Relaxed sequencing games arise by relaxing the classical assumption about the set of admissible rearrangements for coalitions in a consistent way. In Curiel et al. (1993) four different relaxed sequencing games are introduced. These relaxations are based on requirements for the players outside the coalition regarding either their position in the processing order (position unchanged/may change) or their starting time (starting time unchanged/not increased). This means that a player in a certain coalition is allowed to jump over players outside the coalition as long as the exogenously imposed requirements are satisfied. As a consequence, a player may be moved to a position earlier in the processing order when another player moves backwards. Slikker (2006b) proved non-emptiness of the core for all four types of relaxed sequencing games considered in Curiel et al. (1993). In Van Velzen and Hamers (2003) two further classes of relaxed sequencing games are considered. In the first class there is a specific player allowed to switch with a player in front of him in the processing order if this player has a larger processing time, and with a player behind him in the processing order if this player has a smaller processing time. In the second class there are fixed time slots and thus only jobs with equal processing times can be switched. Van Velzen and Hamers (2003) proved that both classes of relaxed sequencing games have a non-empty core. In fact, a lot of attention has been paid to non-emptiness of the core of relaxed sequencing games. However, surprisingly enough, up to now for none of the relaxed sequencing games described above attention has been paid to finding polynomial time algorithms determining optimal processing orders for all possible coalitions.

In this paper another class of relaxed sequencing games is introduced: Step out–Step in (SoSi) sequencing games. This relaxation is intuitive from a practical point of view, because in this relaxation a member of a coalition is also allowed to step out from his position in the processing order and to step in at any position somewhere later in the processing order. In particular, each player outside the coalition will not obtain any new predecessors, possibly only fewer. For the time being we apply this relaxation on the classical sequencing situation as introduced by Curiel et al. (1989). However, this relaxation can also applied to other types of sequencing situations. We start with proving non-emptiness of the core for the class of relaxed sequencing games where the values of the coalitions are bounded from above by the value of this coalition in a classical sequencing game if this coalition would have been connected. After that, we show that the class of SoSi sequencing games belongs to this class, and thus every SoSi sequencing game has a non-empty core. Moreover, we provide a polynomial time algorithm determining an optimal processing order for a coalition and the corresponding value. The algorithm considers the players of the coalition in an order that is the reverse of the initial order, and for every player the algorithm checks whether moving the player to a position later in the processing order is beneficial. This algorithm works in a greedy way in the sense that every player is moved to the position giving the highest cost savings at that moment. Moreover, every player is considered in the algorithm exactly once and every player is moved to another position in the processing order at most once.

The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 recalls basic definitions on one-machine sequencing situations and formally introduces SoSi sequencing games. In Section 3 it is shown that every SoSi sequencing game has a non-empty core. Section 4 provides a polynomial time algorithm to determine the values of the coalitions in a SoSi sequencing game. Finally, in Section 5 we summarize our results and provide some directions for future research. In particular we consider another type of relaxed sequencing games, so-called Step out sequencing games.

A one-machine sequencing situation can be summarized by a tuple (N, σ

                      is the set of players, each with one job to be processed on the single machine. A processing order of the players can be described by a bijection

                      means that player i is in position k. Let Π(N) denote the set of all such processing orders. The processing order σ
                     0 ∈ Π(N) specifies the initial order. The processing time pi
                      > 0 of the job of player i is the time the machine takes to process this job. The vector

                           v

To tackle the allocation problem of the maximal cost savings in a sequencing situation (N, σ
                     0, p, α) one can analyze an associated coalitional game (N, v). Here N naturally corresponds to the set of players in the game and, for a coalition S ⊂ N, v(S) reflects the maximal cost savings this coalition can make with respect to the initial order σ
                     0. In order to determine these maximal cost savings, assumptions must be made on the possible reorderings of coalition S with respect to the initial order σ
                     0.

The classical (strong) assumption is that a member of a certain coalition S ⊂ N can only swap with another member of the coalition if all players between these two players, according to the initial order, are also members of S. Given an initial order σ
                     0 the set of admissible orders for coalition S in a classical sequencing game is denoted by 
                        
                           
                              A
                              c
                           
                           
                              (
                              
                                 σ
                                 0
                              
                              ,
                              S
                              )
                           
                        
                     . This leads to the definition of a classical sequencing game. However, note that the resulting set of admissible reorderings for a coalition is quite restrictive, because there may be more reorderings possible which do not hurt the interests of the players outside the coalition.

In a SoSi sequencing game the classical assumption is relaxed by additionally allowing that a member of the coalition S steps out from his position in the processing order and steps in at any position later in the processing order. Hence, a processing order σ is called admissible for S in a SoSi sequencing game if

                      denotes the set of followers. Condition (i) ensures that no player outside S obtains any new predecessors. As a result, a player who steps out from his position in the processing order, steps in at a position later, and thus not earlier, in the processing order. Note that from an optimality point of view it is clear that we can assume without loss of generality that a member of S who steps out, only steps in at a position directly behind another member of the coalition S. Therefore, condition (ii) requires that each player outside S has a direct follower who was already a follower of him with respect to σ

                      the value of S in a SoSi sequencing game is at least its value in the classical sequencing game. For σ ∈ Π(N), S is called connected with respect to σ if for all i, j ∈ S and k ∈ N such that σ(i) < σ(k) < σ(j) it holds that k ∈ S. Note that for each coalition that is connected with respect to σ
                     0 the set of admissible orders in the SoSi sense equals the set of admissible orders in the classical sense. This means that the value of any connected coalition is the same in the SoSi sequencing game and in the classical sequencing game. Therefore, similar to (1), it readily can be concluded that the value of a coalition S that is connected with respect to σ
                     0 is given by

Let (N, v) be the corresponding SoSi sequencing game. Table 1
                            presents the value of all coalitions. Note that the values of the coalitions in the game (N, v) are equal to the values of the coalitions in the classical sequencing game of this one-machine sequencing situation except for the only disconnected coalition, coalition {1, 3}. For instance, for the grand coalition N it follows from (2) that

The disconnected coalition {1, 3} cannot save costs in the classical sequencing game because there exists no admissible order other than the initial order. However, in the SoSi sequencing game the set of admissible orders consists of two elements

                              Processing order (2 3 1) means that player 2 is in the first position, player 3 in the second position and player 1 in the last position.

The partial tiebreaking condition ensures that if there are two players with the same urgency in the same component of S with respect to σ
                     0, then the player with the lowest index is earlier in processing order σ. Note that the partial tiebreaking condition does not imply anything about the relative order of two players with the same urgency who are in the same component of S with respect to σ but who were in different components of S with respect to σ
                     0. Therefore, an urgency respecting order does not need to be unique. Clearly, there always exists an optimal order for S that is urgency respecting. The partial tiebreaking condition is required to make sure that there is a well-defined procedure of consecutive movements to go from the initial order σ
                     0 to the urgency respecting order σ, as is explained later in this section.

In a SoSi sequencing game there are two types of operations allowed for a coalition S given the initial order σ
                     0. A type I operation is a swap of adjacent pairs in the same component of S. A type II operation is a move from a player in S to the position directly behind another player of S within one of the subsequent components.

Now we are ready to prove non-emptiness of the core of SoSi sequencing games.

                        Theorem 3.2
                        
                           Every SoSi sequencing game has a non-empty core.
                           
                              2
                           
                           
                              2
                              This result can also be obtained using Theorem 5.1 in Slikker (2006b), but the current proof via Theorem 3.1 is in our opinion more elegant.
                           
                        

Clearly, it suffices to show that SoSi sequencing games satisfy condition (3) in Theorem 3.1. Let (N, σ
                           0, p, α) be a one-machine sequencing situation and let (N, v) be the corresponding SoSi sequencing game. Next, let S ⊂ N and let σ
                           * be an urgency respecting optimal order for coalition S. Because of (2) we can assume without loss of generality that S is not connected. We define a special processing order θ
                           0 such that the coalition S is connected with respect to θ
                           0. Thereafter, all type I and type II operations that are used to obtain σ
                           * from σ
                           0 via 
                              
                                 σ
                                 0
                                 S
                              
                            are performed on the processing order θ
                           0.

This section provides a polynomial time algorithm determining an optimal order for every possible coalition and, consequently, the values of the coalitions. First, some new notions as composed costs per time unit, composed processing times and composed urgencies are introduced. Using these notions we can exclude some admissible orders from being optimal.

The composed costs per time unit αS
                      and the composed processing time pS
                      for a coalition S ∈ 2

Next we explain how the concept of composed urgency helps to decide which of two related processing orders is less costly for a certain coalition. For the moment we do not worry about admissibility of these orders. Consider a non-empty coalition S and a processing order σ ∈ Π(N). First take i ∈ S and j ∈ N such that σ(i) < σ(j). Let

                      be the processing order obtained from σ by moving player i to the position directly behind player j. Then the difference between the costs for coalition S with respect to the processing order σ and the processing order

                      is the processing order obtained from σ by moving player i to the position directly behind player j.

Using the above notation of a cost difference it is easily checked whether having a certain player i ∈ S in a later position (behind player j) in the processing order is beneficial for S or not because

Using these criteria one can exclude some admissible orders from being optimal, as illustrated in the following lemma. To be specific, Lemma 4.1 states that if there is a player t ∈ S positioned according to

                      behind a player s ∈ S with lower urgency and it is admissible that these players swap their position then σ cannot be an optimal order, i.e., σ can be improved.

Given a coalition S, Algorithm 1
                      below determines an urgency respecting optimal order and the corresponding cost savings with respect to σ
                     0. The algorithm starts in Step 0 with reordering the players within components of S with respect to σ
                     0. This is done by setting the current processing order σ equal to the urgency respecting processing order

                     Hence, v(S) can be initialized by this value, as is done in Step 1.

Subsequently, the players are considered in reverse order with respect to 
                        
                           σ
                           0
                           S
                        
                     . Note that it is not admissible for a player from the last component with respect to σ
                     0 to step out from his component. Hence, the algorithm does not consider the players in the last component and the first player to be considered is the last player of the penultimate component. This initialization is done in Step 1 where k represents the current modified component and i represents the current player.

In Step 2 it is checked whether moving the current player i to a later modified component is beneficial. When one wants to move player i from the modified component k to a later modified component l, the position of this player in modified component l is fixed because the processing order must remain urgency respecting. This is guaranteed by considering the unique option to move the player directly behind the last player in modified component l with strictly higher urgency than player i. In this way, the partial tiebreaking condition is satisfied if later in the course of algorithm’s run another player is moved to the same modified component. So, player i is never moved to a subsequent component having no players with higher urgency than player i. Let

In Step 3 the settings of k and i are updated. If player i was not the first player of his component, then his old predecessor is the new considered player while going back to Step 2. Otherwise, the last player of the component preceding the old component of player i is considered while going back to Step 2. Moreover, if player i was the first player of coalition S with respect to processing order

In Step 3 we have to update k and i. Since player 6 was the only player in his component, and thus his previous predecessor is not a member of coalition S, we consider next the component that was in front of player 6 and thus k ≔ 2. The considered player is the last player of this component, i.e., i ≔ 5.

Since the previous predecessor of player 5, player 4, is a member of coalition S, he becomes the new current player (so i ≔ 4 and k ≔ 2).

                           4, we have A ≔ ∅. This means that it is not possible to reduce the total costs by moving player 4 to a different component. Hence, σ and v(S) are not changed.

Since the predecessor of player 4 is outside S, we next consider the first component (k ≔ 1) and the last player of the first component (i ≔ 1).

According to Step 4, the algorithm terminates and an optimal order for coalition S is found, namely the processing order in Fig. 12 which can be summarized as

The following lemma shows that Algorithm 1 always constructs an urgency respecting admissible order for a certain coalition S. This lemma is used to prove that the processing order found by the algorithm is also optimal with respect to coalition S (see Theorem 4.3).

                        Lemma 4.2
                        
                           Let (N, σ
                           0, p, α) be a one-machine sequencing situation and let S ∈ 2
                              N
                           \{∅}. Then Algorithm 
                           
                              1
                            
                           constructs an urgency respecting admissible order

                           for coalition S.

                           alg. We only have to prove that σ
                           alg satisfies the partial tiebreaking condition, because the other conditions of admissibility and urgency respecting are satisfied trivially by construction. Suppose, for sake of contradiction, that σ

Thus, condition (i) determines the relative order for players with the same urgency and from the same modified component of S with respect to σ. Likewise, condition (ii) ensures that no player in S can be moved to an earlier modified component of σ while the total costs remain the same. In particular, for coalition S there is a unique representative of the urgency respecting optimal orders and denote this order by

                           alg is an urgency respecting admissible order for coalition S and thus there is a well-defined procedure of consecutive movements to go from initial order σ

                           * does not result in worse costs for coalition S which is a contradiction. As τ(q) < τ(r) < τ(k) and σ
                           *(k) < σ
                           *(q) < σ
                           *(r), we know that the swap of players q and r with respect to σ
                           * is admissible. Consequently, from Lemma 4.1 it follows that uq

In this paper a new class of relaxed sequencing games is introduced. This relaxation is intuitive from a practical point of view, because a member of a coalition is allowed to step out from his position in the processing order and to step in at any position somewhere later in the processing order. First, we have shown non-emptiness of the core for the class of relaxed sequencing games where the value of a coalition is bounded from above by the gains made by all possible neighbor switches. Moreover, we have shown that the class of SoSi sequencing games belongs to this class, and that consequently every SoSi sequencing game has a non-empty core. It would be interesting to further analyze the possible convexity of SoSi sequencing games. Note that we applied our SoSi relaxation to the classical sequencing setting considered by Curiel et al. (1989). Another direction of future research is to apply the SoSi relaxation to other sequencing models as well.

Closely related to the class of SoSi sequencing games is the class of so-called Step out sequencing games. In a Step out sequencing game a member of a coalition S can swap with another member of the coalition S who is in the same component of S with respect to σ
                     0, while he is also allowed to step out from his initial position in the processing order and enter at the rear of the processing order. Hence, in contrast to a SoSi sequencing game, a player in S cannot join any position later in the processing order but only the rear of the processing order. Example 5.1 illustrates the differences between admissible orders in a Step out sequencing game and a SoSi sequencing game.

                            (cf. Fig. 13
                           (a)). In a SoSi sequencing game it is allowed for player 1 to step out from his position in the processing order and to step in in the second component of S, for example in between players 2 and 3. However, this is not allowed in a Step out sequencing game, because in a Step out sequencing game player 1 can only enter at the rear of the processing order. This means that processing order 
                              
                                 σ
                                 ^
                              
                            in Fig. 13(b) is admissible in a SoSi sequencing game but not in a Step out sequencing game.

Using similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 3.2, it can be shown that Step out sequencing games also belong to the class of relaxed sequencing games as discussed in Theorem 3.1, which implies that every Step out sequencing game has a non-empty core.

In this paper we also provided a polynomial time algorithm determining an optimal processing order for a coalition and the corresponding value in a SoSi sequencing game. Finding a polynomial time algorithm determining an optimal order for every possible coalition for a Step out sequencing game turns out to be different than for a SoSi sequencing game. Example 5.2 gives an example of a Step out sequencing game where moving some players individually is not beneficial, but moving these players simultaneously is. This illustrates that the algorithm of SoSi sequencing games cannot be applied to Step out sequencing games because this algorithm moves players individually. It would be interesting to develop a polynomial time algorithm for determining an optimal order for every possible coalition in a Step out sequencing game.

                        Example 5.2
                        Reconsider the one-machine sequencing situation (N, σ
                           0, p, α) of Example 5.1 with

                           . In Fig. 14
                            an illustration can be found of an initial order σ
                           0 together with the cost coefficients and processing times (the numbers above and below the players, respectively). The completion times of the players with respect to this initial order are also indicated in the figure (bottom line in bold).

Some alternative admissible orders are given in Fig. 14. The corresponding cost savings for coalition S with respect to these admissible orders are as follows:

                           Hence, both moving player 1 and player 3 individually to the rear of the processing order is not beneficial (cf. σ
                           1 and σ
                           2, respectively). However, if you move players 1 and 3 simultaneously to the rear of the processing order, then some cost savings are obtained (cf. σ
                           3). This illustrates that a more sophisticated algorithm is needed.
