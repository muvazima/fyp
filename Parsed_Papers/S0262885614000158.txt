                  This paper proposes a new method for self-calibrating a set of stationary non-rotating zooming cameras. This is a realistic configuration, usually encountered in surveillance systems, in which each zooming camera is physically attached to a static structure (wall, ceiling, robot, or tripod). In particular, a linear, yet effective method to recover the affine structure of the observed scene from two or more such stationary zooming cameras is presented. The proposed method solely relies on point correspondences across images and no knowledge about the scene is required. Our method exploits the mostly translational displacement of the so-called principal plane of each zooming camera to estimate the location of the plane at infinity. The principal plane of a camera, at any given setting of its zoom, is encoded in its corresponding perspective projection matrix from which it can be easily extracted. As a displacement of the principal plane of a camera under the effect of zooming allows the identification of a pair of parallel planes, each zooming camera can be used to locate a line on the plane at infinity. Hence, two or more such zooming cameras in general positions allow the obtainment of an estimate of the plane at infinity making it possible, under the assumption of zero-skew and/or known aspect ratio, to linearly calculate the camera's parameters. Finally, the parameters of the camera and the coordinates of the plane at infinity are refined through a nonlinear least-squares optimization procedure. The results of our extensive experiments using both simulated and real data are also reported in this paper.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Camera self-calibration, i.e. computing the camera's intrinsic parameters solely from point correspondences across images, is key to overcome the re-calibration problem of the frequently changing parameters of zooming cameras. These parameters are essential for the recovery of the metric structure of a scene.

The self-calibration problem of a “possibly” zooming and moving camera, otherwise nonlinear and challenging to solve [1–5], is drastically simplified when the plane at infinity is first located [6]. Doing so, allows an affine upgrade of the scene and cameras from which the intrinsic parameters can be linearly calculated [7]. However, the difficult step is to locate the plane at infinity with no prior knowledge about the scene. In the case of a moving camera with constant parameters, the modulus constraints [8–10] can be used to recover the plane at infinity by solving a set of nonlinear polynomial equations. In addition to the inherent difficulty of solving nonlinear equations, these constraints cannot be used when the camera parameters are allowed to vary. In the latter case, chirality inequalities [6] may be used to upgrade a projective reconstruction to a quasi-affine one as well as to bound the location of the plane at infinity. This allows the retrieval of the camera parameters and the plane at infinity either through an exhaustive search within the bounded area or using nonlinear optimization [11].

As far as stationary cameras are concerned, the assumption of a mandatory pure rotation of the camera has been proposed in the literature [12,13] to obtain its intrinsic parameters. Indeed, pure rotations allow for a linear calculation of inter-image homographies induced by the plane at infinity from which the camera parameters can also be linearly retrieved. However, moving cameras in a purely rotational motion is not easy in practice, and such an assumption is only plausible when the camera is far from the scene [14–16].

Whether dealing with stationary or moving cameras, most self-calibration methods, while possibly allowing the cameras to zoom, do not exploit the zooming capability of the capturing device. Only few methods [17,18] relying on the zooming capability of the camera have been reported in the literature. However, such methods have derived only a limited benefit from doing so. Indeed, zooming was only used to estimate the pixel coordinates of the principal point while the linear recovery of the plane at infinity, and hence the remaining intrinsic parameters, required applying a pure translation to the camera. Note that, not only a pure translation of the camera is difficult to obtain in practice, but also that the assumption of a constant principal point throughout zooming is not realistic as shown by several studies among which [19] is probably the most comprehensive one. In addition, it has been shown in [20] that inaccuracies on the position of the principal point may have a significant impact on the calibration of the remaining parameters.

The work presented in this paper deals with the problem of self-calibrating a camera system in which two or more stationary non-rotating zooming cameras observe a static scene. To the best of our knowledge, such configuration of cameras has not been addressed in the literature, although this is a realistic and common configuration often encountered in stereo camera systems, surveillance networks and monitoring of events. In such image capture systems, each camera is physically attached to a static structure (wall, ceiling or tripod) and is only allowed to zoom. Because the cameras are not rotating, the methods designed for stationary rotating cameras cannot be employed to self-calibrate each camera independently. Solutions designed for arbitrarily moving cameras may be employed but lead to unnecessarily complicated nonlinear equations. The camera self-calibration method we propose in this paper exploits the zooming capability of the cameras in order to directly estimate the location of the plane at infinity. Unlike existing methods exploiting camera zoom, the principal point is allowed to freely move after zooming and no special motion between the physical cameras is required.

Our method for locating the plane at infinity from stationary non-rotating zooming cameras is based on some important observations we have made on the results of the experiments conducted by Willson in his work [19] on designing an active model for zoom lenses. Indeed, the change that affects the intrinsic parameters of a camera while zooming is the result of the displacement of both its optical center and the image plane which undergoes a mostly translational motion with possibly an partial rotation. The camera self-calibration method we propose in this paper precisely exploits the effect of this joint motion of the optical center and the image plane on the camera's so-called principal plane. The principal plane of a camera is a plane parallel to the image plane containing its optical center. Unlike the image plane which requires the knowledge of the focal length in order to be located, the principal plane's coordinates are encapsulated in the camera's perspective projection matrix (camera matrix) from which they can be easily extracted. In particular, a consistent set of camera matrices, i.e. matrices calculated in a projective frame that is common for all views, can be obtained from point correspondences across uncalibrated images. The working assumption in this paper (which is supported by Willson's experiments [19] using several cameras) is that the motion of the principal plane, under the effect of zooming, identifies a pair of parallel planes (or a set of parallel planes in the case of multiple zooms). Neither a special motion between the cameras nor any knowledge about the position of the principal point is required at this stage. Indeed, as parallel planes intersect in a line at infinity, two uncalibrated zooming cameras in general position allow in theory to locate the plane at infinity.

Once the plane at infinity is retrieved from parallel principal planes, the no-skew and/or known aspect ratio constraints can be used to linearly estimate the so-called Image of the Absolute Conic (IAC) and hence all the intrinsic parameters. It is also well-known that estimating the camera's intrinsic parameters is very sensitive to the localization of the plane at infinity. Hence, we have investigated two methods for linearly calculating an estimate of the IAC (and as a consequence the camera parameters) from the linearly estimated plane at infinity: (a) the well-known linear least-squares through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [7], and (b) a Linear Matrix Inequality formulation which allows the enforcement of the requirement of a positive-definite IAC [21]. Our extensive experiments both on simulated and real images (using a variable number of cameras, zoom settings and image noise) show that the estimate of the intrinsic parameters, obtained by both methods along with the zoom-based candidate plane at infinity, allow for a simple nonlinear least-squares optimization procedure to converge towards the optimal parameters.

Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some necessary background and preliminaries. In Section 3, we describe the zooming camera model that we have considered for developing our method and its relationship to the plane at infinity. Section 4 describes our self-calibrating method for non-rotating zooming stationary cameras, including the linear affine self-calibration step which constitutes the main contribution of the present paper. Our experiments and the results we have obtained are described and discussed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes our work.

In this paper we consider a static scene observed by n(n
                        ≥2) uncalibrated stationary zooming cameras. The cameras are placed at distinct positions in space and have different orientations. We assume throughout this paper that each camera i (i
                        =1, 2,....., n) captures images at different settings in the subset

Note that although the cameras and the scene neither rotate nor translate, the geometry of each camera changes under zooming effect. For this, we assume throughout this paper that images captured by the same camera with distinct zoom settings as if they had been captured by distinct cameras each of which following the well-known pinhole model [6].

While such set of camera matrices can be obtained using virtually any off-the-shelf method [6], we have used in the present work the method of Rothwell et al. [22]. The resulting matrices allow only for the recovery of the scene and cameras up to a common but unknown projective ambiguity.

The projective ambiguity that affects the scene structure and the cameras can be reduced to an affine one by means of an adequate transformation T represented by a 4×4 regular matrix of the form

                        . At least three images (including the reference image) captured from distinct viewpoints are needed to recover all five unknown entries of ω.

Note that some classes of motion sequences between cameras are critical for camera self-calibration and lead to its failure [26]. For instance, under the no-skew, known aspect ratio and known plane at infinity assumptions, camera sequences containing at most two viewing directions are critical and the underlying reconstruction ambiguity is affine. Cameras with parallel (or anti-parallel) optical axes share the same viewing direction. Hence, at least three distinct viewing directions throughout the sequence of cameras are necessary for the recovery of the intrinsic parameters when solving (5).

The rows of a 3×4 projective camera matrix P are 4-vectors representing the homogeneous coordinates of three planes Π, Ψ and Φ. These planes can be inferred geometrically as the specific world planes depicted in Fig. 1
                         and intersecting in the camera center C.

In particular, the plane Φ, represented by the 3rd row of P, is the principal plane [6] (the term focal plane is also used in the literature). The principal plane is the plane containing the X and Y axes of the camera's reference frame, hence parallel to the image plane ℐ and containing the camera center. It is the plane of equation ϕTQ=0 representing the set of all points Q projected onto image points with coordinates

It is well-known that parallelism is invariant under affine (hence metric) transformations. This property is often exploited to locate the plane at infinity by detecting and establishing correspondences of vanishing points or vanishing lines across images. The plane at infinity can be computed from 3 such vanishing points or from a single vanishing point and a vanishing line [23]. The most general way of locating vanishing points is by determining the intersection point of the images of lines that are parallel in the scene. Furthermore, as parallel planes intersect in a vanishing line, the latter can be located by reconstructing these planes in some projective frame and back-projecting their common line onto the images. It has recently been shown that the plane at infinity can also be located from scenes with 2 pairs of parallel planes determining two vanishing lines without the need for reconstruction [24]. This is achieved through a linear relationship between parallel scene planes and the plane at infinity. To briefly describe this, consider a 3D scene consisting of two distinct and parallel scene planes Π1 and Π2. Since these two planes are parallel to each other, they meet in a line on the plane at infinity Π∞. As a consequence, the coordinates of the plane at infinity and those of Π1 and Π2 are linearly dependent. Such dependency can be expressed by

In this section, we discuss the effect of zooming on the camera model and present the main ingredients used in our method for upgrading a projective scene structure and cameras to an affine frame. Consider a camera that is physically fixed in space, e.g. on a tripod, capturing two or more images at different settings of its zoom lens. At any given setting s

                      and by its optical center C

                      from the image plane. This repositioning of the lens, carried out by automated zooming hardware or by manual lens change, does affect not only the focal length of the pinhole camera model, but also other parameters. In fact, a change in the configuration of a camera lens due to zooming results in the repositioning of both the optical center and the image plane. In his design of an active model for zoom lenses [19], Willson has carried out a series of experiments in which a pattern-based calibration of a stationary camera is repeated at various zoom settings using several zoom lenses. This was to identify the camera parameters that must be allowed to vary with the zoom versus the ones that can be fixed in the zooming camera model. The results of Willson's experiments show that the optical center is dominantly shifted (possibly by several tens of millimeters) along the Z-axis of the camera (the optical axis) and that its displacements along the X- and Y-axes are small and hence neglected in his model. This does not imply that the position of the principal point remains stable since the image plane is also displaced under the effect of zooming. In particular, the image plane was found to undergo a mostly translational motion which is not necessarily parallel to the Z-axis and hence affecting the position of the principal point. In Willson's model, the displacement of the image plane is represented by the fact that both the optical center and the focal length are allowed to vary independently from one another and by allowing the principal point to shift as well. Note that the goal in Willson's work was to obtain a simple model involving only the most influential parameters.

Based on this description, the zooming process incorporates displacing the camera center to a new location whilst preserving camera orientation (i.e. no rotation). This displacement of the camera center in general alters three out of the main five intrinsic parameters: the skew and aspect ratio remain very stable while the principal point and focal length vary. From this point of view, a stationary zooming camera can be viewed as a mechanism for obtaining images from pure translational motion. Obtaining two views from pure translation is hard in practice and requires a high degree of accuracy which might not be achievable except with special equipment and often in a laboratory setup. However, we should note that although an affine reconstruction is possible from two views of a camera with fixed parameters undergoing a pure translation, it is impossible to obtain an affine reconstruction from two views in the case of a zooming camera, i.e. varying intrinsic parameters with pure translation motion constraints as proved in [25]. Furthermore, the modulus constraints cannot be used in the case of zooming or varying camera parameters. The only remaining existing possibility is to rely on scene constrains such as parallel lines and planes. This paper introduces a new method which relies neither on scene constraints nor on explicit motion constraints.

The affine self-calibration method we propose relies on less restrictive constraints on the geometry of a zooming camera than Willson's. Indeed, we rely on the fact that the optical center is mostly displaced along the Z-axis but, unlike Willson's model, we allow it to also shift along the X- and Y-axes by any amount. More importantly, we consider the image plane after zooming parallel to the one before zooming. This assumption includes the case in which the image planeundergoes a pure translation (as in Willson's model) but also allows the image plane to rotate around any axis parallel to the Z-axis. Note that our assumptions imply that all the intrinsic parameters are free to vary. Under these assumptions, we achieve our affine self-calibration goal by tracking the motion of the principal plane Φ (introduced in Section 2.3) of the camera which we denote hereafter Φ

                      intersect. All principal planes originating from the same camera meet in this line. In order to retrieve the plane at infinity, at least two distinct lines on this plane are necessary. Such lines can be obtained from two or more distinct zooming cameras in general position.

In this section, we present and describe our camera self-calibration method for a set of two or more stationary non-rotating zooming cameras. Assuming a consistent set of projective camera matrices has already been recovered from image correspondences, the full camera self-calibration is carried out in three steps. The first step consists in linearly estimating the plane at infinity by employing two or more images captured by each camera at distinct settings of its zoom lens. This step exploits the assumption that the principal planes corresponding to distinct zoom levels of the same camera are parallel to one another. In the second step, an estimate of the intrinsic parameters is linearly calculated by assuming zero-skew and/or known (unit) aspect ratio. Finally, the optimal intrinsic parameters and coordinates of the plane at infinity are obtained through a nonlinear least-squares optimization procedure.

The plane at infinity can be identified from at least two distinct lines lying on it. Using the zooming camera model described in the previous section, each zooming camera allows the identification of one such line lying at the intersection of its (parallel) principal planes. Two or more zooming cameras (n
                        ≥2), two of which not pointing in the same direction, allow the recovery of the coordinates of the plane at infinity by solving a linear system of Eq. (7) involving all cameras and zoom images. However, when relying on (7), each pair of parallel principal planes introduces two new unknowns

                         for every given camera. For instance, two cameras, each capturing two zoom images, yield eight linear equations in eight unknowns and suffice in theory to retrieve the plane at infinity. In practice, more than two cameras may be available and each camera may very well capture more than two images at distinct zoom settings of its lens. In such case, in order to cope with image noise, it is highly desirable to employ all cameras and images at hand. However, n

Fortunately, (7) can be brought to a system of equations solely involving the coordinates of the plane at infinity. This can be achieved by considering that neither the plane at infinity nor any of the principal planes contain the origin of the reference frame. Note that this is always possible either by arbitrarily choosing the world reference frame within the scene or by discarding the principal plane containing the origin of the frame should the latter be attached to one of the cameras. Under this assumption, the coordinate vector of the plane at infinity and that of any given principal plane are of the form ∏∞

Retrieving the plane at infinity from (11) may work well for low levels of image noise. However, when using (11), cameras with more zoom images would carry more weight than the rest of the cameras and thus have more influence on the calculation of the plane at infinity. This may be a source of failure if the images obtained from such dominant cameras turn out to be particularly affected by noise. Furthermore, solving (11) allows the retrieval of the plane whose distance to all 3D points (given by the rows of all the Mi matrices) is minimal. However, in the presence of noise, such solution does not take into account the fact that the rows of each matrix Mi must define a line and that the sought plane ought to contain all such lines. Therefore, a more geometrically meaningful solution is to first define the line that best fits the points at infinity defined by each zooming camera (i.e. the rows of the associated Mi) before fitting a plane to those lines. Finding the line that best fits a set of 3D points is an orthogonal regression problem. The best fitting line can be parametrically defined as a set of points

The plane at infinity corresponds to the right singular vector of the 4×2n matrix L associated with its smallest singular value. Retrieving the plane at infinity through (12) has proved much more accurate in practice and less sensitive to noise than when using (11).

Once the plane at infinity is retrieved, the intrinsic parameters of the reference camera can be calculated by solving (5) either using SVD [7] or through Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) employing a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) formulation [21]. The advantage of solving (5) as a SDP problem is that, unlike when using SVD, the positive-definiteness of the sought IAC matrix ω can be enforced. Indeed, when using SVD in the presence of image noise, the retrieved ω may not be definite rendering the calculation of the camera parameters impossible. In the experiments presented in the present paper, we have tested both the SVD and the LMI-based SDP approaches.

Through solving the linear system of Eq. (5), one would like to calculate all five entries of ω under the zero skew and unit aspect ratio assumptions for all cameras. Although the recovery of the plane at infinity requires two cameras, each capturing at least two images at different zoom settings, the calculation of the IAC requires at least three images captured from distinct viewpoints. We recall that motion sequences containing at most two viewing directions are critical for the no-skew and known aspect ratio case [26]. Note that the images obtained from the same camera at different zoom settings all share a unique viewing direction. Therefore, after the plane at infinity is retrieved, at least three images captured from cameras at different locations in space, and having different viewing directions, are required for the recovery of the reference IAC. In practice, because at least two of the cameras would provide two zoom images for the affine upgrade, at least five images will be available all of which will be used for calculating ω.

Because solving (5) using SVD is straightforward and well-known [6], we briefly describe here the LMI-based approach. For instance, assuming n
                        ≥3 cameras are available, of which at least two are zooming (m

                        ≥2 for at least two instances of i), the IAC ω of the reference image can be obtained by solving the following SDP:

The symbol ≻0 means that the symmetric matrix on the left-hand side is positive definite. Problem (13) is a quasi-convex one that can be solved very efficiently using interior-point methods [27]. From a practical point of view, several solvers, such as SeDuMi (http://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/) and Matlab's LMI Control Toolbox, are available. The reader may refer to [21] for more details about this SDP formulation of the problem of retrieving the IAC.

As in all camera self-calibration methods, the initial estimate of the plane at infinity and that of the intrinsic parameters need to be refined through a nonlinear optimization procedure as to retrieve the optimal parameters. While several cost functions have been proposed in the literature, the optimal results reported in the present paper have been obtained by minimizing the following objective function:

                         refers to the Frobenius norm of a matrix. Again, although at least three images captured from different viewpoints are needed, all available images are to be used in this optimization procedure. Note that, in (14), the matrix inverse Hi,s
                        −1 has been replaced by its equivalent adjoint matrix Hi,s
                        ⁎ as to avoid inverting matrices during optimization and to make π
                        ∞ appear explicitly. We recall that the inverse of a matrix and its adjoint are related by

The adjoint matrix Hi,s
                        ⁎ is defined as the transpose of the matrix of co-factors of Hi,s. It can thus be expressed numerically as well as symbolically. In particular, it has been recently demonstrated in [10] that Hi,s
                        ⁎ entries are affine functions of π
                        ∞ and is of the form

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

In order to validate and assess our self-calibration method for stationary non-rotating zooming cameras, we have conducted several experiments using both synthetic and real images. The experiments with real images have been carried out both in a laboratory setup and with a real scene.

In all our experiments, the projective camera matrices were calculated using the method described in [22]. As customary, data normalization has been used throughout. In all our experiments, a linear estimate of the plane at infinity was obtained by solving (12). Initial estimates of the intrinsic parameters were obtained by solving (5) using SVD as well as by solving the SDP problem (13). Matlab LMI Control Toolbox has consistently been used throughout the experiments to solve SDPs. An estimate of the intrinsic parameters has been extracted from the linearly calculated IAC. Then, the optimal intrinsic parameters of the camera have then been obtained by minimizing (14) using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. Errors on the 3D reconstruction have been recorded and reported following each step of the algorithm. In the case of real images, we also provide the resulting intrinsic parameters for the sake of comparison with those obtained by the pattern-based calibration procedure. In all the results reported here:
                        
                           •
                           “LMI linear” refers to the results obtained after solving SDP problem (13) without any further refinement of the results;

“SVD linear” refers to the results obtained by solving the linear system of Eq. (5) without refinement;

“Focal only linear” are the results obtained by assuming all the parameters of the camera known but the focal length;

“Affine DLT” are the results obtained by aligning the affine reconstruction (directly calculated from parallel principal planes by solving (12)) with the Euclidean ground truth via the best affine Direct-Linear-Transform (DLT) [6].

The results obtained after refinement (by minimizing (14) and reconstructing the scene) are referred to as “LMI nonlinear”, “SVD nonlinear” and “Focal only nonlinear” each taking as input the results returned respectively by “LMI linear”, “SVD linear” and “Focal only linear”. Apart from “Affine DLT” which uses the best transformation, all 3D reconstructions have been carried out in the same frame as the ground truth data and re-scaled accordingly.

Note that, in the estimation of the camera parameters, although our working assumption is the absence of skew and known (unit) aspect ratio, none of the 5 sought entries of ω were fixed (apart from the element at the third row and third column which was fixed to 1). This choice was made so the IAC on the reference image and the IACs on all other views are equally treated.

We have conducted extensive experiments with simulated data. In each simulation, we randomly generated a 3D point cloud consisting of 200 points confined within 1m radius sphere. The experiments were conducted using a variable number of cameras each of which randomly generated at a mean distance of 2m from the center of the sphere with a 0.4m standard deviation. Each camera was oriented in such a way it roughly pointed towards the center of the sphere. The generated cameras were created to simulate a zooming camera with realistic zoom length capabilities of 12.5–35mm, a CCD array of 8×8mm and 64pixels per millimeter. Using each generated camera, we captured a number of images at different zoom settings by projecting the scene points onto 512×512pixel images. The first image captured by each camera was obtained using an 800pixel (12.5mm) focal length, zero-skew, unit aspect ratio, and the principal point located at the center of the image. For the subsequent images taken by each camera, and in order to simulate zooming, the focal length was randomly increased to a length within the range of 15–35mm (960–2240pixels). This way, the optical center of the camera is translated by a relative amount within the range of 2.5 and 22.5mm along the optical axis from its initial position before zooming. For every fixed number of cameras and number of zoom images, each experiment was repeated by progressively corrupting pixel coordinates by a zero-mean Gaussian noise with standard deviation in the range 0 to 2pixels (with a 0.25 pix step). Furthermore, each experiment was repeated for 1000 independent trials for every number of cameras, number of zoom images and noise level. The experiments were conducted using 3 to 6 cameras each capturing between 2 and 7 images at different zoom settings. For each trial, we have recorded the relative 3D RMS error (in percent) of the reconstructed Euclidean structure. Both the mean (over 1000 trials) and the median 3D RMS errors are reported in our figures.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the results obtained with the minimum number of viewpoints (n
                        =3), here represented by 3 distinct physical cameras, each however capturing 2 zoom images. A total of 6 images have thus been employed. Note that the linear step, whether using the LMI formulation or SVD, yielded large 3D errors (about 50% on average when using the LMIs and high levels of noise). Yet, the linearly recovered plane at infinity and camera parameters allowed for the refinement step to converge to a fair result (35% using the LMIs method and 2pixels of noise) considering only 3 viewpoints have been used. While the refined results are comparable regardless of which linear method is initially used (“Focal only linear”, “SVDlinear” or “LMI linear”), the method relying on solving the LMIs provided the best results. The median errors reported on the right-hand side of this figure suggest that at least half of the trials have led to a very good reconstruction with a 3D RMS error of not more than 5%.

It is clear however that more cameras and/or more zoom images are to be considered for better results. For instance, Fig. 4
                         summarizes the results obtained with the same number of cameras (i.e. n
                        =3), employing, however, 7 zoom images captured by each. In the refined results, the mean 3D RMS error is half (about 18%) of what it was when only 2 zoom images per camera were used (about 35%). The errors obtained via the LMI-based and SVD-based linear steps have significantly dropped to 40% (with 2pixels of noise) from respectively 50% and 65% on average. Again, the median 3D RMS errors on the right-hand side of Fig. 4 show that most trials have led to excellent results with at most 1% error.

As a realistic pixel localization error is generally within a single pixel, we provide in Fig. 5
                         the 3D errors obtained when using 3 cameras, each capturing a variable number of zoom images (from 2 to 7), and 1 pixel of noise.


                        Fig. 5 shows that both the median and mean 3D RMS errors decrease with the increasing number of zoom images. This is particularly true when calculating the camera parameters linearly (LMI linear, SVD linear and Focal only). The figure, however, shows also that the refined result remains rather stable as early as when 3 zoom images per camera are used. This suggests that, apart from noise reduction, further improvement of the quality of reconstruction cannot be only achieved by adding more zoom images but also adding more viewpoints, and hence more distinctly located stationary cameras. In this respect, we report in Fig. 6
                         the reconstruction results obtained, with 1 pixel of noise, by keeping the number of zoom images per camera (only 2 zoom images) unchanged while varying the number of cameras from 3 to 6.

One can only deduce from Fig. 6 that using more viewpoints contributes to obtaining a more accurate reconstruction. Typically, using more viewpoints and more zoom images may allow the linear step for calculating the camera parameters to provide better results than those obtained after refinement from fewer viewpoints and zooms. This is for instance the case when using 6 cameras, each capturing 7 zoom images, as depicted in Fig. 7
                        . The results reported therein clearly show that excellent results can be achieved in this manner. Indeed, with only 25% mean error (with 2pixels noise), the quality of the reconstruction obtained with any of the linear methods (LMI, SVD or Focal only) exceeds that of the reconstruction obtained after refinement when using only 3 camera with 2 zoom images each (between 35% and 40% depending on the method).

We conclude this section on simulations with some remarks and comments. In all our experiments, the results obtained linearly, when considering only the focal length to be unknown, were generally worse (except when using SVD with 3 cameras and 2 zoom images each) than those obtained without such knowledge. This is because the ground truth camera parameters do not correspond to the best parameters that can be obtained in the presence of noise. It is thus recommended to leave all the parameters free and to use the LMI-based method for the linear estimate of these parameters as this method has consistently provided the best results. Furthermore, note that the errors calculated after applying the affine DLT always fall between those obtained linearly and those refined. In fact, the errors obtained via the DLT provide the best indication with regard to the quality of the linearly calculated affine reconstruction from parallel principal planes. The errors obtained following the recovery of the intrinsic parameters, whether from the LMIs or from SVD, are likely to be undermined by any proximity to a critical viewing configuration (critical motion between cameras).

In order to validate the proposed self-calibration method, we carried out various experiments using real images in a laboratory setup. Three low-end consumer digital cameras with motorized zoom lenses have been used: a Kodak EasyShare, a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-S930 and a Canon PowerShot SX150 IS. All three cameras were assumed to have zero skew and unit aspect ratio. Because the same physical camera has sometimes been used to capture a scene from more than a single location, in the present section and the next one (Section 5.3 dealing with real scenes), we often use the word “viewpoint” instead of “camera” to refer to a stationary camera placed at some location in space and possibly capturing several zoom images from that same location.

In these experiments, instead of using synthetic data, we presented our EasyShare, Cyber-shot and PowerShot cameras with a scene consisting of a 21×21×21cm cube-shaped calibration object exhibiting 30×30mm black and white squares on each face. We conducted a number of experiments as to assess the quality of the reconstruction and the effect of the relative orientation between pairs of viewpoints (turntable experiments). We also compare the results of our method against those obtained by relying on scene constraints (namely parallel lines and planes). Note that, although the Euclidean structure of the calibration cube was known to us, the cube was treated as an unknown scene when applying our self-calibration method. Knowledge about the cube has only been used to measure the resulting 3D reconstruction errors and in the method employing scene constraints.

The experiments we have conducted here are similar to those we carried out with simulated data. The calibration cube has been imaged from 4 distinct viewpoints by placing each camera on a tripod, roughly 1.25 to 1.5m from the scene. Each of the EasyShare and Cyber-shot cameras captured images from one viewpoint while the CyberShot camera imaged the scene from two viewpoints. From every viewpoint, each camera captured 4 images at different settings of its zoom lens. This has resulted in the 4 sequences of 4 zoom images given in Fig. 8
                           , each sequence being captured from a different viewpoint by one of the cameras.

A total of 108 points, located on 3 mutually orthogonal faces of the cube, were matched across the images obtained by all cameras at all considered zoom settings. However, we have first conducted our experiments by considering only two viewpoints (Viewpoints #1 and #2 in Fig. 8) starting with two zoom images from each of these two cameras and repeating the experiment with 3 and 4 zoom images. Then, the same experiment was conducted by considering three viewpoints (Viewpoints #1, #2 and #3) followed by using all four viewpoints and by varying the number of zoom images each time. Table 1
                            provides the 3D RMS error (in %) – relative to the cube's diagonal – of the 3D reconstruction calculated from the LMI-based (13) and SVD-based (5) linearly estimated parameters along with the errors obtained after the nonlinear refinement (14) of the intrinsic parameters and plane at infinity. We have also reported in Table 1 the 3D errors obtained after aligning the affine structure (calculated via parallel principal planes) and the ground truth data. The ground truth data are the measurements we obtained from the cube using an office ruler. Note that, for the experiments involving only two viewpoints, only the errors obtained using the affine DLT are reported since the method requires at least three distinct viewpoints for upgrading the scene to metric. For the reader's convenience, we provide in Fig. 9
                            the 3D structures obtained (red) after linearly estimating the parameters by solving (5) through either LMIs or SVD. Note that no nonlinear refinement was used. Each estimated structure is superimposed on the ground truth data (blue). All the estimated 3D structures in this figure have been obtained using only two zoom images for the 3-viewpoint and 4-viewpoint cases.

These results show that adding more zoom images and more cameras often allows the obtainment of a better quality reconstruction. When using 3 viewpoints, the reconstruction error obtained through the affine DLT does not exceed 3.22% when only 2 zoom images (per viewpoint) are used. This error drops, with every additional zoom image and viewpoint, down to 0.26% with 4 viewpoints and 4 zoom images each. One can only notice that in the 3-viewpoint case with 2 zoom images, the linear step failed when SVD was used to recover the intrinsic parameters while the LMI method has allowed the recovery of the 3D scene with 25% error. We would like to stress the fact here that the non-linear refinement reduced the RMS % error close to an acceptable 9% (given the few viewpoints and zoom images used) for both the LMI and SVD methods. This is something we have often observed in all our experiments, including those with simulated data. This suggests that the coordinates of the plane at infinity obtained from the parallel principal planes assumption, along with the linearly estimated intrinsic parameters, have always provided initial estimates that fall within the basin of convergence of our nonlinear refinement cost function. Furthermore, although the LMI method has provided slightly less accurate results than the SVD method for the intrinsic parameters calculation, this method has consistently led to a 3D reconstruction that is within acceptable bounds from the true scene. More importantly, the nonlinear refinement step has always yielded excellent results (less than 1%) with all experiments conducted with 3 and more zoom images per viewpoint.

The intrinsic parameters of the cameras, corresponding to the first image (left-most image in each sub-figure of Fig. 8) captured at each viewpoint, are reported in Table 2
                           . The two last rows of each table provide the parameters obtained linearly using SVD (by solving (5)) preceded by our linear affine self-calibration method (“SVD”) as well as the refined parameters after nonlinear optimization (“Refined”). Note that the parameters reported here have been obtained using 4 viewpoints with 3 zoom images each. We also report in this table the intrinsic parameters obtained when calibrating the camera using the cube object as a calibration pattern with 108 known 3D points to estimate the Euclidean camera matrix from which the parameters are extracted (“Pattern”). It can be seen that the intrinsic parameters obtained after refinement are always close to those obtained though the pattern-based calibration. The focal length obtained linearly via “SVD” is also closed to both the refined value and the one estimated through calibration. The errors on the “SVD” parameters are mostly concentrated in one of the image coordinates of the principal point. However, these errors remain acceptable in the sense that the parameters linearly retrieved still allow the refinement step to converge as desired. Although the true principal point does not necessarily coincide with the image center, the results reported here show that, for all the cameras we have used, this point consistently falls within a reasonable distance from it.

The experiments described here have been conducted to test the relative orientation requirement between cameras (or viewpoints) for obtaining a satisfactory 3D affine reconstruction. Indeed, our method for linearly estimating the plane at infinity using the parallel principal planes assumption fails when the image planes of the physical cameras are parallel to one another. This includes the case of a pure translational motion between viewpoints. It is hence necessary to conduct experiments in a setup that allows testing the impact of an increasingly changing orientation between the zooming cameras. In these experiments, we have used the Canon PowerShot SX150 IS camera only.

The camera was mounted on a tripod about 2m from the calibration cube which, in turn, was placed on a rotating tray as shown in Fig. 10
                           . Six 1600×1200pixel images have been captured at different zoom settings of the camera while the latter was kept stationary. The rotating tray was then rotated by 5, 10, and 20° from its initial position. For every rotation of the tray, again six images were captured at different settings of our PowerShot's zoom lens. Fig. 10 shows 3 (out of the 6) images captured from each of the 4 viewpoints. As in the previous experiments involving the calibration cube, a total of 108 points were extracted and matched across the images.

We have repeatedly used our linear method for retrieving the plane at infinity, reconstructed the scene in an affine frame and aligned the latter with the ground truth structure via the best affine DLT. Only two viewpoints were considered each time: viewpoint #1 (as per Fig. 10) and each of the other viewpoints. Furthermore, we have carried out these experiments using from 2 to 6 zoom images per viewpoint. Table 3
                            summarizes the relative 3D RMS errors (in percent) obtained in each case. A view of the affine reconstruction and another one of its alignment (through the best affine DLT) with the true structure of the cube are given in Fig. 11
                            for visual assessment.

In particular, the results reported in Table 3 show that the error on the affine structure obtained with our method is rather significant (12.4%) in the minimal case of 2 viewpoints with 2 zoom images each for a small rotation of 5° between the viewpoints. However, increasing the number of zoom images, even for such a small rotation, allows the improvement of the quality of the reconstruction (typically to 2.16% with 6 zoom images). The reconstruction quality also improves when considering wider viewpoints. These experiments show that with only 10° rotation between viewpoints, a reconstruction with less than 1% error has been obtained when using 3 and more zoom images. Using wider rotation angles (as in the 20° cases reported) does not necessarily improve the quality of the reconstruction. Hence, the proposed method may provide very satisfactory results even with small rotations thus allowing for the point correspondence across images to be carried out in the usual image-proximity conditions.

In these experiments we confront our linear affine self-calibration method with other methods employing scene constraints. Altogether, we have tested three methods using the same images obtained from the same scene and cameras. The first method relies on the use of 3 vanishing points from 3 orthogonal pairs of parallel lines that make it possible to calculate the plane at infinity and hence the affine structure. The second method employs 2 pairs of parallel planes from the scene to locate the plane at infinity and recover the affine structure. The third method is our zoom-based affine reconstruction in the minimum case of 2 cameras and 2 zoom images. In order to provide such scene constraints in a single model, i.e., parallel planes and parallel lines, along with ground truth data, we have again used our calibration cube. Fig. 12
                            shows the calibration cube along with the parallel lines and planes that have been used as scene constraints. Note that unlike our method, the methods employing scene constraints do not work for scenes where no parallel lines or planes exist.

The Canon PowerShot camera was used to capture images from 2 viewpoints. For each viewpoint, the camera was again mounted on a tripod and captured 2 images at different settings of its zoom. Fig. 12 shows the images captured from each of the viewpoints. The two viewpoints were roughly 70cm apart. Again, 108 feature points (also shown in Fig. 12) were extracted and matched across all 4 images.

The affine 3D scene structures were obtained using each method independently then aligned with the ground truth data using the affine DLT method. Table 4
                            shows the results of the affine reconstruction where the RMS errors obtained with scene constraints were about 0.75% while the zoom-based method provided a reconstruction with 1.03% error. The latter is clearly very good considering that our method does not employ any a priori knowledge about the scene as it relies on point correspondences only. Note that, the used scene constraints in these experiments, parallel lines and planes, are perfect cases for such methods. Such perfect lines and planes constraints rarely exist in real scenarios. Moreover, and more importantly, our method is not limited to scenes exhibiting such constraints giving it an advantageous flexibility.

We have conducted additional experiments on a real scene consisting of a large building. Two different cameras, the Sony Cyber-shot and the Kodak EasyShare, were used to capture the images for these experiments. Images have been captured from 4 distinct viewpoints by placing each camera on a tripod at 2 different locations at about 30m from the scene. The viewpoints were a few meters apart from each other. At each viewpoint, the considered camera captured 4 images at different settings of its zoom lens. Each row in Fig. 13(a) shows the 4 images captured from every one given viewpoint.

A total of 71 feature points were extracted and manually matched across all 20 images using mouse clicks. Certain line segments have been chosen to provide a wireframe model and simplify the 3D visualization of the reconstructed structures. A total of23 line segments, of approximately known Euclidean geometry, have been selected as shown in Fig. 13(b). The end-points of these segments are feature points that have been extracted and matched across the images. Selected pairs of these segments have been used to estimate distance ratios and angles and compare them against the approximately known true values. In particular, known segments of equal length, orthogonal, and parallel segments are estimated and the error from ground truth is then calculated.

Our camera self-calibration method was applied in different scenarios each using different numbers of viewpoints and zoom images. The affine calibration computed using our method was upgraded to metric using the SVD and LMI methods for calculating the intrinsic parameters as well as the results refined through nonlinear optimization.

For this particular experiment, we report the following observations. In the case in which only 3 viewpoints were considered, regardless of the number of zoom images employed, the linear metric reconstruction was of bad quality for both the SVD and LMI methods. The recovered structure had acceptable depth in the different direction but the orthogonal angles were quite skewed. The resulting 3D structures were closer to an affine structure than to a metric one. However, the nonlinear optimization was successful for all cases and provided good metric 3D reconstructions. For the experiments where all 4 viewpoints were employed, the metric 3D reconstruction obtained linearly was good with all numbers of zoom images. The reconstruction obtained from linearly estimating the camera parameters using SVD was better than the one obtained by the LMI method. The quality of the 3D was best when all zoom images from all 4 viewpoints were used. Fig. 14
                         shows top and side views of the wireframe models of the scene obtained from 4 viewpoints with 4 zoom images per viewpoint. These wireframe models were obtained using the parameters calculated linearly using SVD and those obtained after refinement. The structure obtained from the LMI-based linear estimation of the parameters is also provided in this figure.

In the case in which 4 viewpoints and 4 zoom images are considered, Table 5
                         lists the angle and ratio errors on the computed metric properties of all pairs of line segments spanning the full 3D metric structure of the recovered scene model. In this table, the average errors of all estimated values along with the standard deviations are given for the results obtained with the linearly calculated camera parameters (using both SVD and LMI methods) and for those obtained using the refined parameters. As the refinement step for both SVD and LMI produced essentially the same results, only the refined result of SVD is presented in each table.

After refinement, the parallel lines were found within 2.62±1.46 degree error while the orthogonal lines exhibited 5.28±3.94 degree error. The average relative error on line segments ratios is roughly about 9%. However, we recall that the exact ground truth data are not available and we have used as a ground truth only an estimate based on visual assessment of all angles and distances. The results we have obtained can be considered as fair, in particular because only 4 viewpoints have been used to image this large building that would normally require to be captured from more viewpoints.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we described a simple yet effective method for self-calibrating a set of stationary non-rotating zooming cameras. The main contribution of the paper consists in a linear method exploiting the zoom mechanism of each camera to recover the coordinates of the plane at infinity and hence the affine structure of the observed scene. The method retrieves the plane at infinity – directly from the projective projection matrices of the cameras – by exploiting the displacement of their principal planes under the effect of zooming. We use the valid observation that the principal planes of a stationary camera at two distinct zoom settings are parallel. The proposed method is practical as it neither relies on special camera motions (e.g. pure translation, pure rotation) nor does it require the existence, and hence identification, of any scene constraints. Besides the simplicity of our method, the results obtained using low-end zooming cameras are very good. The results of our experiments whether using simulations, laboratory setups or an outdoor scene generally show satisfactory results using our method in the minimum case of two cameras each acquiring a pair of zooming images. Our experiments have also shown that these results are further enhanced in situations where more cameras and/or zoom images are incorporated in the process. The full self-calibration method includes the linear recovery of the intrinsic parameters and their refinement along with the coordinates of the plane at infinity. We have tested two linear methods for calculating the intrinsic parameters: using SVD and another method employing a LMI formulation of the problem allowing the enforcement of the positive-definiteness of the IAC. Note that both methods have provided camera parameters that allowed the nonlinear refinement step to readily converge to the desired optimal values. Although the SVD method does not enforce the positive-definiteness of the IAC, it has consistently provided a positive definite solution from which we have always been able to extract an initial estimate of the camera parameters.
