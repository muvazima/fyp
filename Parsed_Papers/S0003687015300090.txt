                  The research aims to address the physically loading task and quality and productivity problems in the brazing of coils of air-handler units. Eight operators participated in two intervention studies conducted in a factory in Malaysia to compare the status quo brazing with (1) the use of a new twin-brazing torch that replaced the single-brazing gun and (2) brazing in a sitting position. The outcome measures are related to quality, productivity, monetary costs, body postures and symptoms. After baseline, Interventions I and II were applied for 3 months respectively. The results show a 58.9% quality improvement, 140% productivity increase and 113 times ROI. There was also a reduction in poor work postures e.g. in the raising of the arms and shoulders; bending, twisting and extending of the neck; and bending of left and right wrists, and the back. This research can be replicated in other factories that share similar processes.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The involvement of ergonomics in business environments has gained importance (Dul and Neumann, 2009; Dul et al., 2012). Companies aspiring to achieve a competitive advantage in terms of quality, productivity, cost savings and workers' well-being seek to adopt various approaches, one of which is the effort to ‘fit work to people’ (i.e. ergonomics) to raise human performance (Dul and Neumann, 2009). As Dul et al. (2012) highlighted, ergonomics should produce two outcomes, i.e. better business performance and improved well-being, for it to be considered important/strategic to a company. In process innovation, numerous ergonomics studies with these outcomes have been conducted (e.g. Edwards and Jensen, 2014; Hemphälä and Eklund, 2013; Tompa et al., 2013, 2009; Erdinc and Yeow, 2011; Caroly et al., 2010; Maudgalya et al., 2008; Yeow and Sen, 2006, 2003; Sen and Yeow, 2003; Abrahamsson, 2000). In this study, the authors chose to focus on the physically loading brazing task in the air-conditioning industry as it requires a lot of bending of the operators' arms, wrists and neck, and raising of arms and shoulders, leading to musculoskeletal symptoms (MSs) and quality and productivity problems. This study aims to improve ergonomics in the brazing process in an air-handler coil factory to achieve better well-being and performance outcomes. The authors published limited preliminary results in Loo and Yeow (2007, 2008) and Yeow and Loo (2009). This paper presents the final results with the inclusion of an additional intervention (Intervention II), an analysis of well-being outcomes in occupational health and safety (OHS) (through the use of a questionnaire and a risk-analysis tool – the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment [McAtamney and Corlett, 1993]), and business performance outcomes in terms of quality, productivity and cost savings.

In the air-conditioning and refrigeration industries, the assembly of coils of air-handler units (ACAHU) is important for heating or cooling air. ACAHU consists of aluminium fins and copper tubes (Fig. 1
                        ) installed within an air-handling unit (called air handler) whose function is to heat up or cool down a mixture of outdoor air and return air from a building space. An air-duct system delivers the heated or cooled air mixture into the air-conditioned space to provide heating or cooling comfort to occupants in the building.

Aluminium sheets from an uncoiler are rolled to the fin stock area in the fin-press room. While lying flat (horizontally) with the fin press (machine), they are stamped and cut into required shapes and sizes. During the process, numerous holes are punched through each of them complete with the formation of circumferential fin collars. Next, with the fin bundle held vertically, copper tubes are inserted horizontally through the holes. The tubes are then expanded by a tube-expander to secure the fin-and-tube assembly. This is achieved by pushing a steel ball by means of hydraulic pressure through each tube of the coil. The ball expands the tubes slightly, creating a tight fit between every individual fin collar and each tube to ensure good heat conduction and effective heat transfer (for central air conditioning) from the tube to the fin. The open ends of the tubes are connected by copper U-bend fittings to form a water circuit. Two header parts are also connected to provide water (or steam) supply and return connections to the assembly. The brazing of each U-bend fitting is done around the joints (at the two ends of the U-bend) to form a leak-proof connection.

The brazing process is as follows:
                           
                              Step 1
                              The ACAHU is placed vertically on the floor (or table) to minimize bending as the operators braze in a standing position. (Placing it horizontally would be too low and require too much bending).

The single-brazing gun (SBG) (Fig. 2
                                 ) is lighted, and its knobs are adjusted to control the acetylene and oxygen flow rates. The pressure regulator knobs of the acetylene and oxygen gas tanks are both turned on to the preset 40 psi (28,123 kg/m2) and 15 psi (10,546 kg/m2) respectively.

The open ends of the copper tubes are flared for easy insertion of copper U-bends into the collars (holes).

Brazing is performed to connect all straight copper tubes and U-bends (at the joint area) using a silver alloy rod.
                                    
                                       a.
                                       The brazing operator needs to heat up all sides of a joint area with one hand holding the SBG.

When the brazing temperature is reached, the hand holding the brazing rod applies the required filler metal manually by touching the tip of the rod on the heated joint. A short length of the rod will be consumed when filler metal at the tip melts and diffuses into the joint area by capillary action.

After brazing, the completed ACAHU undergoes a leak test at a pressure of 350 psi.
                                    
                                       a.
                                       Compressed air is pumped into the ACAHU via the header part.

The ACAHU is tested under water for leakages (indicated by air bubbles rising to the water surface), which normally occur at the U-bend joint areas due to poor brazing workmanship. The leakages are located and marked.

The ACAHU is then sent back to the adjacent brazing workstation for reworking (i.e. repairing leaked portions) before being tested again using similar procedures.

The operator works on an 8-h shift with 15 rest breaks (5–10 min each), excluding lunch and two tea breaks. During the rest breaks, the operator conducts a stand-up, body-stretching exercise to increase blood circulation and avoid continuous repetitive movements over a long period. These rest breaks are possible because the operators have to wait for the completed coil to be removed and a new coil to be delivered. The ACAHUs (weighing between 100 kg and 500 kg) are delivered and removed by an overhead travelling crane without any manual handling. The operators solely undertake the brazing task the whole day without job rotation.

@&#METHOD@&#

The study group consisted of 8 brazing operators aged between 21 and 41 (mean 28.00 ± 6.52), all of whom had more than one-year experience in brazing. They were all male, with heights between 153 cm and 178 cm (165.8 ± 10.1 cm) and weighing between 56 kg and 81 kg (67.8 ± 9.4 kg). All were right-handed who used their right hand for brazing and their left to hold the filler rod. They were selected from a total of 12 brazing operators in the factory based on their consent to participate in the study.

The study comprised three stages, i.e. pre-intervention and two ergonomic interventions.

All eight operators were instructed to perform brazing following the status quo process as documented in Section 1.3 i.e. using an SBG in a standing position. The outcome measures (see Section 2.4) were taken.

All eight operators were instructed to perform brazing on the U-bends in a coil unit using a TBT (Fig. 3
                           ) instead of the SBG (Fig. 2) in the normal standing position (similar to Pre-Intervention with SBG). The TBT is identical to the SBG in weight (approximately 390 g) and effective length (37 cm) and uses the same rate of gas consumption. During the first two weeks (learning process) of using the TBT, the operators experienced a learning curve. They started with a high failure rate (“infant mortality”) where some of the copper tubes were over-burnt at the brazing joints causing several punctures. There were also cases of overfeeding of filler metal causing material wastage. After three weeks, the failure rate dropped and stabilized as they acquired the skill of brazing with the TBT. The intervention period lasted three months.

The workstation was redesigned. All eight operators were instructed to braze using the TBT while sitting on an adjustable stool with four wheels (instead of standing). The air-handler coil was placed on a steel table (76.8 cm in height) horizontally (instead of vertically) to allow easy reach. The placing of the coil in a horizontal position was performed by an existing overhead crane (without any manual handling by the operators). The operators were taught to adjust the stool according to their comfort level to minimize bending their necks and trunks. This intervention period was also three months.

Three sets of outcome measures were collected during the three stages to compare the effectiveness of the interventions vis-à-vis improving the company's business performance and operators' well-being. Some coils have more U-bends to braze than others; thus, for the purpose of comparing performance data among the three stages, only coils with the same number of U-bends (i.e. 48) were included in the data. For the comparison of work postures, the brazing height/s in any of the three stages were not affected by the coil model in production. For example, all models required brazing at the same three levels, i.e. above the shoulders, below the shoulders and near the waist in Pre-Intervention and Intervention I. Additionally, all models required brazing within the same levels (between the waist and shoulders) in Intervention II as the coil was placed horizontally on the table. For comparisons of quality, productivity and monetary cost measures, paired t tests were used.

Business performance data (Bisantz and Drury, 2005) relating to quality, productivity and monetary cost were taken from the production floor. Additionally, well-being data related to body-posture risk and MSs were collected.

For every operator, the number of leak test failures was recorded in each stage. This was calculated by the number of times an ACAHU was rejected before it was certified as having no leaks according to procedure in Step 5 of Section 1.3. The rejects reduction was calculated as follows:

A Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993) was used to measure body-posture risk. Due to limitations, only one operator's movements were recorded, resulting in three 15-min video recordings (using digital camcorder model DCR-SR45, manufactured by SONY, Japan), i.e. one for each stage. A RULA (with a set of RULA scores) was performed on each recording. The worst-case posture was taken from observations of many brazing cycles in each recording to complete the RULA scores. This was done because each recording included 30 or more repetitions (cycles) of U-bend brazing and taking many instances (snapshots) of RULA does not guarantee that it may capture the worst-case posture of all cycles.

MSs were gathered via a questionnaire (Sinclair, 2005), which was designed and pre-tested on the operators. It was adapted from Yeow and Sen's (2003) study consisting of questions on problems/discomforts faced at work, in the work environment and workstation, and training. Questions on occupational health and safety problems in Yeow and Sen's (2003) questionnaire were extended by explicitly asking the operators what pains they faced on the body (e.g. head, neck, elbows, shoulders, upper arms, lower arms, wrists, upper back, lower back, knees and others).

The study was conducted in a real-life field setting with actual production units in a factory in Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia. Interventions I and II were implemented, one at a time, to investigate each cause-and-effect relationship separately. There were no changes (other than the interventions) to the brazing process during the intervention periods (for example, rest breaks were maintained). The study group remained the same throughout the three stages. The interval between the data collection at each stage was three months to allow sufficient time for operators' training and learning of the new process. The outcome measures (including RULA and questionnaire study) were taken on the last day of Pre-intervention, Intervention I and Intervention II. The samples were taken at the beginning of the first shift to avoid work fatigue due to the repetitive task of brazing from affecting the results.

                         present the RULA scores of brazing postures, MSs and observations, and the performance data respectively.

With one hand holding a single-brazing gun (SBG) and another holding a silver alloy rod, a brazing operator needs to heat up the joint area between the flared end of the copper tube and its adjacent U-bend fitting by working the SBG flame alternately around the joint area until the brazing temperature is reached (Fig. 4
                        ). The tip of the alloy rod is then applied manually to provide the required filler metal to feed into the joint by capillary action. This procedure exhibits high-risk postures as shown by the high RULA Final Score of 7 in Table 1 (see Pre-intervention column). All eight operators reported MSs such as pain in the neck, shoulders, upper arms, wrists and lower back (see Table 2 under Pre-intervention column). For brazing joints located above shoulder height (see Fig. 5
                        ai), the high-risk postures related to high height included the extension of the neck, raising of upper arms (>90°), and raising of shoulders and abduction of arms. Additionally, there were high-risk postures related to SBG brazing movements i.e. bending of wrist, tilting of head sideways (neck bending sideways) and bending of neck in the direction of the brazing movement (neck twisting) with both arms raised. For brazing joints located below shoulder height (see Fig. 5bi), the high-risk postures related to SBG brazing persisted. Similarly, for brazing lower joints near the waist level (Fig. 5ci), the high-risk postures related to SBG brazing still occurred together with the bending of the back and neck downwards and the left wrist.


                        Tables 1–3 present the RULA scores of brazing postures, MSs and observations, and the performance data respectively three months after Intervention I. During the TBT brazing process, a brazing operator did not need to work the flame alternately around the joint area as was the case with the SBG. Instead, he performed a straight-line motion with the TBT nozzles (Fig. 6
                        ) perpendicular to each connecting joint by holding (with one hand) and moving the TBT-holding arm without bending his wrist up and down. This procedure reduced the risk of bad postures as shown by the reduction of the RULA Final Score from 7 (Pre-Intervention) to 4 (Intervention I) (see Table 1). The high-risk postures related to SBG-brazing movements (such as the bending of the right wrist up and down, the extension, side-bending and twisting of the neck, the raising of the upper arms and shoulders, and the carrying and abduction of the arms) were no longer present in the TBT brazing at all three levels i.e. above shoulder height (see Fig. 5aii), below shoulder height (see Fig. 5bii), and near the waist level (see Fig. 5cii). Table 2 shows a reduction in three types of MSs, i.e. pain in the right wrist (100%), upper arms (87.5%) and shoulders (87.5%). However, the bending of the neck, left wrist and back still persisted for TBT brazing near the waist level as shown in Fig. 5cii. There was no reduction in pain in these three areas (see Table 2). The results in Table 3 show notable business performance outcomes, i.e. 116% productivity increase (from the reduction of brazing cycle time), US$65,000 cost savings (from the reduction of silver alloy usage), and 49.8% quality improvement (from the reduction of leak test failures).


                        Tables 1–3 present the RULA scores of brazing postures, MSs and observations, and the performance data respectively three months after Intervention II. Comparison of Intervention II with Intervention I showed further improvements in postures as shown by the reduction of the RULA Final Score from 4 (Intervention I) to 3 (Intervention II) (see Table 1). The bad postures in brazing near the waist level during Intervention I were no longer present in Intervention II due to the improved reach as shown in Fig. 7
                        . With a slight push of the wheeled stool by means of the hip, the brazing operator holding the TBT was able to move himself from one corner of the brazing table to the middle or to the other corner with ease. As the coil units were placed horizontally on the table, all U-bend joints subjected to brazing were located at a suitable working height (below the shoulders and above waist level) for brazing in a sitting position. (Note that operators do not sit all the time but stand during rest breaks). The operators did not need to raise their arms and shoulders (as there were no high joints) or bend the left wrist (as there were no low joints). There were also further reductions in MSs (see Table 2) i.e. pain in the neck (100%), left wrist (100%) and lower back (62.5%). Additionally, business performance outcomes improved (see Table 3), i.e. productivity was higher by 24%, cost savings increased by US$14,000, and quality improved by 9.1%.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

There were significant improvements in the operators' well-being. The pain in the neck, shoulders, upper arms, wrists and lower back among the operators in Pre-Intervention was reduced with the improved working conditions in Intervention II and reduction of exposure to high-risk postures. During Pre-Intervention, the brazing task required poor work postures of raising the arms and shoulders, bending, twisting and extending the neck, bending both wrists up and down and bending the back. After Intervention II, these postures were eliminated. Additionally, there were improved business performance outcomes as shown by the tremendous cost savings in filler material, increase in productivity and improvement in quality. From the cost accounting figures, US$700 was invested for the modification of three SBGs to TBTs, the acquisition of three adjustable stools with wheels, and the operators' training (including the cost of failures during the initial learning period). There was no additional capital expenditure as the existing overhead travelling crane was used to place the ACAHU in a horizontal position. This was performed fast and did not affect productivity as it was done during the operators' rest breaks. The return on investment (ROI) was 113 times (US$79,000/US$700) for the first year. As such, the investment was indeed a fraction of the benefits reaped in terms of business performance outcomes and operators' well-being.

This study focused on ergonomics problems in the brazing process, which resulted in improved quality and productivity (Q&P), better OHS and remarkable cost savings. Many ergonomics studies in process innovations have also produced similar positive results, e.g., Yeow and Sen's (2003, 2006) and Sen and Yeow's (2003) ergonomics studies in the printed circuit assembly processes resulted in quality improvement (through the reduction of 32.2% defects), productivity increase (by 3.88 times) and better OHS. Erdinc and Yeow (2011) analysed prior literature of three ergonomics studies conducted in the assembly, metal folding and machine sewing processes and found 44%, 46% and 51% reduction in defects respectively. Similarly, this study conducted in an air-handler manufacturing plant showed a significant reduction in U-bend joint leaks, and hence significantly improved brazing quality through a reduction of 58.9% in rejects (Table 3). Juslén et al. (2007) found a 50% improvement in productivity through ergonomics principles applied in electronics manufacturing processes. Other recent ergonomics studies also showed significant productivity improvements, including Hemphälä and Eklund's (2013) study of the mail sorting process, Sundin et al.'s (2011) of a recycling center's sorting process, and Tompa et al.'s (2013) of the textile manufacturing process. Similarly, in this study, there was a large increase in productivity by 140% (Table 3). Vogel et al. (2013) found a reduction in MSs and sick leave after process innovation (job rotation) in meat cutting. Similarly, this study found a reduction in discomfort (e.g. MSs) after process innovations in the brazing task.

Successful integration of ergonomics in production processes can culminate in Q&P improvements regardless of the type of industry (Eklund, 2000; Caroly et al., 2010; Erdinc and Yeow, 2011; Eklund and Yeow, 2015). As many problems in the industrial world are composite in nature, where ergonomics and Q&P are involved, often there is a correlation between them. For example, several cases presented by Eklund showed that problem-solving in production with the application of ergonomics led to Q&P improvements eventually (Eklund, 2000; Hemphälä and Eklund, 2013; Sundin et al., 2011). Goggins et al.'s (2008) study also reached a similar conclusion. The research on the benefits of ergonomics through literature reviews found that Q&P improvements are consequences of ergonomic improvements (Eklund and Yeow, 2015). Furthermore, Womack et al. (2009) conducted ergonomics studies in manufacturing workstations and found improvements in Q&P, while maintaining a low level of risk of MS injuries. Finally, Escorpizo (2008) presented a clear relationship between ergonomics and productivity.

Ergonomics contributes to business performance. Dul and Neumann (2009) and Dul et al. (2012) emphasized that ergonomics can contribute to company strategies and business goals in terms of cost savings (in business performance outcomes) and not just for reasons of improving OHS (in well-being outcomes). Many studies (Maudgalya et al., 2008; Yeow and Sen, 2003, 2006; Sen and Yeow, 2003; Abrahamsson, 2000) have reported the effectiveness of the use of ergonomics for process innovation. For example, studies by Tompa et al. (2013) and (2009) in the apparel and automobile parts manufacturing processes found improvements in OHS and recorded 5.5 and 10.6 benefit-to-cost ratios respectively on ergonomics investments. Similarly, this study in coil brazing found that besides having well-being outcomes such as a reduction in MSs, there were business performance outcomes in terms of a huge cost savings and ROI, improvement in quality and an increase in productivity. This shows that ergonomic intervention, contrary to what is commonly believed, is a good investment rather than mere expenditure (Yeow and Sen, 2003; Dul and Neumann, 2009).

Intervention II results show that one brazing operator had pain in both upper arms and shoulders. During the interviews, it was found that the operator had inherent chronic musculoskeletal disorder in those areas. Three operators (out of 8) complained of pain in the lower back despite their seated brazing posture throughout the coil-brazing task with a TBT. It was found that their stools were no longer adjustable (due to malfunction) and too high, forcing them to bend their backs while brazing.

Only a small sample size (i.e. 8) was considered in the study because of the limited number of brazing operators (i.e. 12) in the factory. Only three RULA assessments were conducted on one operator. This is similar to limitations in many field experiments such as Yeow and Sen's (2006) experiments on component insertion lines due to the limited number of manual operators in the factory. Therefore, large sample size intervention studies could not be conducted. Despite this inability to generalize, this study has value as it provides exploratory results. As there were too few operators doing the brazing task, it was impossible to carry out controlled experiments for both Interventions I and II. However, assessment interviews were carried out with the coil line manager, two production engineers, two supervisors and all eight brazing operators involved, all of whom reported no external changes during the implementation of the two interventions. Hence, it was concluded that the results obtained and deductions made were of direct relation to the two interventions. As shown in Table 1, only one operator was measured for RULA due to technical problems. Even though there is no information on the variability of the operators, the original intent of RULA analysis has been achieved i.e. to support the notion that there are posture improvements with the use of the TBT. Additionally, even with the RULA Final Scores reduced from 7 (Pre-Intervention) to 3 (Intervention II), two risks present required further investigation. (1) The use of a TBT required a slight wrist bending from the midline (as shown in Fig. 7). Since it was a slight bend and the operators no longer complained of pain in the wrist, no further action was taken. (2) The brazing task was repetitive as the operators brazed more than 4 U-bends per minute. Future studies will address these issues by taking a larger sample size to investigate the variability among the operators, and study the introduction of job enrichment, enlargement and rotation to reduce the time spent on brazing and thus minimize these risk factors. Lastly, the economic analysis in monetary units is related to the currency exchange rate of Malaysia; thus, the figures in US dollars (converted from Ringgit Malaysia) may not be valid in another country.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The study improved ergonomics in the brazing process of ACAHU through two interventions i.e. the conversion from an SBG to a TBT brazing method, and the change of brazing posture from a standing position to sitting on an adjustable mobile stool. Both interventions were found to be highly effective as there were improvements in the well-being of the operators (with a reduction of MSs) and business performance outcomes (improvements in Q&P and cost savings). The interventions were low-cost but had a very high ROI (>100 times). The TBT tool is not patented and can be fabricated/converted from an SBG at a low cost without royalty payments. The interventions can be replicated in other ACAHU factories as most of them share similar brazing processes as documented in Section 1.3. The factories can adopt them as an investment for improved business performance outcomes and well-being of workers.
