                  Background
                  This paper describes use of Prony’s method as a filter applied to multifocal visual-evoked-potential (mfVEP) signals. Prony’s method can be viewed as an extension of Fourier analysis that allows a signal to be decomposed into a linear combination of functions with different amplitudes, damping factors, frequencies and phase angles.
               
               
                  Method
                  By selecting Prony method parameters, a frequency filter has been developed which improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Three different criteria were applied to data recorded from control subjects to produce three separate datasets: unfiltered raw data, data filtered using the traditional method (fast Fourier transform: FFT), and data filtered using Prony’s method.
               
               
                  Results
                  Filtering using Prony’s method improved the signals’ original SNR by 44.52%, while the FFT filter improved the SNR by 33.56%. The extent to which signal can be separated from noise was analysed using receiver–operating–characteristic (ROC) curves. The area under the curve (AUC) was greater in the signals filtered using Prony’s method than in the original signals or in those filtered using the FFT.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  filtering using Prony’s method improves the quality of mfVEP signal pre-processing when compared with the original signals, or with those filtered using the FFT.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since development of the multifocal visual-evoked-potential (mfVEP) recording technique [1], it has been possible to obtain signals that reflect electrical activity in the primary visual cortex in response to stimuli in various sectors of the visual field. Results obtained by analysing mfVEP signals show that it is a valid tool for assessment of visual function in patients with glaucoma [2], amblyopia [3], optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis [4,5] and other pathologies that affect the visual pathway.

As is the case with other electrophysiological recordings, mfVEP signals are contaminated by noise. In contrast-reversing stimulus, mfVEP signals’ amplitude is in the order of nanovolts (although in the case of pattern-pulse stimulus [6] it can be in the order of microvolts), and may even be essentially zero in some locations in control subjects due to local folding of the cortex [7]. Sources of contamination may include the EEG’s alpha waves, other physiological signals emitted by the patient (muscle-tension-associated noise[2], ECG, EOG, etc.), or interference from the power grid or from other electronic equipment.

Very few papers investigate the influence of mfVEP signal pre-processing techniques. In some cases, the signals only undergo the band-pass filtering set by the amplifiers: cut-off frequencies of 3–100Hz [5,8,9], 1–100Hz [10,11] and 1–20Hz [12,13]. In other papers after the hardware filter a digital filter based on fast Fourier transform is applied, with different cut-off frequencies depending of the work: 1–30Hz [14], 3–30Hz [15,16] and 3–35Hz [17,18].

Filtering is essential when performing patient diagnosis based on the results of signal classification. Prony’s method [19] can be viewed as an extension of Fourier analysis that allows a signal to be decomposed into a linear combination of functions with different amplitudes, damping factors, frequencies and phase angles. Prony’s method has been widely applied to electrophysiological signals [20–24]. It is a natural transformation for impulse responses since it uses damped sinusoids as a basis and therefore representation is efficient in terms of the number of coefficients required. Another advantage is that Prony modelling produces higher frequency resolution than simple FFT methods due to its reliance on autoregressive modelling [25]. It is remarkable that the transient nature of evoked potentials is more suited to modelling as a sum of damped sinusoids in time [26].

To the best of our knowledge, Prony’s method has not been used to filter mfVEP signals. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the contribution that filtering in the Prony domain makes to improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of mfVEP signals obtained from healthy subjects.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of hospitals affiliated with the University of Alcalá and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided informed consent.

The control group consisted of mfVEP signals obtained from 48 eyes in 24 healthy subjects ranging in age from 23 to 38 (mean age 30.20±7.55 years) – 10 males and 14 females – with normal neurological and ophthalmologic examination results.

Two 7-min recordings were obtained from monocular stimulation of each eye using the VERIS 5.9 software (Electro-Diagnostic Imaging, San Mateo, USA). The authors employed the following procedure [27]: m-sequence visual stimulation (215–1 steps). Three channels of continuous VEP recordings were obtained with gold cup electrodes (impedance <2kΩ), signal amplification (gain: 105, bandwidth 3–100Hz), and a sample frequency of 1200Hz. For the midline channel, the electrodes were placed 4cm above the inion (active), at the inion (reference), and on the forehead (ground). For the other two channels, the same ground and reference electrodes were used, but the active electrodes were placed 1cm above and 4cm lateral to the inion on either side. Taking the difference between pairs of channels, three additional “derived” channels were obtained.

All analyses were performed with custom made scripts written in Matlab R12 (The MathWorks, Natick, MA).

The SNR was calculated using the noise window signal-to-noise ratio (nwSNR) method explained in detailed in [7]. Briefly, this method divides the trace X(k) (0–500ms) into two different intervals—the signal window (45–150ms), which contains the evoked potential response, and the noise window (325–430ms), which essentially contains noise. The root mean square (RMS) values in the signal and noise windows are calculated as follows:

                         is the sampling period. The classic Prony method solves (3) by using an auxiliary system of linear equations to decouple this non-linear equation. The outline of the algorithm is present in [28] and described in detail in [29].

Given that the length of the mfVEP signals is composed of N=600 samples, approximation by applying (3) obtains P=300 components. Therefore, the mfVEP signal is characterized by the parameters A
                        
                           k
                        , α

                        , (k=1,…, P=300).

As the principal information components of mfVEP signals are in low frequencies, only the lowest M frequencies are chosen for the filter output (X
                        Prony[n]), as represented in (4). Establishing the optimal value of M obtains a simpler representation, while reducing the noise is one of our major findings. The results section demonstrates the approach followed to establish the optimal value of M.

Note that frequency (ωp/2π) corresponds with Prony’s frequency, but is not an exact match for Fourier’s frequency. For example, the frequency calculated with Prony’s method can have arbitrary values and the frequency range is different for each signal.

This paper compares the quality of the output of three different processing methods:
                        
                           (a)
                           The signal resulting from averaging the two recordings (raw data). The raw data is 600 samples (or coefficients) long.

The signal resulting from filtering raw data (0–500ms, 600 samples) using a digital low-pass filter. Although it is possible to use more advanced signal-filtering options, such as a Chebyshev type 1 filter [4,30] filtering using the FFT is the most commonly employed option when processing mfVEP signals [27]. Based on both our own studies and those of other authors [31], we concluded that the best SNRS value is obtained by applying a sharp cut-off [1–20Hz] between using a discrete Fourier Transform. Under these conditions, the filtered signal (X
                              FFT) is represented by 20 coefficients. After the signal is filtered, IFFT is applied to obtain a register in time domain again with 600 samples-500ms.

The signal resulting from filtering raw data using Prony’s method. Thus, SNRS_Prony is the signal-to-noise ratio in the signal window of the trace filtered, and RMSERAW–Prony is the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the original recordings and the signal filtered using Prony’s method:

The best M value (number of components, ordered by frequency, in the Prony domain) is defined as the M value that maximizes the SNRS_Prony/RMSERAW-Prony ratio. This value represents a compromise between the SNR value of the filtered signal and the distortion between the original signal and the filtered signal. According to this criterion, the best value for our database is M=7 (28 coefficients in Prony domain). With these components, the signals are reconstructed into time domain and 600 samples-500ms length signals are obtained.


                     
                     Fig. 1 shows the mfVEP signal for channel 6, sector 2, right eye, of one of the subjects selected at random. It shows the signal without pre-processing (X
                     RAW), filtered in the frequency domain (X
                     FFT), and filtered using Prony’s method (X
                     Prony).


                     
                     Table 1 shows the principal results obtained after analysing the mfVEP signals.

The upper part of 
                     Fig. 2 shows the mean value of the SNRS obtained for each of the 24 subjects (each point is the mean of 2eyes×60sectors×6channels SNR values). For all of the signals obtained (N
                     
                        T
                     =24×2×60×6=17,280 traces), the mean value of the SNRS before filtering is SNRS_RAW=2.75±0.73 (95% CI: 2.44–3.10); when the FFT is used, the value is SNRS_FFT=3.69±0.9 (95% CI: 3.31–4.1); and if the Prony filter is used, the value is SNRS_Prony=4.04±1.00 (95% CI: 3.62–4.47). An extremely significant difference is observed between the two types of filtering (Paired t-test: P< 0.0001).

A criterion widely used to filter out low-quality recordings is to set a threshold of SNRS<=0.23 log units [32], which is equivalent to SNRS=1.7 (dashed blue line in Fig. 2). In our database, 63.88% of the unfiltered recordings would be analysable. If FFT filtering were used, 77.11% would be analysable, and if Prony’s method were used, 82.78% of the sectors would be analysable.

The method most widely used to process mfVEP signals consists of selecting from each sector the channel with the best signal-to-noise ratio in the signal window. In this case, the number of recordings available in the database amounts to 24×2×60 traces.

The lower part of Fig. 2 shows the mean value of the SNRS obtained for each of the 24 subjects, selecting for each sector the best channel (each point is the mean of 2eyes×60sectors SNR values). Among the unfiltered signals, the mean value is SNRS_RAW=4.29±1.26 (95% CI: 3.76–4.83); for the signals filtered using the FFT, it is SNRS_FFT=5.73±1.42 (95% CI: 5.12–6.33); and for the signals filtered using Prony’s method, it is SNRS_Prony=6.20±1.58 (95% CI: 5.53–6.86). For the complete set of recordings, considering the best channel, G
                        FFT%=+33.56% and G
                        Prony%=+44.52%. An extremely significant difference exists between the two types of filtering (Paired t-test p<0.0001).

In our database, and considering the best channel for each sector, without filtering, 90.93% of the visual field sectors are analysable (SNRS>1.7); with FFT filtering, 96.77% are analysable; and with Prony’s method, 97.91% are analysable.

One question that arises is whether Prony’s method is better than the FFT filter at distinguishing mfVEP signals from noise in normal subjects. To address this, the SNRS and SNRN values defined in (2) are used. 
                        Fig. 3 shows the frequency distribution of the values of SNRS (red) and SNRN (blue) for 2880 records (24 individuals ×2 eyes ×60 mfVEP recordings from the best channel).

The noise and signal distributions overlap. Therefore, some of the mfVEP responses from the signal window cannot be distinguished from noise. The capacity of the various methods to distinguish between signal and noise has been evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. An ROC curve shows sensitivity against the False Positive Rate (FPR=1−specificity). For all of the thresholds available between min(SNRN) and max(SNRS), the sensitivity (fraction of cases in which SNRS>Threshold) and specificity (fraction of cases in which SNRN<Threshold) values are calculated according to (6) and (7):

Calculating an AUC value for each subject obtains the following results: AUCRAW=0.9909±0.0191 (95%CI: 0.9837–0.999), AUCFFT=0.9915±0.0183 (95%CI: 0.9838–0.9993) and AUCProny=0.9952±0.0125 (95%CI: 0.9901–1.000), with the mfVEP-Prony showing the largest area.

The difference between AUCRAW and AUCFFT was not statistically significant (P=0.081, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test). However, there was a difference between AUCFFT and AUCProny (P=0.001) and between AUCRAW and AUCProny (P=0.000).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The principal conclusion of this paper is that filtering healthy subjects’ mfVEP signals using Prony’s method improves the SNRS to a greater extent than filtering them in the frequency domain. As a consequence, this obtains a greater number of analysable visual-field sectors, making this method better at distinguishing mfVEP signals from noise than the standard filter method.

This paper demonstrates that M=7 components of the Prony filter are sufficient to achieve a good approximation of the original signals in healthy subjects.

The RAW signal is represented by 600 coefficients; the signal filtered using the FFT is represented by 20 coefficients; and the signal filtered using Prony’s method is represented by 28=7×4 coefficients, which is slightly higher than the FFT representation.

If the quality of the mfVEP signal is quantified by its SNRS (analysing the six channels available per sector), for the overall database use of Prony’s method achieves an improvement of G
                     Prony%=+46.90%, while the Fourier filter achieves an improvement of G
                     FFT%=+34.18%. Therefore, the advantage of using Prony’s method over the Fourier filter can be quantified as +12.72%. These results mean that by using Prony’s method the percentage of traces that exceed the minimum value of SNRS>1.7 is 82.78% of visual field sectors, while using the FFT filter produces a figure of 77.11%.

If for each sector the channel with the best SNRS (best channel) is selected, use of Prony’s method achieves a gain of G
                     Prony%=+44.52%, while use of the Fourier filter achieves a gain of G
                     FFT%=+33.56%. In this case, with Prony’s method the proportion of sectors with signals that exceed the SNRS>1.7 threshold stands at 97.91%, while with the FFT filter the proportion stands at 96.77%. As is to be expected, the SNRS is greater when the best channel is selected. However, the gain obtained by selecting the best channel is smaller with both types of filtering than when 6 channels from each sector are considered. This effect is undoubtedly due to the fact that the signals with the best SNR in each channel are close to their upper quality limit and, as a consequence, the percentage gain is smaller.

Analysis based on ROC curves shows that Prony’s method reduced the overlap between signal and noise distribution. Based on AUC criteria, Prony’s method obtains the best results (AUCProny=0.9952±0.0125) when compared against values of AUCFFT=0.9915±0.0183 and AUCRAW=0.9909±0.0191. No significant difference exists between AUCRAW and AUCFFT (the traditional processing method). However, a difference does exist between AUCFFT and AUCProny and between AUCRAW and AUCProny.

The authors believe that the moderate margins for improvement in signal quality and in the number of analysable sectors according to their SNR is due to the fact that they have been recorded in healthy subjects. Therefore, they are generally of good quality and, consequently, the margin for improvement is very small. The next step would be to confirm that applying Prony’s method to patients with various pathologies achieves a greater gain in the parameters that define signal quality.

Several papers confirm that the SNR of this study’s database is appropriate. For instance, [27] obtain the following formula for the SNR according to subject age: SNRS=5.1−(0.01×years), valid for the best channels of each sector and applied to data filtered using the Fourier transform (cut-off at 35Hz). In their database, SNRS=5.59 (mean age=49.0), a similar value to the one obtained in our signals (SNRS=5.73) after filtering them with the FFT (cut-off at 20Hz).

In [33] research the advantages of a prediction method based on 40 virtual electrodes. Using a database of 15 healthy participants, the standard method (bandwidth of 1Hz–2kHz) obtains an SNRS of 3.87±1.08, while with the prediction method the SNRS is 4.36±1.03, representing a gain of +12.66%. Using Prony’s method, and when analysing the best channels, we obtained an improvement in the SNRS (G
                     Prony%=+44.52%) greater than that obtained using the prediction method.

ROC analysis has been used previously to evaluate the overlap between SNR distribution in the signal and noise windows. For instance, Meigen and Kramer i 
                     [34] calculate the AUC of a sample of 30 subjects, positioning the four electrodes (A, B, C, D) within a 4-cm radius of the inion. Our original data (AUCRAW=0.9909±0.0191) exceed the best value obtained by Meigen and Kramer (0.964±0.005), making it difficult to establish a direct comparison. In their paper, and using a single channel, they obtain a best value of AUC=0.933±0.005 for A–B. In our case (AUCProny=0.9952±0.0125), we exceed that value. This is undoubtedly due to the different position of the electrodes and to the fact that we selected the best channel of the six available, while Meigen and Kramer obtained all their data from a single channel.

Ishikawa et al. [35] study a population of healthy Japanese subjects, obtaining an AUC of 0.983±0.027 for 54 left eyes and one of 0.983±0.017 for 56 right eyes. Various channels are combined after obtaining them from electrodes positioned 4cm above, left and right of the inion and 2.5cm below the inion (ground electrode on the left earlobe). This value is comparable to that obtained in this paper using the FFT (AUCFFT=0.9915±0.0183).

Nakamura et al. [36] study patients with glaucoma, obtaining for 62 control subjects a mean SNRS value of 3.09. They also analyse ROC curves, obtaining an AUC value of 0.98±0.02. This result can be compared with the results achieved in this paper using FFT filtering (AUCFFT=0.9915±0.0183), although the cut-off frequencies are different (35Hz and 20Hz) in our study.

Our results exceed those obtained in [18] when using a PCA method to filter the signals. By selecting four principal components, they obtain a value of SNR=5, which is lower than the one obtained in this paper using Prony filtering.

Several lines of research merit further investigation to ascertain if it is possible to improve on the results achieved here. For example, in the Prony filter (Eq. (4)), it would be interesting to see if better results are obtained by setting a cut-off frequency and selecting components below that value rather than by selecting a fixed number of components. Other mfVEP signal-filtering options also merit analysis, e.g. wavelet methods, classic principle components/single value decomposition and hierarchical decomposition. [30].

In conclusion, we consider that this mfVEP-signal filtering method, although limited by the small sample size and by the fact that the research was carried out on healthy subjects, has great potential for use in diagnosing and monitoring visual pathway pathologies in patients with demyelinating and ischaemic diseases.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

Due to development of the multifocal visual-evoked-potential (mfVEP) recording technique, it has been possible to obtain signals that reflect electrical activity in the primary visual cortex in response to stimuli in various sectors of the visual field. As is the case with other electrophysiological recordings, mfVEP signals are contaminated by noise. The amplitude of this type of signals is in the order of nanovolts–microvolts, and may even be essentially zero in some locations in control subjects due to local folding of the cortex. Sources of contamination may include the EEG’s alpha waves, other physiological signals emitted by the patient (muscle-tension-associated noise, ECG, EOG, etc.), or interference from the power grid or from other electronic equipment.

Filtering is essential when performing patient diagnosis based on the results of signal classification. Very few papers investigate the influence of mfVEP signal filter techniques. This paper describes use of Prony’s method as a filter applied to multifocal visual-evoked-potential (mfVEP) signals. Prony’s method can be viewed as an extension of Fourier analysis that allows a signal to be decomposed into a linear combination of functions with different amplitudes, damping factors, frequencies and phase angles. To the best of our knowledge, Prony’s method has not been used to filter mfVEP signals.

By selecting Prony method parameters, a frequency filter has been developed which improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Three different criteria were applied to data recorded from subjects (48 eyes in 24 healthy subjects ranging in age from 23 to 38) to produce three separate datasets: unfiltered raw data, data filtered using the traditional method (fast Fourier transform: FFT), and data filtered using Prony’s method. Filtering using Prony’s method improved the signals’ original SNR by 44.52%, while the FFT filter improved the SNR by 33.56%. The extent to which signal can be separated from noise was analysed using receiver–operating–characteristic (ROC) curves. The area under the curve (AUC) was greater in the signals filtered using Prony’s method than in the original signals or in those filtered using the FFT.

The principal conclusion of this paper is that filtering healthy subjects’ mfVEP signals using Prony’s method improves the SNRS to a greater extent than filtering them in the frequency domain. As a consequence, this obtains a greater number of analysable visual-field sectors, making this method better at distinguishing mfVEP signals from noise than the standard filter method. The authors believe that the moderate margins for improvement in signal quality and in the number of analysable sectors according to their SNR is due to the fact that they have been recorded in healthy subjects, so the next step would be to confirm that applying Prony’s method to patients with various pathologies achieves a greater gain in the parameters that define signal quality.
