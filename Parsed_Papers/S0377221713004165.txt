                  Cross-efficiency in data envelopment analysis (DEA) models is an effective way to rank decision-making units (DMUs). The common methods to aggregate cross-efficiency do not consider the preference structure of the decision maker (DM). When a DM’s preference structure does not satisfy the “additive independence” condition, a new aggregation method must be proposed. This paper uses the evidential-reasoning (ER) approach to aggregate the cross-efficiencies obtained from cross-evaluation through the transformation of the cross-efficiency matrix to pieces of evidence. This paper provides a new method for cross-efficiency aggregation and a new way for DEA models to reflect a DM’s preference or value judgments. Additionally, this paper presents examples that demonstrate the features of cross-efficiency aggregation using the ER approach, including an empirical example of the evaluation practice of 16 basic research institutes in Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 2010 that illustrates how the ER approach can be used to aggregate the cross-efficiency matrix produced from DEA models.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cross-efficiency in data envelopment analysis (DEA) models, proposed by ħ0110h0110h0110h0110protectSexton et al.1986, has proved to be an effective way to rank decision-making units (DMUs). This method is based on allowing the overall efficiency of a DMU to be evaluated by self-evaluation and peer evaluation. These results are used to obtain a cross-efficiency matrix, in which the diagonal members show the DEA efficiency scores of the DMUs and the off-diagonal cells give the cross-efficiency scores. Aggregation of the cross-efficiencies is then used to rank the DMUs. Cross-efficiencies can provide more information than relative efficiency scores of DMUs that are provided by the objective function in DEA models. ħ0110h0110h0110h0110protectSexton et al.1986 used the average of the cross-efficiency scores in each row of the cross-efficiency matrix to perform the cross-evaluation. Cross-evaluation has two principle advantages: (1) it provides a unique ordering of the DMUs and (2) it eliminates unrealistic weight schemes without requiring the use of weight restrictions from application area experts (ħ0015h0015h0015h0015protectAnderson et al.2002). Because alternative input and output weights exist, ħ0055h0055h0055h0055protectDoyle and Green1994 introduced aggressive and benevolent models, which minimize or maximize, respectively, the efficiency of the composite DMU constructed from the other DMUs compared to DMU
                     0.

Cross-efficiency in DEA models has been applied to many areas, such as flexible manufacturing systems (ħ0120h0120h0120h0120protectShang and Sueyoshi1995), preference voting and project ranking (ħ0070h0070h0070h0070protectGreen et al.1996), industrial robot selection (ħ0020h0020h0020h0020protectBaker and Talluri1997), Olympic rankings and benchmarking (ħ0150h0150h0150h0150protectWu et al.2009).


                     ħ0125h0125h0125h0125protectWang and Chin2011 noted that “Existing researches on the cross-efficiency evaluation are mainly focused on either its applications or the calculation of cross-efficiency matrix. Little attention has been paid to the aggregation process of cross-efficiencies. The most extensively used approach is to aggregate cross-efficiencies with equal weights.” They proposed the use of ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator weights for cross-efficiency aggregation. Additionally, ħ0130h0130h0130h0130protectWang et al.2011 investigated how to determine the weights in cross-efficiency evaluation. ħ0135h0135h0135h0135protectWang et al.2011 used ideal and anti-ideal DMUs to aggregate the cross-efficiencies. ħ0085h0085h0085h0085protectLiang et al.2008 proposed the concept of game cross-efficiency and developed a game cross-efficiency model, which treats each DMU as a player. ħ0095h0095h0095h0095protectRödder and Reucher2011 considered that these DMUs should use the cross-efficiency concept to improve their future productivity, and proposed a consensual peer-based DEA model with optimized cross-efficiencies.

None of the above-mentioned methods to aggregate cross-efficiency considers the preference structure of the decision maker (DM). The DM’s preference structure can be reflected through the DM’s value judgments. However, the features of the DM’s preference structure can affect the DM’s value judgments. ħ0010h0010h0010h0010protectAllen et al.1997 argued that “The concept of value judgments, albeit frequently discussed, is lacking a formal definition in the context of DEA, and therefore value judgments are considered as ‘logical constructs, incorporated within an efficiency assessment study, reflecting the Decision Makers’ preferences in the process of assessing efficiency.”
                  

The DM’s preference structure can be verified through a mutual preferential independence test (ħ0035h0035h0035h0035protectChen1997). The weighted-average method requires the preference structure of decision-maker (DM) to meet a series of conditions, particularly the condition named “additive independence” (ħ0060h0060h0060h0060protectFishburn1970). When a DM’s preference structure does not meet the “additive independence” condition, a new aggregation method should be proposed. The method using ideal and anti-ideal DMUs is essentially a linear model. Although game cross-efficiency model treats each DMU as a player, it ignores the DM’s preference.

This paper uses a new nonlinear method, termed the evidential-reasoning (ER) approach, to aggregate the cross-efficiencies obtained from cross-evaluation through the transformation of the cross-efficiency matrix to the data. The ER approach is different from most conventional multiple attribute decision analysis (MADA) methods, and describes each attribute at an alternative by a distributed assessment via a belief structure. Also, the ER approach provides a new procedure for aggregating multiple attributes based on the distributed assessment framework and the evidence combination rule of Dempster–Shafer (D–S) evidence theory. It has been used in many real MADA problems, such as engineering design assessment (ħ0170h0170h0170h0170protectYang and Singh1994; ħ0175h0175h0175h0175protectYang and Sen1997), group decision-making ħ0040h0040h0040h0040protectChin et al.2009a(Chin et al., 2009a), environmental impact assessment (ħ0140h0140h0140h0140protectWang et al.2006), and the Quality Function Deployment assessment ħ0045h0045h0045h0045protectChin et al.2009b(Chin et al., 2009b).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews cross-efficiency in DEA models and basic aggregation methods. Section 3 introduces the Dempster–Shafer (D–S) evidence theory and the steps of the ER approach. Section 4 proposes the use of the ER approach for cross-efficiency aggregation. Section 5 provides an illustrative example to demonstrate the potential applications of the ER approach in cross-efficiency aggregation, particularly when the preference structure of the decision-maker does not meet the “additive independence” condition. Section 6 concludes this paper.

Because alternative input and output weights exist, ħ0110h0110h0110h0110protectSexton et al.1986 suggested introducing a secondary goal to compute the unique efficiency score for DMUs. ħ0055h0055h0055h0055protectDoyle and Green1994 proposed aggressive and benevolent models, which minimize or maximize, respectively, the efficiency of the composite DMU constructed for other DMUs as compared to DMU
                     0. The most commonly used secondary goal is the aggressive model, which minimizes the efficiency of the composite DMU constructed for n
                     −1 DMUs. The aggressive model is given as

                      is the CCR efficiency of DMU
                     0 derived from the CCR model.

The benevolent formulation for cross-efficiency evaluation is achieved by putting max in the objective function of Model (6) in place of min. See Model (7) for details.

                      is the CCR efficiency of DMU
                     0 derived from the CCR model.

If a cross-efficiency matrix is given, it must be decided how to aggregate cross-efficiencies to one score for each DMU in the next step. Several authors proposed different approaches to handle this problem (ħ0095h0095h0095h0095protectRödder and Reucher2011; ħ0155h0155h0155h0155protectWu et al.2011). Just as mentioned above, the preference structure of the decision maker (DM) is not taken into account in most of existing methods. We believe that we should consider the preference structure of DMs before aggregating the cross-efficiency. If it satisfies the “additive independent” condition, we can use linear methods. Otherwise, we should use new alternative method to aggregate cross-efficiencies. The ER approach, based on the distributed assessment framework and the evidence combination rule of D–S evidence theory, is a suitable nonlinear method and can be used to aggregate the cross-efficiencies obtained from cross-evaluation to one score for each DMU through the transformation of the cross-efficiencies to the distributed assessment with a belief structure. Using the ER approach, we can present the cross-efficiencies by a distributed assessment, thereby showing the diversity of cross-efficiencies. The use of the ER approach is justified because it only assumes that cross-efficiencies for a DMU are generated in a way independent of whether cross-efficiencies for other DMUs are known or not and that the cross-efficiencies are conjunctively combined to obtain a joint score for the DMU. This is an appropriate assumption. However, it is not appropriate to assume that cross-efficiencies for one DMU could be generated in isolation from other DMUs as cross-efficiencies for all DMUs are generated from the same cross-efficiency matrix.

Research on evidence theory was first conducted by ħ0050h0050h0050h0050protectDempster1967, and ħ0115h0115h0115h0115protectShafer1976 formalized evidence theory. This formulation is termed the Dempster–Shafer (D–S) theory of evidence. The main feature of the D–S theory is that it has the ability to describe uncertainty and ignorance, which is implied in the mass function and reserved in the process of evidence aggregation.

                        Θ
                      is the power set of Θ. The assigned probability m(A)>0, which is called the probability mass, measures the belief exactly assigned to A and represents how strongly the evidence supports A. All of the assigned probabilities sum to unity, and there is no belief in the empty set (Φ). The probability assigned to Θ is called the degree of ignorance. Each subset {A
                     ⊆
                     Θ∣m(A)>0} is called a focal element of m.

The core of evidence theory is Dempster’s rule of combination, by which evidence from different sources is aggregated. The rule assumes that information sources are independent, and it uses the following equation to aggregate multiple belief structures:

                     ħ0115h0115h0115h0115protectShafer1976 proved that Dempster’s rule of aggregation satisfies commutativity and associativity.


                     ħ0195h0195h0195h0195protectZadeh1984 noted that Dempster’s rule could lead to counterintuitive results when used to aggregate conflicting evidence. The direct use of the aggregation rule results in an exponential increase in the computational complexity (ħ0025h0025h0025h0025protectBuchanan and Shortliffe1984). ħ0170h0170h0170h0170protectYang and Singh1994 developed operational algorithms for evidence aggregation that can reduce the computational complexity to linear time by utilizing the characteristics of the evidence combination process based on the evaluation analysis model. Subsequently, the frame of the evidential-reasoning approach was proposed and improved by ħ0170h0170h0170h0170protectYang and Singh1994, ħ0165h0165h0165h0165protectYang and Sen1994, and ħ0185h0185h0185h0185protectYang and Xu2002a. Many theoretical studies and applications in the ER approach have been produced, and these include the ER approach with interval belief degrees (ħ0145h0145h0145h0145protectWang et al.2006), the ER approach with interval uncertainty (ħ0160h0160h0160h0160protectXu et al.2006), the ER approach with probabilistic and fuzzy uncertainties (ħ0180h0180h0180h0180protectYang et al.2006), the ER approach with both fuzzy and interval uncertainty (ħ0075h0075h0075h0075protectGuo et al.2009), environmental impact assessment (ħ0140h0140h0140h0140protectWang et al.2006) and quality function deployment ħ0040h0040h0040h0040protectChin et al.2009a, ħ0045h0045h0045h0045protectChin et al.2009b(Chin et al., 2009a,b).

The ER approach was developed for MADA on the basis of decision theory, in particular utility theory, and D–S evidence theory. It uses weighted belief degrees to establish an innovative weighted belief distribution for profiling a piece of evidence, which generalizes the basic probability assignment method of D–S evidence theory. The ER approach employs the orthogonal sum operation on the weighted belief distributions to combine multiple pieces of evidence, in which each piece of evidence can play a limited role relative to its weight (ħ0170h0170h0170h0170protectYang and Singh1994; ħ0185h0185h0185h0185protectYang and Xu2002a). The evidence combination process of the ER approach is similar to Dempsters rule of D–S evidence theory in that they both employ the orthogonal sum operation for conjunctive probabilistic reasoning, although the latter does so on the belief distributions formulated directly from the basic probability assignments, thereby assuming that each piece of evidence always plays a dominant role. As such, the main difference between the ER approach and D–S evidence theory is that the former can be used to combine highly or completely conflicting evidence in the context of MADA without suffering from the well-known counter-intuitive problem of D–S evidence theory (ħ0170h0170h0170h0170protectYang and Singh1994).

Second, suppose the weights of the pieces of evidence are given by W
                     =(ω
                     1,
                     ω

                     ), where ω
                     
                        i
                      is the relative weight of the ith piece of evidence with 0⩽
                     ω
                     
                        i
                     
                     ⩽1, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ∑
                              
                              
                                 i
                                 =
                                 1
                              
                              
                                 N

                                 i
                              
                           
                           =
                           1
                        
                     . Weights have an important role in assessments and can be determined using existing methods, such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) (ħ0100h0100h0100h0100protectSaaty1977, ħ0105h0105h0105h0105protectSaaty1980) and the entropy method (ħ0065h0065h0065h0065protectHwang and Yoon1981; ħ0155h0155h0155h0155protectWu et al.2011).

Third, we consider that the efficiency scores of DMUs in the DEA model reflect the degree of best possible relative efficiency. If a DMU is evaluated to have the best possible relative efficiency of unity, then it is said to be DEA efficient; otherwise, it is said to be DEA inefficient.

Here, we reconsider the efficiency scores of DMUs in the DEA model from another point of view. Suppose there are two distinctive evaluation grades defined that collectively provide a complete set of standards for assessing a piece of evidence and are represented as
                        
                           (27)
                           
                              Θ
                              =
                              {
                              
                                 
                                    H
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              ,

                                    2
                                 
                              
                              }
                              ,
                           
                        
                     where H
                     1 represents “efficient” and H
                     2 represents “not efficient”. Note that “not efficient” is different from “inefficient”. “Not efficient” reflects the worst possible relative efficiency of DMU to be evaluated, which represents an efficiency score of zero. These two evaluation grades are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive for the evaluation. The efficiency scores of the DMUs can be viewed as the distributions on “efficient” and “not efficient”. For example, if the efficiency score of one DMU is 0.8, then the distribution is {(Efficient,0.8), (Not
                     
                     efficient,0.2) }, which means that the evaluated DMU is efficient with 80% of the possibilities and is not efficient with 20% of the possibilities.

The ER approach is a nonlinear aggregation method. For interests of comparison, we give a simple example with two pieces of evidence to show the differences between the ER approach and the average method. To illustrate the features of these two methods, let us fix the first piece of evidence as e
                     1
                     ={(H
                     1,0.5), (H
                     2,0.5)}. We give the second group of multiple pieces of evidence as

Suppose the weights of these two groups of evidence are equal (0.5,0.5) and all sets of cross-efficiencies of DMUs are generated in an independent way. In other words, the generation of one set of cross-efficiencies for DMUs does not depend on whether other sets of cross-efficiencies are known or not. Thus we have the following distributions aggregated using the ER approach and the average methods as shown in Table 3
                     . Fig. 1
                      illustrates the differences of two distributions aggregated using the ER approach and the average method. From Fig. 1, we can see that the ER approach is quasi-linear when two pieces of evidence are of equal importance and amplifies the amplitude of variation of H
                     1 and H
                     2, especially in the case of aggregating pieces of evidence with large difference of distributions. Perhaps this feature could be interpreted as an evidence-enhancement effect in the process of aggregating cross-efficiencies in DEA models. Indeed, this is a key feature of the ER approach, in the sense that there will be a greater degree of belief for a proposition such as H
                     1 if more pieces of independent evidence are accumulated to jointly support the proposition, and with the accumulation of evidence the increase of the belief is normally nonlinear, unless the pieces of evidence are mutually exclusive. For the type of cross-efficiency analysis discussed in this paper, it is inappropriate to assume that one set of cross-efficiencies could be generated in isolation of other cross-efficiencies from the same DEA model, or they could be mutually exclusive. Rather, all cross-efficiencies are generated on the basis of the same DEA model as is the case in this paper. On the other hand, it seems appropriate to say that generating a set of cross-efficiencies from a DEA model does not depend on whether the other cross-efficiencies of the same DEA model are already known or not. As such, it seems appropriate to apply the ER approach to combine cross-efficiencies, rather than a linear or additive method.

In this section, we present some illustrative examples on cross-efficiency aggregation in DEA models using the evidential-reasoning approach. First, we compare two methods for cross-efficiency aggregation, which are the average method (ħ0110h0110h0110h0110protectSexton et al.1986) and the ER approach. Second, we will use the ER approach to aggregate cross-efficiency in a case study on the performance assessment of basic research institutes in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 2010.

In this subsection, we examine the cross-efficiency aggregation in DEA models using the average method and the ER approach through a simple example to illustrate the evidence enhancement effect in the ER approach. Suppose that there are four DMUs and the cross-efficiency matrix is as shown in Table 4
                        .

Suppose that the cross-efficiencies of these target DMUs have equal weights (1/4,1/4,1/4,1/4). Table 4 shows that the average cross-efficiencies of four DMUs are 0.6975, 0.7000, 0.2625 and 0.2600 respectively (Column 6). That is DMU2
                        ≻DMU1
                        ≻DMU3
                        ≻DMU4 when using the average method to aggregate the cross-efficiency matrix, where the symbol “≻” means “superior to.” When the preference structure of DM does not meet the “additive independence” condition, we use the ER approach to aggregate the cross-efficiency matrix with equal weights. We can find that DMU1
                        ≻DMU2
                        ≻DMU4
                        ≻DMU3(Column 7). Obviously, compared with the average method, the rankings of (DMU1, DMU2) and (DMU3, DMU4) get reversed when using the ER approach. This fact can be seen as the direct show of evidence enhancement effect. ħ0190h0190h0190h0190protectYang and Xu2002b investigated thoroughly the nonlinear features of the ER information aggregation process, which is different with the linear information aggregation methods, e.g., the average method. In this example, the cross-efficiencies are very different (see, Row 1 and Row 3) for DMU1 and DMU3. On the contrary, the cross-efficiencies of DMU2 and DMU4 are quite similar (see, Row 2 and Row 4). Just as mentioned in Section 4, the evidence-enhancement effect is stronger when large differences present in the distributions of aggregating evidences. It’s this effect that causes the rank reversals in this example.

In this subsection, we carry out a case study on cross-efficiency aggregation in DEA models using the ER approach to evaluate the relative efficiencies of 16 basic research institutes in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 2010.

Since 2005, CAS has enacted the comprehensive quality evaluation (CQE) system for the evaluation of the institutes in the CAS. Within the framework of the CQE, multiple inputs and outputs of basic research institutes in the CAS are monitored using several quantitative indicators. Here, we use the same inputs and outputs indicators as proposed in ħ0080h0080h0080h0080protectLiu et al.2011 for the basic research institutes in the CAS. The data of these indicators (2 inputs and 4 outputs), which come from the quantitative monitoring report in 2010 in CAS, are as follows.

Expen.) are often major research inputs, while research outputs are different, depending on different stakeholders’ views. The following table represents a view from the level of the Bureau of Basic-research in CAS, in which publications include international papers indexed by the Science Citation Index (SCI Pub.). High-quality papers published in top research journals (High Pub.), graduate students’ enrollment (Grad. Enroll.), and the external research funding obtained (Exter. Fund.) are the major indicators to judge performance. See Table 5
                         for details.

In this example, we use the input-based CCR–DEA model (Model 5) and the aggressive model (Model 6) to obtain the aggressive cross-efficiency matrix. We use the method proposed by ħ0005h0005h0005h0005protectAli and Seiford1993 (see Eq. (4) for details) to set the value of non-Archimedean construct ξ, and we let ξ
                        =1E−11. Table 6
                         shows the weights for the inputs and outputs in the aggressive model, which is the basis for the aggressive cross-efficiency matrix.

Please note that the weights in Table 6 cannot be zero and they are strictly positive in fact due to the constraints v
                        
                           i
                        , u
                        
                           r
                        
                        ⩾
                        ξ, i
                        =1,2,…,
                        m; r
                        =1,2,…,
                        s. But in this case study, we use zero as the replacement of a very small real number, not less than non-Archimedean construct, due to the computational accuracy. Using the weights for the inputs and outputs shown in Table 6, we can generate the aggressive cross-efficiency matrix shown in Table 7
                        .

The DM’s preference structure can be verified through a mutual preferential independence test (Chen, 1997). If the DM’s preference structure satisfies the “additive independence” condition, then we can use average cross-efficiency proposed by ħ0110h0110h0110h0110protectSexton et al.1986 to rank these 16 basic research institutes. See Table 7 for details.

Unfortunately, the DM’s preference structure failed to satisfy the “additive independence” condition after the mutual preferential independence test for the institute ranking. This failure occurred mainly because these cross-efficiency scores are generated from the same data set and are linked to each other. The ER approach requires that evidence be generated in an independent way, and it is much milder than the “additive independence” condition. In this example, each cross-efficiency score is generated from its own DEA model, whose efficiency score does not depend upon the other DEA scores. So, we can use the ER approach described in Section 4 to rank these 16 basic research institutes. We consider that there are 16 pieces of evidence for DMU

From Eq. (45), we have the following efficiency scores for the 16 basic research institutes. We used the weighted average method (ħ0125h0125h0125h0125protectWang and Chin2011) as a reference in this example. See Table 9
                         for details.

The Pearson correlation coefficient between the weighted average cross-efficiency scores and the efficiency scores obtained by the ER approach is 0.9987, which shows the rationality of aggregating cross-efficiency scores using the ER approach. The cross-efficiency scores in Table 7 are generated from the same data set and are linked to each other, which is the main reason that the DM’s preference structure failed to satisfy the “additive independence” or “mutual exclusiveness” condition after the mutual preferential independence test during institute ranking. Table 10
                         shows the Pearson correlation coefficients of different pairs of cross-efficiency vectors (columns of Table 7).

From Table 10, we can see that the Pearson correlation coefficients of most pairs of cross-efficiency vectors are relatively high (not less than 0.5). This fact can also demonstrate that the cross-efficiencies for each DMU are related to those for other DMUs. So, we can deduce that the ER approach is more suitable for cross-efficiency aggregation in the institutes’ evaluation in CAS than the weighted average method.

In Table 9, we find that the efficiency scores of the higher ranked DMUs (DMU2, DMU13, DMU14, DMU4, DMU1, DMU7, DMU15, DMU9, DMU16, DMU3, DMU6, DMU8, DMU14) calculated by weighted average method become higher when using the ER approach and that the efficiency scores of lower ranked DMUs (DMU10, DMU11, DMU12) becomes lower, which can demonstrate the evidence-enhancement effect. For example, the efficiency score of DMU4 is 0.9927 in Column 4 in Table 9, but the efficiency score of DMU2 is 0.9985 in Column 7. The efficiency score of DMU12 is the worst using weighted average cross-efficiency method. Due to the evidence-enhancement effect, the efficiency score is lower when using the ER approach than using weighted average cross-efficiency method. The efficiency scores of DMU12 are 0.3176 and 0.3090, respectively, in Columns 4 and 7. DMU1, DMU4 and DMU14 rank 5(0.9174), 4(0.9457) and 3(0.9533), respectively, when using the weighted average cross-efficiency method but rank 4(0.9816), 3(0.9884) and 5(0.9795), respectively, when using the ER approach.

When we use the input-based CCR–DEA model to evaluate the 16 basic research institutes, the efficiency scores of DMU1, DMU2, DMU4, DMU13 are all 1, and these DMUs cannot be discriminated. But we can easily find that cross-efficiency aggregation using the ER approach can produce full ranking for the DMUs that are evaluated. See Table 9 for details.


                        Table 11
                         shows the changes of the efficiency scores and ranks of 16 basic research institutes under different weights on self-evaluation. There are five alternatives of weight on self-evaluation:
                           
                              Case 1: The weight on self-evaluation is 0.6. In this case, DMU13 and DMU14 rank 3(0.9131) and 2(0.9227), respectively, when using the weighted average cross-efficiency method but rank 2(0.9635) and 3(0.9621), respectively, when using the ER approach.

Case 2: The weight on self-evaluation is 0.7. In thias case, DMU4, DMU13 and DMU14 rank 4(0.9186), 3(0.9349) and 2(0.9380), respectively, when using the weighted average method but rank 3(0.9734), 2(0.9793) and 4(0.9723), respectively, when using the ER approach.

Case 3: The weight on self-evaluation is 0.8. In this case, DMU1, DMU4 and DMU14 rank 5(0.9174), 4(0.9457) and 3(0.9533), respectively, when using the weighted average method but rank 4(0.9816), 3(0.9884) and 5(0.9795), respectively, when using the ER approach.

Case 4: The weight on self-evaluation is 0.9. In this case, DMU1 and DMU14 rank 5(0.9587) and 4(0.9687), respectively, when using the weighted average method but rank 4(0.9956) and 5(0.9834), respectively, when using the ER approach. Also, DMU5 and DMU10 rank 14(0.3592) and 13(0.3599), respectively, when using the weighted average method but rank 13(0.3616) and 14(0.3573), respectively, when using the ER approach.

Case 5: The weight on self-evaluation is 1. In this case, the efficiency scores and ranks of 16 basic research institutes using the weighted average method or the weighted ER approach are the same as those using CCR–DEA model (Model 5) because the weights of 15 peer evaluations are all zero in this case.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Cross-efficiency in DEA models was proposed by ħ0110h0110h0110h0110protectSexton et al.1986 and is an effective way to rank DMUs. This method has two principal advantages in cross-evaluation: (1) it provides a unique ordering of the DMUs and (2) it eliminates unrealistic weight schemes without requiring weight restrictions from application area experts (ħ0015h0015h0015h0015protectAnderson et al.2002). Cross-efficiency in DEA models has applications in several areas. Dozens of theoretical studies have been performed on cross-efficiency in DEA models.

The common methods to aggregate cross-efficiency do not consider the preference structure of the decision maker. Because cross-efficiency scores are generated from the same dataset, they are not exclusive of each other. Instead, the scores are linked to each other. This fact may lead to the possibilities that the DM’s preference structure does not meet the “additive independence” condition in many assessment practices. However, if each DMU is assessed using its own DEA model independently, then the cross-efficiency scores that are generated can be regarded as independent pieces of evidence, which can be aggregated using the ER approach. This paper uses the ER approach to aggregate the cross-efficiencies obtained from cross-evaluation through the transformation of the cross-efficiency matrix to pieces of evidence. This paper provides a new method for cross-efficiency aggregation and a new way in DEA to reflect a DM’s preference or value judgments. Using this idea, a cross-efficiency matrix from other DEA models can also be aggregated using the ER approach to reflect the DM’s preference or value judgments.
