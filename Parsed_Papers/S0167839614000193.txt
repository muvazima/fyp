                  This paper addresses the problem of determining the symmetries of a plane or space curve defined by a rational parametrization. We provide effective methods to compute the involution and rotation symmetries for the planar case. As for space curves, our method finds the involutions in all cases, and all the rotation symmetries in the particular case of Pythagorean-hodograph curves. Our algorithms solve these problems without converting to implicit form. Instead, we make use of a relationship between two proper parametrizations of the same curve, which leads to algorithms that involve only univariate polynomials. These algorithms have been implemented and tested in the Sage system.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The problem of detecting the symmetries of a curve has been studied extensively, mainly because of its applications in Pattern Recognition, Computer Graphics and Computer Vision.

In Pattern Recognition, a common problem is how to choose, from a database of curves, the one which suits best a given object, represented by means of an equation (Huang and Cohen, 1996; Lei et al., 1998; Sener and Unel, 2005; Tarel and Cooper, 2000; Tasdizen et al., 2000; Taubin, 1991). Before a comparison can be carried out, one must bring the shape that needs to be identified into a canonical position. Thus it becomes necessary to compute the symmetries of the studied curve. In this context, the computation of symmetries has been addressed using splines (Huang and Cohen, 1996), by means of differential invariants (Boutin, 2000; Calabi et al., 1998; Weiss, 1993), using a complex representation of the implicit equation of the curve (Lebmeir and Richter-Gebert, 2008; Lebmeir, 2009; Tarel and Cooper, 2000), and using moments (Huang and Cohen, 1996; Suk and Flusser, 1993, 2005; Taubin and Cooper, 1992).

In Computer Graphics, the detection of symmetries and similarities is important, both in the 2D and the 3D case, to gain understanding when analyzing pictures, and also in order to perform tasks like compression, shape editing or shape completion. Many techniques involve statistical methods and, in particular, clustering; see for example the papers (Berner et al., 2008; Bokeloh et al., 2009; Mitra et al., 2006; Podolak et al., 2006), where the technique of transformation voting is used. Other techniques are robust auto-alignment (Simari et al., 2006), spherical harmonic analysis (Martinet et al., 2006), primitive fitting (Schnabel et al., 2008), and spectral analysis (Lipman et al., 2010), to quote a few.

In Computer Vision, symmetry is important for object detection and recognition. In this context, an analysis has been carried out using the Extended Gauss Image (Sun and Sherrah, 1997) and using feature points (Loy and Eklundh, 2006). In addition, there are algorithms for computing the symmetries of 2D and 3D discrete objects (Alt et al., 1988; Brass and Knauer, 2004; Jiang et al., 1996; Li et al., 2008) and for boundary-representation models (Li et al., 2008, 2010; Tate and Jared, 2003).

In the case of discrete objects (polygons, polyhedra), the symmetries can be determined exactly (Alt et al., 1988; Brass and Knauer, 2004; Jiang et al., 1996; Li et al., 2008). This can be generalized to the case of more complicated shapes whose geometry is described by a discrete object, as done in Brass and Knauer (2004), where an efficient algorithm is provided. Examples of this situation appear with Bézier curves and tensor product surfaces, where the shape follows from the geometry of the control points. However, in almost all of the other above references, the goal is to find approximate symmetries of the shape. This is perfectly adequate in many applications, because the input is often a ‘fuzzy’ shape, with missing or occluded parts in some cases. In fact, even if the input is exact, it is often an approximate, simplified model of a real object. Here we shall consider a different perspective. We assume that our input is exact, and we want to deterministically detect the existence and nature of its symmetries, without converting to implicit form. More precisely, our input will be either a plane or a space curve 
                        C
                      defined by means of a rational parametrization with integer coefficients. Our goal is to (1) determine whether 
                        C
                      has any symmetries, and (2) determine all symmetries in the affirmative case.

Notice that since we are dealing with a global object, i.e., the whole curve 
                        C
                     , we do not have a control polygon from which the geometry of the curve, and in particular its symmetries, can be derived. This could be the case if we were addressing a piece of 
                        C
                     , at least when 
                        C
                      admits a polynomial parametrization. In that situation, 
                        C
                      could be brought into Bézier form, and then an algorithm like Brass and Knauer (2004) could be applied. In fact, in that case the algorithm of Brass and Knauer (2004) would be computationally more effective than ours, since essentially the analysis follows from a discrete object. However, this idea is no longer applicable when the whole curve is considered.

Additionally, an analysis of approximate symmetries of rational curves could be attempted by sampling points on the curve, and then applying algorithms like Brass and Knauer (2004), Li et al. (2008, 2010). In that case, the question is how to choose suitable zones for sampling, which amounts to collecting some information on the shape of the curve (Alcázar and Díaz-Toca, 2010). A natural strategy is to look for notable points on the curve, like singularities, inflection points or vertices: Since any symmetry maps notable points of a certain nature to the same kind of points or leaves them invariant, one might sample around these points. One thus obtains clusters of points that must be compared. There would be various possibilities for comparing these clusters, depending on the kind of symmetry one is looking for, all which should be explored. Still, this approach only leads to an approximate estimate on the existence of symmetries, which is a different problem than the one considered in this paper.

Up to our knowledge, the deterministic problem for whole curves has only been solved in the case of implicit plane curves (Lebmeir and Richter-Gebert, 2008; Lebmeir, 2009) and in the case of polynomially parametrized plane curves (Alcázar, 2014). The case of space curves seems absent from the literature. In Lebmeir and Richter-Gebert (2008), Lebmeir (2009), the authors provide an elegant method to detect rotation symmetry of an implicitly defined algebraic curve, and efficiently find the exact rotation angle and rotation center. The method uses a complex representation 
                        F
                        (
                        z
                        ,
                        
                           
                              z
                           
                           
                              ¯
                           
                        
                        )
                        =
                        0
                      of the curve. Some cases not treated in Lebmeir and Richter-Gebert (2008) are completed in Lebmeir (2009), where similar ideas are applied to detect mirror symmetry. In contrast, our method applies directly to the parametrization, which is the most common representation in CAGD, avoiding the conversion into implicit form. The approach in Alcázar (2014) is similar to ours, although it should be noted that restricting to polynomial parametrizations yields an advantage for solving the problem fast and efficiently.

The main ingredient in our method is the underlying relation between two parametrizations of a curve that are proper, i.e., injective except perhaps for finitely many values of the parameter. Essentially, whenever a symmetry is present, this symmetry induces an alternative parametrization of the curve. Furthermore, if the starting parametrization is proper, this second parametrization is also proper. Since two proper parametrizations of a same curve are related by means of a Möbius transformation (Sendra et al., 2008), we can reduce the problem to finding this transformation. Thus, involutions, i.e., symmetries with respect to a point, line or plane, can be detected and determined for plane and space curves. For rotations, we need one more ingredient: a formulation in terms of complex numbers for plane curves, or the Pythagorean-hodograph assumption for space curves. In practice, our methods boil down to computing greatest common divisors and finding real roots of univariate polynomials, which are tasks that can be performed efficiently.

                      Here “gcd” refers to the greatest common divisor. Since 
                        C
                      is rational, it is irreducible. One can check whether a parametrization of a plane curve is proper, and every rational plane curve can be properly reparametrized without extending the ground field. See Sendra et al. (2008) for a thorough study on properness and a proof of these claims, and see Alcázar (2012, Section 3.1) for similar results for rational space curves.

The nontrivial isometries of the Euclidean plane are classified into reflections, rotations, translations, and glide reflections. The special case of central symmetries is of particular interest and corresponds to a rotation by an angle π. Central and mirror symmetries are involutions.

The classification of the nontrivial isometries of Euclidean space again includes reflections (in a plane), rotations (about an axis), and translations, and these combine in commutative pairs to form twists, glide reflections, and rotatory reflections. Composing three reflections in mutually perpendicular planes through a point P, yields a central inversion with center P, i.e., a symmetry with respect to the point P. The special case of rotation by an angle π is again of special interest, and it is called an axial symmetry. Central inversions, reflections, and axial symmetries are involutions.

By Bézout's theorem, an algebraic curve other than a line cannot be invariant under a translation or glide reflection, and a space curve can, in addition, not be invariant under a twist. We shall refer to the remaining isometries as symmetries, and we shall say that a plane or space curve 
                        C
                      is symmetric, if it is invariant under a nontrivial symmetry. Any algebraic curve in the plane, neither a line nor a circle, has finitely many symmetries (Lebmeir, 2009, Section 5). We need the following lemma to show the same result for nondegenerate space curves, i.e., space curves not contained in a plane.

                            Since there are finitely many α, β by Lemma 1 but infinitely many angles Φ, we get infinitely many angles γ as well, therefore contradicting Lemma 1. We conclude that

At this point one could in principle find the symmetries of 
                        C
                      by determining f and φ satisfying Eq. (4). However, the resulting polynomial system would involve too many variables in the coefficients of φ and f to be solved efficiently. In the following section we propose an efficient method to determine the symmetries of

                      is well defined and nonzero at 
                        t
                        =
                        0
                     . Since this is the case for almost all parameters t, this condition holds after applying an appropriate, even random, linear affine change of the parameter t.

Assume that the plane or space curve 
                        C
                      in (1) is invariant under a nontrivial symmetry 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        )
                        =
                        Q
                        x
                        +
                        b
                     . By Theorem 5, there is a Möbius transformation φ satisfying (4). Our strategy will be to first, in Sections 3.1–3.5, express all unknown parameters in Q, b, and φ as rational functions of a single parameter b of φ. Substituting these rational functions into (4) and clearing denominators, one obtains three polynomials in t, whose coefficients are polynomials in b. For (4) to hold identically for all t, each of these polynomial coefficients must be zero, which happens if and only if their greatest common divisor vanishes. Removing from this polynomial all factors for which the Möbius transformation or symmetry is not defined or not invertible, one obtains a polynomial 
                        P
                        (
                        b
                        )
                      in which every real root corresponds to a symmetry.

Let f be a plane rotation or an involution in 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      or 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              3
                           
                        
                     . Alternatively, let f be any isometry and 
                        C
                      be a Pythagorean-hodograph curve. We can now formulate the main theorem of the paper, which will be proved case-by-case in Sections 3.1–3.5.


                     
                        Theorem 7
                        
                           The curve 
                           
                              C
                            
                           has a nontrivial symmetry f if and only if 
                           
                              P
                              (
                              b
                              )
                            
                           has a real root b at which the parameters of Q, 
                           b
                           , and φ are well defined.
                        

Each real root of 
                        P
                        (
                        b
                        )
                      determines a Möbius transformation, which corresponds uniquely to a symmetry of 
                        C
                      by Theorem 5. By Corollary 4, 
                        C
                      has at most finitely many symmetries, implying that 
                        P
                        (
                        b
                        )
                      cannot be identically zero.

Finally, observe that one can directly find the symmetry type and its elements by analyzing the set of fixed points of the symmetry 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        )
                        =
                        Q
                        (
                        b
                        )
                        x
                        +
                        b
                        (
                        b
                        )
                     . In particular, 
                        
                           rank
                        
                        (
                        Q
                        (
                        b
                        )
                        −
                        I
                        )
                      is 1 for a symmetry with respect to a plane; 2 for a symmetry with respect to a line; 3 for a rotation symmetry or central inversion.

                         need not be mirror symmetries of our curve. Taking compositions of the reflections found in Section 3.3 will therefore only yield some of the rotations of 
                           C
                        . In addition, the rotations whose corresponding Möbius transformation have parameter 
                           d
                           =
                           0
                         will be found by the method of Section 3.1.

Unfortunately it seems that the approach of the previous section cannot be generalized to find all rotations of space curves. The complex numbers in the plane can be replaced by quaternions (Farouki, 2008; Goldman, 2010) in space, which provides a convenient way to express rotations. For instance, one can give quaternion versions of (12) and (13). The difficulty, however, comes from the fact that quaternions are not commutative, which makes it hard to eliminate the parameters defining the rotation in the resulting equations. Because of this, we have not been able to prove a version of Theorem 7 for space rotations. In fact, we are uncertain whether it is possible in that case to write all parameters of the Möbius transformation as rational functions of just one of them. While we might write these parameters in terms of two of them, which would yield a bivariate polynomial system, we feel that this solution is not satisfactory computationally. We therefore pose the question here as a pending problem.

                         then we do not run into the same obstacle. Such curves form an important topic in Computer Aided Geometric Design, and they have been studied extensively both from the point of view of theory and of applications (Farouki, 2008). In this case we can determine all rotation symmetries, since (16) gives a rational function

                           )
                        . After this we determine the symmetry as before. The sign of

                         is not easily determined in advance, so it is necessary to carry out the algorithm for both cases.

For all but the simplest examples, the computations quickly become too large to be carried out by hand, and a computer algebra system is needed. We have therefore implemented and tested the algorithms in Sage (Stein and et al., 2013). The resulting worksheet with implementations and examples can be downloaded from the website of the third author (Muntingh, 2014).

We test the performance of the algorithms in Section 3 for several classical curves on a Dell XPS 15 laptop, with 2.4 GHz i5-2430M processor and 6 GB RAM. Additional technical details are provided in the Sage worksheet (Muntingh, 2014).

                         (seconds) of the computations. In each case the algorithm for finding rotations performs better than the algorithm for finding involutions. The curves “inversion 1” and “inversion 2” are constructed to have precisely one central inversion.

Note that the algorithm for finding involutions of space curves performs significantly worse for the crunode in Table 2 than for the other curves of degree four. The reason seems to be that, besides the degree of a parametrization, the sizes of the coefficients greatly influence the performance of the algorithms. Even rational numbers with relatively small numerator and denominator get blown up by simple arithmetic operations. This is a common problem when computing in exact arithmetic.

Most of the computation time is spent by substituting the symmetry and Möbius transformation in (4) and finding the polynomial conditions on the parameter b.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have provided effective methods for determining the involution symmetries of a plane or space curve defined by a rational parametrization, and the rotation symmetries of a rational plane or Pythagorean-hodograph space curve. Examples were given, and the algorithms have been implemented in Sage. Experiments show that we can generally quickly compute the rotation and involution symmetries of curves of relatively low degree. The current approach cannot guarantee to find all the rotation symmetries of a space curve efficiently, except in the case of Pythagorean-hodograph curves. For the general case, an alternative strategy seems to be required.
