                  Background
                  Many studies have shown roles of microRNAs on human disease and a number of computational methods have been proposed to predict such associations by ranking candidate microRNAs according to their relevance to a disease. Among them, machine learning-based methods usually have a limitation in specifying non-disease microRNAs as negative training samples. Meanwhile, network-based methods are becoming dominant since they well exploit a “disease module” principle in microRNA functional similarity networks. Of which, random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm-based method is currently state-of-the-art. The use of this algorithm was inspired from its success in predicting disease gene because the “disease module” principle also exists in protein interaction networks. Besides, many algorithms designed for webpage ranking have been successfully applied in ranking disease candidate genes because web networks share topological properties with protein interaction networks. However, these algorithms have not yet been utilized for disease microRNA prediction.
               
               
                  Methods
                  We constructed microRNA functional similarity networks based on shared targets of microRNAs, and then we integrated them with a microRNA functional synergistic network, which was recently identified. After analyzing topological properties of these networks, in addition to RWR, we assessed the performance of (i) PRINCE (PRIoritizatioN and Complex Elucidation), which was proposed for disease gene prediction; (ii) PageRank with Priors (PRP) and K-Step Markov (KSM), which were used for studying web networks; and (iii) a neighborhood-based algorithm.
               
               
                  Results
                  Analyses on topological properties showed that all microRNA functional similarity networks are small-worldness and scale-free. The performance of each algorithm was assessed based on average AUC values on 35 disease phenotypes and average rankings of newly discovered disease microRNAs. As a result, the performance on the integrated network was better than that on individual ones. In addition, the performance of PRINCE, PRP and KSM was comparable with that of RWR, whereas it was worst for the neighborhood-based algorithm. Moreover, all the algorithms were stable with the change of parameters. Final, using the integrated network, we predicted six novel miRNAs (i.e., hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-181d, hsa-miR-192, hsa-miR-423-3p, hsa-miR-484 and hsa-miR-98) associated with breast cancer.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Network-based ranking algorithms, which were successfully applied for either disease gene prediction or for studying social/web networks, can be also used effectively for disease microRNA prediction.
               
            

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

One of the important goals in biomedical research is finding molecular mechanisms of diseases. Many studies have been proposed to figure out genetic factors of diseases. In which, prediction of disease-associated genes has been given much attention in recent decades (Kann, 2009; Tranchevent et al., 2010; Moreau and Tranchevent, 2012; Doncheva et al., 2012; Masoudi-Nejad et al., 2012). Recently, studies on the molecular mechanisms of diseases have been extended to microRNA (shortly called miRNA) which is a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (He and Hannon, 2004; Chen and Rajewsky, 2007).

The human genome may encode thousands of miRNAs (Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014; Bentwich et al., 2005), which may target about 60% of mammalian genes (Lewis et al., 2005; Friedman et al., 2009) and are abundant in many human cell types (Lim et al., 2003). Many studies have shown role of miRNAs in both common (Conrad et al., 2006; Li and Kowdley, 2012; Mendell and Olson, 2012; Esteller, 2011; Steinfeld et al., 2013) and rare diseases (Salvatore et al., 2011). For instance, miRNAs have been related to metabolic diseases (Rottiers and Näär, 2012), obesity, diabetes and cancer (Ali et al., 2011). In particular, functional relevance of miRNA sequences in human disease is also studied (Bhayani et al., 2012). Moreover, combination of miRNAs and environmental factors has also been studied in relation to human diseases (Qiu et al., 2012).

To predict novel disease associated miRNAs, machine learning-based methods have been proposed. For example, study (Jiang et al., 2010a) used Naïve Bayes model to integrate genomic data for prioritizing disease-related miRNAs; study (Qinghua et al., 2010a) employed support vector machine for distinguishing miRNAs associated with diseases from those that are not. In addition, study (Qabaja et al., 2013) used a protein network-based Lasso regression model to infer disease-miRNA associations. Moreover, by using a semi-supervised classifier, study (Chen et al., 2012a) predicted disease-related interactions between miRNAs and environmental factors. The common limitation of such machine learning-based methods is the compilation of negative training samples consisting of non-disease miRNAs because it is often the case in biology that not observing an association does not imply the association does not exist (there are no proven negatives) (Xu et al., 2011a).

In addition to machine learning-based methods, more recent computational methods to associate miRNAs to diseases are network-based. Depending on how the network is represented, different approaches can be envisaged. For instance, study (Xu et al., 2011a) built a heterogeneous miRNA target-dysregulated network based on physical miRNA-target interactions (i.e., a bipartite network where nodes represent respectively miRNAs and their targets and the edges refer to the physical interactions between the miRNAs and their targets), then analyzed topological features of the network to prioritize candidate disease miRNAs. However, most network-based methods for disease miRNA prediction exploit properties of homogeneous miRNA functional similarity networks (i.e., nodes represent miRNAs and edges represent the degree of functional relatedness between the miRNAs, where the functional relatedness is assessed based on omics data). For instance, study (Jiang et al., 2010b) constructed a miRNA functional similarity based on the degree to which miRNAs share the same targets or by calculating the similarity of the regulation patterns of each pair of miRNAs (Qinghua et al., 2010b). Study (Wang et al., 2010) presented a method, MISIM, in which they adapted the method for measuring the functional similarity of protein-coding genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms toward assessing the functional similarity between miRNAs to draw the edges in the miRNA functional similarity network. Recently, we constructed a miRNA functional similarity network by integrating functional similarity interactions based on shared target genes and synergistic interactions between miRNAs (Le and Marchal, 2014). After constructing the homogeneous miRNA functional similarity networks, the associations between miRNAs and diseases are subsequently predicted from these networks by assuming that functionally related miRNAs tend to be associated with phenotypically similar diseases (also known as “disease module” principle (Bartel, 2004; Lu et al., 2008) in miRNA functional similarity networks).

Several measures have been developed to assess similarities in such networks to reliably predict novel disease associated miRNAs. Local similarity measures only assess the direct neighborhood of a miRNA in its functional similarity network (i.e., only the neighbors of known disease-associated miRNAs are considered) (Xu et al., 2011a; Jiang et al., 2010b). Moreover, a state-of-the-art method based on random walk with restart (shortly called RWR) algorithm, which yields global similarity measure, has been recently proposed (Chen et al., 2012b; Chen and Zhang, 2013) and shown to outperform local similarity measure-based ones. The application of RWR algorithm on miRNA functional similarity networks in disease miRNA prediction is inspired from its success in disease gene prediction based on protein interaction networks. Indeed, this algorithm has been successfully applied in a number of studies for disease gene prediction (Kohler et al., 2008; Li and Patra, 2010; Le and Kwon, 2012, 2013) and also considered as a state-of-the-art method in that field compared to other network-based methods (Navlakha and Kingsford, 2010). The success of RWR in both disease gene and miRNA prediction is because it well exploits “disease module” principle appearing in both protein interaction networks (i.e., genes/proteins associated to the same or similar disease tends to form functional/physical module in gene/protein interaction networks (Feldman et al., 2008; Goh et al., 2007; Oti and Brunner, 2007)) and miRNA functional similarity networks (i.e., functionally related miRNAs tend to be associated with phenotypically similar diseases (Bartel, 2004; Lu et al., 2008)). Note that, there exists other “disease module” principle-based methods successfully proposed for disease gene prediction such as PRINCE (Vanunu et al., 2010) which achieved a comparable performance with RWR algorithm. Moreover, based on observations that social/web networks share topological properties such as scale-free and small-worldness with gene/protein interaction networks, a number of algorithms used for studying social/web networks such as Google’s PageRank (Page et al., 1999), PageRank with priors (shortly called PRP), K-Step Markov (shortly called KSM) (White and Smyth, 2003) was successfully adapted for disease gene prediction (Morrison et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2009).

Inspired from the success of RWR algorithm, which firstly applied in disease gene prediction, for disease miRNA prediction, we employed PRINCE algorithm for disease miRNA prediction in this study. In addition, we tested whether miRNA functional similarity networks share small-worldness and scale-free with social/web networks and then we adapted webpage ranking algorithms such as PRP and KSM for disease miRNA prediction. These algorithms including RWR, PRINCE, PRP and KSM have a common feature in that they yield global similarity measures between candidate miRNAs and a set of known disease-associated miRNAs. Moreover, an algorithm based on a neighborhood of known disease-associated miRNAs, which yields a local similarity measure, was also assessed. To test the performance of these five algorithms, we constructed miRNA functional similarity networks. More specifically, we built functional similarity networks by assessing the degree of similarity of each miRNA pair according to their shared target genes. After that, we integrated these networks with a miRNA functional synergistic network collected from Xu et al. (2011b) to make a more comprehensive network. The performance of each algorithm was assessed based on average AUC (area under ROC curve) values and average rankings of newly discovered disease miRNAs. Experimental results showed that the performance on the integrated miRNA functional similarity network is better than that on individual ones. Interestingly, PRINCE, PRP and KSM achieved a comparable performance with RWR, whereas it is worst for the neighborhood-based algorithm. In addition, all the algorithms were stable with the changing of their parameters. Moreover, we tested these algorithms to find novel miRNAs associated to breast cancer. The evidence search from literature about the associations between 100 highly ranked candidate miRNAs and breast cancer confirmed six of them, which are not yet recorded in public disease-miRNA association databases.

@&#METHODS@&#

In this study, we first constructed miRNA functional similarity networks from miRNA-target databases and literature. Then, we analyzed topological properties of these networks. After that, we applied five network-based ranking methods in prioritizing candidate miRNAs. Based on the rankings, we compared the performance of different miRNA functional similarity networks on the same network-based ranking method, and the performance of different network-based ranking methods on the same miRNA functional similarity network. Fig. 1
                      shows schematic view of the workflow of this study.

We constructed four miRNA functional similarity networks including (i) two of them were built based on shared target genes; (ii) one was based on miRNA functional synergistic interactions collected from literature and (iii) one was integrated by combining these networks. More specifically, we first constructed the two miRNA functional similarity networks based on the same procedure as in Jiang et al. (2010b). To this end, we used 143,596 miRNA-target gene associations of human from PITA (Kertesz et al., 2007) and 520,526 miRNA-target associations of human from TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2003) (see Tables S1 and S2 in Supplementary file). In each miRNA functional similarity network, two miRNAs were defined to functionally interact if they share at least one target gene and the weight of that interaction was defined by the number of shared target genes divided by the number of target genes of miRNA which targets to a smaller number of genes. This resulted in a network consisting of 331 miRNAs and 1526 interactions (shortly called simPITANet) and a network of 1428 miRNAs and 46,118 interactions (shortly called simTargetScanNet) based on the collected miRNA-target interactions from respectively PITA and TargetScan. Second, we built a functional synergistic network containing 3872 interactions among 692 miRNAs (shortly called synNet) collected from Xu et al. (2011b). Third, to integrate these different miRNA functional similarity networks, we normalized the weight of each interaction in these networks in a range of [0, 1] as follows:

                                             w
                                             
                                                i
                                                j
                                             
                                          
                                          −

                                          max
                                          −
                                          min
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        where wij
                         is weight of interaction between miRNA/node vi
                         and vj
                        , min and max are the smallest and largest values of weights of each miRNA functional similarity network, respectively.

Then, the two miRNA functional similarity networks (i.e., simPITANet and simTargetScanNet) were combined with the miRNA functional synergistic network (i.e., synNet) to construct an integrated miRNA functional similarity network (shortly called miRNANet) consisting of 1521 miRNAs and 51,362 interactions. Different from our previous study (Le and Marchal, 2014) where these networks were considered as unweighted ones to simplify the integration, in this study, they are considered as weighted and integrated using “per-edge average” method as follows:

miR2Disease (Jiang et al., 2009) (http://www.mir2disease.org/) is a comprehensive resource of miRNA and human disease which is manually curated. In this study, we obtained 270 experimentally verified disease phenotype–miRNAs associations from this database for a total of 53 disease phenotypes (see Table S3 in Supplementary file). Due to using a leave-one-out cross validation method for assessing the performance of the algorithms; only 35 of those disease phenotypes associating to at least two miRNAs were finally selected.

Given a connected weighted graph G(V, E) with a set of nodes V
                        ={v
                        1, v2
                        , …, vN
                        } and a set of links E
                        ={(vi
                        , vj
                        )|vi
                        , vj
                        ∈V}, a set of source/seed nodes S⊆V and a N
                        ×
                        N adjacency matrix W of link weights. Here, we are going to introduce some network-based algorithms for measuring the relative importance of node vi
                         to S. By modeling a miRNA functional similarity network as a graph with nodes present miRNAs, links present miRNA–miRNA functional interactions, W presents pair-wise similarities between miRNAs, and S presents known disease-associated miRNAs, ranking/prioritization of candidate miRNAs to predict novel miRNAs associated to a disease of interest is based on their relative importance to known disease-associated miRNAs. This value also measures how much relevant to a disease a candidate miRNA is. Hereafter, we introduced the five network-based ranking algorithms used in this study.

This is a neighborhood-based method (shorted called NWR) which was based on direct neighbors of source nodes/known disease-associated miRNAs (S). Formally, the relative importance of a node vi
                            to a set of source nodes is defined as following:

                                             j

                            is weight of link (vi
                           , vj
                           ). This score is 0 for nodes/miRNAs not connected to any source nodes/known disease-associated miRNAs.

RWR is a variant of the random walk and it mimics a walker that moves from a current node to a randomly selected adjacent node or goes back to source nodes with a back-probability γ∈(0, 1). RWR can be formally described as follows:

In this study, RWR was used to prioritize candidate miRNAs which are miRNAs in miRNA functional similarity networks that have not been associated with a disease phenotype. Thus, the set of source nodes (S) consists of the miRNAs known to be associated with a disease phenotype. All miRNAs in the network are eventually ranked according to the steady-state probability vector P
                           ∞.

Study (Vanunu et al., 2010) introduced this algorithm for disease gene prediction on a protein interaction network. Similar to RWR, PRINCE is a kind of propagation algorithm; it simulates a process where nodes for which prior information exists pump information to their neighbors through an iteration process. At each iteration, every node propagates the information received at the previous iteration to its neighbors. PRINCE can be formally described as follows:
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          P
                                          
                                             t
                                             +
                                             1
                                          
                                       
                                       =
                                       α
                                       
                                          
                                             W
                                          
                                          ′
                                       
                                       
                                          P
                                          t
                                       
                                       +
                                       (

                                          P

                           where P
                           0 represents prior knowledge function. Similar to RWR, in this study, it is the N
                           ×1 initial probability vector where the value of an element corresponding to a non-source node or a source node is zero or 1/|S|, respectively. First part of the equation represents the smooth propagation process which assigns similar values to adjacent nodes, while the second part represents a priori knowledge. Trade-off parameter α∈(0, 1) weighs the relative importance of these constraints with respect to one another. Different from RWR, The matrix W′ is represented by a row-normalized matrix and defined formally as follow:

Similarly to RWR, all miRNAs in the network are eventually ranked according to the steady-state probability vector P
                           ∞.

PRP (White and Smyth, 2003) is an extension of the original PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1999). It mimics a random Internet surfer starting from one of a set of source nodes, and follows one of the links randomly in each step. In this process, the surfer jumps back to the source nodes at back-probability β∈(0, 1), thus restarting the whole process. Therefore, this algorithm generates a score that is proportional to the probability of reaching any node on the graph. This score indicates the relative importance of those nodes to the source nodes. The PRP algorithm is originally defined for unweighted networks. In this study, we adapted it to use for weighted networks. Formally, the PRP algorithm can be described as follows:

                              j
                            is a set of outgoing nodes of vj
                           .

Similar to RWR and PRINCE, pi
                           
                           0 is initial probability of vi
                            and is assigned to zero or 1/|S| if vi
                            is a non-source node or a source node, respectively.

Similarly to PRR, KSM mimics a surfer who starts with one of the source nodes. The surfer follows a random link in each step, but he/she return to the source node after K steps and restarts surfing (White and Smyth, 2003). It is formally defined as follow:

Prioritization performance was assessed through the leave-one-out cross-validation (shortly called LOOCV) process. Let us assume that a miRNA functional similarity network G(V, E), a set of known disease miRNAs (D⊆V) and a set of candidate miRNAs (C) are given. A miRNA s∈D is held out for validation and the remaining disease miRNAs are specified to a set of source nodes (i.e., S
                        =
                        D\{s}). The network-based ranking algorithms were used to prioritize all the candidate miRNAs. This process was repeated by setting every s∈D to a held-out miRNA. For a reliable performance comparison, we drew the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and computed the area under the curve (AUC) based on the rank of held-out miRNA s in set C∪{s}. More specifically, given a thresholdτ, we counted TP (true positives), FN (false negatives), FP (false positives), and TN (true negatives), which were formally defined as following:

By varying τ from one to the number of miRNAs in the set C∪{s}, the relationship between sensitivity and (1−specificity) was plotted. The ROC curve is the curve constructed based on those pairs of values, and the AUC is the area under the ROC curve. In this study, we considered candidate miRNAs set as all miRNAs that are not known to be associated with the disease (i.e., V\D) in G.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The study of topological properties of a complex network such as web networks and biological networks is important here, since the connections in the network not only reflect direct functional relationships between network nodes, but also indirect relationships. In addition, analysis on global topological properties of a network is the base for selection of a suitable algorithm to assess the importance/centrality of a node in the network. In this section, we analyze topological properties of the four miRNA functional similarity networks (i.e., miRNANet, simTargetScanNet, simPITANet and synNet). To this end, we employed Network Analyzer tool (Assenov et al., 2008), which is a Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011) plugin for network analysis. The results including the average number of neighbors, network density, clustering coefficient, and average shortest path length of the four miRNA functional similarity networks are summarized in Table 1
                        . Relative high values of the average number of neighbors and network density show that they are highly connected. In addition, relative high values of clustering coefficients and small average shortest path length indicated that nodes in these networks tend to cluster together and most pairs of nodes will be connected by at least one short path. Fig. 2
                         shows a visualization of miRNANet network where the largest component covered 99.97% of the interactions. Besides, other global topological properties of a network were also assessed by node-degree distribution. This distribution specifies the model of the investigated network and therefore its evolution. For the four miRNA functional similarity networks, node–degree distributions are plotted in Fig. 3
                         and power law distributions can be fitted to the points of the plots with high correlation coefficients (i.e., 0.928, 0.907, 0.971 and 0.931 and for miRNANet, simTargetScanNet, simPITANet and synNet, respectively). These high coefficients depict that these miRNA networks are scale-free. In addition, fat-tail of node-degree distributions in Fig. 3 also showed that these networks have greater than expected number of hubs. This property taken together with relative high values of clustering coefficients and small average shortest path lengths (see Table 1) indicated that these networks are small-worldness. In summary, these miRNA functional similarity networks have both scale-free and small-world properties, which are shared with social/web networks. This observation is very important for selection and adaptation of algorithms used for studying social/web networks in ranking miRNAs in the miRNA functional similarity networks. This is also inspired from the success of applying these algorithms for ranking disease candidate genes in gene/protein interaction networks (i.e., Google’s PageRank in Morrison et al. (2005)), and two algorithms PRP and KSM in Chen et al. (2009)). In this study, in addition to RWR, PRINCE and NWR, we utilized PRP and KSM to rank disease candidate miRNAs in the miRNA functional similarity networks (see Section 2).

In this experiment, we compared the performance of each algorithm on different miRNA functional similarity networks. To this end, we used LOOCV method for each disease phenotype in the set of 35 disease phenotypes (see Section 2). Consequently, the performance of each method on each network is an average of AUC values of disease phenotypes. Particularly, we employed this procedure for RWR, PRINCE, PRP, KSM and NWR algorithms on the two miRNA functional similarity networks (i.e., simTargetScanNet, simPITANet), the functional synergistic network (i.e., synNet) and the integrated network (i.e., miRNANet). The back-probability (γ and β) of RWR and PRP, and the trade-off α of PRINCE were varied in a range of [0.1, 0.9]. For KSM, number of steps (K) was varied in range of [2, 6]. Fig. 4
                         showed the performance of these algorithms on the miRNA functional similarity networks. It was obvious that the performance for the integrated miRNA functional similarity network (i.e., miRNANet) is better than that of other miRNA functional similarity networks statistically significantly for all the algorithms (all P-values<0.05. See Table 2
                         for more detail of the comparisons). This indicates disease miRNAs are more likely to form modules in the integrated miRNA functional similarity network than others; therefore, all the algorithms better exploited the “disease module” principle and consequently better predict disease-associated miRNA. In other words, disease miRNAs are not very close to each other in individual miRNA functional similarity networks; however, the integration of them helps connect disease miRNAs closer. This result is consistent with the result of our previous study for only RWR algorithm (Le and Marchal, 2014). In addition, the performance of RWR, PRINCE, PRP, KSM algorithms are stable with the change of parameters (i.e., back-probability (γ and β) for respectively RWR and PRP, trade-off (α) for PRINCE, and number of steps (K) for KSM). For performance comparison of all the algorithms, we select the integrated miRNA functional similarity network (i.e., miRNANet), which brings the best performance to all the algorithms. In addition, thank to their stability with the change of parameters, we took average of AUC values over all changes of the parameters as the performance of each algorithm. Fig. 5
                         shows that the performance of PRINCE, PRP and KSM are comparable with that of RWR (i.e., average AUC values are 0.898, 0.890, 0.891, and 0.892 for RWR, PRINCE, PRP and KSM, respectively). This indicates that the “disease module” principle existing in both gene/protein and miRNA functional similarity networks make RWR, PRINCE, PRP and KSM, which successfully applied on gene/protein networks to predict disease associated genes, applicable on miRNA functional similarity networks to predict novel disease associated miRNAs. In addition, the sharing of topological properties such as scale-free and small-worldness of miRNA functional similarity networks with social/web networks has inspired the use of PRP and KSM algorithms for ranking candidate miRNAs in miRNA functional similarity networks.

We also compared the performance of the five algorithms on their prediction of newly discovered disease associated miRNAs. To this end, we collected a total of 405 newly discovered disease-miRNAs associations between 24 disease phenotypes and 123 miRNAs compared to those in miR2Disease (Jiang et al., 2009) from a most updated miRNA-disease association database, HMDD (Li et al., 2014) (see Table S4 in Supplementary file). For each disease phenotype, we used known disease associated miRNAs in miR2Disease as seed nodes for each algorithm to rank those newly discovered disease miRNAs among remaining miRNAs in the miRNANet network. Thank to the stability in prediction performance of all the algorithms with the changes of parameters, we set back-probability (γ and β) to 0.5 respectively for RWR and PRP, trade-off (α) to 0.5 for PRINCE and number of steps (K) to 4 for KSM in experiments. Observed result was consistent with the previous result that the average rankings of those novel disease miRNAs are comparable for RWR, PRINCE, PRP and KSM, whereas it is highest (the higher rankings are the worse method is) for NWR (see Table 3
                        ).

In this experiment, we tried to predict novel miRNAs associated to breast cancer (MIM ID is 114480). Breast cancer (also called breast neoplasm) is a complex disease and is known to be associated with 170 miRNAs in the most updated disease-miRNA association HMDD (Li et al., 2014). To predict novel miRNAs associated to this disease, we used those known associated miRNAs as source nodes, and other miRNAs in the miRNANet network as candidates. Due to the stability in prediction performance of all the algorithms with the changes of parameters, we set α, β and γ to 0.5 for PRINCE, PRP and RWR, respectively, K to 4 for KSM. After all candidate miRNAs were ranked, we selected 100 highly ranked candidates for evidence search about the association between miRNA and breast cancer from literature on PubMed using Entrez Programming Utilites (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/). Table 4
                         shows evidenced candidate miRNAs for each algorithm. For instance, study (Liu et al., 2012) showed that hsa-miR-101 regulates p23 protein of which high level may promote tumor progression and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. It was reported that hsa-miR-181d and hsa-miR-98 are two of nine miRNAs observed to be up-regulated greater than twofold in primary breast cancer compared with normal adjacent tumour tissues (Yan et al., 2008). In addition, study (Rosa-Rosa et al., 2009) confirmed that 11q13 containing hsa-miR-192 is susceptible region of breast cancer. Moreover, hsa-miR-423-3p expressions differentiated 70.1% of hereditary and non-hereditary breast cancer (Murria Estal et al., 2013). Final, hsa-miR-484 was showed as one of prognostic microRNA/mRNA signatures from the integrated analysis of patients with invasive breast cancer (Volinia and Croce, 2013). Interestingly, three of these six evidenced miRNAs (i.e., hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-181d and hsa-miR-98) were highly ranked by all the algorithms. Other not yet evidenced miRNAs in the top 100 miRNAs can be good candidates for biologists for further investigation (see Table S5 in Supplementary file). Considering the number of evidenced miRNAs in top 100 ranked candidate miRNAs of each algorithm we observed that although NWR performed worst among the five algorithms in overall performance comparisons; however, for a specific disease phenotype such as breast cancer, it could return higher number of evidenced miRNAs in the top 100 compared to PRINCE, PRP and KSM.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The identification of novel disease-associated miRNAs is an important task in biomedical research. This drives future personalized medicine research (Jones, 2007) toward not only gene-based (Kay, 2011) but also on RNA-based (Melnikova, 2007; van Rooij et al., 2008; Davidson and McCray, 2011; Lundstrom, 2011) therapies by controlling miRNA regulation in diseases (Fan et al., 2012). In this study, in addition to RWR algorithm, which was presented in our previous study, we introduced four network-based ranking methods to predict novel disease-associated miRNAs based on the constructed miRNA functional similarity networks. Similarly to RWR algorithm, the use of PRINCE was inspired from its success in predicting disease-associated genes since “disease module” principle is found in both gene/protein interaction networks and miRNA functional similarity networks. In addition, global topological properties such as small-worldness and scale-free properties shared with social/web networks has inspired the use of network-based ranking algorithms such as PRP and KSM used to study social/web networks for ranking disease candidate miRNAs on the miRNA functional similarity networks. Experiment results showed that the performance of PRINCE, PRP and KSM was comparable with that of RWR, which was considered as a state-of-the-art method for disease miRNA prediction, and they were all better than that of NWR, which yields local similarity measure. In addition, the performance of the integrated miRNA functional similarity network was also better than that of individual miRNA functional similarity/synergistic networks for all the five algorithms. This result was conserved with our previous study about such improvement for only RWR algorithm. This also indicated that disease miRNAs are more disease-oriented modularized in the integrated miRNA functional similarity network. In other words, the integration of individual miRNA functional similarity network helps connect disease miRNAs closer. Moreover, all the algorithms were stable with the change of their parameters. Final, using the integrated miRNA functional similarity network, we predicted six novel miRNAs including hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-181d, hsa-miR-192, hsa-miR-423-3p, hsa-miR-484 and hsa-miR-98 associated to breast cancer which are not yet recorded in the most updated disease-miRNA association HMDD (Li et al., 2014).
