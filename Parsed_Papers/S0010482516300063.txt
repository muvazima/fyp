                  This paper introduces a technique for predicting death in patients with Chagas disease using features extracted from symbolic series and time–frequency indices of heart rate variability (HRV). The study included 150 patients: 15 patients who died and 135 who did not. The HRV series were obtained from 24-h Holter monitoring. Sequences of symbols from 5-min epochs from series of RR intervals were generated using symbolic dynamics and ordinal pattern statistics. Fourteen features were extracted from symbolic series and four derived from clinical aspects of patients. For classification, the 18 features from each epoch were used as inputs in a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The results showed that it is possible to distinguish between the two classes, patients with Chagas disease who did or did not die, with a 95% accuracy rate. Therefore, we suggest that the use of new features based on symbolic series, coupled with classic time–frequency and clinical indices, proves to be a good predictor of death in patients with Chagas disease.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Sudden death, associated or not with advanced cardiomyopathy, is one of the characteristic phenomena of Chagas disease [1]. The electrophysiological mechanisms most frequently associated with sudden death in patients with Chagas disease are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. With the development of therapeutic strategies for preventing death by ventricular fibrillation, especially those using implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), the search for methods capable of predicting the progression to death, and particularly to sudden death, in Chagas disease [2–4] has become extremely important for proper patient selection. Therefore, a more accurate risk stratification is necessary to identify patients at high risk of sudden death. Furthermore, ICD implantation is an invasive procedure which has associated risks (inappropriate shocks, proarrhythmias, pre and postoperative complications, issues with electrodes, infection) and can cause depression, anxiety and worsen patient quality of life [5]. Many clinical features, such as age and functional class, have been assessed as possible risk factors for the development of fatal arrhythmias. However, the sensitivity and specificity of any single test for predicting these types of arrhythmias are limited [6].

Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is an important tool for detecting cardiac arrhythmias. The HRV reflects the complex interactions of the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular diseases are often predicted by changes in HRV. Therefore, the ability to classify (or distinguish between) physiological and pathological HRV patterns can be useful for developing new diagnostic tools. The HRV analysis is performed by analysis of RR intervals series. The RR intervals are intervals between two R waves of the electrocardiogram (EKG). They correspond to the frequency of ventricular depolarization. The RR interval series represents the sympathetic-vagal balance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) given by HRV. Thus, predicting the risk of arrhythmias from sequences of RR intervals requires extracting key features from HRV signals. However, there is still the issue of how to extract the appropriate features in order to effectively classify extremely similar classes with the lowest computational cost. Symbolic dynamics (SD) has been used in literature to analyze [7] and classify HRV [8].

In addition to selecting relevant features, the performance of the pattern recognition system also depends on the choice of classifier. Many pattern recognition systems of cardiovascular signals employ artificial neural networks [9], k-nearest neighbor [10], hidden Markov models, independent component analysis and principal component analysis [9], among others. Recent studies have introduced an approach that uses support vector machines (SVMs) to classify electrocardiogram (ECG) signals [9,11]. However, results have shown that the classification error rate is still above 10% for some specific classes [11].

This paper is intended to evaluate if HRV features obtained by traditional methods and via symbolic dynamics (SD) can predict death in patients with Chagas disease, and to use the SVM to classify signals.

Patient recruitment was conducted at the Centro de Referncia Ambulatorial da Doena de Chagas (Outpatient Reference Center for Chagas Disease) of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Federal University of Minas Gerais), Brazil. Patients with consecutive ages between 20 and 70 years and a definite serologic status of Chagas disease were selected (
                           ≥
                         two different positive reactions to Trypanosoma cruzi in patients at risk of infection). Those who agreed to participate and provided their informed consent underwent a standard protocol, including clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms and chest X-rays, echocardiograms, exercise testing and 24-h Holter monitoring. Protocol details can be found in published articles with the same cohort [12,13]. The exclusion criteria were: (1) atrial fibrillation or palpitation, artificial pacemaker rhythm or any other non-sinus rhythm; (2) no evidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney or liver failure, anemia or significant systemic disease; (3) alcoholism; (4) pregnancy; and (5) use of any drug with cardiovascular or metabolic effects. Patients were divided into two groups: one comprising 15 patients who died (nonsurvival) and another consisting of 135 who did not (survival).

The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Minas Gerais. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring was performed using a three-channel portable cassette tape recorder (Dynamis, Cardios, So Paulo, Brazil). Patients were encouraged to continue with their normal daily activities during data recording, but to avoid physical exercise or using drugs that might interfere with autonomic function. The HRV analyses were carried out when at least 18h of good quality traces had been recorded and 85% or more sinus rhythm heartbeats were available.

Recordings were analyzed on a Burdick/DMI Hospital Holter System (Spacelabs Burdick, Deerfield, Wisconsin, USA) using a semi-automatic technique with a sampling frequency of 200Hz. For each tape, the entire recording was carefully inspected and the QRS complexes were classified into normal beats, ectopic beats, or artifacts in order to create normal RR intervals time series. The RR intervals were extracted from each of the ECG recordings by means of an automatic QRS detection algorithm, using the Holter system [14]. For feature extraction, 5-min windows were randomly selected from the HRV series from 24-h traces.

Following thorough investigation, 18 features were chosen for classifier training. These features were divided into three groups depending on the nature of the feature and the data by which it was estimated (Table 1
                        ). Four clinical features: patient age; NSVT, presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during 24-h Holter monitoring or exercise testing; LVEF

                           0.5
                        , left ventricular ejection fraction lower than 50% during electrocardiography; and

                        , duration of the QRS complex greater or equal to 134ms during electrocardiography [13]. Nine time–frequency features: mNN, mean RR intervals; SDNN, standard deviation of RR intervals; RMSSD, square root of the mean of the sum of squares of differences between adjacent RR intervals; pNN50, percentage of RR interval differences exceeding 50ms; MSD, mean successive difference between adjacent RR intervals; TotPow, variance of RR intervals; LF, power in the low frequency range; HF, power in the high frequency range; and LF/HF, LF/HF ratio. Five symbolic features:

The four features of the first group refer to the patients and remain constant during the 24h of data collection, but may vary between patients. The other two groups of features (Table 1) were obtained from the series of RR intervals for each epoch.

The following section describes the methodologies employed in this study for feature extraction.

Time–frequency feature extraction is based on classic indices calculated from the series of RR intervals. Time-domain indices are based on statistical methods derived from RR intervals and from the differences between them [15,16]. These parameters were calculated for 24-h traces [12]. Frequency-domain indices are based on periodic components of HRV series. Power spectral density (PSD) was estimated in high (0.15–0.4Hz) and low (0.04–0.15Hz) frequency ranges [15]. The PSD in high frequency (HF) ranges represents modulation of vagal activity, whereas the PSD in low frequency (LF) ranges represents both vagal and sympathetic activity. The ratio between high and low frequencies (HF/LF) represents the sympathovagal balance. In this study, we chose to analyze PSD in 5-min windows during the period of decreased heart rate during sleep, as previously reported [17].

Features extracted using symbolic series were obtained from 5-min windows in the RR intervals time series from 24-h traces. The features were subdivided into three methods.

Symbolic dynamics provides a class of features based on the transformation of a time series into a sequence of symbols that can be statistically characterized using symbol-sequence histograms and quantified using Shannon entropy.

In order to analyze the dynamic behavior of HRV via SD, a partition of the first return map from tachograms must be defined. The first return map of a tachogram is formed by a cloud of points scattered along the line of identity

                           . The dispersion of points perpendicular to this line reflects the variability of long-term signal and is quantified by SD1, defined as the standard deviation along the line x
                           2 perpendicular to x
                           1. Moreover, the dispersion along x
                           1 reflects the short term variability and is quantified by the standard deviation along the line SD2 [7,16], as illustrated in Fig. 1
                           (a).

Several partitions are defined in literature [7,16]. In this study, a statistic partition was defined [16] so that the resulting symbols described variations in long-term HRV signal dynamics. This partition can be determined by:

                            are defined so that the resulting symbols are equiprobable [16]. The parameter q defines the number of partitions, i.e., the size of the alphabet. Fig. 1(b) illustrates this partition.

Then the partition of the first return maps is defined, each point on the map is converted into its corresponding symbol, creating a series of discrete values. This series is used to generate sequences of symbols s
                           
                              i
                            of finite size n by means of a non-overlapping sliding windows algorithm.

Therefore, a value for m is defined, it is possible to estimate the probability density function (PDF) by creating a relative frequency histogram of each of the sequences. To do so, the q
                           
                              m
                            possible sequences are converted into numbers in base q and arranged according to their natural order.

The values of q=3 and m=6 were chosen in order to achieve well-defined statistics [16]. Therefore, we used 5-min epochs that represented T
                           
                              p
                            values with approximately 500 points, in which T
                           
                              p
                            represents the total number of points in the first return map and was limited to the values of q and m, so that q
                           
                              m
                            was approximately 1% of T
                           
                              p
                            
                           [16]. For each of the 150 series, size T
                           
                              p
                            windows were separated using a sliding windows algorithm. All other features listed in Table 1 were also extracted from these epochs.

Shannon entropy was calculated based on the symbol-sequence histograms and is defined as:

The forbidden words or forbidden sequences were subsequently selected. Forbidden words are words that did not occur (or were not observed) in the data record used. However, as the system is corrupted by noise, forbidden words are defined as those with a low frequency of occurrence (probability of occurrence lower than 0.1%) [7]. Both the entropy and the number of forbidden words (nFW) quantify the complexity of the signal, i.e., characterize its dynamic behavior.

The relation between small segments of size q of a HRV time series can also be represented by ordinal pattern statistics (OPS), a tool proposed by Parlitz et al. [8] to encoding time series. Ordinal patterns have many applications, such as in analysis of the complexity of time series and in classification problems [8].

                           , the first step of the OPS approach consists in obtaining non-overlapping segments of size q. The samples of each segment are ordered according to their amplitudes, generating a vector with the indices of the sorted samples. The ordinal patterns are calculated from this vector as detailed in [8].

The probabilities of occurrence of specific patterns for a given delay τ and length q are used to characterize RR intervals, i.e., the number of patterns π in the series represents a measure of the complexity of the signal. Therefore, Shannon entropy is calculated from the frequencies of occurrence of the symbols (patterns) generated by OPS.

In order to measure the degree of complexity of the series based on the sequence of symbols, the complexity index is calculated according to the metric proposed in [20]. This index measures the amount of different patterns in the finite sequence of symbols and therefore characterizes the level of order or disorder of the series.

The complete list of features is provided in Table 1.

Classifiers were trained from data divided into 5-min epochs, which are supposedly stationary [15]. For feature extraction, we selected randomly 30 windows from each epoch of 5-min of each patient. All set of features of all patients make up the matrix of features of size:

Each epoch has its own set of 18 features whose indices are displayed in Table 1, and each class (survival or nonsurvival) is assigned a class label by a cardiologist. Following training, the classifier automatically determines the corresponding class label for the set of 18 features associated with each epoch (Fig. 3
                        ). This procedure is based on an SVM with a Gaussian kernel (radial basis function, RBF), defined by:

The 18 features, extracted from the 5-min epochs from the 150 series (135 from class survival and 15 from class nonsurvival), were used as classifier inputs. A data balancing technique was subsequently used, whose details are as follows. Training and test groups were randomly chosen, with 20% of the samples being used for training and the remaining 80% for the test. Once a 5-min window is selected for training, this window is not replaced for selecting the testing data. Cross-validation was performed for choosing the C and σ SVM parameters. The experiment was repeated 10 times and yielded the mean accuracy rate, mean sensitivity, mean specificity and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Details on SVM classification methods are described in others works [22,21].

This method was described in detail in our previous work [21]. In brief, SVM is a model classifier, based on machine learning, which generates a nonlinear separation surface between two classes defined by instance-label pairs (

The classification problem in Chagas disease is unbalance due to the distribution of the collected data. As there are 135 patients who survived and 15 who died, the number of epochs for one class is smaller than for the other. Such training with an unbalanced data set may generate biased classifiers. The chosen approach to solve this problem was to oversample the minority class, thus ensuring that each class (patients with Chagas disease who did or did not die) has the same number of occurrences in the training data. This was done for all training data sets used in this study. The chosen approach was random sampling by the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). In SMOTE method, proposed by [23], oversampling of minority class is based on the generation of synthetic data by means of interpolation. For each positive example

                            its k-nearest neighbors. The k-nearest neighbors are chosen randomly. We choose k=5. We compute the difference between the vector of features and the k-nearest neighbors of feature vectors. Then we multiply this vector of differences by a random number between 0 and 1 and add this to the original vector of features. The resulting vector is included into the matrix of features in order to increase its size. More technical details can be found in [23].

Classifier performance was assessed by means of the classic indices: accuracy rate, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve.

Classification via SVM was considered correct when it coincided with the clinical progression of the disease, as documented by the cardiologist. Therefore, for a given patient and a given RR series with M epochs, the percentage accuracy rate is defined by

The ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic) is an essential instrument for evaluating the diagnostic test. The ROC curve is a two-dimensional representation of the performance measure of a binary classifier for different thresholds of the classifier output. The ROC curve provides the rate of true-positives as a function of the rate of false-positives (sensitivity versus 1 - specificity). Each point on the curve represents a sensitivity/specificity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of how well a parameter can distinguish between two classes diagnosis (in this case, survival and nonsurvival). The area under the ROC curve is the probability that a classifier will assign a higher classification to a randomly chosen positive example as opposed to a randomly chosen negative example. By convention, the values of the AUC are always 
                           ≥
                           0.5
                        . Values equal to 1 represent a perfect separation between classes.

A set of features used in this study is not standard in HRV series analysis. These features are associated with the complexity of RR intervals time series and are represented by series of symbols. In order to test this influence on classifier performance, a specific test was conducted in which these features were excluded to train a different classifier. Classifier performance was then compared with the performance achieved with the whole set of features (18 features). Then, three cases were studied: (i) clinical features were excluded (T(1)); (ii) symbolic features were excluded (T(2)) and (iii) time–frequency features were excluded (T(3)). In order to evaluate the impact of these changes, a non-parametric difference test (Wilcoxon test) was used to compare accuracy rates and other indices (classifier performance) before and after feature removal.

                     ), since the p-value was lower than 0.5 for most cases. The values of p-value are shown in Table 3

This reinforces the assumption that clinical, time–frequency and symbolic features are relevant for classification. Table 2 also displays the area under the ROC curve for all cases. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was greater when all features were used together (AUC=0.99), i.e., classifier performance improved, which also suggests that clinical features, in association with symbolic and time–frequency features, are relevant for predicting death in patients with Chagas disease.

The results from Table 2 show that excluding clinical features led to a significant decrease in the accuracy rate and area under the ROC curve, suggesting that risk score data such as NSVT, LVEF

                      are relevant for classifying patients with Chagas disease who did or did not die. These indices have been used in other studies [13,24], which stresses their importance for predicting death in patients with Chagas disease. Table 2 also shows that “dynamic” information (features related to SD) is what most contributes to the predictive ability. Incorporating SD to classic and clinical indices increases the accuracy rate and sensitivity, although it reduces specificity.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

In this study, we observed that information regarding the HRV signal (time–frequency and symbolic features) significantly improved the ability to predict the risk of death in patients with Chagas disease. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the SVM was useful for accurately classifying two classes, survival and nonsurvival. The SVM was used, in the literature, as a strong tool for predicting several diseases, as in the diagnosis of cancer [25,26], in the prognosis of knee osteoarthritis [27], in medical images classification [28] and in many applications such as microarrays [29]. This enables the use of this tool in the prognosis of Chagas disease.

Acharya et al. [30] propose a diagnostic system computer-aided, similar to the method proposed in this paper, using several classifiers, among them a nonlinear SVM-based features, as recurrence plot, approximate entropy and Lyapunov exponent to distinguish patients with diabetes mellitus in healthy patients, via RR interval series. The best performance was obtained for the AdaBoost classifier with these indices: accuracy rate 90%, sensitivity 92.5% and specificity 88.7%. The results calculated via SVM with RBF kernel were: 83.3%, 86.6% and 81.7%. Comparing these results with our results (4th column in Table 2), we observed that our results were 95%, 98% and 89%, respectively, this results give a better performance for separating two classes in presence of some pathology.

Previous studies have shown that the SD provides an important prognostic information in patients with heart disease. These investigations show that symbolic variables, obtained by methods similar to those of the present work, are able to detect selective patterns in autonomic cardiovascular regulation discriminating against classes of patients with heart diseases [8,31,32]. These findings and our results suggest that the variables related to the SD can detect pathological conditions characterized by a marked imbalance in autonomic regulation and concomitant increased risk of cardiac events. Thus, it can be suggested that the use of the SD can improve the prediction of the risk of death in Chagas heart disease.

In Voss et al. [31] SD methods combined with other nonlinear methods, such as analysis via Poincare map, was used to discriminate between patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and healthy patients demonstrating that the method revealed significant differences between patients with low and high risk stratification in DCM, with sensitivity and specificity 90%. Our results showed sensitivity and specificity 98% and 89%, respectively (Table 2), which confirms the conjecture that the SD is a good risk stratification indicator in Chagas disease.

The authors in Voss et al. [32] showed that it was possible to discriminate between patients with heart failure (HF) and healthy patients, using joint symbolic dynamics (JSD) to analyze the interaction between changes in heart rate and blood pressure (HRV and BPV). The results showed high-risk stratification in patients with HF (sensitivity 76.5%, specificity 84.2% and area under the ROC curve 81.4%). Again, when we compare with the results in Table 2, we have 96%, 94% and 99% for sensitivity, specificity and AUC, respectively, which shows that our results are still more accurate, in the case of risk stratification in Chagas disease.

The authors in Parlitz et al. [8] used time-frequencial based features, SD based features and OPS based features to classification series of 24h (long term) 15 patients heartbeats with congestive heart failure (CHF). The classification was made in order to distinguish between two classes: healthy patients and patients with CHF. The study shows that these authors obtained accurate rates ranging from 73% to 100% when tested with cross-validation via leave-one-out using a SVM in a two-dimensional space, i.e., they only used two groups features for classification. However, when comparing with the results obtained in this work can be seen that there was a accurate rate 95% (Table 2) for two classes (survival or nonsurvival), something that has not yet been found in the literature, to the author׳s knowledge, in terms of HRV classification in Chagas disease context.

In Parlitz et al. [8] was suggested that SD and OPS based features combined with other indices of HRV in a high-dimensional feature space could improve performance in cardiovascular signals classification, however, this was not done by the authors. This work showed good results in 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              18
                           
                        
                     . However, other studies [33,34] suggest that reducing the size of the feature space can decrease the classification error, thus further studies are necessary in searching for relevant features using feature selection techniques. This can be seen in Table 2, which confirms that there was a worsening in SVM performance to remove symbolic features (features 14–18). This result also confirms the assumption that these features used together are useful for distinguishing different HRV patterns (physiological and pathological patterns).

Predicting the risk of death in patients with Chagas disease is one of the challenges of the clinical management of the condition. Although risk scores are available for prognosis determination [2,35], improvements in predictive ability are desirable, especially for recognizing patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. Our findings demonstrated the prognostic value of SD in patients with Chagas disease, which represents an innovative aspect of this study. Previous studies have used SD to analyze HRV in other applications: to discriminate between healthy patients and patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, to analyze the interaction between heart rate variation and blood pressure, and to classify the heart rate of patients with congestive heart failure [8,31,32]. This study used a different methodology, as we defined entropy, the number of forbidden words and the complexity index from series of symbols from RR intervals and used SD indices to evaluate prognosis. The results achieved in this study suggest that symbolic variables are capable of detecting selective patterns in autonomic cardiovascular regulation which predict death in patients with Chagas disease.

Symbolic features, such as the number of forbidden words, entropy and the complexity index, characterize the “richness” of the signal׳s dynamic behavior. Therefore, two or more different dynamic behaviors can be discriminated based on this information. The larger the entropy of a given group of patients, the more complex (more stochastic and less deterministic) the behavior of these individuals. This degree of complexity is directly associated with the autonomic regulation of the heart. These findings reinforce the hypothesis that autonomic dysfunction may be associated with the increased risk of sudden death in Chagas heart disease, a hypothesis that has been suggested by several authors but still lacks empirical evidence [36,37]. Our findings also demonstrate for the first time that conventional autonomic indices, such as time–frequency indices, also have prognostic importance in Chagas disease.

The study is also an innovative application of the SVM for predicting risk. The SVM has been used in literature as a tool for predicting several diseases, e.g., in cancer diagnosis [25,26] and for medical image classification [28], in addition to several other applications, such as microarrays [29]. Other methods such as linear, logistic and Cox regression are commonly used in the medical field as models for statistical analyses, and this study shows that the use of the SVM is promising in this area of knowledge.

Although the sample used in this study is representative, it is still small. Therefore, further data are necessary in order to achieve more accurate results. Furthermore, a independent data is needed. A second independent sample of this must be included for external validation. Moreover, the sample was initially unbalanced, which could result in a biased classification. However, this problem was corrected by using a data balancing technique which resamples the minority class. Although risk score data such as NSVT, LVEF 
                           <
                           0.5

                         have been used in other studies [24,13], they still have not been validated. The SVM has a multidimensional nature, i.e., it analyzes a set of information in a high-dimensional space, so it does not study individual marker values. Reducing the dimension of the feature space may reduce the classification error. We did some tests with some size reduction methods/selection of characteristics, using techniques like singular value decomposition (SVD) and Relieff (feature selection by relief algorithm) and it was found that all 18 characteristics, which are being used in this study were selected, showing that they are relevant/statistically significant (no redundancy). Thus, we chose to use all 18 features, regardless of a feature selection method. Therefore, others studies are necessary in the search for relevant features using feature selection techniques.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A new strategy for risk stratification using a SVM classifier effectively predicted the risk of death in patients with Chagas disease, with a high accuracy rate, sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the use of new features based on symbolic series, coupled with classic time–frequency and clinical indices, can potentially help recognize patients with Chagas disease who are at a greater risk of death. Furthermore, these results suggest it is possible to extend the application of the technique to problems involving patients at risk of sudden death or problems with predicting ventricular arrhythmias, since death in patients with Chagas disease is usually associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias. These results provide a proof of concept for the clinical application of the technique, i.e., they enable a better assessment of which patients need to undergo ICD implantation and which patients do not. In the future, it may be possible to develop a clinical prediction model through a software that helps the physician by automatically predicting/classifying ventricular arrhythmias and therefore identifying patients who should undergo ICD implantation.

@&#SUMMARY@&#


                     Objective: This paper introduces a method that uses features extracted from symbolic series and time–frequency indices of heart rate variability (HRV) to predict death in patients with Chagas disease. Methods: The study was performed in 150 patients: 135 patients are survivors and 15 are nonsurvivors. The HRV series were obtained from the 24-h Holter. Finite symbol sequences were generated using symbolic dynamics and ordinal pattern statistics from 5-min epochs from series of RR intervals. Fourteen features are extracted from symbolic series: nine features were based from time–frequency indices and five features were based from symbolic indices. Four features are derived from clinical aspects of patients. For classification, the 18 features from each epoch were used as inputs in a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Results: The results showed it is possible to distinguish between the two classes, patients with Chagas disease who did or did not die, with a 95% accuracy rate. The results suggest that the use of new features derived from symbolic series and time–frequency indices and clinical indices show to be a good predictors of death in patients with Chagas disease. Conclusion: A new strategy for risk stratification was developed, in this paper, to predict death in patients with Chagas disease. The method developed in this work can help, in the future, to identify patients who need cardioverter defibrillators. Therefore, the developed tool is an aid tool for physicians in predicting ventricular arrhythmias and identifying risk patients.
