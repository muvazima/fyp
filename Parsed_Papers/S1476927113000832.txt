                  To explore the molecular mechanisms of cholangiocarcinoma (CC), microarray technology was used to find biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis. The gene expression profiles from 6 patients with CC and 5 normal controls were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus and compared. As a result, 204 differentially co-expressed genes (DCGs) in CC patients compared to normal controls were identified using a computational bioinformatics analysis. These genes were mainly involved in coenzyme metabolic process, peptidase activity and oxidation reduction. A regulatory network was constructed by mapping the DCGs to known regulation data. Four transcription factors, FOXC1, ZIC2, NKX2-2 and GCGR, were hub nodes in the network. In conclusion, this study provides a set of targets useful for future investigations into molecular biomarker studies.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a highly malignant neoplasm originating from the neoplastic transformation of cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells lining the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary system (Ahrendt et al., 2001; Blechacz and Gores, 2008). CC accounts for an estimated 15% of liver cancer worldwide and is the second most common primary liver cancer after hepatocellular cancer (Wise et al., 2008; Srivatanakul et al., 2010). For non-resectable cases, the overall survival following diagnosis is less than 12 months (Sirica, 2005) and the 5-year survival rate is 0% where the disease is inoperable because distal lymph nodes show metastases (Yamamoto et al., 1999). The poor prognosis of CC highlights the need for increased efforts in understanding the pathogenesis of this primary liver cancer.

The diagnosis of CC remains a challenge. The most widely used circulating markers for CC currently are carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (Nehls et al., 2004; Reddy and Patel, 2006). However, these markers harbor limitations, such as the false positive results (Ong et al., 2008) and the possibility of elevated levels due to the presence of other types of cancer, such as gastric cancer and gynecologic malignancies (Vestergaard et al., 1999; Van Beers, 2008). Tumor specific genetic alterations have been shown to play important roles in cancer development (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Several genes have been identified to be biomarkers for CC, such as CDO1 (cysteine dioxygenase, type I), DCLK1 (doublecortin-like kinase 1), SERP1 (stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1), ZSCAN18 (zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 18) and LCN2 (lipocalin 2) (Srisomsap et al., 2010; Andresen et al., 2012).

DNA microarray enables investigators to study the gene expression profile and gene activation of thousands of genes and sequences simultaneously. Although microarrays have been used recently to profile global changes in gene expression in liver samples obtained from patients with CC (Hass et al., 2008; Seok et al., 2012; Sia et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013), genomic studies of CC have been limited (Andersen and Thorgeirsson, 2012) in comparison with other cancers. The purpose of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of CC using microarray technology to possibly find markers for CC initiation that may improve the diagnosis of CC. The availability and integration of high-throughput gene expression data and the computational bioinformatics analysis may shed new lights on molecular biomarker identification of CC.

The gene expression profiles of CC patients with normal controls were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with accession number of GSE31370. This dataset was based on the platform of Illumina humanHT-12 v4.0 expression beadchip and deposited by Seok et al. (2012). In their study, Seok et al. focused on comparing molecular features of scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma with those of hepatocellular carcinoma and CC. The original dataset included 26 genechips and we extracted 11 genechips of them for further analysis, including 6 genechips from CC cancer tissue and 5 genechips from the surrounding normal liver.

UCSC (http://genome.ucsc.edu) is an interactive website offering access to genome sequence data from a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species and major model organisms, integrated with a large collection of aligned annotations. We downloaded the human transcription factors (TFs) and their target chromosome region from UCSC (Downloads→Human→Annotation database→tfbsConsSites.txt.gz). Then, we downloaded the chromosome annotation information from NCBI and analyzed the relationships between TFs and their target genes.

From the perspective of systems biology, functionally related genes are frequently coexpressed across a set of samples (Stuart et al., 2003; Bergmann et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2004). The R program Differentially Coexpressed Genes and Links (DCGL) is designed for identifying differentially coexpressed genes and links from gene expression microarray data (Liu et al., 2010).

For GSE31370, we used the DCGL package (Liu et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2011) in R (Team, 2011) to identify differentially coexpressed genes (DCGs) and links in CC patients compared to normal controls. There are two methods in DCGL package to identify DCGs: differential coexpression profile (DCp) and differential coexpression enrichment (DCe). These two methods mainly differ in the measure of differential coexpression (dC) of a gene.

We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) between the expression profiles of all gene pairs. For gene i, the PCCs between itself and its n neighbors in the filtered set form two vectors, X

In order to facilitate the functional annotation and analysis of large lists of genes in our result, we inputted all the DCGs into DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) for GO term enrichment analysis. The DAVID is a program that checks for an enrichment of genes with specific GO, KEGG, and SwissProt terms (Huang da et al., 2009). We chose p-value<0.05 as the cut-off criterion.

@&#RESULTS@&#

We downloaded publicly available microarray dataset GSE31370 from GEO database and applied DCGL package in R to identify DCGs in CC patients and normal controls. We first calculated the dC value of each gene using DCp method and filtered the top 25 percent of genes. To strengthen reliability of DCGs, we further used the DCe method to identify DCGs and selected the overlapping DCGs of these two methods for further analysis. Finally, DCp method resulted in 1677 DCGs and DCe method screened out 540 DCGs. A total of 204 DCGs were identified by both methods and we selected these high reliability DCGs for further analysis (Supplementary Table 1).

To functionally annotate these 204 DCGs, we used the online biological classification tool DAVID and observed significant enrichment of these genes in multiple GO categories (Table 1
                        ). The most significant enrichment was the GO category of coenzyme metabolic process with p-value=0.003318. The other significant GO categories included peptidase activity, acting on l-amino acid peptides (p-value=0.007059), alcohol catabolic process (p-value=0.007259) and cellular carbohydrate catabolic process (p-value=0.008584).

In order to analyze the transcriptional regulation relationship in the initiation and progression of CC, we mapped the 204 DCGs to the known regulatory data between TFs and target genes and obtained 32 pairs of regulation relationships (Table 2
                        ). By integrating the regulatory relationships above, we built a regulatory network using Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) (Fig. 1
                        ). From Table 2 and Fig. 1, we could find that the TFs of FOXC1 (forkhead box C1), ZIC2 (Zic family member 2), NKX2-2 (NK2 transcription factor related, locus 2) and GCGR (glucagon receptor) with high degree formed local networks. Besides, expression of these four TFs was altered in CC patients compared to normal controls.

To test whether these 24 DCGs (the red and dark blue nodes in Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 2) could separate the CC patients from normal controls, we performed hierarchical clustering analysis (Fig. 2
                        ). From Fig. 2, we could find that clustering of conditions portioned samples into 2 groups. Four gene expression profiles of normal controls were clustered together, separated from the gene expression profiles of CC patients. However, the sample of normal 3 was clustered into CC group. We think it was because of experimental error.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

CC is the second most common primary liver cancer after hepatocellular cancer (Wise et al., 2008). The severity of the disease and its clinical heterogeneity combined with the lack of good diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies makes the treatment of CC a major challenge. Since microarray can interrogate expression levels of thousands of genes in human genome simultaneously, it has been widely used in discovery of disease biomarkers (Cooper et al., 2007; Scherzer et al., 2007; Guttula et al., 2012). In this study, differences in expression profiles between CC patients and normal controls were studied using computational methods. A total of 204 DCGs in CC patients compared to normal controls were identified. These genes were mainly involved in coenzyme metabolic process, peptidase activity and oxidation reduction. After regulatory network construction, a total of 24 DCGs were identified to play important roles in the initiation of CC. Of them, the transcription factors FOXC1, ZIC2, NKX2-2 and GCGR were hub nodes in the regulation network. Although ZIC2 has been previously reported to be differentially expressed in CC (Seol et al., 2011), the remaining identified genes in this study have not previously been reported.

In our study, FOXC1 directly regulated 7 target genes, including 3 DCGs and 4 normal genes (Fig. 1). Expression of FOXC1 was elevated in CC patients compared with normal control (Fig. 2). FOXC1 belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors which is characterized by a distinct DNA-binding fork head domain. The specific function of this gene has not yet been determined; however, it has been shown to play a role in the regulation of ocular and cerebellar development (Rice et al., 2005; Aldinger et al., 2009). So far, no studies have reported FOXC1 as a biomarker of CC. However, it was identified as a functionally important biomarker of breast cancer aggressiveness and the basal-like breast cancer subtype (Ray et al., 2010, 2011). They reported ectopic overexpression of FOXC1 in breast cancer cells increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas shRNA-mediated FOXC1 knockdown yielded opposite effects (Ray et al., 2010). Therefore, it remains to be investigated what its potential role could be in development of CC.

ZIC2 regulated 3 DCGs in the initiation of CC. ZIC2 belongs to the ZIC gene family of zinc-finger transcription factors, which are essential for various developmental programs, including the establishment of left-right asymmetry in the early embryo and the development of central nervous system, skeletal and muscle (Merzdorf, 2007). Mutations in ZIC family members determine many clinically significant congenital abnormalities (Grinberg and Millen, 2005). Moreover, aberrant expression of ZIC2 has been observed in small cell lung cancer (Gure et al., 2000), medulloblastomas (Yokota et al., 1996), hepatocellular carcinoma (Spano et al., 2010) and endometrial cancer with node metastasis (Bidus et al., 2006). Our finds were in accordance with previous reported study showing differential expression in cholangiocarcinoma compared with normal biliary epithelial cells (Seol et al., 2011).

NKX2-2 regulated 5 target genes in the initiation of CC, including 2 DCGs and 3 normal genes. Homeobox protein NKX2-2 contains a homeobox domain and may be involved in the morphogenesis of the central nervous system and pancreas (Price et al., 1992; Sussel et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2009). Previous studies showed that NKX2.2 is necessary for oncogenic transformation in Ewing's sarcoma (Smith et al., 2006; Owen et al., 2008). GCGR is a glucagon receptor belongs to the B family of G-protein coupled receptors (Prevost et al., 2010). Stimulation of the receptor results in activation of adenylate cyclase and increased levels of intracellular cAMP. GCGR has been reported to play important roles in controlling blood glucose levels and missense mutation in the GCGR gene is associated with diabetes mellitus type 2 (Hager et al., 1995). Besides, aberrant expression of GCGR in humans causes resistance to glucagon and is associated with pancreatic alpha cell hyperplasia, nesidioblastosis, hyperglucagonemia, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Zhou et al., 2009). However, no studies have reported NKX2-2 and GCGR expression in CC so far.

There are some limitations in our study. First, the microarray data is not generated from ourselves but from GEO database. Second, the sample size for microarray analysis is relative small (6 genechips from CC cancer tissue and 5 genechips from the surrounding normal liver). Third, validation of the results in other datasets or samples is lack in this study. Therefore, further experimental studies based on a larger sample size are needed to confirm our results. This would be a next step in our research.

In conclusion, this study provides a set of targets useful for future investigations into molecular biomarker studies. Functional studies are necessary to elucidate the role of these genes in CC pathogenesis and determine their potential as molecular targets for the development of new CC therapeutic approaches.
