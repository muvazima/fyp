                  The traditional hypothesis of “rationality” is far from perfect. Models of fairness solely based on consequence cannot explain why the same consequence of an action is perceived and reciprocated differently. A reciprocity model which accounts for both consequence and its underlying intention is presented in this paper to illustrate the effect of intention in a traditional dyadic channel where one supplier plays a Stackelberg-like game with one retailer. This research aims to investigate how reciprocity may affect the members’ decisions and the channel’s coordination. In this study, two scenarios are discussed: (1) the retailer has a preference for reciprocity while the supplier does not and (2) both the retailer and the supplier have a preference for reciprocity.

The results show that intention plays an important role in decision making of the supply chain and will significantly change the equilibria. Moreover, an acrimonious supply chain can be coordinated with a simple wholesale-price contract under certain conditions, which can never happen in a traditional channel. A harmonious supply chain, however, cannot be coordinated in any way.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

With the development of behavioral economics, more and more doubts regarding the traditional assumption of rationality have emerged. Many experiments have shown that the decision-maker considers not only the profits but also other behavioral factors such as fairness. Investigations of an ultimatum game demonstrated that a strong preference for fairness for both the proposer and the responder can lead to results significantly deviating from traditional theoretical predictions, although the influence of fairness will decrease and the results tend to approach traditional conclusions in cases of many competitors. Our research is based on a two-echelon supply chain system in which one supplier acting as the leader plays a Stackelberg-like game with one retailer as the follower, focusing on how to set an optimal price. According to Cachon (2003), this kind of model is not complex yet it is sufficiently rich to study important questions in supply chain coordination. Based on the supply chain system, our work aims to develop a model which incorporates behavioral factors so that both the supplier and the retailer are concerned with fairness and the kindness of an action, considering both its consequence and the underlying intention.

Fairness is always a critical issue in the supply chain. However, traditional theories often neglect this aspect and assume that decision-makers will maximize their own profits as much as they can. In reality, many other important factors are taken into account to make a deal. For example, in the ultimatum game, a proposal which is very unfavorable to the responder will not be considered when both the proposer and the responder are concerned with fairness. Otherwise the proposer will suffer retaliation and both parties profit nothing. Therefore, the impacts of the behavioral factors cannot be ignored once the decision is made in terms of game theory. To date, many behavioral models have been proposed based on behavioral experiments. They can be classified into two major types. The first type is the so-called equity-based models which only focus on the consequence of an action. Another is defined as reciprocity models featured by taking the intention into account as well (Korth, 2009).

After comparing many existing reciprocity models, Korth (2009) conclude that the reciprocity model built by Falk and Fischbacher (2006) is the most successful in predicting behavior observed in experiments with computable unique equilibria for many games. Moreover, using two independent parameters for each player’s utility function, it can overcome previous models’ shortcomings and thus model and explain many phenomena such as pure selfish behavior, pure inequity aversion, or pure intentional reciprocity. Our model is developed based upon Falk and Fischbacher (2006) because it is a very powerful tool for predicting behavior resulting from a variety of preferences in many different games.

In practice, the attribution of intentions is an important issue in reciprocity because many relevant decisions are likely to affect each other. For example, political and business decisions often affect some parties’ material payoffs negatively. It will be much easier to prevent opposition if the decision-maker can demonstrate that he is somehow forced by law, international competition and some other external forces to take that action if the response of the negatively-affected parties also takes into account the decision-maker’s intentions (Falk, Fehr, & Fischbacher, 2008). For another example, a hardware store is often regarded as unkind to raise prices of snow shovels during a blizzard because it takes advantage of the accidental increase in demand, while a similar action of a grocer is more acceptable if the wholesale price has increased due to a transportation mix-up (Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1986). The reason for different reception is that the latter is intent to achieve normal profit while the former appears to loot a burning house. Similarly, you may buy a product from a local convenience store with a low price but it is also acceptable when the same product is sold with a higher price in a big mall since you know that the costs are different. In addition, the attribution of intentions is important in law (Huang, 2000). Intentions are the key basis to judge whether the same action is a tort or a crime and whether an action is purposely taken. Thus, the penal code distinguishes quite carefully between the consequences of an action and its underlying intentions. For cases in which a consumer believes that the monopolist has obvious unkind intention, Rabin (1993) found that the consumer might refuse to buy a product from a monopolist at an “unfair” price even though he could get greater material value. In this case, the consumer intends to punish the monopolist and give up the deal. The study of Blinder and Choi (1990) suggests that employers are unwilling to reduce wages when there is high unemployment. Generally the owner believes that the wage level may affect a worker’s propensity to cooperate, which indicates the employer’s underlying intention, especially under the condition of high unemployment.

We first analyze the channel in which only the retailer has a preference for reciprocity while the supplier merely seeks to maximize her

                        “She” and “he” are used to represent the supplier and the retailer respectively throughout the paper.

                      profit. After that, we extend our study to the case where both members have reciprocal preferences. In the paper, we refer to a channel with single or multi reciprocity-preferred members as a reciprocal channel. Our study shows that whether or not the supplier has a preference for reciprocity, the channel can be coordinated with a wholesale-price contract as long as the retailer has such a social preference in an acrimonious supply chain (

                     , where 
                        
                           γ
                        
                      and 
                        
                           μ
                        
                      are the fairness parameters of the retailer and the supplier respectively. Detailed explanations are below). However, it is strange that the wholesale-price contract should have failed to coordinate a harmonious supply chain (
                        
                           γ
                           μ
                           ⩽
                           1
                        
                     ). Furthermore, some counter-intuitive phenomena may appear. In the acrimonious supply chain, the retailer may charge a price which is lower than the optimal retail price of the traditional channel when the supplier’s wholesale price is relatively high and the retail price may decrease with the wholesale price.

Our research makes the following contributions to the literature. Firstly, the present paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first one to investigate a psychological game within the context of supply chain. Numerous behavioral experiments not only demonstrate that the traditional assumption of economic-man is not precise but also show that a concern for fairness is not enough to describe the rule of decisions. Therefore, it is necessary for us to incorporate some psychological factors such as intention into the supply chain since they have non-negligible impacts on decision making. We would like to start this work with a dyadic channel. Secondly, we provide supply chain members with indications of how their intentions affect the interactions between them and derive psychological equilibria. Thirdly, our model indicates that it is possible to coordinate the channel with a wholesale-price contract.

The rest of the paper is organized as followed. Section 2 presents a review of literature related to social preference models, including fairness and reciprocity, and relevant applications within a supply chain context. In Section 3, the psychological game model of considering intention within a supply chain context is given. In Section 4, we analyze the model in detail and derive the equilibria under different scenarios. The impacts of some important parameters on the equilibrium are presented in Section 5. Section 6 summarizes our conclusions and recommends future research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Individuals who have social preferences are willing to make material sacrifices to reward others who are kind to them, and to punish those who are not. Their motivation for doing so does not arise from any prospects of future material reward. Fehr, Fischbacher, and Tougareva (2002) observes that, both in the high and the normal stake condition, fairness concerns are strong enough to outweigh competitive forces and give rise to non-competitive wages. Additionally, fairness concerns may play an important role even at relatively high stake levels. Such preferences not only help account for experimental data from a diverse set of sources, they also are in accord with the facts of everyday experience. Fehr and Schmidt (2006) provide a comprehensive overview of recent papers based on social preference where players not only care about their own material payoff but also about other things like fairness. Hitherto many models have been built based on social preferences of fairness. Generally, they can be classified as either equity-based or reciprocity-based.

Equity-based models assume that the agents have preferences for exhibiting inequity aversion. These agents try their best to decrease the other party’s payoff in order to narrow the difference between the two payoffs (it applies to games with more than two players), even at the cost of sacrificing their own material payoff. There are two prominent models in this domain: the equity-based approaches by Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and Bolton and Ockenfels (2000). The model of Bolton and Ockenfels (2000) assumes that the disutility of inequality is symmetric regardless of who receives the higher payoffs. The subjects compare their material payoff with the average material payoff of the group rather than comparing directly with each other. Fehr and Schmidt (1999) instead argue that individuals have a stronger aversion to disadvantageous (i.e., one has less than others) inequality than to advantageous inequality (also see Loewenstein, Thompson, & Bazerman, 1989). It incorporates the guilt arising from obtaining too much in the model.

An important characteristic of the models of inequality aversion is that they focus exclusively on outcomes. Papers reporting experiments with some other games, however, also derive the conclusion that both intentions and outcome preferences are need to be taken into account. For example, people tend to respond more negatively to an unequal outcome that is the result of an intentional choice than to an unequal outcome brought about by nature. Individuals seem disposed to positively reciprocate kind intentions, and to display negative reciprocity in response to hostile intentions. This is the case even when the reciprocal acts yield no future or current monetary payoffs and might even be costly (Fehr & Gächter, 2000). Those models considering both consequence and intention are called Reciprocity models. Reciprocity means that one responds to perceived kindness with kindness (i.e., positive reciprocity) and to perceived spite with spite (i.e., negative reciprocity).

The model of reciprocity can explain games such as the ultimatum game (Blount, 1995), investment game (Cox, 2001), and mini-ultimatum game (Falk, Fehr, & Fischbacher, 2003) while equity-based models cannot. Cox and Deck (2005) find that negative reciprocity is not significant in the punishment mini-ultimatum game and that positive reciprocity is significant in the trust mini-investment game with a single-blind protocol but insignificant with a double-blind protocol. Another class of models (e.g. Dufwenberg & Kirchsteiger, 2004; Falk & Fischbacher, 2006; Rabin, 1993) also assigns fairness intentions a major behavioral role. In short, substantial evidence reveals that inequality aversion cannot fully explain behavior, and that intention as well as expectations about others’ behavior also matter. Fehr and Gächter (2000) show that reciprocity has powerful implications for many economic domains. It will enhance the possibilities of collective action since it is an important determinant in the enforcement of contracts and social norms. At the same time, however, reciprocity may lead to inefficiency of the provision of explicit incentive because the incentives may crowd out voluntary co-operation.

These two categories of models are different from each other in the following two aspects: (1) In the models of reciprocity, both consequence and intention are simultaneously considered. In many policy decisions which involved game theory, the player wants to figure out the underlying intention behind the consequence as a basis for formulating policy. However, the decision-makers focus on outcome only in the equity-based models. (2) In the equity-based models, only when the follower has the possibility of reducing this inequality will he punish the other party. In the reciprocity models, however, the decision-makers reciprocate or punish their partners on the basis of perception of kindness or unkindness from them.

Another stream of literature closely related to our paper is incorporating behavioral issues such as fairness concern into decision making and the context of supply chain contracting. Behavioral models of decision analysis both in individual decision making and group decision making are proposed by Tamura (2005) to resolve some expected utility paradoxes. Cui, Raju, and Zhang (2007) develop a model in which both parties care about fairness in a dyadic monopoly setting and derive an interesting counter-traditional result that the supplier can coordinate the channel with a constant wholesale price. Katok (2011) and Caliskan-Demirag, Chen, and Li (2010) extend the model to include incomplete information and to other commonly used non-linear demand functions, respectively. Based on the model of Ho and Su (2009) and Ho, Su, and Wu (2013) extend the model of Cui et al. (2007) to a setting with one supplier and two retailers and consider both peer-induced fairness concern and distributional fairness concern simultaneously. Loch and Wu (2008) focus on two social preferences (relationship and status-seeking) and conduct an experiment to show that both social preferences systematically affect economic decisions in the supply chain transactions. Pavlov and Katok (2009) build a model of coordinating contracts with fairness preferences and find that incomplete information about fairness preferences result in rejections. Du, Nie, Chu, and Yu (in press) investigate the newsvendor problem for a dyadic supply chain consisting of two members who have the preference for status-seeking with fairness concerns by introducing a Nash bargaining solution as the fairness reference to formulate the relative fairness. They point out that fairness concerns will not change contracting coordination in certain conditions. Katok and Pavlov (2013) investigate the causes of three factors (inequality aversion, bounded rationality, and incomplete information) on the inefficiency of coordinating a simple supplier–retailer channel. The main result is that incomplete information about the retailer’s degree of inequality aversion plays a more important role than bounded rationality in explaining the suppliers’ behavior. Yang, Xie, Deng, and Xiong (2013) consider cooperative advertising in a distribution channel consisting of a single manufacturer and a single retailer and investigate the influence of the retailer’s fairness concerns. The result shows that the channel can be achieved as long as the retailer is fairness-concerned and certain conditions of model parameters can be satisfied.

This paper considers the standard dyadic channel consisting of a single supplier and a single retailer. The supplier and the retailer play a classical Stackelberg-like game. The supplier moves first and charges a constant wholesale price w (per unit product). Then, the retailer sets his retailer price p (per unit product). For simplicity, we assume that only the supplier incurs a unit production cost c in this channel. The market demand

                      is assumed to be a decreasing function of retailer price p, mathematically,

Both the supplier and the retailer are assumed to have similar mental characteristics. For example, the retailer has a reference point of fairness in his mind: if the profits that he gains do not reach this point, he is likely to analyze the supplier’s intention to see if he is making this decision deliberately or if he has some difficulties that he is reluctant to mention. If the retailer concludes that the supplier is being unkind to him, he will punish the supplier by increasing the retail price, because this will reduce market demand and thus may be harmful to the supplier’s brand. Of course, it may also cause trouble to the retailer himself. However, if the decision that the supplier made is the best thing he could do for the retailer, the penalty reduces. The supplier also has this characteristic of reciprocity.

In our model, both members know the other’s strategy space and payoffs, as well as the benchmark of fairness. This benchmark is not necessarily a point; it is more likely an interval. If an action taken by the supplier results in profits of the retailer far from his benchmark of fairness, the supplier will be considered to be intentionally unkind and will suffer punishment from the retailer. In the working paper of Falk and Fischbacher (2006), two ultimatum games were compared to demonstrate the importance of intention. Under the background of supply chain, the strategy spaces of two members are continuous and thus are different from that of the ultimatum game. Neither of the decision-makers can easily find out whether the opponent is kind to him or not, since the boundary is not very clear. That is what we want to expound in the following parts.

Both the supplier and the retailer have their own benchmark of fairness in their minds, which can be used to evaluate the kindness of the other party. We assume that the equitable payoff of the retailer

                      are both assumed to be positive and are exogenous variables in our model.

We first write out the utility functions of the supplier and the retailer as follows. Here, we use a structure similar to the model of Falk and Fischbacher (2006).

Now we will explain each term of the utility functions. Because the two utility functions are symmetrical to each other, we use the retailer’s utility function for the example. The utility function consists of two parts. The first part; i.e., the profits term, has been extensively addressed in classical models. We therefore focus on the second part; i.e., the reciprocity utility term. The reciprocation utility term is the product of four parameters: they are

As a consequence, it is one of the elements of the strategy of the supplier. This element is used to determine the supplier’s behavior since she does not know the strategy with certainty.

In the following section, we will show how to judge the intention factor for each decision-maker. In games such as ultimatum game, it is reasonable to regard “half pie” as the benchmark of fairness. However, this benchmark of fairness is not suitable for many practical business dealings. If we apply this benchmark to the background of supply chain, it means that the retailer and the supplier are supposed to get the same profits. Obviously, this is not in line with the reality. Under our hypothesis, the way of judging kindness or unkindness is not only by comparing one’s own profits with his partner’s or with his own expected profits, but also the relationship with the reason why he chooses this strategy instead of other optional strategies, and thus the underlying intention of an action may be prominent. We will explain it mathematically in more detail below.


                     Falk and Fischbacher (2006) summarized a series of rules to measure intention factor from the results of a questionnaire. Most of them are reasonable and intuitive to some extent whereas some flaws are inevitable. In their opinion, only if player A chooses a strategy while he has other strategies to reduce player B’s payoff, can player B ensure that player A is definitely kind to him, which implies that the intention factor of player B equals 1. This rule was used to evaluate the intention factor of the employer to the employee in the gift exchange game. Based on this rule, it is not difficult to deduce that the employer is kind to the employee as long as he offers a wage which is more than zero. However, there are many counterexamples to show that this deduction is unlikely to be the truth. For example, it will definitely be deemed as unkind and thus be refused if a firm offers a job seeker 500 Chinese Yuan per month while the average monthly wage of a common employee of this firm is about 2000–3000 Chinese Yuan. The problem lies in that it ignores the average level of salary. Therefore, the conclusions derived by analyzing an ultimatum game can be rarely applied in practice. Consequently, the average level of salary is included as a constraint condition in our model. Moreover, there is another important flaw in the ultimatum game. A small supplier is not expected to get the same profits as a large retailer since they are unequal in scale, strength, contribution and so on. We thus relax the assumption of fairness benchmark in our model. Accordingly, the intention factor

                        ). The reason this matters is because the supplier has at least one strategy to reduce the retailer’s payoff and at the same time also achieve her fairness benchmark, however, the supplier gives up this strategy. This obviously shows that the supplier is kind to the retailer and the retailer will perceive her kindness.

The second circumstance of

                         is a complement set of the first circumstance under the same precondition. At this moment, the retailer cannot be sure if the supplier is faithfully kind to him. If the supplier does not choose another strategy, it is probably because that strategy is not good for her (which means it may reduce her profits) instead of being considerate of the retailer. In any event, however, she does not destroy the retailer’s advantage. Therefore, the supplier is also assumed to be kind to the retailer when her intention of kindness is inconspicuous, i.e.,

However, other conditions cannot provide enough evidence for the retailer to believe that the supplier is intending to do that, because there is a possibility that the supplier’s intention is just self-protection. It is this reason that reduces the significance of unkindness from the supplier perceived by the retailer, thus,

To sum up, according to above discussion and classification, we have two kinds of supply chains, harmonious supply chains and acrimonious supply chains. In a harmonious supply chain, there is only one possibility, i.e., the intention is unambiguous (RH1), and the constraint is

If i is perceived as kind, the bigger the difference, the more reward he gets; if i is perceived as unkind, he will be punished more by j as the difference becomes larger. The player j infers whether i is kind or unkind to him by the outcome term; based on the intention factor, he decides the degree of reward or punishment.

                         at this moment. Said differently, no matter whether the supplier is perceived as kind or unkind, the retailer’s second utility will increase if he takes a reasonable action to reciprocate her.

In our model, the supplier and the retailer play a Stackelberg-like game. The first mover is the supplier, who offers a wholesale price w to maximize her utility, and then the retailer as a responder decides to accept or reject it. If he rejects, the game is over and payoffs are zero for both members. If he accepts the wholesale price, he makes a decision about the retail price p by optimizing his utility. We incorporate reciprocity into this traditional game to investigate how the fairness and intention factors affect the members’ decisions and channel’s coordination. This supply chain is called a reciprocal supply chain. With this background, once the wholesale price is given, the retailer needs to evaluate the supplier’s kindness and intention so as to charge a reasonable retail price. Said differently, the retailer has the ability to reciprocate the supplier’s action by way of changing the retail price. As for the supplier, however, how does she evaluate the retailer’s intention since she is the first mover? Here, we have to introduce the psychological game to solve this problem. The supplier and the retailer make decisions based on their own beliefs, which we have explained in detail in previous parts and will be explained in the process of model analysis.

In a psychological game, the Psychological Nash Equilibrium is the counterpart of the Nash Equilibrium in game theory. The difference lies in the fact that the decision-maker’s utility depends not only on the strategy chosen by other players, but also on belief. Nevertheless, the beliefs are not a part of the strategy space, which means the players cannot change the payoff by their beliefs. Compared with traditional Nash Equilibrium, Psychological Nash Equilibrium requires that beliefs are equal to actual behaviors. Therefore, in the state of equilibrium, we have

                     . This assumption is reasonable, especially for the game in which players are familiar with each other (within a supply chain, the supplier deals with the retailer frequently and they often know each other well) and it is consistent with the past literature on psychological games (see Geanakoplos, Pearce, & Stacchetti, 1989). According to the method of backward inference, we consider the decision of the second mover – the retailer first.

As we can see from previous analysis, the most important thing for analyzing the decision of the retailer (the supplier) is to decide the intention factor perceived by the supplier (the retailer). This was discussed in the previous section and can be reduced to a relatively simple expression. However, with different

                         is different. According to previous analysis, we should discuss the decision problem considering two kinds of supply chains.

                           ), we have two scenarios: RC1 and RC2. The retailer will choose a way to maximize his utility by combining RC1 and RC2 and making a comparison between them. Specifically, for a wholesale price w, the retailer has two possible optimal responsive retail prices, one is in RC1 and the other is in RC2, and he only needs to choose one to maximize his utility. Getting his optimal retail price requires

                           . Therefore, the utility based on which the retailer choose his optimal retail price is

It is not difficult to demonstrate Proposition 1 based on the aforementioned six equivalent relationships (19).□


                           Proposition 1 implies that in the harmonious supply chain, the retailer charges a higher retail price as a response to the supplier setting a higher wholesale price, and charges a lower retail price to reciprocate a lower wholesale price in the harmonious supply chain. This result is consistent with that of Cui et al. (2007). In the acrimonious supply chain, however, the result is a little different: if

                            as the higher wholesale price interval, the result shows that the reciprocal retailer may charge a retail price which is lower than

                            when the supplier’s wholesale price is relatively high. We may attribute this abnormality to the supplier’s intention perceived by the retailer. Up to now, we have merely calculated the retailer’s best response when the wholesale price is given. Subsequently, the effects of the intention will be revealed more when the supplier and the retailer play a Stackelberg-like game and this kind of interaction involving intention will make the game more interesting. We first investigate the channel in which the supplier is a profit-maximizer.

We have already discussed the retailer’s best response in various scenarios when the wholesale price is given. These results will be meaningful to his best response so that we can know how the reciprocity affects the decision. Due to its complexity, the method of numerical analysis is used in the following discussion.

                        Proposition 2 tells us that it is possible that the retail price is decreasing with the wholesale price in an acrimonious supply chain, even if it occurs in a short interval, as illustrated in Fig. 1
                         when the wholesale price is relatively low (of course, we can ensure that the short interval is valid). If

                        . The reason may lie in the following two points. Firstly, a kind action of the supplier is perceived by the reciprocal retailer while an increase in wholesale price brought on by other factors will not distort her kindness as perceived by the retailer. For instance, the raise in price does not necessarily imply selfishness and unkindness. It may be a sort of self-protection action and can be understood (Kahneman et al., 1986). Secondly, the supplier endows the reciprocation utility term with more weight (

It is worth noting that the scenario without considering intention and the scenario when intention is unambiguous lead to the same maximization problem. Two questions arises naturally: why should maximization for the scenario of unambiguous intention be equal to that in the scenario without considering the intention and how can we differentiate them? Though they seem to face the same maximization problem, they definitely have different results. In fact, we can find out the importance of the intention factor by comparing the response functions under the two scenarios. Firstly, when the supplier chooses the wholesale price from the interval 
                           
                              (
                              c
                              ,
                              
                                 
                                    a
                                 
                                 
                                    b
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                        , the intention-based (i.e., the supply chain of considering the intention) scenario has three different corresponding retail prices while it has only one for the non-intention-based scenario. Secondly, in our framework of supply chain, though it is possible to coordinate the supply chain in both the non-intention-based scenario and the intention-based scenario, they have different requirements for coordination. In order to compare them vividly, a graph is given below in Fig. 2

                        Fig. 3
                         describes the impacts of the retailer’s intention on the retail prices of three cases: the cases when intention is greater and smaller and the case of no intention (i.e. traditional case). As you can see from Fig. 3, the relationship between retail price p and wholesale price w is linear when the intention is not considered, while it is non-linear after incorporating the intention into the supply chain. Additionally, when the intention becomes more ambiguous (i.e., smaller

                        ), the part of the curve which is affected by the intention factor becomes linear and has a similar shape to the traditional case. In fact, the members’ utility functions tell us a similar implication: when

                         decreases, the reciprocation utility term becomes smaller, which means the decisions that the retailer makes are more based on consequence than on intention. The reason is that when the intention is not obvious, the retailer tends to regard the consequence as his main basis of evaluating the supplier’s kindness. The basis of consequence here, however, is not equal to the profit-maximizing rule since it implies the preference for fairness concern.

In this part, we analyze the traditional supplier’s decisions first. That is, the only goal of the supplier is to maximize her profit

                              =
                              (
                              w
                              -
                              c
                              )
                              (
                              a

                              )
                              )
                           
                         by charging her wholesale price w in anticipation of the retailer’s best response through 
                           
                              p
                              (

                         given in Eq. (20). It might seem unreasonable to investigate this situation in which only the retailer is concerned about fairness and intention. With the assumption of full information, it might seem that the retailer will also be concerned only with his profit because he knows the supplier is a selfish maximizer of profit. This is, however, not the case. It is possible that an ’economic person’ deals with a ’behavioral person’ and some researchers have looked into such situations (Cui et al., 2007). We will extend our analysis in next subsection to the case where the supplier has the same social preference as the retailer. In this subsection, we aim to get some important managerial insights through this relatively simple case and simultaneously provide a reference benchmark for the next part’s analysis.

Similar to the analysis for the retailer, there are also two steps for the analysis of the traditional supplier’s decisions. Firstly, we will find the most profitable wholesale price for the supplier in each of the three price intervals shown in Eq. (20). Secondly, the supplier derives her globally optimal payoff by comparing the resulting payoffs. For the sake of simplicity, we leave the detailed derivations to online Appendix B.

                        ) in which a traditional supplier plays a game with a reciprocal retailer (who has a preference for reciprocity). It is well known that the supplier is not able to achieve the maximum channel profit with only a constant wholesale price if the two members solely care about their own monetary payoffs (Jeuland & Shugan, 1983). However, Proposition 5 implies that the supplier may be able to achieve it as long as some constraints can be satisfied when 
                           
                              γ

                        . Unfortunately and strangely, however, the channel can never be coordinated if 
                           
                              γ

                        . This is probably because there is no conjecture about the intentions in harmonious channel and both players tend to maximize their own profits since both parties’ intentions are clear. It is also worth noting that the supplier’s wholesale price is greater than her marginal cost when the channel is coordinated. Furthermore, the supplier’s wholesale price of this reciprocal channel is relatively lower compared with the optimal wholesale price in the corresponding traditional channel (both

We now assume that the supplier has the same preference for reciprocity as the retailer. Therefore, we can easily write out the mathematical expression of retailer’s intention as perceived by the supplier as follows:

                           In the equilibrium, we assume that the beliefs equal the real actions. Therefore, the supplier’s optimal wholesale price will be the solution of the following equation
                              7
                              Unfortunately, we know of no technique to derive the analytical solution. Thus, Eq. (34) is used to represent the supplier’s optimal decision.

Because of the complexity of the supplier’s utility function, we are not able to derive the optimal wholesale price in a way which can be expressed analytically. However, the existence and the uniqueness of the optimal wholesale price for the three cases are demonstrated in online Appendix D. Intention-based approaches explain more stylized facts from experiments but, in terms of tractability, come at a cost. Nevertheless, their explanatory power justifies their complexity (Korth, 2009).

By MATHEMATICA, it is not difficult to show that Eq. (41) has no real root, which means the wholesale price

                            cannot be used to coordinate the channel. Likewise,

                            also fails to coordinate the channel.

Therefore, it is straightforward to know that the channel cannot achieve coordination when

Careful analysis of the constraint of Proposition 6 reveals that it has nothing to do with

                                       s
                                    
                                 
                              
                           , which means the intention of the retailer perceived by the supplier will not affect the possibility of a channel’s coordination when both members have the preference for reciprocity. It is well known that the supplier benefits more than the retailer in the traditional Stackelberg-like game if the information is perfect, which means the leader has the first-mover advantage. However, if we incorporate intention into this game, the supplier has to guess the retailer’s intention before she moves and thus this advantage may disappear, or if not, be reduced since our result shows that the supplier’s guess has no impact on the coordination of the channel.

When both the supplier and the retailer have preferences of reciprocity, we have derived complicated equilibria which make it difficult to obtain interesting managerial implications, especially when 
                        
                           γ

It would be beneficial to examine the equilibria carefully before we do this. According to Eq. (42), there are four pairs of equilibria in terms of different conditions in the acrimonious channel.

                      implies that the retailer raises his fairness benchmark, which means his requirement for profit is more difficult to satisfy when other parameters remain the same. Therefore, the supplier and the retailer tend to have conflicts and thus both the wholesale price and the retail price rise. However, Table 1
                      shows that the two members may be in a harmonious state. Both prices are decreasing with

                      until they reach Coordinating Equilibrium. The possible explanation is that as the first mover, the supplier does not perceive unkindness from retailer (note that

                      represents the increase in the supplier’s reference profit. Thus, it would be difficult to satisfy the supplier’s requirement for the profit and she will increase her wholesale price, just as shown in Table 2
                     . As a reciprocal player, the retailer should raise his price as a response, because he perceives the unkindness from the supplier since

One possible explanation lies in the following two points: (1) the intention behind the unkindness perceived by the retailer is not very clear (

                     ); (2) before the retailer knows clearly what the underlying intention of the supplier’s action is, he is likely to make a strategy to minimize his loss or maximize his profit. The retailer’s best retail price

                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                      of Table 2 reflects this, because both the speed at which the wholesale price increases and the speed at which the retailer’s profit decreases are declining as 
                        
                           μ
                        
                      increases. Therefore, the intention plays an important role in decisions, but other factors, such as the sequence of the game, may also have influence, especially when both parties are not very sure about the other party’s real intention.


                     Tables 3 and 4
                     
                      are used to compare the impacts of unit cost c on the supplier’s and the retailer’s prices and their profits in reciprocal and conventional channel, respectively. The wholesale prices and the retail prices are increasing with the unit cost c in the two channels, but both the wholesale price and the retail price are lower in the reciprocal channel. In addition, the difference between the supplier’s profit and the retailer’s profit becomes smaller in the reciprocal channel while in the conventional channel, the supplier gains a large share of the total profit since she has “first mover advantage” and does not have a preference for reciprocity. The total profit of the supply chain is greater in the reciprocal channel. The above results may be caused by the following reason. In the conventional channel, neither the supplier nor the retailer has a preference for reciprocity and they are solely profit maximizers, so the raise in c may aggravate the conflict between the two players. In the reciprocal channel, however, both players not only care about consequence but also its underlying intention. The increase in unit cost is uncontrollable and the retailer knows this, so it is understandable that the supplier increases her price and thus the retailer slowly increases the retail price as a response, which improves the whole channel’s efficiency compared with the conventional channel.


                     Table 5
                      shows that in the acrimonious channel, both the supplier and the retailer will increase their prices as

                      becomes greater, which leads to lower profits for both parties. This is because when the intention of the retailer perceived by the supplier

                     ) from the retailer, the supplier will strike first to gain the advantage by rasing her price. This brings home to the retailer that the supplier is unkind to him (he may think the supplier is kind at first), so it is natural for him to raise the retail price. This conflict results in the decreasing channel efficiency, even though this may be a misunderstanding.

                      happens occasionally, but it appears sporadically and the degree is very small (−0.00003). In addition, the intention is not clear (
                        
                           
                              
                                 ξ
                              
                              
                                 s
                              
                           
                           =
                           0.5
                        
                     ). Thus, the supplier has no reason to punish the retailer and thus reduces the wholesale price since she knows the benefit of reciprocity and cooperation. Although the retailer perceives unkindness from the supplier and the intention factor equals 0.9 (0.9 does not mean that the retailer believes the probability of this unkindness is 90%), he still chooses to reward the supplier by reducing his price.

In this paper, we take an initial step to incorporating the members’ preferences of reciprocity into a dyadic channel, where the supplier acts as a leader in setting wholesale price and the retailer acts as a follower in charging a retail price accordingly. The preference for reciprocity emphasizes that decision makers not only consider the consequence of one action which is caused by the other party but also consider the intention behind it in order to evaluate the other party’s kindness or unkindness as a basis for reward or punishment. Past studies in behavioral economics and marketing have shown that fairness concern is an important norm and thus it has received much more attention than has been paid to intention. The preference for fairness, however, mainly stresses the importance of an action while neglecting the influence of the intention. More and more behavioral experiments show that the intention behind the action may be decisive. Therefore, it is meaningful to study the preferences of reciprocity and to explore their implications for channel coordination.

Our analysis shows that the reciprocal channel can be coordinated by using a constant wholesale price in the acrimonious supply chain (
                        
                           γ
                           μ
                           >
                           1
                        
                     ), which implies that the problem of double marginalization is not necessarily present all the time. This result may be helpful to explain why the wholesale-price contract is widespread – aside from its simplicity of operation, another important reason may lie in that it has the potential of increasing both parties’ utilities as long as they have a preference for reciprocity. However, it is impossible to coordinate the channel with a wholesale-price contract in the harmonious supply chain (
                        
                           γ
                           μ
                           ⩽
                           1
                        
                     ).

The paper also shows that compared with traditional retail price, the retailer charges a lower retail price to reward the supplier’s lower wholesale price and a higher retail price to punish the supplier’s higher wholesale price in the harmonious supply chain. This kind of reciprocation is reasonable and intuitive and is consistent with the result of Cui et al. (2007) in which the members of the supply chain are fairness-concerned but not intention-concerned. In the acrimonious supply chain, however, the retailer may charge a price which is lower than the optimal retail price of traditional channel 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 t
                              
                           
                        
                      when the supplier’s wholesale price is relatively high. This result is counter-intuitive and is different from that of the supply chain in which the members are solely fairness-concerned, and thus the difference between them may be attributed to the members’ intention-concerned preference.

In addition, our study implies that when 
                        
                           γ
                           μ

                     , the retail price may decrease in the wholesale price when the wholesale price changes from c to

                     ), though this result exists only in a short beginning interval. This counter-intuitive phenomenon will not appear in a fairness-concerned channel. Furthermore, when the supplier’s intention perceived by the retailer

                      is ambiguous, no matter whether the intention is perceived as kind or unkind, the retailer is inclined to make his decision the same as he would in a traditional channel. On the other hand, when the supplier’s intention perceived by the retailer is relatively obvious, his decision is quite different. Therefore, based on some counter-intuitive results which will never happen in traditional channels and fairness-concerned channels, we conclude that the members’ intentions do have impacts on the supply chain’s decisions and channel coordination, which implies that our initial step of incorporating intention-concerned preference into the supply chain is valuable.

A simple dyadic channel consisting of one supplier and one retailer is investigated in this paper. It would be meaningful to study the impacts of reciprocity in other more complex channel structures. Additionally, the introduction of asymmetric information may make the analysis more complicated but may be important since the members play a psychological game. Furthermore, the structures of the intention factors (i.e.,

Finally, the influence of the reciprocity preference on the conditions of those coordinating contracts, such as buyback or revenue-sharing, is interesting as well.
