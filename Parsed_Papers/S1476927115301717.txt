                  Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as new therapeutic agents for fighting multi-drug-resistant bacteria. However, the process of optimizing peptide antimicrobial activity and specificity using large peptide libraries is both tedious and expensive. Therefore, computational techniques had to be applied for process optimization. In this work, the representation of the molecular structure of peptides (mastoparan analogs) by a sequence of amino acids has been used to establish quantitative structure—activity relationships (QSARs) for their antibacterial activity. The data for the studied peptides were split three times into the training, calibration and test sets. The Monte Carlo method was used as a computational technique for QSAR models calculation. The statistical quality of QSAR for the antibacterial activity of peptides for the external validation set was: n
                     =7, r
                     2
                     =0.8067, s
                     =0.248 (split 1); n
                     =6, r
                     2
                     =0.8319, s
                     =0.169 (split 2); and n
                     =6, r
                     2
                     =0.6996, s
                     =0.297 (split 3). The stated statistical parameters favor the presented QSAR models in comparison to 2D and 3D descriptor based ones. The Monte Carlo method gave a reasonably good prediction for the antibacterial activity of peptides. The statistical quality of the prediction is different for three random splits. However, the predictive potential is reasonably well for all cases. The presented QSAR modeling approach can be an attractive alternative of 3D QSAR at least for the described peptides.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Over the past decade, bacterial resistance has increased dramatically leading to a huge global health problem (Overbye and Barrett, 2005; Neu, 1992). Bacterial resistance is a natural biological phenomenon that can be associated to their fight for survival. Mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics are very different and complex and depend both on the bacteria and the structure of antibiotics. However, there are several known mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. In the first mechanism, bacteria may acquire genes encoding antibiotic-inactivating enzymes, like β- lactamases. In the second mechanism, bacteria may acquire efflux pumps which prevent the antibacterial agent to reach its target site. In the third mechanism, bacteria may acquire several genes for a certain metabolic pathway that ultimately produces altered bacterial cell walls. This leads to loosing the binding site of the antimicrobial agent, or on the another hand, bacteria may acquire mutations that can limit the access of antimicrobial agents to the intracellular target site via the downregulation of porin genes (Radu et al., 2011; Band and Weiss, 2015; Li et al., 2015). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have recently been recognized as suitable leads in several areas of drug discovery due to their high affinity and specificity toward their targets and quite favorable toxicity profiles (Dathe et al., 1996; Levy and Marshall, 2004). A wide range of pathogen agents like bacteria, viruses or fungi can be inhibited with AMPs through the interaction and modulation of microbial membrane permeability (Bowdish and Hancock, 2005; Brandenburg et al., 2010). The main physico-chemical features important for AMP selectivity for the pathogen membrane are net electric charge, hydrophobicity and peptide length (Yandek et al., 2009). However, the exact mechanism of antimicrobial peptides against the membrane of pathogen agents is still unknown. One of the most effective antimicrobial peptides of great medical interest is mastoparan, isolated from wasp venom (Amin et al., 2003; Hirata et al., 2000; Hori et al., 2001; Sukumar et al., 1997). Mastoparan analogs isolated from different wasp species have improved pharmacological effects making them especially interesting for the pharmaceutical industry due to their different selectivities against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli and low hemolytic activity (Cherkasov and Jankovic, 2004; dos Santos Cabrera et al., 2008, 2011; Leite et al., 2011). Since mastoparans have wide therapeutic applicability and extremely low side effects, the design and synthesis of new mastoparan derivatives are an important trend in preclinical and clinical studies (Bartie et al., 2008; Fan et al., 2011). Unfortunately, the application of methods by which the antimicrobial activity of new derivatives of mastoparan is calculated without requiring the presence of microbial membranes is necessary due to limited knowledge about the mastoparan mechanism of action at pathogen membranes.

Computational methods are a valuable tool in designing and evaluating new compounds because they are fast and cost-effective. Furthermore, they do not require complicated chemical synthesis and testing procedures. Especially quantitative structure—activity relationships (QSAR) and quantitative structure—property relationship (QSPR) techniques are important for drug design since in the absence of a targeted protein X-ray structure they are the only available methods. Therefore QSARs are a chemoinformatic tool to predict the biological activity of potential therapeutic agents by means of the analysis available experimental data (García et al., 2011; Mullen et al., 2011). One of the most important steps in building an accurate QSAR/QSPR model is the selection of descriptors used for encoding molecules under study. As a starting point for building a computational model, descriptors are calculated for as many molecular attributes as possible. However, in further model development a crucial step is the selection of the most appropriate descriptors for predicting the desired activity/property. Usually the selection of effective descriptors is problem-dependent and there is no universal rule to achieve this goal. Also, when QSAR models are built with 3D representation of molecules and descriptors derived from them, new problems emerge because complex softwares with high computation time and complex computer resources are typically used to keep into account the tridimensional structure (Avram et al., 2012; Du et al., 2007; Cerovsky et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2010). Therefore, the QSAR modeling where 3D representation is excluded is an attractive approach. For simpler molecules, the widely used paradigm for building up a QSPR/QSAR model is the following: Endpoint=Function (system of atoms). In the first approximation, biochemical processes are not accompanied by the destruction of the amino acids. Hence, these phenomena can be expressed by the paradigm: Endpoint=Function (sequence of amino acids). The second paradigm is a very attractive alternative to the first paradigm for the cases of peptides and proteins, because the representation of amino acids by symbols A, R, N, etc. is very compact. In addition, this approach, if successful, can indicate a particular function of an amino acid (that is an autonomic system of atoms) in a biochemical process.

The CORAL software (Veselinović et al., 2013; Achary, 2014; Toropova and Toropov, 2014a; CORAL, 2015) gives the possibility to carry out the calculation with a string of symbols which represent peptide structures, using the same algorithms which have been involved in the SMILES-based QSPR/QSAR modeling (Toropov et al., 2012). The aim of the present study is to build QSAR models for calculating the antibacterial activity of mastoparan analogs based on descriptors derived from the simple representation of peptides as a sequence of amino acids. The further aim of this study is to estimate the CORAL software to build up a QSAR model for the antibacterial activity of peptides.

@&#METHOD@&#

The numerical data on the antibacterial activity of peptides (mastoparan analogs, n
                        =33, Table 1
                        ) is expressed as a negative decimal logarithm of minimum inhibitory concentrations (pMIC) and it is taken from literature (Avram et al., 2012). The data for the studied peptides were split three times into the training, calibration and test sets (Table 1). The training set is used for developing a QSAR model, the calibration set is used as the “critic” of the developed QSAR model and the test set is used for estimating the predicted potential of the developed QSAR model in cases of various threshold values (Toropova and Toropov, 2014b). All three studied splits are generated according to the following principles: (a) the range of the endpoint is approximately the same for each sub-set (b) the splits are not identical.

Using CORAL, the optimal descriptor is calculated as
                           
                              (1)

                                    (
                                    Threshold
                                    ,
                                    
                                       
                                          N
                                       
                                       epoch
                                    
                                    )
                                    =
                                    ∑
                                    
                                       W
                                       (
                                       
                                          
                                             A
                                          
                                          k
                                       
                                    
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                        Threshold is a coefficient for the definition of rare (noise) structural attributes, e.g., if Threshold is 3 then an attribute X that takes place in the training set only two times (or less) will be defined as “rare” and the correlation weight of X will be set to zero W(X)=0, i.e. the attribute is not involved in building up a model. N
                        epoch is the number of epochs of the Monte Carlo optimization. One epoch of the optimization involves a cycle of modification of all correlation weights. The Ak
                         is a defined amino acid, e.g., A, R, N, etc. (Toropov et al., 2012) (Table 1).

The models of the antibacterial activity were calculated by the Monte Carlo method. The first step was the definition of correlation weights which provide the maximal value of the correlation coefficient between the DCW(Threshold, N
                        epoch) and pMIC for the calibration set. The second step was checking up of the model with the peptides of the validation set which are “invisible” during model building up. Table 2
                        .

The statistical quality of the calculated QSAR models is defined with the correlation coefficient (r
                     2), cross-validated correlation coefficient (q
                     2) and standard errors of predictions (s).

The statistical quality expressed as the correlation coefficient (r
                     2) and standard errors of predictions (s) for QSAR models of the antibacterial activity for mastoparan analogs suggested in the work of Avram et al. (Avram et al. 2011) based on 2D descriptors together with physicochemical parameters data for the test set were as following: (1) a QSAR model with a number of hydrophobic centers, volume and relative positive charge (r
                     2
                     =0.720, s
                     =0.203); (2) a QSAR model with a number of hydrophobic centers and volume (r
                     2
                     =0.719, s
                     =0.199); (3) a QSAR model with a number of hydrophobic centers, area and positive relative charge (r
                     2
                     =0.714, s
                     =0.205); (4) a QSAR model with a number of hydrophobic centers and donor atoms (r
                     2
                     =0.705, s
                     =0.204); (5) a number of hydrophobic centers, refractivity and relative positive charge (r
                     2
                     =0.700, s
                     =0.219). The statistical quality of the QSAR models calculated with Eqs. (2
                     –4) is similar to the above listed. The authors did not present results for r
                     2 and s for the test set, but rather the difference between the observed and the predicted pMIC of mastoparan analogs. QSAR models presented in this work have better values for the difference between the observed and the predicted pMIC of mastoparan analogs (Table 1). All the above stated facts favor the presented QSAR model in comparison to 2D descriptor based ones.

The statistical quality of the models of the antibacterial activity for the same peptides suggested in the work (Avram et al., 2012) is based on 3D descriptors together with physicochemical parameters data (hydrophobicity, experimental characteristics for hydrogen bond donors, etc.). The statistical quality of these models is the following: s
                     train
                     ≈0.25, r
                     2
                     train
                     ≈0.9; and s
                     test
                     =0.507, s
                     test
                     =0.469, and s
                     test
                     =0.474. Thus, the statistical quality of the models calculated with Eqs. (2
                     –4) is poorer for the training set, but preferable for the external validation set. Therefore, the suggested approach can be an attractive alternative of 3D QSAR, at least for the described peptides (Table 1).

The correlation weights (CW) of amino acids (A
                     k) can be used for their classification according to the values from three independent Monte Carlo optimization runs. There are three types of A
                     ks: with stable positive values of CW—the promoters of the increase of the endpoint value; with stable negative values of CW—the promoters of the decrease of the endpoint value; and an unstable Ak which has both positive and negative values of CW for three Monte Carlo optimization runs (Toropov et al., 2012). Table 3
                      contains the correlation weights of different amino acids (A
                     k) which have been obtained from three different data splits. According to the presented results, amino acids that increase pMIC value are: Alanine (A), Aspartic acid (D), Phenylalanine (F), Isoleucine (I), etc. Amino acids that decrease pMIC value are Glutamic acid (E) and Serine (S). Glycine (G) has an undefined role.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this study, QSPR models were developed to pMIC values for mastoparan analogs. QSAR modeling was performed on a dataset of 33 peptides with optimal descriptors based on the representation of the peptide structure by a sequence of amino acids. The Monte Carlo method was used as a computational technique for model calculation. The predictive potential of the applied approach was tested with three random splits into the sub-training, calibration, test and validation sets and with different statistical methods. The Monte Carlo method gave a reasonably good prediction for the antibacterial activity of peptides (pMIC, Mastoparan analogs). The statistical quality of the prediction is different for three random splits. However, the predictive potential is reasonably well for all cases.
