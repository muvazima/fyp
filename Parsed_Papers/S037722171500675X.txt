                  The complexity of evaluating chance constraints makes chance-constrained programming problem difficult to solve. One way to handle this complexity is by devising satisficing measures for the relevant uncertainties. This paper focuses on solving the stochastic vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) by Satisficing Measure Approach (SMA) that mitigates the dissatisfaction experienced by the customers. Satisficing measures are first proposed for the VRPTW with stochastic demand on various distributions to demonstrate the dependency of customers’ satisfaction towards lack of inventory based on the vehicle's capacity. Similar satisficing measures are extended to VRPTW with stochastic travel times. We integrate the proposed satisficing measures into an existing tabu-search heuristics to solve a set of generalized Solomon instances in a short amount of computation time. Compared with best-known results, the SMA saves the effort to design recourse actions, applicable to many popular probability distributions and produces very competitive results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The static and deterministic vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) deals with the situation where all the input data such as demands and travel times are known in advance. In a practical distribution network, many events can occur and perturb initial plans (Delage, 2010). Due to the uncertainty in customer demand and vehicle travel time, delays are experienced by customers. However, big delays that occur in a priori routing plan are disruptive and lead to poor quality of service. This paper focuses on the context of a stochastic VRPTW, where the customer demand or vehicle travel time is unknown before realization. Solutions to the stochastic VRPTW include a priori routing plans, which assign customers to vehicles and sequence customers in the routes. The goal of this paper is to solve the stochastic VRPTW by a Satisficing Measure Approach (SMA) that mitigates the dissatisfaction experienced by the customers. As the stochastic VRPTW can be complicated with various settings, this paper only contributes to the literature under the static assumption, that is, the information about customers and vehicles is known, and all the decisions must be made prior to the commencement of distribution.

The study of stochastic vehicle routing problem (SVRP) has gained in popularity in recent years and much progress has been made towards understanding the structure of these problems and the computational behavior of related algorithms (Gendreau, Laporte, & Séguin, 1996a). The vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD) is one of the well-known problems in SVRP. The first main contribution to the VRPSD considers the problem involving more than one depot with Poisson distributed demands (Tillman, 1969). The next significant contribution on the VRPSD is made on a chance constrained model and two penalty models (Golden & Stewart, 1978). Dror and Trudeau highlight the asymmetric nature of distance costs (Dror & Trudeau, 1986), contributing to another important milestone in the VRPSD literature. Nevertheless, a major contribution to the study of VRPSD is in Bertsimas (1988) which derives several bounds, asymptotic results and other theoretical properties. In subsequent studies (Gendreau, Laporte, & Séguin, 1995; Laporte & Louveaux, 1993; Laporte, Louveaux, & Mercure, 1989; Laporte, Louveaux, & Van Hamme, 2002), an integer L-shaped method is developed. A tabu search heuristic is used to solve a stochastic vehicle routing problem where customers are present with some probability and have random demands (Gendreau, Laporte, & Séguin, 1996b). More recent papers on the problem include Haugland, Ho, and Laporte (2007), Mendoza, Castanier, Guéret, Medaglia, and Velasco (2010), Rei, Gendreau, and Soriano (2010), and Secomandi and Margot (2009).

In the vehicle routing problem with time windows and stochastic demands (VRPTWSD), each customer has an associated time window. In the event of route failure, the time windows of the remaining customers on the planned route may be violated because of the time spent by the vehicle returning to the depot and resuming its work. The available related literature on the VRPTWSD is limited. A chance constrained model is used to solve a vehicle routing and scheduling problem with time windows and stochastic demands (Ong, Ang, Goh, & Deng, 1997). A stochastic recourse model is applied to a vehicle routing problem with time windows and stochastic demands (Chang, 2005), in which the computation of the expected recourse cost is an extension of that of Gendreau et al. (1995). The integer L-shaped method is applied to develop a heuristic for the problem. But this heuristic is only tested on the Solomon's C101 instance (Solomon, 1987) excluding the vertex demands and the vehicle capacity, and vertices are arbitrarily assigned one of the three demand types in approximately equal proportions. Recently, the VRPTWSD is modeled as a stochastic program with recourse and an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic is proposed for its solution (Lei, Laporte, & Guo, 2011). Computational results show the superiority of the proposed heuristic over an alternative solution approach.

Other than stochastic demands, stochastic travel times comprise another set of uncertainty in the SVRP. The first model that explicitly considers the vehicle routing problem with stochastic travel times (VRPST) is presented in 1992 (Laporte, Louveaux, & Mercure, 1992). In this model, the vehicles are incapacitated, and chance-constrained formulation and stochastic program with simple recourse are proposed. A branch-and-cut approach is used to solve instances on networks with 10–20 nodes and 2–5 scenarios. Kenyon and Morton also focus on the vehicle routing problem with stochastic travel and service times (Kenyon & Morton, 2003). They develop a solution procedure by inserting a branch-and-cut algorithm into a Monte Carlo solution approach to solve large-sized problems effectively. The VRPST is studied to consider travel times resulting from a stochastic process due to traffic congestion (Van Woensel, Kerbache, Peremans, & Vandaele, 2008). The developed queueing models are solved by means of a tabu search metaheuristic.

The VRPTW with stochastic travel times (VRPTWST) is introduced more recently. A two-stage stochastic integer program with recourse is proposed for a problem in which travel times are stochastic and each customer has an associated time window (Wong, Leung, & Cheng, 2003). Ando and Taniguchi consider the VRPTW with uncertain travel times and solve it with a genetic algorithm (Ando & Taniguchi, 2006). Russell and Urban also study the VRPTW where the travel times are random variables with a known probability distribution (Russell & Urban, 2007). The number of vehicles used and the total distance travelled are minimized along with the penalties that appear because of the arrivals outside the time windows. Zheng and Liu propose a chance-constrained programming model for the VRPTW with fuzzy traveling times, and use a hybrid approach including fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm (Zheng & Liu, 2006). The VRPTW with stochastic travel and service times is studied by Li, Tian and Leung, and two formulations based on stochastic programming are proposed (Li, Tian, & Leung, 2010). A heuristic algorithm based on tabu search is developed to obtain the results effectively. But they find no feasible solutions to their chance-constrained programming model, and conclude that the chance-constrained programming model is harder to solve than stochastic programming model with recourse. Recently, a robust optimization approach has been proposed and used to solve small instances for the VRPTWSD (Agra et al., 2013).

In order to improve the service quality in a distribution network, the unexpected behavior of random variables needs to be characterized. One commonly used service quality measure for describing this unexpected behavior is recourse cost. The random behavior of customer demands or travel times could cause an expected feasible solution to become infeasible. This situation is referred to as “route failure”, and when it occurs, some corrective actions can be introduced to obtain a new feasible solution. If the route's accumulated demand at any customer exceeds the actual vehicle capacity, the associated vehicle might be forced to return to the depot in order to reload and resume the distribution at the last visited customer. Recourse cost calculates the additional cost for recourse actions to fix the route failures. However, recourse cost depends highly on strong assumptions of recourse actions.

Another commonly used service quality measure is the probabilistic measure, which is usually the possibility of demands exceeding vehicles’ capacity or arrival times exceeding customers’ due times over assumed distributions. The probabilistic measures are usually included in chance constraints, which force the probability of unexpected behavior to be below a specific threshold (Branda, 2012, 2013; Shapiro, Dentcheva, & Ruszczynski, 2009). The computational intractability of the probabilistic measures arises due to lack of convexity. There are three cases in the computation of the probability (Bianchi, Dorigo, Gambardella, & Gutjahr, 2009): a) closed-form expressions are available; b) ad hoc and fast approximation of the probability are designed and used during optimization; c) the probability is estimated by simulation. Typically, closed-form expressions are not available. The design of ad hoc approximation is strongly problem dependent, and no general rule exists for finding efficient approximations. The simulation is a time-consuming process which is undesirable. For example, in local search algorithms such as tabu search, it is crucial to be able to evaluate the neighbourhood of a solution efficiently.

In many models, the aim is to maximize the success probability in the objective function. But, one of the drawbacks of maximizing only the success probability is that it assumes indifference to the level of losses and gains. It does not address how catastrophic losses could be (or how exceptional gains could be) when extreme (i.e., low probability) events occur. A number of studies have in fact suggested that it is not the case to be completely insensitive to such magnitude variations, particularly with respect to losses (Payne, Laughhunn, & Crum, 1980). More recently, it has been argued that a model which solely maximizes the success probability is too crude to be normatively or descriptively relevant (Diecidue & Van de Ven, 2008).

Thus, the dissatisfaction on service lateness may not be proportional to the amount of lateness in the VRPTW with stochastic travel time. Customers may become more impatient when the service is delayed until a later time. Hence, it is necessary to establish a new service quality measure which could in some extent reflect real attitudes towards delays and in particular, could account for the degree of dissatisfaction over the threshold.

Here, satisficing measures are derived to evaluate the dissatisfaction of customers for insufficient vehicle inventory or later arrival time than due time. The concept of aspiration levels from satisficing has been utilized as a means of quantifying the desirability of investment opportunities with uncertain payoffs (Brown & Sim, 2009). In particular, Brown and Sim aim to provide a framework for measuring the quality of risky positions with respect to their ability to satisfy (i.e., achieve the aspiration level). A more general class of measures, called satisficing measures, is axiomatized. Probabilistic measures are one special case of satisficing measures. It is also shown that satisficing measures have a dual connection to risk measures. In addition, the quasi-concavity property is important computationally, as it readily admits the use of efficient algorithms for optimization over satisficing measures. Their framework does not rely in any way on the axioms of utility theory. Though the primary focus is on a model useful for financial positions, the framework readily applies to other settings in which risk is an important issue.

To fully address the stochastic VRPTW, this paper firstly proposes satisficing measures to demonstrate the dependency of customers’ satisfaction towards the delay process based on their corresponding acceptable level. This acceptable level is the assigned vehicle's capacity level or due time of time window. The satisficing measures are developed on various specific or general distributions, and can be computed faster than the normal probability index. Then, a SMA is introduced by applying the satisficing measures within an existing tabu-search heuristics for the VRPTW. Finally, experiments are performed on a set of generalized Solomon instances to evaluate the quality of the solutions obtained by the proposed SMA.

Our paper has several important contributions to the field of stochastic vehicle routing. First, our SMA can be defined for many popular distributions, including the ambiguous distribution with support and mean support. Our approach, with minimal change in the methodology and implementation, can be easily adopted to solve both VRPTW with stochastic demand and VRPTW with stochastic travel time. Secondly, our heuristics produce competitive results in a short amount of computational time. In fact, we obtain better solutions than the existing literature, while the superior speed is due to the computational tractability of the SMA: it can be reduced to solving a one-dimensional convex minimization problem.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the satisficing measures and the SMA are proposed for the VRPTWSD. In Section 3, we extend the SMA to solve the VRPTWST. In Section 4, we report the performance and the promising results of the SMA when it is integrated into a tabu-search heuristics. Finally, Section 5 concludes with several managerial insights.

We define in this section the satisficing measure for the VRPTWSD. The main difficulty associated with VRPTWSD lies in the computation of the recourse cost. This cost, incurred any time a vehicle fails to satisfy a customer's demand, consists of additional distance travelled to the depot and then back to the customer, and the cost of late services as the vehicle may arrive late to the subsequent customers in the route. Methods to compute the recourse cost often rely on simulation or making extra assumptions about the probability distributions to have an analytical expression for the cost. To get around this difficulty, our proposed measure penalizes the route's failure indirectly by penalizing the negative excessive inventory, defined as the difference between the vehicle's capacity and the route's aggregate demand. We then show that our measure is tractable: it can be reduced to solving a univariate convex minimization problem. Based on the characteristics of this measure, it can be used as a cost component, or as an approximation of the chance constraint, or both at the same time. We show later in the numerical studies that although the SMA does not take into account the recourse cost directly, our solutions still have very low recourse cost.

                         at customer i, it is required to wait until time ei
                        . Each vertex i is also associated with a nonnegative and stochastic demand

                         to be collected. The stochastic demands can be split and unknown until vehicles arrive at the customers. As a result, failure may occur along a route if the total collected demand exceeds the vehicle capacity.

We adopt a factor-based model in which the demand for each customer can be written as an affine combination of some primitive uncertain factors

The proposition follows the definition of the measure in Brown and Sim (2009) so the proof will be omitted. Decision makers would prefer a lower probability of route failure, i.e., a higher

                        , which is the probability that vehicle satisfies the customers’ demand with its capacity C. With this property, our measure can be used to approximate a chance constraint, and can be implemented as a constraint in the optimization model. This characteristic is strongly related to the conservative, convex approximation of chance constraints proposed by Nemirovski and Shapiro (2006).

Using these theorems, the satisficing measure can be computed for each route. The overall satisficing measure of the routing plan can be defined as the sum of the individual satisficing measures for each route.

Since the decision maker prefers a higher ρ, ρ is used as a criterion to evaluate the performance of the routing plan. There are, however, many different ways to define ρ, for example, by taking a weighted average instead of taking the simple summation. One drawback of taking a weighted average is that the decision maker needs to give a weight to each route, which is not an intuitive and trivial task. Thus, we choose the simplest form of aggregation possible so that the model is not complicated by unnecessary technical details.

In this section, the SMA is extended to solve the VRPTW with stochastic travel time. The VRPTWST can be defined in a similar manner as the VRPTWSD except that the customer demand di
                      is now deterministic while each edge is associated with a stochastic travel time 
                        
                           
                              t

                     . The stochastic travel times are unknown until the vehicles traverse the edges.

The ready time of each customer is a strict requirement: when the vehicle arrives at the customer before the ready time, the vehicle is required to wait until the ready time. The due time, however, is a soft requirement. It is difficult to have a strict constraint on the due time since the travel time is uncertain and there is no possible guarantee that the vehicle can surely arrive before the due time.

As in Section 2, analytical results of the satisficing measure are preferred so that they can be efficiently integrated into the heuristics. For this reason, we concentrate on the case when the travelling time between any two customers is independent. More specifically, the travelling time from customer i to customer j is modeled as a random variable

                     . The plot of the function g
                     1(e, ·) is given in Fig. 2
                     . This piecewise linear transformation conforms with the distributionally robust optimization framework since after the transformation, the travel time is shifted towards higher values. A similar idea has been previously proposed to transform the mean and variance of the distribution (Jula, Dessouky, & Ioannou, 2006).

Note that the function g
                     2 needs an additional small positive term 
                        ϵ
                      to keep

                      as a random variable. For a quick demonstration of the importance of this term, consider for example when

Similar to the satisficing measure proposed for the VRPTWSD, the service provider prefers a higher value of ρ. We can thus integrate ρ into the objective function of the problem, and modify the heuristics accordingly in order to solve the VRPTWST. Even though we assume that the service time is deterministic, the extension to stochastic service time is straightforward and does not require any significant changes to the formulation of the measure.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

For the computational studies, the SMA is implemented into the tabu-search heuristics presented in Lau, Sim, and Teo (2003). There are three distinguished features of this heuristics: first, it is a nested approach that combines both the construction and improvement procedures into one, i.e., the algorithm constructs and improves the solutions simultaneously. Second, instead of using a weighted cost, the algorithm uses a hierarchical cost. Finally, the heuristics is developed for the limited fleet size, thus it has a mechanism to force dense packing within a route. This heuristics does not have any randomization in the searching procedure, therefore it is completely deterministic: given the input and the algorithm parameters, we obtain the same solution anytime we run the algorithm.

We have two choices when we implement the heuristics: either to take the satisficing measure as a cost component, or to take it as a constraint which approximates the chance constraint. Since we do not want to create new parameters, in this case the (joint) probability requirements, which may complicate the comparison of our solutions with the existing literature, the SMA will be a cost component in the algorithm. More specifically, for every neighborhood move, the algorithm will evaluate the overall satisficing measures defined in Definition 8 or 11, and the individual costs are ranked in the order of descending importance as

                        
                           •
                           maximize total number of customers served,

maximize the overall satisficing measure,

minimize total number of vehicle used,

minimize total distance travelled.

The algorithm has a holding list to store all customers who are not being served by the current solution. Starting with all customers in the holding list and with one vehicle, the algorithm proceeds by doing the neighborhood search: transfer, exchange, transfer to/from holding list and exchange with holding list. If the holding list is still not empty, the algorithm will increase the number of vehicles by one. Once the holding list is empty or all vehicles are being used, the algorithm will fix the current number of vehicles, and continue the neighborhood search until the stopping criteria is met. The results have shown that this strategy brings about tremendous improvement of packing density on Solomon test cases (Solomon, 1987) without having to rely on a set of good construction heuristics. The algorithm described above is implemented in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and run on a laptop with an Intel Core i7-3517 U CPU @ 1.90 gigahertz and 2 gigabytes RAM.

The experiments are conducted under the assumption that the customers’ demands are mutually independent and follow Poisson distribution. Because our SMA does not use the expected total cost in the neighborhood search process, it is necessary to estimate the expected total cost when the final solution is obtained in order to illustrate how much the cost is in practice. To this purpose, simulation is performed to estimate the expected total cost of the solution, the expected total number of time windows violations, and the expected total lateness.


                        Lei et al. (2011) have presented a way to calculate the expected total cost, but it is not very realistic. For instance, they assume that the demand of any customer cannot exceed the capacity of the vehicle, and that there is only one failure happening on each route. They can then compute the cost using an analytical solution under these assumptions.

Thus, a more realistic way is introduced here to estimate the expected total cost of a solution obtained by the SMA. In particular, the expected total cost is calculated via simulation, and the demand can exceed the capacity. Also, vehicles can make multiple trips to the depot. In addition, the recourse policy is defined as follows: if the inventory (capacity minus accumulated demands of previous customers) on the vehicle cannot satisfy the remaining demand (original demand minus satisfied demand of previous visits on the same customer) of a customer on the planned route, the inventory is first used up, then the vehicle returns to the depot, refills its inventory to capacity and returns to the last visited customer; if the inventory on the vehicle becomes exactly consumed by any customer on the planned route, the vehicle returns to the depot, refills its inventory to capacity and then proceeds to the next customer along its route.

The inclusion of time windows in the VRPTWSD means that in the case of route failure, the time windows of the remaining customers on the planned route may be violated because of the time required by the vehicle to return to the depot and resume its service. In the simulation, it is assumed that customers whose time window is violated are still served by the vehicle. Next, the details of the calculation of the expected total cost are given.

For comparison purposes, we also calculate the cost in our solution according to the formulation of Lei et al. (2011). Then, the calculated cost is compared with the cost of Lei et al. (2011).

The recourse actions lead to extra travel distance for the vehicle, hence, the vehicle may arrive later than the due time of a customer and cause lateness, measured by the difference between the arrival time and the due time at the customer. The expected total number of customers whose time window is missed and the expected total lateness are denoted by E[ω(R)] and E[τ(R)]. Their values can also be estimated by simulation.

For VRPTWSD, no comparative data existed until Lei et al. (2011) derived the instances from that of Solomon (1987). In our experiments, the instances generated by Lei et al. (2011) are used. The coordinates and time windows are the same as the Solomon instances. The demand of each customer is generated according to the Poisson distribution with a mean equal to the customer demand in the Solomon instances. However, the capacity is smaller than that in the Solomon instances.

For the VRPTWSD, it is hard to compute optimal solutions or tight lower bounds (Lei et al., 2011). So the solution obtained by the SMA is compared with the cost reported by Lei et al. (2011), which is the only comparative paper for the VRPTWSD.


                           Table 1 reports the summary of solutions obtained by the SMA on instances of Lei et al. (2011). The details of the solutions are described in the supplementary material. In Table 1, the columns “#Veh”, “φ(R)”, “Φ(R)”, “E[ω(R)]”, “E[τ(R)]” and “Time (seconds)” describe the number of vehicles used in the solutions, deterministic total cost of the solutions, expected total cost estimated by simulation according to our assumptions and recourse policy, expected number of violated time windows estimated by simulation, expected lateness estimated by simulation, and CPU time in seconds respectively. We report only the expectations since these are the values which are widely reported in the literature. Moreover, other performance measures, such as route or customer reliability, are very sensitive to the number of vehicles used or the number of customers. In addition, the joint reliability, similar to the joint chance constraint, can become uninformative when there are a large number of customers.


                           Table 1 clearly shows that demand uncertainty leads to more cost for implementing recourse actions for correcting failures. On Class 2 instances, the values reported in “E[ω(R)]” and “E[τ(R)]” are almost 0. We note that because Class 1 instances of Solomon have a shorter scheduling horizon than Class 2 instances, Class 1 instances are more sensitive to failures in the problem. This explains why we observe positive values for Class 1 and 0 for Class 2. The average CPU time for all instances is 3.05 seconds, which is fast and practical in reality.

In Table 2, the columns “Satisficing Measure Approach” and “Lei et al. (2011)” summarize the results obtained by calculating the recourse cost and total cost of our solutions according to the assumptions and formulae from Lei et al. (2011) and the results reported by Lei et al. (2011) respectively. The columns “E[ψ(R)]”, “F(R)”, “#Veh” and “Time (seconds)” describe the expected recourse cost of the solutions according to Lei et al. (2011), the expected total cost calculated according to Lei et al. (2011), the number of vehicles used, and CPU time in seconds respectively. The columns “#Veh Imp” and “Cost Imp (percent)” show the improvement in “#Veh” and the percentage improvement in “F(R)” by the Satisficing Measure Approach over Lei et al. (2011) respectively. The details of the comparison can be found in the supplementary material. Lei et al. (2011) assumes that the customer demand is less than the vehicle's capacity, and that only one failure happens in one route. Table 2 clearly shows that for most of the instances, the solutions obtained by the SMA are better than that of Lei et al. (2011) in terms of cost, the number of vehicles used as well as in the computation time.

While the readers compare the costs reported in Table 2, it is important to know that the solutions from Lei et al. (2011) are obtained by directly minimizing F(R). Even though our approach does not try to minimize F(R) directly, our solutions are still better in the majority of the test cases compared to the solution of Lei et al. (2011). This shows the robustness and the big promises our approach has since our approach can be applied to a wider range of distributions than Lei et al. (2011). Finally, while our approach does not calculate the recourse cost, our solutions still have very low recourse cost. This justifies empirically that we can penalize the negative excessive inventory as a good proxy for minimizing the recourse cost.
                           
                           
                        

The experiments are conducted under the assumption that the travel times on the edges are mutually independent and follow an ambiguous distribution. Similar to the previous section, simulation is used to estimate the expected total cost of the solution and the expected total lateness.

In the case of route failure, the time windows of the customers on the planned route are violated. Recourse actions can be implemented to correct the failure. A simple recourse policy for lateness can be defined as follows: a special vehicle is separately sent to serve the customer. However, in our simulation, only the overall lateness is estimated, and recourse actions are not considered. This is because our solution depends on the satisficing measure, and the expected total lateness estimated by the simulation is enough to describe the extent of the violating time windows. It is assumed that customers whose time window is violated are still served by the vehicle.

For VRPTWST, we generate our own instances derived from those of Solomon (1987). The capacity, coordinates, demands and time windows are the same as the Solomon instances. The travel time of each edge is generated according to an ambiguous distribution which lies in a family

However, it is hard to simulate an ambiguous distribution to estimate the overall lateness in a solution. Thus, Gamma distributions are adopted in simulation to approximate these ambiguous distributions. For each edge

For the VRPTWST, the solutions obtained by the SMA are compared under AD1, AD2 and AD3. Meanwhile, the solutions can also be compared with the cost obtained by solving the deterministic problem with expected travel time values.


                           Table 3 compares the VRPTWST solutions (under AD1) obtained by the SMA with deterministic solutions obtained by first solving the deterministic VRPTW with expected travel times, and then estimating the overall lateness. It is clearly observed that much less lateness happens in the solutions obtained by the Satisficing Measure Approach than the deterministic solutions with increases in “#Veh” from 7.86 to 8.91 and “φ(R)” from 1038.924 to 1241.833. The details of the comparison are described in the supplementary material.

In Table 4, the percentages of increase in “#Veh” and “φ(R)” are compared with the percentage of decrease in “E[τ(R)]”. It can be observed that a 13.36 percent increase in “#Veh” and 19.53 percent increase in “φ(R)” lead to a 72.58 percent decrease in “E[τ(R)]” on average.

                           Tables 3–5 clearly show that the stochastic solution strategy is better than the deterministic solution strategy with respect to lateness, and more cost is required to handle more uncertainties. Thus, the SMA can reduce overall lateness and provide good solutions for the VRPTW with stochastic travel time.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, satisficing measures are used to evaluate the uncertainties in the stochastic VRPTW, such as stochastic demands and stochastic travel times. The SMA is then proposed by integrating these satisficing measures within an existing tabu-search heuristics for the deterministic VRPTW to solve these two problem variants. From the experimental results, it can be concluded that our approach is a reasonable method to solve the VRPTWSD and VRPTWST. In comparison with known results, the SMA clearly has an advantage of low computational time since the evaluation of the satisficing measure is fast. In addition, the SMA can be developed for many popular distributions, such as Poisson, Gamma, Normal and ambiguous distributions. This means that the SMA can be applied to a wide spectrum of problems, which is a merit for real life, practical implementations.

One straightforward extension is to apply the SMA for the VRPTW with both stochastic demand and travel time, however, there is currently no competitive method to solve this latter problem, which makes the comparison difficult. Furthermore, implementing the satisficing measures as an approximation for the chance constraint is also a direction which is worth exploring. As the approximation of Nemirovski and Shapiro (2006) can be extended to the joint chance constraint case, we expect that our satisficing measure can also be used for the joint chance constrained VRPTW. Another interesting question is to assess how good the overall satisficing measure we are using compared to the weighted average, or for example, the worst case measure

                     . Theoretically, future research work on this area includes proposing tighter satisficing measures and applying the SMA to other types of stochastic problems. Additionally, other metaheuristics could be explored to improve the robustness of the proposed method.
