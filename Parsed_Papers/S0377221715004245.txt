                  This paper examines the conditions for a widespread adoption of Carbon Capture transport and Storage (CCS) by a group of emitters that can be connected to a common CO2 pipeline. It details a modeling framework aimed at assessing the critical value in the charge for the CO2 emissions required for each of the emitters to decide to implement capture capabilities. This model can be used to analyze how the tariff structure imposed on the CO2 pipeline operator modifies the overall cost of CO2 abatement via CCS. This framework is applied to the case of a real European CO2 pipeline project. We find that the obligation to use cross-subsidy-free pipeline tariffs has a minor impact on the minimum CO2 price required to adopt the CCS. In contrast, the obligation to charge non-discriminatory prices can either impede the adoption of CCS or significantly raise that price. Besides which, we compared two alternative regulatory frameworks for CO2 pipelines: a common European organization as opposed to a collection of national regulations. The results indicate that the institutional scope of that regulation has a limited impact on the adoption of CCS compared to the detailed design of the tariff structure imposed on pipeline operators.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The current dominance of hydrocarbon fuels in the global primary energy mix is likely to persist in the foreseeable future, suggesting that there will be no sharp decline in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (IEA, 2011). Against this daunting background, geologic Carbon Capture transport and Storage (CCS)
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        CCS is a generic name for the combination of technologies applied in three successive stages: (1) the capture which consists of a separation of CO2 from the emissions stream generated by the use of fossil fuels at industrial plants; (2) the transportation of the captured CO2 via a dedicated infrastructure to a storage location; and (3) the long-term storage of the CO2 within a suitable geological formation in a manner that ensures its long-term isolation from the atmosphere (IPCC, 2005).
                      represents a technically conceivable option to isolate large volumes of CO2 from the atmosphere. A widespread deployment of this abatement technology to large industrial CO2 point sources could reconcile the world's current dependence upon hydrocarbons with the large and rapid reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions required to prevent the effects of global warming (Pacala & Socolow, 2004). However, the large-scale deployment of CCS faces an enduring economic challenge: as CCS scales up from local, small-scale demonstration projects, it becomes contingent upon the construction of a costly CO2 pipeline infrastructure with national or continental scope (Herzog, 2011).

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the burgeoning analysis of the economics and regulatory issues of CO2 pipeline projects. We consider the case of the ex nihilo creation of a sizeable CO2 pipeline system, aimed at gathering the emission streams produced by a given collection of independent industrial plants and transporting them to a storage site. We address two related questions. First, how far would the price of CO2 emissions have to rise for the CCS technology to be adopted by that collection of emitters? Second, to what extent do the tariff and/or the regulatory structure imposed on the CO2 pipeline operator modify this break-even value for joint CCS adoption?

Over the past decade, a large body of literature has emerged on CCS.
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        A tentative and non-exhaustive clustering of these contributions includes: (i) the applications of top-down dynamic models to contrast the relative performances of policy instruments and to check their influence on the adoption of CCS (e.g., Gerlagh & van der Zwaan, 2006); (ii) the detailed bottom-up analyses on the future prospects for CCS (e.g., Kemp & Kasim, 2008; Lohwasser & Madlener, 2012); (iii) the application of differential game models to analyze the strategic behavior of countries that consider reducing their emissions through CCS while facing transboundary CO2 pollution (Bertinelli et al., 2014); (iv) the investment analyses applying the real-option approach to value CCS projects (e.g., Heydari et al., 2012); (v) the contributions aimed at determining an optimal R&D policy for the CCS technology (Baker & Solak, 2011; Eckhause, 2011; Eckhause & Herold, 2014) and (vi) studies aimed at identifying the tax incentives required for new power plants to be willing to adopt carbon capture technology immediately (Comello & Reichelstein, 2014).
                      Despite the amount of literature, however, little research has considered the spatial nature of this abatement technology (i.e., the fact that sources can be remotely located from geologic sequestration sites imposing the construction of dedicated CO2 transport systems). This relative lack of consideration can probably be explained by the engineering cost studies that typically highlight the inexpensive nature of CO2 transportation relative to the other components of the CCS chain (i.e., capture and storage). Nevertheless, CCS experts repeatedly emphasize the importance of carbon transportation issues (Flannery, 2011). According to Herzog (2011), at least two barriers hamper the construction of a sizeable transportation infrastructure. The first is the “chicken and egg problem” faced by CO2 pipeline project developers: on the one hand, it is not worth building a pipeline system without a critical mass of capture plants to feed CO2 into it, but on the other hand, emitters are unlikely to invest in a costly capture equipment without being certain that a CO2 pipeline will be constructed. The second is the lack of clarity in the regulatory regimes (and the tariff policies) governing CO2 pipelines.

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a modeling framework that analyzes the coordination issue at hand with the help of cooperative game-theory techniques. The theoretical basis of our approach stems from a club theory perspective (Buchanan, 1965) and follows the early works of Littlechild (1975) and Sharkey (1982). Accordingly, the CO2 emitter's decision to install or to not install capture equipment can be viewed as the outcome of a voluntary application to a “CCS club” aimed at aggregating the emissions captured in a given industrial cluster to generate economies of scale in the construction and subsequent operation of a joint CO2 transportation infrastructure. Our aim is to derive conditions for the large voluntary adoption of CCS, as a function of: (i) the price of CO2 emissions (set through a tax or a cap-and-trade system), (ii) the CO2 transportation technology, and (iii) the nature of the tariffs regulation imposed on the pipeline operator.

Second, we consider an application of the proposed framework to the case of the construction of a trunkline system collecting the CO2 captured by 14 industrial facilities located in northwest France and Belgium, and transporting it to the Netherlands.
                        3
                     
                     
                        3
                        To be precise, this project assumes the construction of a trunkline system aimed at collecting the CO2 captured by 14 small to large-sized industrial facilities located in both Le Havre (France) and Antwerp (Belgium), and transporting it to the Rotterdam area (Netherlands), where it can be stored in depleted oil fields in the North Sea. This sizeable project could represent one of the first attempts to build a transnational CO2 pipeline system in Continental Europe.
                      Our findings confirm that spatial pricing issues significantly narrow the possibility of constructing a pipeline tariff structure: any kind of uniform postage stamp tariff impedes the adoption of CCS, whereas geographical price discrimination is more effective. Our findings reveal that CCS adoption is easier to achieve in case of a smaller project that solely considers the 12 largest emitters. Our modeling framework can also be used to compare two alternative organizations for the regulation of CO2 pipelines: a regulation designed at the EU-level and a collection of national-based regulations. Our findings indicate that an integrated European regulation is preferable to ease the deployment of that carbon removal technology. Yet, the choice of the institutional scope of the pipeline regulation (national vs. European) seems quantitatively less important for the adoption of CCS than the detailed decisions related to the tariff structure imposed on pipeline operators.

Our framework should prove useful in evaluating the cost effectiveness of CO2 abatement via CCS. A series of widely quoted studies have attempted to estimate the cost effectiveness of carbon abatement by means of CCS technologies (IPCC, 2005; McKinsey, 2008; MIT, 2007). Apart from the accounting controversies pointed out in İşlegen and Reichelstein (2011), all these studies typically make reference to average cost concepts. However, accounting-only approaches neglect the coordination issues associated with the joint adoption of CCS by a group of heterogeneous emitters. Because of this omission, average cost figures can underestimate the real break-even value. The empirical results reported in this paper document the magnitude of this underestimation and indicate that the difference can be substantial and varying depending on the emitters’ heterogeneity and the tariff system used.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 justifies our approach. Section 3 presents a cooperative game theoretic model of the adoption of pipeline transport of CO2. In Section 4, this framework is used to derive a numerical methodology aimed at evaluating the break-even value for joint CCS adoption. Then, Section 5 details an application of this methodology to the case of a real European project. Finally, the last section offers a summary and some concluding remarks. For the sake of clarity, all the mathematical proofs are presented in Appendix A.

In this section, we justify our approach by detailing the main economic features of a pipeline-based CO2 transportation service. In Section 2.1, we highlight the presence of very marked economies of scale. Section 2.2 reviews the recent models proposed to determine the deployment of a CO2 pipeline system and argues that the decision to construct a CCS infrastructure resembles the decision to create a “club.” Lastly, Section 2.3 introduces the tools needed to analyze club goods and the organizational structures to be analyzed.

Recently, a series of engineering analyses have been conducted to model the economics of simple point-to-point pipeline systems capable of transporting a given steady flow rate of CO2 across a given distance (e.g., McCoy & Rubin, 2008; McCoy, 2009). These studies detail an exhaustive, engineering-based, representation of the CO2 pipeline technology
                           4
                        
                        
                           4
                           A comprehensive presentation of these engineering considerations is beyond the scope of this paper. These studies typically include: (i) a flow equation that describes the frictional loss of energy through the pipe (i.e., the pressure drop) as a function of the fluid's properties (e.g., flow-rate, pressure, temperature) and engineering parameters (e.g., the pipeline length, its diameter, an empirically determined friction coefficient); (ii) the mechanical constraints related to the pipeline's maximum operating pressure; and (iii) the equation governing the power required to pump the CO2.
                         and put that representation to work to determine the cost-minimizing design of a given CO2 pipeline infrastructure (the pipeline diameter; the size of the compression equipment installed along the pipeline).

From a conceptual perspective, these studies bear a strong analogy with the engineering economic methodology used in the natural gas industry. As far as natural gas pipelines are concerned, a prolific literature, stemming from Chenery's (1949) seminal contribution, has combined engineering and economics to guide both investment and operational decisions.

                           5
                           For example: (i) the analytical studies conducted on simple point-to-point natural gas infrastructures (André & Bonnans, 2011; Massol, 2011), and (ii) the numerous applications of mathematical programming to model meshed networks (e.g., De Wolf & Smeers, 1996; André et al., 2009).
                         Using that analogy,

                           6
                           There exists some technological differences between natural gas and CO2 pipelines systems as methane is typically piped in a gaseous state whereas CO2 is piped in a supercritical state (McCoy & Rubin, 2008). Nevertheless, these differences are not sufficient to denounce the validity of this analogy.
                         one may describe the CO2 pipeline technology as an engineering production function that has two inputs: (i) energy (to power the pumping equipment) and (ii) capital (to install a pipeline and the pumping equipment), which can be combined in varying proportions to transport a given future flow of CO2. In the long-run, the CO2 planner's problem amounts to finding the cost-minimizing combination of inputs compatible with this engineering production function.

Using these engineering models, a number of studies have examined how the cost of a simple point-to-point CO2 pipeline varies with the output level. These cost simulations consistently indicate that the technology at hand exhibits very marked increasing returns to scale over a large range of output in the long run (IPCC, 2005; McCoy, 2009; McCoy and Rubin, 2008). The presence of decreasing marginal costs has important implications for the industrial organization of the CO2 transportation industry. In principle, each of the potential users of a given CO2 pipeline system could independently build an infrastructure for itself, but the cumulated cost of these individual infrastructures would be prohibitive compared to those of a common pipeline system. Hence, economies of scale represent an incentive for the aggregation of the emitters’ transportation demands and the construction of a unique pipeline infrastructure.

In recent years, there has been an upsurge in interest in the application of optimization techniques to determine the cost-minimizing design of an integrated CCS infrastructure network (Bakken & von Streng Velken, 2008; Bielicki, Calas, Middleton, & Ha-Duong, 2014; Kemp & Kasim, 2010; Klokk, Schreiner, Pagès-Bernaus, & Tomasgard, 2010; Kuby, Bielicki, & Middleton, 2011; Mendelevitch, Herold, Oei, & Tissen, 2010; Middleton & Bielicki, 2009; Morbee, Serpa, & Tzimas, 2012; Spiecker, Eickholt, & Weber, 2014).
                           7
                        
                        
                           7
                           These contributions are directly related to the operations research literature on the optimal design of a pipeline network, a well-known problem with numerous applications in the energy industries (e.g., Rothfarb et al., 1970; Bhaskaran & Salzborn, 1979; Brimberg et al., 2003; Babonneau et al., 2012; André et al., 2013).
                         While very much needed for indicative regional planning purposes (e.g., to organize the source-to-sink allocation), these optimization models implicitly posit an idealized industrial organization: a unique decision maker is supposed to have total control of the whole CCS chain. However, the validity of such a central planning approach is controversial because, in reality, several independent stakeholders are likely to be involved in the creation of a CCS infrastructure (e.g., the emitters, the CO2 pipeline operator).

                           8
                           This statement is also shared by Mendelevitch (2014) who recently examined CCS deployment using a large-scale market equilibrium model formulated as a mixed-complementarity problem. However, in contrast to ours, this analysis assumes the presence of constant returns to scale in the CO2 pipeline industry (and thus neglects the role of decreasing marginal costs).
                         This fact can hardly be overlooked: according to the policy discussion in Herzog (2011, p. 600), an inappropriate coordination of these individual decisions can impede the massive deployment of CCS.

                              Herzog (2011, p. 600) attributes the lack of deployment of CO2 pipeline systems to what he casually depicts as a “chicken and egg” problem: on the one hand, a transportation infrastructure is required to foster the deployment of carbon capture equipment in a given area but, on the other hand, a critical flow of captured CO2 is needed to justify the construction of the infrastructure.
                         In this paper, we investigate these coordination issues.

Coordination is especially important in the pipeline industry because timing considerations matter. On a given CO2 pipeline project, there is an incentive to organize the aggregation of the emitters’ demands ex ante, i.e., during the planning phase. The size of a pipeline system is mainly determined by the diameter of the pipe, a parameter that cannot be modified ex post (i.e., once the infrastructure is installed). Because of this irreversibility, any ex post expansion in the demand for transportation requires the addition of extra pumping equipment, a move that would either be blocked by technological considerations (e.g., the allowable maximum stress of the pipe) or would result in an excessive cost (compared to those of an optimally designed pipeline with an adapted capacity). Hence, the CO2 transportation service is a good characterized ex post by rivalry and the excludability of benefits.

                           10
                           We refer to Sandler and Tschirhart (1980) for a comprehensive presentation of these notions.
                        
                     

The conjunction of this feature together with the presence of marked economies of scale indicates that the CO2 transportation service resembles a “club good” (Sandler & Tschirhart, 1980). Thus, the construction of a CCS infrastructure amounts to the creation of a club of CCS adopters (Buchanan, 1965). The very marked returns to scale calls for an optimum club size that consists of all the potential adopters. However, the creation of such a club is not granted: it would result from the voluntarily adhesion of the CO2 emitters. A poorly defined institutional structure can create an incentive for a subset of emitters to prefer to either disband or create a smaller club.

Club goods are usually analyzed making use of cooperative game techniques (Sandler & Tschirhart, 1980). A cooperative game consists of the following two elements: (i) a set of players; and (ii) a “characteristic function” specifying the value created by different subsets of the players in the game. A group of players who commit themselves to join together is called a “coalition.” What the members of the coalition get, after all the bribes, side payments, and quid pro quo have cleared, is called an “allocation.” The main solution concept of a cooperative game is the core. The core of a cooperative game consists of all undominated allocations. In other words, the core consists of all allocations with the property that no subgroup within a coalition can do better by deserting that coalition.

                           We refer to Massol and Tchung-Ming (2010) for an illustration of this concept in the natural gas sector.
                        
                     

In the following, we shall consider and compare two types of cooperative games and therefore two types of allocations. First we analyze the decisions of a heterogeneous group of emitters that can own and share a common pipeline system, and thus form a “vertically integrated” club. The club is assumed to gather the individual net benefits of the infrastructure and redistribute them among its members. Second, we examine the decisions of the emitters in the case that an independent pipeline operator can sell CO2 transportation services. Before deciding its construction, the pipeline operator has to design and sign an enforceable long-term contract with each emitter that specifies the amount that will be charged to that emitter for the transportation service. In the theoretical literature, the resulting game is considered a “cost-sharing game” (Young, 1985).

In this section, we present our framework and our main analytical results. In Section 3.1, we present the assumptions and clarify the notation. In Section 3.2, we detail the conditions required for CCS adoption in the case of a group of emitters that own and share a common pipeline system, and thus form a “vertically integrated” club. In Section 3.3, we examine CCS adoption in the case of an infrastructure owned by an independent pipeline operator. In Section 3.4, we show that the conditions required for the creation of a vertically integrated club of emitters are equivalent to those required for the deployment of CO2 pipeline infrastructure owned by an independent operator.

To begin with, we detail the assumptions and clarify the notation.

This paper examines the economics of a CO2 pipeline project aimed at transporting the CO2 captured at a number of industrial facilities and transporting it to a storage site. We let N denote the finite set of emitters that could potentially be connected to that CO2 pipeline system (still, N is a subset of the total set of emitters in the economy in question). The objective of the paper consists of determining the minimum set of conditions that ensure that a pipeline infrastructure connecting all these emitters is constructed. Hereafter, the emitters in this set are indexed by subscript i and we let |N| denote the cardinality of this set and S denote a subset of N.

The project is located in a large economy where an environmental regulation is aimed at reducing CO2 emissions by putting a price on these emissions (either a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system). We let

                            denote the prevailing price for the emission of one ton of CO2. We assume that, though important in volume, the emissions of the emitters in N represent only a tiny share of the economy's emissions so that the impact of the emitters’ decisions on the carbon price

                              This assumption is satisfied even in the case of the large-scale European CCS project examined in Section 4. In this project, the emitters that can potentially be connected to the pipeline system together control less than 0.9 percent of the total amount of CO2 emission allowances in the EU cap-and-trade system. As a result, their decisions to adopt CCS are unlikely to greatly modify the prevailing carbon price. Conceivably, the interactions between the emitters’ decisions and the prevailing supply and demand conditions on the CO2 market could become significant in case of a very large CCS project. To model these interactions, further developments would be needed (e.g., to introduce a complete market equilibrium model for the CO2 market). Such developments are clearly beyond the scope of the present paper. Nevertheless, we believe that this approach is general enough to examine a very large number of proposed CCS projects.
                           
                        

Each emitter faces a binary decision concerning whether or not it adopts the CCS technology. We let σ denote the price of the storage service provided by an independent storage operator.

                              The parameter σ may also be interpreted as a levelized unit cost of storage.
                            For each emitter i, we let Qi
                            denote the annual quantity of CO2 that can potentially be captured, and χi denote the levelized unit cost of the site-specific carbon capture unit. As a result, the amount

                              As there is no global information available about the shape of that cost function beyond these 2|N| local evaluations, it should be clear that we cannot use the arsenal of useful results obtained in the analytical literature dedicated to continuous multiproduct cost functions (e.g., Baumol, 1977; Sharkey, 1982).

                                  facilities, nearly 3.5 billion conditions must be verified). Yet, for small enough problems such as the one considered in the next section, an exhaustive enumeration of all these conditions remains computationally feasible.
                            This assumption suggests that, for a given set of emitters, the construction of a common CO2 pipeline system lowers the transportation cost compared to a situation where the transportation service is provided by several pipeline systems.

In this section, we think of emitters as potential members of a club aimed at constructing and operating a common pipeline infrastructure, i.e., a vertically integrated club. The club is assumed to gather the individual net benefits and redistribute them among its members. We proceed as follows. We first define the total net benefits that could be collectively obtained by any group of emitters S creating their “restricted” club. Then, we explore the conditions required for a club gathering all the emitters in N to build the largest-possible infrastructure, i.e., a pipeline infrastructure connecting all the |N| emitters. Lastly, we examine the conditions for an incentive-compatible sharing of the benefits generated by that largest-possible infrastructure, i.e., those that ensure that no subgroup within the grand coalition could do better by deserting the coalition.

Consider any given group of emitters S, with S⊆N and S ≠ ∅. We assume that they can form a restricted club aimed at operating a shared CCS infrastructure. The club's objective is to install and operate the infrastructure that maximizes the difference between the total benefits obtained by the members and the cost of the infrastructure. Conceivably, the non-adoption of CCS by some emitters in that group S may be needed to obtain the maximum net benefits that collection can provide to that group S. Side payments among the club members may be necessary to reach an agreement.

Formally, a pipeline project aimed at serving the emitters in any subgroup R, with R⊆S, would generate a net benefit equal to the difference between:

We now explore the condition required by the largest possible club N to construct the largest-possible infrastructure, i.e., a pipeline system aimed at transporting the emissions captured by all the emitters.

For that largest-possible infrastructure project to be rationally selected by the club N, it has to provide the members with a total net benefit that is greater than that obtained with any of the alternative infrastructure configurations that connects a subset of emitters. Formally, it means that the total net benefit

So far, we have focused on the total net benefit the grand coalition can provide. But we have not yet investigated whether the creation of such a largest-possible club is a rational decision for each of the potential members. So, this section focuses on the emitters’ individual decisions to join the largest-possible club N.

For the sake of stability, this payoff should prevent each possible subgroup of emitters from preferring the creation of a restricted club (and thus seceding from the grand coalition). Hence, this vector must provide each subgroup of emitters with a total payoff that is at least greater than the total benefit that would be obtained with a stand-alone attitude. So, this payoff vector has to verify the following condition:

A payoff vector that verifies this condition is said to be coalitionally rational. Note that if that condition is verified, the emitters’ individual payoffs are non-negative.

In the game theoretic jargon, a payoff vector that verifies both condition (4) and (5) is said to be in the core of the cooperative game (N,v), where N is the set of players and v is the characteristic function, i.e., the set:

                                  is computationally cumbersome. Two alternative computational tactics can be employed. The first one requires: (i) to pre-compute the values of the function v for each of the possible sub-coalitions S⊂N (which is computationally demanding as the pre-computations requires, for each possible sub-coalition S⊂N, to determine a maximum over a discrete set that has 2|S| elements), and (ii) using these values to verify whether the allocation equation (4) and the

                                  linear inequality constraints (5) are jointly verified. The second strategy uses an equivalent definition of the constraints (5). Using definition (1), these constraints can be replaced by the following equivalent:

We now focus on an alternative organization where the pipeline infrastructure is owned by an independent firm that sells a CO2 transportation service to the emitters. Pipeline operators can construct and operate pipeline infrastructures aimed at serving emitters. Before deciding its construction, a pipeline operator has to design and sign an enforceable long-term contract with each emitter specifying the amount that will be charged to that emitter for the transportation service. In this section, we examine the conditions required for that construction to be decided.

The technology used in CO2 pipelines is reputed to be not proprietary. So potentially there are several pipeline firms that may have access to the same technology and thus the same sub-additive cost function C defined in the preceding section. These rivals can potentially serve any subgroup of emitters. As a result, we assume entry to be free in the pipeline industry.

Following the theoretical literature on contestable markets, in case of an industry where entry is set free, a firm has to take into consideration the possible entry of a potential rival when deciding its pricing policy. The sustainability of an industrial structure based on a unique operator serving all the emitters is achieved if and only if this operator charges a revenue vector

Thus, even in the absence of a regulatory profit constraint imposed on the pipeline operator, these conditions jointly demand that the pipeline operator adopts a revenue vector r that exactly recovers the total cost (Sharkey, 1982). Note that the conditions (8) and (9) are the conditions for subsidy-free revenues proposed by Faulhaber (1975) that ensure that no set of customers pays more for service than their stand-alone cost (i.e., the cost to exclusively serve that group of customers).

In the game-theoretic jargon, any revenue vector r that verifies these constraints is a cost allocation that belongs to the core of the cooperative cost game (N,C), i.e., the set:

Therefore, sustainability issues impose the pipeline operator to propose a cross-subsidy-free revenue vector. Thus, a non-empty set Λ is an important condition for the feasibility of such a pipeline project. Hereafter, we assume that the condition Λ ≠ ∅ is verified. From an empirical perspective, the non-emptiness of this set can be checked using the linear program LP-B detailed in 0.

We now examine the emitters’ decision to adopt the proposed CCS project. Recall that for any emitter i, the amount

As entry is free in the CO2 pipeline industry, a rival could potentially propose an alternative project aimed solely at connecting the emitters in a given sub-coalition S⊂N. This rival would charge a revenue vector

                            and incur a cost C(S). Hence, for the largest infrastructure project to be preferred, it has to provide each possible sub-coalition with a net benefit larger than the one obtained with the rival's project:

To summarize, the construction of the grand infrastructure is subject to two types of conditions. First, according to the theory of contestable markets, the promoter of the pipeline project has to charge a sustainable revenue vector: i.e., r ∈ Λ (cf. the conditions (8) and (9)). Second, the pipeline operator must charge a revenue vector r such that the emitters’ individual benefits provide them with an incentive to accept the operator's proposition (cf. the conditions (11) and (13)). At first sight, these two types of conditions jointly impose numerous constraints on the selection of a revenue vector.

                            that was derived in the benchmark case of a vertically integrated club also affects feasibility when the pipeline infrastructure is owned by an independent pipeline operator.

In the preceding sections, we detailed the conditions required for the construction of the largest-possible infrastructure in the case of a vertically integrated club of CCS emitters and in those of an independent pipeline operator. We now clarify the relation that exists between the benefit-sharing problem of a vertically integrated club and the tariff setting problem of an independent CO2 pipeline operator.

Recall that in the case of an independent pipeline operator,

                        Proposition 2 indicates that selecting a cross-subsidy-free tariff (i.e., a revenue vector r in Λ the core of the cost game) is a necessary condition to obtain a vector of individual benefits y capable of triggering the formation of a vertically integrated CCS club. However, that condition is not a sufficient one. So, we now propose a complementary condition to achieve a necessary and sufficient condition.

This proposition indicates that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the tariff setting problem faced by the promoter of an independent CO2 pipeline project and the benefit-sharing problem faced by a vertically integrated club. It proves that the revenue vector charged by the pipeline operator must provide emitters with a share of the net benefits that verifies all the conditions required for the creation of a stable club of CCS emitters.

From a computational perspective, this one-to-one correspondence also provides a useful simplification. Recall that in case of a vertically integrated club, checking whether a proposed payoff vector y is in the core

Hence, this proposition offers a sharp reduction in the number of conditions to be verified. In the sequel, we make use of these simplifications to examine the role played by the prevailing carbon price on CCS adoption.

In the sequel, our analysis proceeds focusing solely on the case of an independent pipeline operator. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that using the one-to-one mapping function

                        , the tariff setting problem faced by a pipeline operator can systematically be reformulated and re-interpreted as a club formation problem.

In this section, we address an important question: what is the critical value in the charge for CO2 emissions that would allow the adoption of CCS technologies? To answer it, we define the break-even value for joint CCS adoption and propose a linear programming approach aimed at evaluating this critical value. We then consider two extensions of this model. The first extension focuses on the case of a pipeline operator that is compelled to use an exogenously predetermined, non-discriminatory tariff structure. The second one examines the case of a transnational pipeline infrastructure that is supervised by a collection of national regulators.

In the preceding section, we have shown that the deployment of the largest infrastructure connecting all the emitters is systematically impeded if the prevailing carbon price is strictly lower than the threshold level

                              ̲
                           
                        . However, is it possible to obtain that deployment with any carbon price larger than this threshold?

To answer this question, we can observe that the prevailing carbon price does not intervene in the definition of a sustainable revenue vector (i.e., in the definition of Λ the core of the cooperative cost game). In contrast, for any sustainable revenue vector r, the associated emitters’ individual net benefits

                         is reputed to be non-empty for a given carbon price, so is the case with any carbon price level larger than this value. For the pipeline operator, it is thus crucial to determine the lowest value in the charge for CO2 emissions that allows the pipeline operator to charge a revenue vector that is sustainable and such that every emitter obtains a non-negative net benefit.

                                 Faulhaber (1975) among customers.

So far, we have supposed that the pipeline operator is left free to charge any revenue vector in its feasible set. This analysis implicitly assumes that the pipeline operator can charge discriminatory tariffs. However, such a perfect discrimination hardly looks realistic. For example, the pricing scheme used by European infrastructure firms is usually subject to approval by a regulator that does not directly select the individual prices but typically instructs the operator to use a non-discriminatory tariff policy. Therefore, we now consider the situation where the pipeline firm is compelled to use non-discriminatory tariff structures and examine whether the existence of this exogenous regulatory constraint modifies the break-even value for joint CCS adoption.

In this section, we successively examine two types of non-discriminatory tariff structures: (i) the case of a multipart linear tariff; and (ii) the case where the pipeline operator is compelled to offer a menu of tariffs using the so-called second degree price discrimination principles. In each case, we address the following questions. First, is the proposed tariff structure compatible with the conditions for the deployment of a large CO2 pipeline infrastructure? Second, in case of a positive answer to the previous question, does this tariff structure modify the break-even value for joint CCS adoption?

We analyze the case of a possibly multipart, non-discriminatory, linear tariff whereby the pipeline operator is allowed to use a series of k, with k ≤ |N|, observable emitter-specific features (e.g., the volume of CO2 emissions Qi
                           , the peak flow of emissions). Let the vector

                           . Lastly, in Case #3, there is no solution to LP2, which means that the feasible set associated with LP2 is empty. As there is no maximum bound on the carbon price in LP2, a sufficiently large value of

                            can ensure that none of the emitters’ individual participation constraints in (21) is binding. Thus, the empty nature of the feasible set indicates the impossibility to jointly verify the conditions (19) and (20), which means that the pipeline operator cannot implement this tariff structure and recover its costs without generating cross-subsidizations among customers.

                              As entry is assumed to be free in the CO2 pipeline industry, imposing the use of this pricing scheme would create the conditions for a profitable entry for a pipeline competitor serving a subset of emitters, and thus artificially generate a suboptimal organization of the CO2 pipeline industry (i.e., an organization where several firms coexist whereas a single-firm organization would have been less costly).
                           
                        

We now consider a second type of tariff that corresponds to a so-called second-degree price discrimination scheme. The pipeline operator is compelled to design a menu of m different multipart linear tariffs. Knowing that menu, emitters are then assumed to choose the tariff that minimizes their CO2 transportation cost given their emission features.

                           . To avoid indeterminacy, we impose the following restriction: mk ≤ |N|. For simplicity, we use t as a short notation for the collection of these m price vectors.

In that case, each emitter is assumed to rationally select the tariff that minimizes its CO2 transportation cost. This choice in turn determines the revenue charged by the pipeline operator. Thus, we are dealing with a bi-level optimization problem (Bracken & McGill, 1973; Bard, 1998; Colson, Marcotte, & Savard, 2007) where the upper level problem is analogue to LP2 (determining the tariff levels and the minimum value of the prevailing carbon price that are compatible with the conditions required for the deployment and adoption of the proposed infrastructure), and the lower-level problem corresponds to the emitters’ individual decisions.

Regarding the lower-level, every emitter takes the proposed menu of tariffs t as given and rationally selects the tariff that minimizes its CO2 transportation cost. From the pipeline operator's perspective, it means that the maximum amount of revenue ri
                            that can be obtained from an emitter i is equal to

In this bi-level optimization problem, the objective is to determine the critical value in the charge for CO2 emissions that is required for: (i) allowing the pipeline operator to charge a sustainable revenue vector (cf. conditions (25) and (26)), (ii) ensuring the participation of all the emitters (cf. condition (27)), and (iii) taking into consideration the emitters’ choice with respect to the proposed menu of tariffs (cf. the lower-level problems (28)).

From a computational perspective, a reformulation is needed to solve this two-level optimization problem. In Appendix C, we apply the reformulation proposed in Fortuny-Amat and McCarl (1981) to construct the equivalent problem MILP-C which is a mixed-integer linear programming problem.

As in the case of LP2, any attempt to solve this bi-level optimization problem results in one of the three following outcomes. In Case #1, a solution is found and verifies

                           . Lastly in Case #3, there is no solution, which indicates that the tariff structure imposed on the pipeline operator is not compatible with the conditions required for the construction of the infrastructure (i.e., charging a cross-subsidy-free revenue vector and providing every emitter with a non-negative individual net benefit).

In Europe, a number of the projected CO2 pipeline infrastructures will have a transnational nature (e.g., Mendelevitch, 2014). So there is a possibility for these infrastructures to be supervised by a collection of national regulatory authorities. One may wonder whether a state-based regulatory organization could have an impact on the break-even value for joint CCS adoption.

To address this question, we consider the case of a transnational pipeline infrastructure installed across two states labeled A and B. The set of emitters connected to that pipeline can be decomposed as follows: 
                           
                              N
                              :
                              =
                              
                                 N
                                 A
                              
                              ∪
                              
                                 N
                                 B
                              
                           
                         where NA
                         (respectively NB
                        ) is the subset of emitters in country A (respectively B) and 
                           
                              
                                 N
                                 A
                              
                              ∩
                              
                                 N
                                 B
                              
                              =
                              ∅
                           
                         because each emitter is associated with a unique country. To simplify, we assume that the CO2 emissions captured in A are piped to B where the infrastructure transports all the emissions captured in both countries. The notation CA
                        (.) (respectively CB
                        (.)) denotes the pipeline total cost function in country A (respectively B). The total cost incurred in country A (respectively B) is CA
                        (NA
                        ) (respectively CB
                        (N)).

We assume that there are two national regulators and that each of them has an exclusive competence to regulate the pricing structure used by the pipeline operator in its jurisdiction. Each regulator: (i) imposes the pipeline operator to maintain a distinct accounting system on its jurisdiction; (ii) demands that the revenues obtained in its jurisdiction recover exactly the total cost incurred on that territory; and (iii) imposes the pipeline operator to charge cross-subsidy-free revenues à la 
                        Faulhaber (1975). Thus, in each jurisdiction, the pipeline operator is left free to charge possibly discriminatory prices provided that the amount charged to any subgroup of emitters does not exceed the stand-alone cost to serve solely that group of customers. We let rA
                         denote the revenue vector charged by the pipeline operator to the emitters that are using the infrastructure located in country A; and rB
                         denote the revenue vector charged to those that are using the infrastructure located in country B. Thus, the total amount that is charged to an emitter i is equal: to

In LP5, the conditions (30) and (31) compel the pipeline operator to charge a revenue vector rA
                         that belongs to the core of the cooperative cost game (NA, CA
                        ). These two conditions model the restrictions imposed by the first regulator that instructs the pipeline operator to charge a cross-subsidy-free revenue vector that recovers the total cost incurred in country A. Similarly, the conditions (32) and (33) jointly insure that the revenue vector rB
                         is in the core of the cooperative cost game (N, CB
                        ). These conditions impose the pipeline operator to charge a cross-subsidy-free revenue vector in country B. Condition (34) represents the individual participation constraints of the emitters in country A: it ensures that for each of these emitters, the sum of the amounts charged by the pipeline operator in each jurisdiction does not exceed that emitter's willingness to pay for a CO2 pipeline service. The condition (35) represents the individual participation constraints of the emitters in country B.

                         denote the solution of the linear program LP5 which is the break-even value for joint CCS adoption in case of an institutional organization based on two independent regulators that leave the pipeline operator to determine a cross-subsidy-free tariff structure. From a regulatory policy perspective, it is interesting to compare this value

Lastly in Case #3, there is no solution, which indicates that the tariff structure imposed on the pipeline operator is not compatible with the conditions required for the construction of the infrastructure (i.e., charging a cross-subsidy-free revenue vector and providing every emitter with a non-negative individual net benefit).

The program LP5 can also be used in a series of extensions. In LP5, the pipeline operator can charge possibly discriminatory prices. As in the preceding section, this program can also be adapted to deal with the case where the pipeline operator is compelled to use a predetermined pricing structure in each jurisdiction. This extension can be useful to examine the compatibility of two given national tariff structures. This extension is based on a modified version of the linear program LP5 where the decision variables rA
                         and rB
                         are replaced by the proposed price variables together with the associated tariff structure. For the sake of brevity, we shall not further detail these modifications which are analogous to the ones used in the construction of LP2 from LP1.

In this section, we detail an application of our framework to analyze the economics of a European project that involves the construction of a transnational CO2 pipeline system.
                  

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

We consider the construction of a potential high-pressure CO2 trunkline system aimed at gathering the CO2 emissions originating from two large industrial clusters – Le Havre (France) and Antwerp (Belgium) – and transporting them to the Rotterdam area (Netherlands) where the CO2 can be stored offshore in depleted oil fields.
                              21
                           
                           
                              21
                              The context of this case study has been inspired by the COCATE project funded by the European Commission DG Research (reference: 7th Framework Program, Energy. 2009.5.2.2: Towards an infrastructure for CO2 transport and storage. Collaborative Project – GA No. 241381, cf. http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/93104_en.html for a presentation).
                            We assume that this pipeline infrastructure will be constructed and operated by an independent operator. In Europe, entry is reputed to be free in the CO2 pipeline industry.

Using both the French and Belgian National Allocation Plans for CO2-emission allowances, a total of 14 large to small industrial facilities (e.g., coal power plant, refineries, petrochemical plants) have been identified as possible CCS adopters in these two clusters. These industrial emitters are listed in Table 1. For the sake of simplicity, the subset of all the Belgian (respectively French) emitters is denoted B (respectively F).

These 14 plants jointly emit 19.7 million tons of CO2/year. According to the figures in Table 1, there is an uneven distribution of the annual emission volumes as the five largest emitters (Antwerp #1, Le Havre #1, #11, #2 and Antwerp #2) jointly generate 88 percent of these total emissions whereas the share of the two smallest emitters (Le Havre #8, and #12) looks negligible. The case of these very small emitters deserves discussion. Recently, some concerns have emerged regarding the efficiency of an Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) based on a “blanket coverage” that includes all the industrial emitters of greenhouse gases in an economy.
                              22
                           
                           
                              22
                              For example, the benefit-cost analysis conducted by Betz et al. (2010) indicated that a “partial coverage” solely focused on the largest emitters could generate substantial social cost savings.
                            As a result, the EU Commission has taken some steps toward a “partial coverage” scheme whereby emitters that do not attain a threshold level of 25 000 ton CO2 per year are exempted from the ETS. Formally, we let N
                           All denote the set that gathers all the 14 emitters. In case of a “partial coverage” scheme, the two smallest emitters are eliminated from the list of potential CCS adopters and we let

The quarterly emission figures detailed Table 1 indicate that there are marked differences in the within-year patterns of emissions. Some facilities emit a steady flow of CO2 during the whole year (e.g., Antwerp #1 and #2) whereas others have significant within-year variations (e.g., Le Havre #1). These within-year variations in CO2 emissions are of importance as the emission load factor influences the gauging of a pipeline system. Due to data availability issues, the analysis concentrates on the between-quarter variability in the daily CO2 flow rates. Hereafter, we denote

In this paper, we use the data detailed in Table 1 for the site-specific, annual unit cost of the capture equipment and the gathering lines connecting the industrial facilities to the CO2 trunkline system (collection). The annual unit cost for offshore CO2 storage in the North Sea is assumed to be equal to 8 euro per ton CO2 per year. This figure is based on the estimates reported in IPCC (2005).

Regarding CO2 pipeline transportation, a detailed engineering economic model based on McCoy (2009) has been put to work to determine the optimal combination of parameters (pipeline diameter, operating pressures, etc.) that minimizes the annual total cost to install and operate an adapted pipeline system for each possible coalition of emitters in the largest coalition N
                           All.

                            The CO2 trunkline at hand can be decomposed into two subsystems: a first pipeline system connects Le Havre to Antwerp and a second connects Antwerp to the Rotterdam area. Thus, for any coalition of CCS adopters S with S⊂N

In Table 2
                           , we consider a series of attention-grabbing coalitions of emitters and report, for each of them, the total annual costs of the components of an adapted CCS infrastructure and the associated average cost. According to this engineering process model, the annual total cost to install and operate an adapted pipeline system capable of transporting the CO2 emitted by the largest set of emitters N
                           All is €123.8 million which represents 10.5 percent of the total annual cost of the entire CCS chain (capture, transport and storage). Because of its location, the coalition B that gathers the two Belgian emitters provides the lowest average total cost figure: 55.92€/(tCO2 per year), of which 2.47€/(tCO2 per year) are related to the CO2 pipeline system. For the largest coalition N
                           All, the average annual total cost of the whole CCS chain is 59.86€/(tCO2 per year), of which solely 6.29€/(tCO2 per year) are related to the CO2 pipeline system. We can remark that the pipeline cost incurred when serving the grand coalition N
                           All is very close to the one obtained when serving the restricted coalition

                            remains limited.

We have verified the sub-additive nature of the engineering-based pipeline cost function C by numerically comparing, for any pair of coalitions in the grand coalition N
                           All, the cost of jointly serving these two coalitions with the cost of serving them separately. These exhaustive verifications confirm the presence of sub-additivity.

                            Thus, according to the literature on contestable markets, this CO2 pipeline infrastructure is a natural monopoly (Baumol, 1977; Sharkey, 1982).

Using the linear program LP-B detailed in Appendix B, we have checked the non-emptiness of Λ the core of the cooperative cost-sharing game (N, C). We successively consider the two alternative definitions of the grand coalition N: the case of a “blanket coverage” based on the largest coalition (i.e.,

Hence, there cannot exist any rationale for the creation of a club gathering all these emitters.

Using the approach detailed in Section 4.1, we now proceed to analyze the conditions required for the construction of that infrastructure by an independent pipeline operator that is left free to decide its pricing policy. We successively consider two possible definitions for the grand coalition N: either the largest group of 14 industrial facilities N
                        All, or the restricted coalition that only includes the 12 largest emitters

Then, we solve the linear program LP1 to obtain the break-even value for joint CCS adoption

A comparison of these values with the average total cost of the CCS chain reported in Table 2 reveals important policy implications for the deployment of CCS technologies. Indeed, most of the accounting-based studies seek to evaluate the average total cost of plausible CCS chains and implicitly assume that it gives the break-even price required to trigger investment in CCS capabilities. Yet our finding indicates that this approach can significantly underestimate the price at which CCS will be adopted by the grand coalition at stake. For example, below a CO2 price of 66.8€/t, there is no way to obtain the adhesion of all emitters in N
                        All to the infrastructure project. The difference between that price level and the average total cost of the whole CCS chain is larger than 6.9€/(tCO2 per year) and clearly matters as it represents 110 percent of the average total cost of the CO2 pipeline system.

Last but not least, a few words can be added on the absolute levels of these break-even prices. These absolute thresholds, although relatively high compared to values of the carbon prices nowadays, do not seem unattainable in the mid-run. For example, the IEA carbon price assumptions used in IEA (2011), range from $45 to $120 (USD 2010) per ton by 2035.

                           The 450 ppm voluntarist scenario in IEA (2011) yields much higher carbon values in 2035, at 120 USD2010 per ton.
                        
                        
                     

We now apply the framework detailed in Section 4.2 to analyze a series of plausible tariffs structures that could be imposed on the CO2 pipeline operator. In this section, we first present two series of conceivable tariffs before discussing their impacts on the break-even value for joint CCS adoption.

Inspired by the natural gas analogue, the discussion focuses on two main classes of tariff structures. First, we present the so-called ‘postage stamp’ pricing systems that consist of determining a uniform toll structure that is levied on all the injection points to the pipeline system (Hewicker & Kesting, 2009).
                           28
                        
                        
                           28
                           In the European natural gas industry, the implementation of ‘postage stamp’ pipeline pricing systems is usually motivated by their simplicity and their perceived fairness (cf. David & Percebois, 2004) for a presentation of the ‘postage stamp’ pricing system implemented in Denmark, Spain, Finland, and Sweden).
                         Yet, it compels a charging of the same rate, irrespective of the location of the CO2 emitters, and thus neglects spatial issues. So, we also consider a second class of pricing systems that reflects a third-degree price discrimination based on location.

We introduce three types of ‘postage stamp’ tariffs: (i) simple linear tariff, (ii) unique multi-part tariffs, and (iii) a menu of multipart tariffs. The first two can be examined using the concepts detailed in Section 4.2.1. The third is based on a second-degree price discrimination scheme and is thus examined using the approach detailed in Section 4.2.2. For the sake of brevity, all these tariffs are summarized in Table 4.

To begin with, we focus on the simplest case: a single-part unit price. We analyze two possible pricing schemes. In the first case (Tariff #PS1), the revenue charged to each emitter is obtained using the transportation price per unit volume of CO2 transported tQ
                              . In the second (Tariff #PS2), emitters are required to pay for the maximum capacity (i.e., the peak flow rate of their emissions) given a unit price 
                                 
                                    t
                                    
                                       q
                                       ¯
                                    
                                 
                               per unit of capacity.

As the ‘postage stamp’ tariff structures used for natural gas pipelines typically combine several elements, we also consider three two-part tariffs. In Tariff #PS3, the revenue charged to each emitter includes a fixed charge tf
                               and a volume-related term based on the unit price tQ
                              . Tariff #PS4 is similar except that the volume-related component is replaced by a capacity-related one using the unit capacity price 
                                 
                                    t
                                    
                                       q
                                       ¯
                                    
                                 
                              . Tariff #PS5 corresponds to another variation where there are no fixed charges but the pipeline operator is left free to charge a price per unit of volume transported and a price per unit of capacity.

As it is conceivable to combine a ‘postage stamp’ tariff structure with a second-degree price discrimination scheme, we also analyze the case where the pipeline operator is allowed to create a menu of two two-part tariffs. Such a menu could take into consideration the fact that there are marked differences in the transportation services required by the different users.

Location can be used as an objective attribute to implement a third-degree price discrimination. So, we now assume that the pipeline operator is allowed to charge possibly different tariffs depending on the location of each of the emitters.

Compared to the non-discriminatory cases above, one can expect that a third-degree price discrimination provides the pipeline operator with an enlarged feasible set for its pricing policy. To what extent can this relaxation facilitate CCS adoption? To gain insight on that issue, one may compare the solutions obtained with each of the ‘postage stamp’ tariff structures above and those obtained with their location-specific analogue denoted Tariff #LS1 to Tariff #LS8 (cf. Table 5
                           ). For the sake of clarity, the location-dependent tariff parameters are superscripted with B (respectively F) for Belgian (respectively French) emitters.

@&#RESULTS@&#

We have successively tested these tariffs structures using the programs LP2 or MILP-C. In Table 6
                           , we report the break-even value for joint CCS adoption obtained when solving these programs for the grand coalition of emitters N
                           All (Case I) and for the restricted coalition 
                              
                                 N

                                       C
                                    
                                    
                                       O
                                       2
                                    
                                 
                              
                            that solely includes the largest emitters (Case II). Several observations can be made from these results.

First, spatial issues matter! Indeed, the implementation of a ‘postage stamp’ pricing system that neglects the emitters’ difference in locations systematically impedes the construction of the proposed CO2 transportation infrastructure. Our investigations confirm that such a tariff system would clearly penalize the Belgian emitters because they would be charged an amount larger than the stand-alone cost to construct a dedicated pipeline system gauged for these two emitters.

Second, designing a non-discriminatory pipeline tariff compatible with the widest possible adoption of CCS technologies is a difficult task! According to the results obtained for the grand coalition N
                           All (Case I), very few tariffs (only the multipart tariffs #LS4 and #LS7 based on a fixed charge and a capacity-based component) verify the conditions for a non-empty feasible set for the programs LP2 or MILP-C. This finding suggests that imposing a poorly-defined, non-discriminatory, pricing scheme (e.g., a volume-based tariff) is likely to hamper the construction of a CCS chain capable of capturing the emissions of all these 14 plants. In contrast, the results obtained with the coalition 
                              
                                 N
                                 
                                    ≥
                                    25
                                    
                                    
                                       kiloton
                                       C
                                    
                                    
                                       O
                                       2
                                    
                                 
                              
                            (Case II) indicate that achieving a “partial coverage” is less restrictive (as six of eight tariffs are compatible with a non-empty feasible set for the programs LP2 or MILP-C). Given the limited environmental impact of the two smallest emitters, this finding questions the relevance of a “blanket coverage” target for the promoters of that CO2 pipeline project.
                        

Third, the obligation to use a non-discriminatory pricing scheme for the pipeline component is non-neutral on the break-even value for joint CCS adoption. No matter what definition is adopted for the grand coalition (either N
                           All or

                           All), that difference attains 11.24€/(tCO2 per year), that is 1.8 times the average cost of the pipeline system in that configuration.

Lastly, it is interesting to compare the break-even value for joint CCS adoption 
                              
                                 p
                                 
                                    C
                                    
                                       O
                                       2
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    *
                                    *
                                 
                              
                            obtained when using a menu of two-part tariffs to those obtained when a unique two-part tariff is implemented (e.g., Tariff #LS4 vs. Tariff #LS7). No matter what definition is adopted for the grand coalition N, the obtained break-even values 
                              
                                 p
                                 
                                    C
                                    
                                       O
                                       2
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    *
                                    *
                                 
                              
                            are systematically identical. This indicates that imposing such a second-degree price discrimination scheme does not at all ease the adoption of the CCS technology. We are going to argue that this seemingly surprising result is not that surprising! Indeed, the analysis of the solutions of the mathematical programs MILP-C confirms that the two optimum tariffs are identical. Intuitively, this outcome suggests that the pipeline operator cannot offer some volume or capacity related rebates to “large” users without charging extra revenue to the “small” users (recall that the pipeline operator has to recover its costs). Interestingly, these “small” users are typically those with the lowest willingness to pay per (either volume or capacity) unit of CO2 pipeline service and are thus the ones with a binding participation constraint.

The infrastructure at hand has a transnational nature, which raises a policy issue: “Should the regulation of that infrastructure be organized at the national level or at the EU-level?”

To address this question, we follow the analysis detailed in Section 4.3 and check whether or not the extra-requirements imposed by national regulators have an influence on the break-even value for joint CCS adoption. So, we now suppose that there exists two local (i.e., national) regulators and that each of them has an exclusive competence to regulate the pricing structure used by the pipeline operator in its jurisdiction. In the first row of Table 7, we report the break-even values 
                           
                              p

                         obtained when solving the linear program LP5 with each of the two alternative definitions of the grand coalition N
                        All and

                        .

We have also considered the case of a pipeline operator that is compelled to use a predetermined tariff structure in each jurisdiction. In the second row of Table 7, we report 
                           
                              p
                              
                                 C
                                 
                                    O
                                    2

                                 National
                              
                           
                         the break-even values for joint CCS adoption assuming that the two regulators instruct the pipeline operator to use a multipart linear tariff similar to #LS4 (i.e., a two-part tariff based on a fixed term and a capacity component).
                           29
                        
                        
                           29
                           Remark that the distinction between ‘postage stamp’ tariffs and location-specific ones is pointless here because this national-based institutional organization allows prices to differ in each country. Thus, the pipeline operator is implicitly allowed to charge location-specific prices.
                        
                     

From these results, several facts stand out. First, we focus on

                         the break-even value for joint CCS adoption obtained in case of a unique transnational regulator provides a direct assessment of the impact of a national-based regulatory organization on the adoption of CCS. Compared to the values

                         reported in Table 3, these results indicate that the geographical scope of the regulation has zero impact on CCS adoption for a pipeline project aimed at gathering the emissions from the restricted coalition

                              N

                         is substantially increased in case of two national regulators. For a CCS project developer, this finding suggests that CCS adoption is harder to achieve in a project aimed at connecting all the possible emitters to a common infrastructure than in an alternative project solely focused on the largest emitters.

Second, we focus on the situation where the two regulators impose the use of non-discriminatory tariffs and examine the break-even values

                        . A comparison of the results reported in Table 7 with those in Table 6 (cf. Tariff LS#4) indicates that a collection of national regulations systematically imposes a net increase in the break-even value for joint CCS adoption compared to a regulation organized at the EU-level. Though that net increase remains modest (

These modest increases suggest that for a feasible location-specific pricing structure, implementing a national-based regulation may not play a major role compared to the choice of the grand coalition of emitters.

                           Following a remark raised by a referee, we note that an institutional design based on two national regulators allows the pipeline operator to charge different prices in the two countries. Hence, the pipeline operator is ‘de facto’ allowed to charge location-specific prices in the two countries. That is why the comparisons conducted in this subsection are restricted to the location-specific tariffs discussed in Section 5.3.

                         reported in Table 7 is close to 11.3€/tCO2 a magnitude larger than the average total cost of the CO2 pipeline). This finding has important implications for the deployment of the CCS technology. Given the existing regulatory and tariff uncertainties observed in the CO2 pipeline industry (Herzog, 2011), a pipeline project developer that cannot precisely anticipate the level of the future carbon prices may rationally prefer to design its infrastructure so as to solely serve the largest emitters (i.e., those in the smaller CCS club

The question of how to design an appropriate regulatory framework for CO2 pipeline systems is one of the key design issues that regulators and policy makers across the world will have to address to clarify the conditions for the deployment of a large-scale CCS industry. In this paper, we analyze the role played by pipeline-related regulations on the emitter's decision to adopt the CCS technology and thus share the common CO2 pipeline costs.

This paper specifies an adapted modeling framework that has its roots in the cooperative game theoretic treatment of clubs. Our approach explicitly takes into consideration the main features of the CCS industry: the heterogeneity of the likely club members (caused by differences in the emitter-specific capture costs, in their location, in the size of their annual emissions and in their infra-annual patterns of emissions) and an engineering-based model of the long-run cost to build and operate a CO2 pipeline. We believe that this model-based approach is able to provide valuable guidance for the professionals and scholars interested in the institutional design of the regulation that will be applied to the CO2 pipeline industry. As this paper has a practical ambition, a great deal of attention has been paid to address the practical issues faced in the implementation of the proposed methodology.

This club-theoretic perspective allows us to clarify the conditions required for CCS adoption. In the paper, two cases are successively examined: (i) the case of a group of emitters that can own and share a common pipeline system, and thus form a “vertically integrated” club; and (ii) the case of an infrastructure owned by an independent pipeline operator. As the conditions obtained in these two cases are equivalent, the problem faced by the promoter of a CO2 pipeline project amounts to the creation of a stable club of emitters.

Using these conditions, the paper provides a formal definition of the break-even value for joint CCS adoption which is the threshold carbon price required to obtain the creation of a club gathering all the emitters. From an applied economics perspective, we show that this value can be computed using a linear programming problem and that this approach can be adapted to take into consideration a variety of regulatory constraints that may be imposed on an independent pipeline operator. For example, we consider the case of a pipeline operator compelled to use an exogenously-predetermined, non-discriminatory tariff structure and model the interactions between the proposed tariff structure and the break-even value for joint CCS adoption. In another example, we consider the case of a transnational pipeline infrastructure supervised by two national regulators and adapt our framework to verify whether this institutional organization modifies the break-even value for joint CCS adoption.

We then consider an application to the case of a Northwestern European CO2 pipeline project. The main findings can be summarized as follows. First, the break-even value for joint CCS adoption is significantly larger than the average cost of the entire CCS chain, a cost concept that is often misleadingly interpreted as the CO2 abatement cost of the CCS technology. Second, we analyze a series of non-discriminatory pricing schemes that may conceivably be imposed on the pipeline operator. Interestingly, our findings confirm that the design of these pipeline access charges is non-neutral on the adoption of the CCS technology. For example, the results reveal that the emitter's location must be taken into consideration in the design of a pricing scheme and that a poorly designed pricing scheme can either significantly raise the break-even value for joint CCS adoption, or even impede the construction of a single pipeline infrastructure. Third, we compare the outcomes obtained in case of a pricing regulation organized at the EU-level to those obtained with a collection of national regulations. Our findings indicate that the scope of the regulation does not significantly impact the adoption of the CCS technology. Lastly, these results reveal that CCS adoption is always easier to achieve when considering a restricted club of CCS adopters that does not include the two smallest emitters.

Although our discussion is centered on this specific project, it should be clear that the methodology detailed hereafter could apply to other CO2 pipeline projects as well. As in any modeling effort, we made some simplifying assumptions. The main one is related to the static nature of the approach used to treat the coordination problem of joining a common pipeline network. The design of a dynamic framework where emitters would be allowed to join/exit the agreement depending on the evolution of variables like the carbon price constitutes an attractive agenda for future research.

                        Proof of Proposition 4
                        To begin with, assume that

                            is a solution to LP1. As r* jointly verifies the constraints (15) and (16), we have r* ∈ Λ which proves that Λ ≠ ∅.

Now, we assume that Λ ≠ ∅ and have to show that the feasible set of LP1 is non-empty. As Λ ≠ ∅, there exists at least one revenue vector

Following Fortuny-Amat and McCarl (1981), the complementarity conditions (C.2) can be replaced by integer restrictions in the form of disjunctive constraints. We introduce:

                      indicates that the particular tariff l (i.e., the price vector tl
                     ) minimizes the CO2 transportation cost of emitter i; and M a constant with a value that is large enough for the problem at hand.

                        31
                        For example, in the present case, one can rationally presume that the difference between the amount paid by an emitter for its CO2 transportation service (and thus the revenue charged to him) and the amount that he would have paid if that emitter had chosen the worst tariffs offered by the pipeline operator will be smaller than, let say, two times the overall cost of the entire pipeline. Hence, the value 
                              
                                 M

                                 2
                                 ×
                                 C

                            looks like a possible candidate.
                      Using these variables, the complementarity constraints (C.2) becomes:
