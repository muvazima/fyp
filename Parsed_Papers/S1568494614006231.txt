               Abstract
               
                  In this work, we first define intuitionistic fuzzy parameterized soft sets (intuitionistic FP-soft sets) and study some of their properties. We then introduce an adjustable approaches to intuitionistic FP-soft sets based decision making. Finally, we give a numerical example which shows that this method successfully works.
