                  In this paper we describe and test a pipeline for the extraction and semantic labelling of geometrically salient points on acquired human body models. Points of interest are extracted on the preprocessed scanned geometries as maxima of the autodiffusion function at different scales and annotated by an expert, where possible, with a corresponding semantic label related to a specific anatomical location.
                  On the extracted points we computed several descriptors (e.g. Heat Kernel Signature, Wave Kernel Signature, Derivatives of Heat Kernel Signature) and used labels and descriptors to train supervised classifiers, in order to understand if it is possible to recognize the points on new models.
                  Experimental results show that this approach can be used to detect and recognize robustly at least a selection of landmarks on subjects with different body types and independently on pose and could therefore applied for automatic anthropometric analysis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The use of 3D digital scanners to capture relevant information about human body shape is rapidly growing and not only limited to ergonomic studies or clothing design, but also for healthcare-related applications [1].

To obtain quantitative parameters from the scans, it is, however, necessary to identify landmarks, perform specific measurements, extract geometrical descriptors of the shape that can be compared across different subjects and correlated, for example, with other diagnostic data. Most of the software tools used to process acquired models requires the use of specific acquisition protocols, with constraints on subject pose. This may create problems in comparing data acquired in different places and performing large-scale multicentric studies as well as in applying advanced shape analysis tools on the captured models.

If we want to find meaningful anatomical landmarks, there is another relevant issue related to the fact that many points use in anatomical or anthropometric studies do not have a well defined geometrical characterization, being usually located through manual palpation. The local geometry is not only poorly characterized, but may be also relevantly different in subjects with different body built. For this reason, even using state of the art point matching methods, it is not possible to localize accurately those points in digital models, as revealed by a recent contest [2]. The error in locating standard anthropometric points (defined in the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry manual, www.isakonline.com), with registration based or spectral based methods was not negligible as these technique perform optimally in case of same shapes isometrically deformed and not in case of different body types.

On the other hand, it is not necessary, to perform anthropometric studies, to rely on traditional landmarks, as shown, for example, in [3] where robust measurements are derived from curve-skeleton analysis and body segmentation and used to predict composition parameters. Similarly, we could derive new robust measurements exploiting the points on the body surface that can be easily characterized with their geometric properties, e.g. geometrically salient points. These measurements, clearly different from standard anthropometrical ones, but correlated with them, could be performed automatically and independently on acquisition resolution, quality, pose, etc.

In this paper we present a study aimed at understanding if, among the surface points that can be characterized for geometric saliency on 3D scans, there are meaningful locations that can be automatically recognized on human scans with few quality constraints and large differences related to sex, body type and pose. These points can be used to extract quantitative measurements on the human body that can be then tested for repeatability and robustness and correlated with other parameters measured on the same subjects.

To accomplish the task we extracted salient points at different scales exploiting the autodiffusion function (ADF), asked an expert to give them semantic labels, if possible, and characterized the points with several descriptors (pose invariant) encoding local and contextual information. Supervised classification tests have been then performed in order to understand which points can be successfully recognized, how the recognition depends on pose and body type and which are the automatic labelling algorithms providing the best accuracy.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of related work, Section 3 the complete processing and analysis pipeline, Section 4 the experimental tests performed and Section 5 a final discussion of the results.

The automatic identification on digital models of landmarks used in manual anthropometric protocols is not easy, because they are not necessarily geometrically salient. A possible solution consists of establishing a complete point to point correspondence between the acquired mesh and one or more labelled templates and transfer the template labels to the new model. Generic deformable human models or SCAPE models encoding pose and principal body type variations [4,5] can be deformed in order to fit the data. A possible simplified solution for their extraction is to solve a global graph optimization problem. In [6,7] manual landmarks placed on models from the Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource Project (CAESAR) are joined in a graph structure and statistical learning is used to predict corresponding points’ position in new models, assuming similar pose. Localization errors are, however, rather high especially for poorly characterized points. In [8] a similar approach is applied in canonical form space to obtain posture invariance. All these kind of methods have been tried by the participants to the SHREC’14 contest on automatic location of landmarks used in manual anthropometry [2]. The results of the contest, however, showed that the accuracy of the best techniques on subjects with different body types is not very good for anthropometric applications, even working on good-quality meshes and similar poses.

To simplify the task, a possible solution is to search for different points and measures as usually done in commercial measurements systems used, for example, in the fashion industry. Points and measurements location are mainly derived from an accurate human body partitioning exploiting specific protocols, poses, machines, etc. and are therefore not good for examining heterogeneous data or stored archives, while more general methods tested on human meshes [9–11] are not used to derive reliable point based measurements.

Point location methods exploiting pose constraints have been proposed in the literature. Combinations of local descriptors and posture related priors are used, for example, in Leong et al. [12] where depth maps and cross sections perpendicular to the body axis are used to find the landmarks, or in [13] where Spin Images and posture-related constraints are used to match points.

In this paper we describe a novel approach to deal with the problem of recognizing human body landmarks on different subjects. The idea is to extract geometrically salient points in a multiscale framework, asking an expert if these points can be actually described with a semantic label, and then trying to see if the same label could be automatically assigned by a supervised classification method using different point descriptors. If this is possible, the repeatability of landmarks related measurements or feature characterization on landmarks could be tested to understand if these landmarks can be useful for human body analysis.

In the following subsection we describe in detail the procedures used for point extraction, description, labelling and classification.

Our detection of salient points is based on the heat diffusion theory. This choice is motivated by the robustness against isometric deformations and the high repeatability demonstrated in the SHREC 2010 benchmark [14] by the heat-kernel based detectors.

In order to detect a feature point we therefore compute the so called autodiffusion function as [15]:

Being the ADF invariant under isometric deformations the extracted points should be invariant if the body pose is changed. Furthermore, the procedure is stable under perturbation of the shape, that happen typically in different subjects, and can be computed easily and efficiently.

It is worth noting that at higher scales (i.e., large values of t) the detection selects only points with very strong protrusions. In order to increase the number of detected points we need to decrease t capturing more local surface features.

In this work we have to compare salient points extracted at different scales and that should be approximately corresponding on different subjects (whose body size may be different). To have salient points comparable across subjects we normalize the scale, introducing a new variable s representing the scale space in an uniform reference frame for all the models. This variable is derived by the classical ADF time sampling used in the Heat Kernel Signature matching [16].

In order to describe feature points, we tested different state-of the art descriptors still based on the spectrum of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on the surface. This choice is motivated by the fact that they are able to encode local and global information and are invariant under non rigid motion [17].

The first descriptor tested is the Heat Kernel Signature (HKS), introduced in [16] and applied in [18] for object retrieval. Given a surface point x, the HKS is an n dimensional descriptor vector, defined as:

Obviously this is not exactly true due to variability in subjects’ body types. A possible way to overcome the matching inaccuracy due to the resulting scaling problems, may be the use of non-Euclidean distances in HKS vectors comparison. The problems is similar to that of matching images that differ for different brightness scaling, and this means that we can refer to the huge literature related to histogram comparison to improve point matching using HKS features.

From the HKS we derived other two descriptors based on the observation that also the increments in switching from one scale to the next one have high discriminative properties. Therefore, as further descriptor we introduce the first order derivative of the HKS with respect to the scale variable:

                        In the original formulation, authors considered a family of log-normal energy distributions, motivated by a perturbation analysis of the Laplacian spectrum. In our test we used the same choice and sampled 100 energy distributions to obtain the WKS descriptor.

We asked an experienced anatomist to tell if the extracted salient points can have a real anatomical meaning giving them, in that case, a specific label. Due to the impossibility to check the salient points at each value of s, we annotated the answer of the expert and the corresponding labels at three specific scales, corresponding to 
                           
                              s
                              =
                              1
                              ,
                              s
                              =
                              25
                           
                         and 
                           
                              s
                              =
                              100
                           
                        . The choice of the intermediate scale is motivated by the fact that at that value of s we find a number of salient points that is approximately half of that found at 
                           
                              s
                              =

The expert labelled 17 classes of points that correspond to specific body feature localization (Toes, fingertips, nose, chin, shoulder, scapular, bicep, olecranical, lateral elbow, breast, crotch, trochanteric, gluteal, patellar, knee, medial knee, heel). With this choice, several points extracted at the finest scale are left unlabelled due to the fact that they are not clearly localized in a well defined anatomical landmark. We decided with the anatomist to give them different labels in our classification test, related to the body area where they are located. These labels were head, cranial, ear, antibrachial, brachial, chest, vertebral, abdominal, femural, crural, lower leg. Only a few points were, in this way, unlabelled (in our classification framework labelled as “other”). The reason for this choice is simply to give the possibility of exploiting the points, that are not usable for comparisons or measurements, as a contextual information for further analysis (e.g. processing at finer scales).

An example of points extracted at 
                           
                              s

                         and labelled by the expert is shown in Fig. 1
                        . The list of the labels used is represented in Fig. 2
                        .

Our final goal is to see if detected points can be correctly labelled with an example-based approach.

We first considered a Nearest Neighbour classification testing different metrics to compute distances in the feature spaces, using methods classically used in histogram comparison. We also tested the use of different classification methods, both linear and nonlinear, using the implementations provided by PRTools (www.37steps.org). In particular we were interested in testing also the classification in dissimilarity spaces [20], that demonstrated very good performances in practical applications. According to this paradigm, we can represent data instances not using directly the feature representation, but using the distances from a set of examples (representation set) as a new feature space where the classes are usually more easily separable.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

We tested the approach on 80 surface meshes captured by a whole body scanner device (Breuckmann BodyScan) used in ordinary anthropometric procedures. In order to have a challenging testbed, and to test effects of body types and pose on detection and recognition of salient points we included in the dataset 20 models acquired on normal men, 20 models acquired on normal women, 20 models acquired on overweight women and 20 on males in largely varied poses.

Subjects did not wear caps causing the appearance of several quite different curvature maxima in the head. Acquired models were preprocessed in order to produce a watertight mesh. The pre-processing procedure, implemented with Meshlab scripting [21] consisted of floor and noise removal, Poisson remeshing and Quadric Mesh decimation with to obtain target 30K faces meshes.

                         shows the salient points extracted on a test model at

                              =

                        . These are the scales where we asked the expert anatomist to assign semantic labels to the points.

It is possible to see that the number of landmarks is quite small at the first two scales, while is sufficiently high at the finest one. At the finest scale most of the extracted points seem to correspond well to major geometrical protrusions of the body and some points without a strong geometrical characterization are appearing. It must be considered that at low values of t (and s) the effect of acquisition noise can become relevant and influence the point extraction. If we plot the total number of salient points detected in the tested scale range, we see that it starts growing quite rapidly when s is less than 20 (see Fig. 5
                        ).


                        Table 1
                         shows the number of points with different labels assigned by the expert at the three selected scales. The last column indicates the expected number of points that should ideally appear. It is possible to see that at the coarsest scale of our analysis the detected points are quite few and recognized as belonging to just three classes (fingers, head, toes). Adding more detail different recognized salient point classes appear, even if at the intermediate scale only in a subset of the models analyzed.

At the finest scale of our analysis (
                           
                              s
                              =
                              1
                           
                        ), however, it is possible to see that there is a number of points that is found in all or almost all the models, and with the correct cardinality (heel, shoulders, scapular, nose, chin, breasts, gluteal). Toes and fingers are not detected in the right number due to the input mesh quality and resolution (toes and fingers are often actually not visible in the input meshes). However, at least one salient point per limb of each class is always detected.

Other point classes are not consistently found in all the models at 
                           
                              s
                              =
                              1
                           
                        . This is partially due to the still too coarse resolution and mesh simplification, partially to the actually different shape of the models. Using more detailed input meshes and a different 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                                 
                                    min
                                 
                              
                           
                         in the autodiffusion function sampling would allow probably to find other point classes well represented, at the risk, however, of finding more noisy and spurious points quite different across different subjects.

We considered therefore the scale 
                           
                              s
                              =
                              1
                           
                         a sufficiently good tradeoff in order to test a possible automatic detection and recognition of selected salient points.

We validated the multi-class labelling procedure to classify all the salient points detected in models at 
                           
                              s
                              =
                              1
                           
                        . For this task, we designed a leave-subject-out procedure, labelling the salient points of each subject with multi-label classifiers trained on the descriptors computed on all the other subjects, averaging the results obtained.

In the first test we used simply a Nearest Neighbour classification, using the different spectral descriptors described in Section 3 and testing different metrics to evaluate distances in feature spaces. It is possible to see that the Wave Kernel Signature largely outperforms the other descriptors (see Table 2
                         and that the use of different metrics to compare signatures can slightly improve the classification accuracy with respect to the usual Euclidean distance.


                        Table 3
                         shows the results of the test performed only with the WKS descriptor, using different classifiers. It is possible to see that is difficult to outperform the Nearest Neighbour labelling for this specific task: the use of other popular classification techniques, in fact, does not improve the classification accuracy.

We were, however, able to obtain a non negligible improvement in the labelling performances by applying a dissimilarity based approach.

The only technique tested that outperform Nearest Neighbour approaches is a particular dissimilarity based method that integrates a class specific distance for representation objects. The simple use of the dissimilarity based paradigm, does not reduce the amount of classification errors, that are quite similar (slightly higher) than those obtained with the Nearest Neighbour classifiers using the same metric to compute descriptor difference. Note that the results shown in Table 3 for dissimilarity based methods are obtained using all the training set as representation. However, using the dissimilarity-based approach, it is possible to optimize the multi-class labelling in order to consider classes’ peculiarities. In detail, we can compute distances of classes from the representation objects using specific metrics for each class. A possible solution is, for example, to compute from the training set (that in our tests is also the representation set), the eigenspace of each class and compute distances from representation objects using the Cityblock distance in this space, possibly considering only the most relevant eigenvectors.


                        Table 3 shows that this approach is effective in reducing the overall classification error for the complete multi-class labelling. We used here the first 50 eigenvectors for each representation object class.

An obvious drawback of the procedure is the computational complexity of the procedure, considering also that to obtain the best results we used a representation space with a very high dimensionality (salient points extracted by all the models with the exception of the tested one).

An interesting question that arises is how these results depend on sex, body type and poses. With our heterogeneous test set we can check which is the classification error related to the different subsets of models. Table 4
                         shows the number of salient points extracted at 
                           
                              s
                              =
                              1
                           
                         and the average classification error for the four model classes. The results show that pose changes does not affect relevantly the classification accuracy (as expected, using spectral descriptors), even if may decrease the number of extracted points. The model subset where results seem less accurate is normal weight women.

This is, however, mainly due to the difficulty in classifying spurious salient points created by hair, that have a bad local characterization due to variable shape and acquisition noise (see Fig. 7).

                        . Most of the errors are related to the regional labels that are not well characterized. It is therefore interesting to check if the specific points that are robustly extracted at

                         (shoulders, chin, nose, scapular, breasts, gluteal, patellar, fingers, toes) can be effectively recognized.

                         shows the precision and recall values for each single class of this subset, where we give two values of recall (true positive rate): the first (recall 1) is the number of correctly labelled points divided by the number of the number of detected points with that label assigned by the expert, the second (recall 2) is the number of correctly labelled points for each class divided by the total number of points with the same expected label. This last value is therefore the probability to obtain the correct detection of all the points with the selected label considering also possible detector failures. Precision (Positive Predictive value) is the number of correct classification results divided by the sum of true and false positives for the class considered. It is possible to see that, for some selected point types (nose, chin, shoulder, heel, breast) the true positive rate is one or close to one even considering possible missed detections. These results can be considered satisfactory, considering also that the classification accuracy could be improved, for example, by optimizing descriptors and metric for specific point classes, using hierarchical classification or adding more spatial constraints (e.g. forcing spatial coherence of labels with Markov Random fields, or using other graph based approaches). We plan to perform more experiments on class adaptive metric learning but this would require the availability of a larger annotated training set. We also expect that, even keeping this simple approach, the availability of a larger set of examples will be effective in eliminating false positives and false negatives.

In any case, it is possible to say that the proposed approach is feasible and automatic recognition of semantically corresponding points and regions in largely variable human models can be performed with a good precision.

In order to check the possibility of performing useful measurements from the automatically detected and labelled salient points we performed a test on a set of 12 subjects for which a scanning procedure was performed twice and that underwent also manual anthropometric measurements. On both the acquired models of each subject, we estimated three anthropometric measurements based on the extracted salient points and evaluated their differences. These difference have been compared with the lowest average error in locating the closest anthropometric landmarks obtained in the Shrec 14 contest [2]. We also computed the correlation coefficients between the new measurement and this most related anthropometric measurements that are listed in Table 6
                        . These preliminary results, reported in Table 6, seem to confirm that the use of geometrically salient points may be used to derive measurements with similar meaning with respect to standard anthropometric ones, but probably more robust than those obtained from automatic location of standard landmarks.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

We presented a framework for the automatic recognition of points (and regions) in human body scans. The method is based on the extraction at specific scales of geometrically salient points that are then labelled using spectral descriptors and supervised labelling. The use of the Wave Kernel Signature as point descriptor demonstrated a very good discriminative power, outperforming Heat Kernel Signature and derived descriptors. Nearest Neighbour classifier (best with Jeffrey Divergence) provided good classification results. A dissimilarity based classification approach using different metrics according to the representation object classes was, however, the most effective classification method tested, even if computationally expensive.

The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of automatic recognition of anatomical points or regions based on simple spectral based descriptors on human models with large variations in pose and body type. The good classification results obtained seemed to us a good result considering the poor quality of meshes, that presented relevant artefacts due to holes, hair and motion. A subset of anatomical points was robustly both detected and classified on these noisy meshes. The accuracy of the classification could be improved further by using machine learning techniques to define new spectral based descriptors optimized for the specific class of models, using approaches inspired, for example by the work of Litman and Bronstein [22]. A problem of the experimental procedure applied is that, due to the use of a limited mesh accuracy and a non negligible Heat Kernel smoothing, we had a relevant number of missed points for another subset of points labels. Using more detailed input meshes and a different time sampling for the autodiffusion function, the detection rates could be easily improved, at the cost of being more sensitive to noise.

The location of the extracted salient points does not necessarily match the human placement of corresponding landmarks, even if it is not necessarily less reliable (there is a large inter-operator error in locating anatomical landmarks [23]) and could be used differently to extract useful information on the subjects’ body. A first test presented here demonstrated the potential use of the automatically labelled salient points to derive quantitative measurements characterizing the human body. The semantic correspondence between different body types in different poses obtained with the point labelling can be, however, used as a starting point for other applications, e.g. shape registration, dense correspondences computed with methods requiring initialization [24,25].

It is also worth noting that the appearance of some of the points could be quite different in subjects with different body type, fatness, musculature, etc. In this case the accurate location of the point is clearly impossible, but geometric properties of the local neighbourhood could give relevant information on the specific body shape.
