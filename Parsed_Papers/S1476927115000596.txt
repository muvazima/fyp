                  G-quadruplex is a stable, four-stranded DNA or RNA structure formed from guanine-rich regions and implicated in telomere maintenance, replication, gene regulation at transcription level or translation level, etc. Based on bioinformatics methods, we analyzed different putative G-quadruplex motifs (PGQMs) patterns in various genomic regions of two subspecies (indica and japonica) of Oryza sativa and the whole genomes of other 8 species. In total, in the 10 species we discussed, the PGQMs densities in monocots were higher than dicots. 40,483 and 31,795 PGQMs were identified with a density of 108.46 and 84.89 PGQMs/Mb, respectively, in japonica and indica genomes, 10,655 and 5420 loci were found to contain at least one PGQM in their gene bodies (with a percentage of 19% and 14%) indicating a wide distribution of G-quadruplex motifs in O. sativa genome. They preferred to locate in transcription start sites proximal regions and 5′-UTR with relative high enrichment. This phenomenon supports the hypothesis that PGQMs are involved in gene transcription and translation. In addition, we analyzed the distribution of different loop length in G-quadruplex and found the density of long loop PGQMs was less than short loop in indica’s intron but it was similar in japonica. Meanwhile, we focused on the loci with PGQMs and conducted gene ontology (GO) analysis of them. As a result, many GO terms were identified and significantly correlated with the loci containing at least one PGQM. The GO analysis in the two subspecies of rice may be helpful for elucidating the functional roles of G-quadruplexes.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Interest in the biological functions of G-quadruplex forms of nucleic acids, G4 DNA and G4 RNA, has blossomed over the past few years as strong support for their impact on transcription, translation, replication, recombination, chromatin structure and telomere maintenance has emerged (Smargiasso et al., 2008; Wieland and Hartig, 2009). G-quadruplexes are noncanonical secondary structures formed by G-rich stretches of nucleic acids. The basic structure of G-quadruplex consists of four guanines held together by Hoogsteen bonds in a square and planar arrangement, forming a G-quartet. The center of a G-quartet contains a monovalent cation (potassium or sodium) that stabilizes the inwardly oriented oxygen atoms of the four guanines, thereby minimizing their repulsion and providing stability to the quartet. Two or more quartets stack upon each other to form a three-dimensional G-quadruplex structure (Burge et al., 2006). Several conformations can be adopted by G-quadruplexes, including parallel and antiparallel topologies, which can be formed in either intramolecular or intermolecular strands (Fig. 1
                     ). Conformation of the G-quadruplex is controlled by strand orientation, loop length and ions present in solution (Burge et al., 2006; Williamson et al., 1989).

RNA and DNA folding events have the potential to alter gene expression in vivo (Gollnick et al., 2005), and one such event is G-quadruplexes formation. Using bioinformatics search methods such as the program ‘Quadparser’, ∼375,000 putative G-Quartet motifs (PGQMs) were identified in the human genome (Todd et al., 2005), where G-quadruplexes are found primarily in the intergenic regions and are enriched in telomeres (Azzalin et al., 2007). A large percentage (>40%) of human promoters contain at least one PGQM, implicating PGQMs in potential regulatory functions (Huppert and Balasubramanian, 2007). In addition, several prokaryotes have also been shown to have a higher frequency of PGQMs in upstream regulatory regions (Yadav et al., 2008; Rawal et al., 2006). Genes containing G-quadrulexes have been implicated in control of transcription, translation, stability and structure. Transcription of several oncogenes can be controlled by the promoter region G-quadrulex and binding of several ligands. Control of translation by PGQMs is confirmed by the ESR1 mRNA (Balkwill et al., 2009), the human NRAS proto-oncogene (Kumari et al., 2007), the MT3 metalloproteinase mRNA, and ZIC-1RNA (Arora et al., 2008), all of which have repressed translation when a stable G-quadrulex forms in their 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs). G-quadruplex motifs have also been implicated in stability and post-transcription processing (Christiansen et al., 1994).

Genome-wide analyses of G-quaduplexes have been reported for many species, including human, fungi, and chicken, etc. However, the genome-wide analyses of G-quadruplexes in plant genomes are relatively fewer by far. Previously, Mullen et al. (2010) reported the distribution of G-quadruplexes in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, and found possible roles of G-quadruplexes in drought responses. Additionally, Takahashi et al. (2012) reported that G-quadruplexes were enriched in TSS (transcript start sites) and conducted GO analysis in Oryza sativa subsp. japonica. However, only japonica genome and only one G-quadruplex pattern were studied in their work and they did not involve other genic regions, such as coding sequences, 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR and introns. Rice (O. sativa) is one of the most important crops for human consumption, and about one-third of the population depends on rice for more than 50% of caloric intake. Moreover, rice is also one of the most researched plants, and the completion of rice genome sequences made it possible to analyze the genome-wide distribution of G-quadruplexes in the genome and transcriptome of japonica and indica, which are two subspecies of O. sativa.

Japonica rice genomic sequences were obtained from the TIGR version 7, released at October 31, 2011. The information about specific components of the genome, including 5′-UTRs, 3′-UTRs, coding sequences, introns and TPR (defined as −500 to +500) was obtained from the gff3 files in the TIGR database. For the alternative splicing of some loci, we only selected one of them to analyze. We also utilized the major annotation provided by TIGR.

For comparisons, we also selected other 9 plants species by phylogenetic distance from japonica and the differences between dicots and monocots to analyze the distribution of G-quadruplex. The whole genomic sequences of other species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa indica, Brassica rapa, Lotus japonicus, Sorghum bicolor, Glycine max, Zea mays, were obtained from the NCBI, Ensembl and JGI websites. The version details for these obtained data are provided in Supplementary Table S1.

In general, the G-quadruplex motif was defined as d(G
                           X
                        L1−N
                        )3+G
                           X,
                         where d indicates deoxynucleoside, G is guanine, L is any nucleotide including G, N stands for the loop length and the number of guanines constituting the stem is given by X. These definitions correspond to G-quartets of varying stabilities, with larger values of X and smaller values of N generally corresponding to more stable sequences. So far, the studies about G-quadruplex have all used the d(G3+L1–N
                        )3+G3+ rule to identify putative G-quadruplex motifs, but this rule cannot distinguish different PGQMs. For further research on different numbers of guanine tandems with different loop lengths, we changed the rule and defined the following patterns with corresponding regular expression to identify exact start and end positions of PGQMs in the japonica rice genome:

G2 pattern: (G{2}.{1,7}?) {3,}G{2} and (C{2}.{1,7}?) {3,}C{2};

G3 pattern: (G{3}.{1,7}?) {3,}G{3} and (C{3}.{1,7}?) {3,}C{3};

G4 pattern: (G{4}.{1,7}?) {3,}G{4} and (C{4}.{1,7}?) {3,}C{4};

G5+ pattern: (G{5,}.{1,7}?) {3,}G{5,} and (C{5,}.{1,7}?) {3,}C{5,};

Where the C patterns represented that the G-quadruplexes could form in the complementary strand of the genomic DNA. So the PGQMs identified by the rule d(G3+L1–N
                        )3+G3+ were classified into different patterns. Previously, PGQMs were searched in whole genome sequences and coding sequences, (Mullen et al., 2010; Takahashi et al., 2012). However, we also analyzed 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR, exons and introns for more details. All of the above PGQM patterns were identified in the entire japonica and indica rice genomes using a perl program. The PGQMs reported here are non-overlapping, such that any continuous stretch of PGQM sequence will count as one, regardless of the number of registers. For further research on PGQM of different loop lengths, we divided the G
                           X
                         pattern into two parts, i.e., the short loop pattern G
                           X
                        L1−3 and the long loop pattern G
                           X
                        L1−7 (when we calculated the PGQMs with a loop length of 1–7, the short loop pattern with a maximum loop size of three nucleotides was also identified, so the long loop pattern G
                           X
                        L1−7 appearing in this paper was defined as not comprising of G
                           X
                        L1−3 by excluding the short loop pattern.)

@&#ANALYSIS@&#

Functional analyses of the gene products was conducted using the BiNGO 2.3 plugin (Maere et al., 2005) for the Cytoscape 2.6.0 visualization program (Shannon et al., 2003). BiNGO assesses genes in a user-defined category as compared to the entire japonica rice annotation. Here, the PGQMs-containing GO annotated genes were compared with the GO annotation for the entire japonica rice transcriptome. The japonica rice GO terms were also obtained from TIGR database. BiNGO uses the hypergeometrical statistical test, which is equivalent to an exact Fisher test, along with a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction at a significance level of 0.05.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

PGQMs, G3N1–7G3N1–7G3N1–7G3 and C3N1–7C3N1–7C3N1–7C3 (where the C pattern represents PGQMs in the negative DNA strand) referred to herein as ‘G3’ pattern were prevalent in the O. sativa genome. In the total length of 373Mb japonica rice genome, there were 40,483 PGQMs identified, which corresponded to a genomic density of 108.46 PGQMs/Mb (Tables 1 and 2
                        
                        ). The density of PGQMs in japonica rice genome was close to that in the human genome (357,774 PGQMs in 2858.01Mb, with a density of 115.6 PGQMs/Mb), but the density in indica was less (31,795 PGQMs in 374Mb, with a density of 84.9 PGQMs/Mb). These densities are larger than that in most other plants that had been calculated for comparisons in Fig. 2
                        .

At the same time, we found that the PGQMs were shown to be unevenly distributed in the japonica and genomes. Basically, if the PGQMs were randomly distributed then the number of PGQMs counted on a given genomic length could be modeled as a Poisson process. For a large value of λ (λ
                        >10), the Poisson distribution could be approximated by the normal distribution N (λ, λ) (where λ is the mean of the Poisson distribution). Here, we calculated the number of PGQMs in the 100kb genomic windows. Because the calculation of PGQMs was affected by regional GC composition, we corrected the effects of heterogeneity of chromosome and GC content by transforming the numbers to normalized values within each of the chromosomes and the categories of similar GC content and Z=(n−λij)/λij
                           1
                        
                        /
                        
                           2
                         (where n is the observed number for each window and λij
                         is the mean for all windows belonging to chromosome category i and GC-content category j) (Du et al., 2009). Under the null hypothesis that PGQMs were evenly distributed, we expected that the normalized values would follow the standard normal distribution. However, the observed distribution was significantly different from the expectation (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, D
                        =0.25, P
                        <0.01), indicating a genome-wide nonuniformity.

Tandem repeats of two guanines (G2) have also been reported to form G-quartet structures, albeit in a less stable form. For example, Wieland and Hartig (2007) studied differences in RNA PGQMs with G2 and G3 sequences and showed that G2 sequences formed PGQMs but had lower melting temperatures than equivalent G3 sequences; in addition, all G2 sequences had weaker CD (circular dichroism spectrum) signatures than G3 sequences. Nonetheless, G2 sequences can form G-quartets that can be quite stable, especially in the presence of high salt concentrations. The thrombin DNA aptamer, with the sequence G2T2G2TGTG2T2G2 is an example of a well characterized DNA G2 quartet (Bock et al., 1992). Takahashi et al. (2012) only discussed PGQMs for stretches of three guanines, therefore we evaluated prevalence of PGQMs for stretches of two to five guanines. This simplification of the search motif with two guanines increased the number of hits to 1,226,780 and 1,101,716, providing a genomic density of 3286.79 and 2941.47 PGQMs/Mb, respectively, in japonica and indica (Table 1). For further research on other kinds of continuous guanines, we also calculated G4 (PGQMs with tandem stretches of four guanines) and G5+ (PGQMs with five or more continuous guanines) patterns. There were 3997 G4 PGQMs identified, with genomic densities of 10.71 PGQMs/Mb; and 660 G5+ PGQMs identified, with genomic densities of 1.77 PGQMs/Mb in japonica. There were 3067 G4 PGQMs identified, with genomic densities of 8.91 PGQMs/Mb; and 516 G5+ PGQMs identified, with genomic densities of 1.38 PGQMs/Mb in indica (Table 1). Compared with japonica, the percent of genic PGQMs in genome is a little lower in indica.

We found that the distribution of PGQMs throughout the genome is not uniform. To begin with, the prevalence of G3 PGQMs in genic regions was calculated. As described before, the density of G3 PGQMs in the japonica and indica genomes are, respectively, 108.46 and 84.89 PGQMs/Mb. We found that the G3 PGQMs density in the genic regions was lower than in the whole genome. Here, the corresponding values of G3 PGQMs in genic regions are 34% and 83.17 PGQMs/Mb (Table 1), and the ratio of DNA G3 PGQMs in the genic to intergenic regions is 0.52 in japonica. We were interested in different PGQMs patterns, so PGQMs statistics were tallied considering different loop lengths and numbers of guanines. In particular, we observed whether certain loop lengths are more common than others in the japonica and indica genomes. We defined the short loop as a maximum of three nucleotides, G3L1–3, which PGQMs we found for the entire genome decreased to 12,925 with a density of 34.83 motifs per Mb in japonica. Similar with the whole G3 PGQMs, 34% of G3L1–3 PGQMs were found in gene regions of japonica, with a relative enrichment of 0.78, while 24% of G3L1–3 PGQMs were found in indica, with a relative enrichment of 0.90 (Table 2). For the long loop PGQMs G3L1–7, we found that 27558 G3L1–7 PGQMs presented in the entire genome of japonica with 73.83 motifs per Mb (Table 2). Even though there are almost 1-fold PGQMs more than that of G3L1–3, the relative enrichment, 0.77 for the genic regions, is the same as that of G3L1–3 sequence and the whole G3 patterns.

Next, we changed the PGQMs definition to G4L1–3, which includes stretches of four guanines and a maximum loop size of three in the DNA region. There were 2426 G4L1–3 PGQMs found in the entire genomes of japonica, with 6.50 motifs per Mb. Similarly, there are 2014 G4L1–3 PGQMs in indica with 5.38 PGQMs/Mb. In accordance with G3 patterns, only 34% of G4L1–3 PGQMs located in genic regions of japonica, with the relative enrichment of 0.77 (Table 2). However, the long loop of G4 pattern PGQMs, G4L1–7 decreased the number of PGQMs found for the entire genome to just 1571, with 4.21 motifs per Mb. Unlike the G3 patterns, the long loop length decreased the number of PGQMs. Even though there are fewer PGQMs than those for G4L1–3, the relative enrichment, 0.74 for the genic regions (Table 2), is similar with that of G4L1–3 and G3 patterns. The longer continuous guanines with short loop and long loop, G5+L1–3 and G5+L1–7 patterns, were also calculated for comparisons. There were only 492 PGQMs for G5+L1–3 and 168 PGQMs for G5+L1–7 presenting in the entire gnome of japonica, with densities of 0.85 and 0.92, respectively. These two patterns shared the similar relative enrichment, ∼0.64 for the genic region (Table 2), which was lower than that of other patterns described previously. Comparing with the similar enrichment of different loop distance in G3, G4 and G5 patterns PGQMs in japonica genic regions, the enrichment of long loop PGQMs was a little higher than that in short loop PGQMs in indica genic regions. The G4 and G5+ patterns also indicated that the PGQMs with long continuous guanines prefer to form G-quadruplex sequences with short loops.

Next, we changed the PGQMs definition to G2L1–3, which includes stretches of two guanines with short loop size in the DNA region. As described previously, reducing the tandem of guanines caused an increase in the number of PGQMs to 496,018 in japonica, corresponding to a PGQMs density of 1328.93 PGQMs/Mb (Table 2). Remarkably, upon decreasing the number of guanines in the search motif, the density of PGQMs shifted from favoring intergenic to the genic region (enrichment value of 1.07). For the long loop of G2 pattern G2L1–7, there were 730,762 PGQMs identified in the entire genome, corresponding to a density of 1957.86 sequences per Mb (Table 2). In accordance with G2L1–3, the G2L1–7 patterns preferred to locate in genic region, with an enrichment value of 1.16. As mentioned above, we drew the following conclusions: (1) the PGQMs with shorter number of guanines prefer to locate in genic regions; (2) the PGQMs with long number of guanines, G4 and G5 patterns, prefer to form PGQMs with short loops. And indica had the similar rules. On the whole, PGQMs enrichment in genic regions and TPR in japonica was a little higher than indica.

We calculated the distances between PGQMs and genes on the basis of positional relationships. The distribution of distances in japonica for transcript start sites (TSSs) is shown in Fig. 3
                        A and that for transcript termination sites (TTSs) is shown in Fig. 3B. And the distribution of distances in indica for TSSs and TTSs are, respectively, shown in Fig. 4
                        A and B. Similar to the work done by (Takahashi et al., 2012), we can observe that all PGQMs patterns enrich near TSSs in Fig. 3A or Fig. 4A and there are obviously peak valleys near TTSs in Fig. 3B or Fig. 4B. G-quadruplex are known to have a role in the regulation of gene transcription and translation, with many transcription regulatory elements located in TSS-Proximal regions. This is why PGQMs enrich near TSSs. More detailedly, PGQMs with long loop pattern near TSSs in japonica were more than short loop except G3 pattern, but it was contrary in indica. This illustrated that G-quadruplex may have different mode of action with japonica and indica.

As motivation for characterizing PGQMs in the genic region, we first asked, for any given PGQMs definition, how many genes or loci contain at least one PGQMs. Gene models are named uniquely within a given open reading frame (ORF), thus a given locus can have more than one associated gene model, e.g., if there are alternatively spliced variants for a gene. Here we only selected one gene model of every locus for analysis, and in other words, one locus only corresponded to one gene model. Of the 55,801 loci in japonica genome, 10,655 loci were found to contain at least one G3 PGQM in their gene bodies, which represents 19% of the total number of loci in japonica genome; and the enrichment value is 14% (5420 loci contain at least one G3 PGQM in total 38,091 loci) in indica, which is a little lower comparing with japonica. As for the long tandem guanines G4 and G5+ patterns, the numbers of loci in japonica found to contain at least one PGQM were only 1270 and 187, respectively. But for the G2 pattern, at least one PGQM was found in almost all loci (up to 98.9%), suggesting the potential for widespread formation. We also analyzed the loci found to contain the stringent PGQMs, G3 pattern in japonica and obtained the following: (1) 8333 loci were found to contain only one G3 PGQM, (2) 1703 loci were found to contain two G3 PGQMs, and (3) 619 loci were found to contain three or more G3 PGQMs.

Regulation of translation by G3 PGQMs in RNA transcripts has been demonstrated in Escherichia coli and eukaryotic cells (Wieland and Hartig, 2007; Morris and Basu, 2009; Halder et al., 2009), and G3 PGQMs regulation of gene expression is also well known (Wieland and Hartig, 2007), so we counted the amount of PGQMs in different domains of the genic region including TPR (TSS-Proximal regions, from −500 to 500), coding sequences region, intron, 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR for further research. As can be seen in Table 2, the PGQMs densities in TPR were high for all patterns with enrichment value of ∼2 (The enrichment of G2L1–7 was 1.54 or 1.80 and obviously lower than that of the others) (Table 2). Many transcription regulation elements are known to locate in TPR, so this phenomenon indicated the role of transcription regulation by G-quadruplex. For the PGQMs locating in genic regions, we found that the enrichment values in coding sequences, intron and 3′-UTR were very low. However, it is interesting that the enrichment value in 5′-UTR was very high (Table 3
                        ). We also analyzed the influence of loop length in G-quadruplex to distribution and found that the density of G3L1–7 PGQMs in indica’s intron was 35.2% while density of G3L1–3 was 63.0%. However, the densities of G3L1–7 and G3L1–3 in indica’s intron were 41% and 49% (Tables 3 and 4
                        ). We are especially interested in the distribution of PGQMs in mRNA for the role of regulation of translation by PGQMs in mRNA. In this counting, ‘mRNA’ is defined as genic which includes coding sequences and UTRs and only G-rich sequences. As we expected, there were many PGQMs presenting in 5′-UTR, with high enrichment in all patterns (Table 5
                        ). This phenomenon suggested a role for G-quadruplex in regulation of translation.

The function of gene products encoded by loci containing at least one PGQM in their gene bodies, TPR was examined using Gene Ontology (GO) codes. The results (correct P-value <0.05) are shown in Supplementary Table S2. Previously, a number of GO terms were found to be related to genes with PGQMs in the template strands of TSSs of japonica (Takahashi et al., 2012). Furtherly, we, respectively, calculated the GO terms of genes and TPR with PGQMs, and the results were compared with two subspecies of O. sativa. Biological process of the loci with PGQMs located in the gene body were related to macromolecule modification process (GO:0043412, GO:0006464) and cellular component of the loci with PGQMs located in the gene body and TPR were related to intracellular or organelle part(GO:0005623, GO:0044424, GO:0005622, GO:0043229, GO:0044422, etc.) both in japonica and indica.

Meanwhile, there were many distinctions in PGQMs in genes or TPR with a GO term. Biological process of the loci with PGQMs located in the gene body were related to response to abiotic stimulus (GO:0009628, GO:0009409, GO:0009266, GO:0009314), cellular component and organelle organization (GO:0016043, GO:0006996), and metabolic or biosynthetic process of nitrogen compound and glycoprotein (GO:0006807, GO:0009100, GO:0044271, GO:0009101) in indica, while they were related to small molecule, organic acid and cellular amino acid metabolic process (GO:0044281, GO:0006082, GO:0006520) in japonica. Molecular function of the loci with PGQMs located in TPR were related to hydrolase activity (GO:0016818, GO:0016817) in indica, and those were more related to symporter activity (GO: 15,294, GO: 5402) and phosphatase activity (GO:0016791, GO:0004721, GO:0019208) in japonica.

Additionally, Liu et al. (2007) reported that rice full-length cDNAs revealed highly expressed sequence divergence between indica and japonica. According to their work, there were lots of genes, such as PF00076 (GO:0003676), PF00071 (GO:0005525), PF00069 (GO:0005524), PF02798 (GO:0005515), PF02365 (GO:0003677), PF00046 (GO:0043565), PF00249 (GO:0003677), PF00170 (GO:0043565) which showed significant divergence between indica and japonica, and we also found they had significant difference in TPR with GQPMs between the two subspecies. The results showed the GO enrichment analysis of TPR with GQPMs had some similarities with rice full-length cDNAs’ divergence between indica and japonica.

In particular, these GO terms indicating symporter activity (GO: 15,294, GO: 5402) were identified with a high frequency. G-quadruplex structure is known to be stabilized by K+ or Na+, and take together with the cation symporter activity which may be regulated by G-quadruplex, indicates a mechanism for the transport of K+ and Na+ in japonica rice genome. Many loci with PGQMs are related to nucleotide binding, indicating G-quadruplexes can regulate gene expression by controlling the expression of transcription factors, and many G-quadruplexes need to be bound by transcription factors to regulate gene expression, indicating a feedback control mechanism in G-quadruplexes and transcription factors.

As described previously, G-quadruplex not only control gene transcription, but also have a role in translation regulation. So we also examined the mRNA containing PGQMs in 5′-UTR. In accordance with the loci containing PGQMs described above, these candidate mRNA mostly enriched in the GO terms related to binding (GO: 166, GO: 5524, etc.) and metabolic processes (GO: 19,538, GO: 44,267,). Meanwhile, some biological process such as localization (GO: 51,179), post-translation protein modification (GO: 43,687), phosphorylation (GO: 16,310), signaling (GO: 23,052, GO: 23,060, GO: 7165) were also identified. These results suggested a putative regulation role in many biological processes in japonica rice genome.

As described previously, the PGQMs density in japonica rice genome was obviously larger than that in other plants that had been calculated for comparisons in Fig. 2. From the data in Fig. 2, we can find that the PGQMs densities in Monocots, such as Z. mays, O. sativa japonica, O. sativa indica, S. bicolor and B. distachyon are significantly higher than that in the dicot species, which include A. lyrata, A. thaliana, G. max, B. rapa and L. japonicus. Moreover, we considered GC content had an important influence in PGQMs density, so we also compared GC content and PGQMs density across the different plant genomes (Table 6
                        ). PGQMs levels correlated well with the GC content (R
                        2
                        =0.57), however, the correction was abnormal in Z. mays, L. japonicus and O. sativa japonica genome. The L. japonicus genome had the lowest GC content but had higher PGQMs level than the other dicots. The Z. mays genome had the highest GC content but had lower PGQMs level than O. sativa and B. distachyon. And the O. sativa japonica genome had significantly higher PGQMs densities with lower GC content. As described previously, PGQMs mainly located in noncoding regions, and this may be the reason why such a big difference of PGQMs densities existed in japonica and indica.

The distributions of PGQMs in O. sativa japonica and the other 9 species are not the same. We also calculated the distances between PGQMs and genes on the basis of positional relationships. The distribution of distances for transcript start sites (TSSs) in all species in our study is shown in Fig. 5
                        A and that for transcript termination sites (TTSs) is shown in Fig. 5B. We can observe that the PGQMs in O. sativa japonica, O. sativa indica, S. bicolor, Z. mays, B. distachyon and A. thaliana genome all significantly enrich near TSSs in Fig. 5A, indicating a wide gene regulating role of G-quadruplexes in plants. The distributions of PGQMs in the other species A. lyrata, B. rapa, G. max and L. japonicus genome did not follow the same trend with lower PGQMs levels in the genomes. Fig. 5B shows significantly PGQMs-depletion near TTSs of G. max, O. sativa indica, O. sativa japonica, B. distachyon and S. bicolor genome but the distributions in the other genomes have no significant changes. There are no related studies about fewer G-quadruplexes locating in 3′-UTR, so the reason of PGQMs-depletion near TTSs is not clear. These results imply that the frequencies of PGQMs in TSSs/TTSs were conserved during evolution in many species, however, these trends are species dependent and thus not relevant.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this study, we described a wide distribution of PGQMs in plant genomes, especially in japonica and indica genomes. In addition, we summarized the distribution of different putative G-quadruplex patterns in various genic regions in detail. The PGQMs preferred to locate in TPR and 5′-UTR with high enrichment, indicating a role in the regulation of transcription and translation by G-quadruplex. Moreover, many kinds of GO terms were found to relate to the loci containing PGQMs by using GO codes analysis, indicating the wide regulating effect on various biological processes by G-quadruplexes. Recently, many researches about G-quadruplexes have been reported in animal genomes, and more and more important genes were found to be regulated by G-quadruplexes. The results in our study affirm G-quadruplexes are also widely distributed in plant genomes, and G-quadruplex has possible regulating effect on many biological processes. There are some similarities between GO enrichment analysis of TPR with GQPMs and rice full-length cDNAs’ divergence in indica and japonica, and this may indicate part of molecular function of G-quadruplexes in binding and enzyme activity. These results will be helpful for illustrating the functional roles of G-quadruplexes in plant genomes, especially the rice genome.
