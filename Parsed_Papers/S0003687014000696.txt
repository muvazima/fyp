                  The paper investigates the impact of text and background color combinations on the legibility of text presented on LCDs. The legibility of 56 elementary color combinations was tested by 308 participants. The first task required the participants to identify 21 uppercase alphabetic characters selected and presented in conformance with a Snellen chart in various color combinations. For each color combination, the number of correctly identified characters was recorded as a visual performance measure. In the second task, participants subjectively rated the legibility of color combinations on a ten-point Likert scale. The results show that neither the Le Courier legibility table nor the CRT legibility table is appropriate for LCDs. A new legibility table is proposed for LCDs where the highest ranked are contrastive color combinations with positive polarity whereas for CRT displays, the highest ranked are contrastive color combinations with negative polarity. The findings of this study can be used to determine the best possible color combinations when developing content displayed on LCDs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This paper examines the impact of text and background color combinations on the legibility of text presented on liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Displays based on liquid crystal technology are the most widely represented, being used with personal computers and other modern electronic devices. Due to the very intense development that started in 1968, they have reached a very high level of quality (Kubo et al., 2000) and have held a dominant market share since 2005.

The legibility of the information presented is one of the main requirements of effective readability (Legge et al., 1987; Sanders and McCormick, 1993). Legibility is understood as the visual properties of a character or symbol that determine the ease with which it can be recognized with respect to the ANSI/HFS 100 (1988) standard. It is only affected by the spatial vision abilities of the observer. Legibility can be enhanced by high luminance and color contrast, larger targets, and increased inter- and intra-target spacing (Sanders and McCormick, 1993). Legibility can also be affected by different display angles (Cai et al., 2013) or in case of color LCD e-readers by text direction, screen size and character size (Lin et al., 2012). Readability can be measured by the reading rate, identification of misspelled words, searching for pre-specified letters/words within lists or passages, and so on. Because readability is considered a psychological response, several factors influence its performance. These factors are difficult to isolate when readability performance is being measured (Gradisar et al., 2010). Therefore, this research focuses solely on legibility.

Human information processing when reading, learning, and making decisions depends on how information has been adopted, which is subject to various possible forms of presentation (Ghani and Lusk, 1981; Suh, 1999). Research on how color combinations affect visual perception dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. Researchers tried to determine which color combinations would make posters most visible from a distance (Le Courier du Livre, 1912; Luckiesh, 1923). The earliest experiments were conducted in bright sunlight and people were asked to read two rows of letters from various distances. It was determined that the most legible color combination was black letters on a yellow background. Based on the various color combinations tested, the experiment yielded what is known as the Le Courier legibility table which ranks 13 different combinations of text color on background color. Further research was needed given the ordinal ranking and lack of detail about the experiment. Accordingly, various legibility and readability studies were conducted (Tinker and Paterson, 1928, 1929a, 1929b, 1929c, 1929d, 1929e, 1932, 1940, 1942, 1944, 1946; Tinker, 1955, 1963); these also examined the influence of colors. Their findings led to the conclusion that readability does not depend on color as such, but on brightness differences. However, all of the researchers generally recommended dark characters on light backgrounds.

With the development of computers and advent of electric displays, various studies were carried out on whether screen reading is more difficult than reading printed text (Mason and Mitroff, 1973). More in-depth research was soon conducted (Christ, 1975; Teichner, 1979; Gremillion and Jenkins, 1981; Silverstein, 1982). Experimental studies showed that reading from paper is easier and faster than from displays (Gould et al., 1987; Dillon, 1992). While some data reported otherwise (Oborne and Holton, 1988), by the early 1990s the matter was resolved and image quality was clearly identified as a crucial variable (Jorna and Snyder, 1991).

However, the color combination of text and background has been proven to be an important characteristic of visual stimuli that may affect the visual performance of displays (Radl, 1980; Pace, 1984). Other studies have also pointed out that some colors such as red, green, and blue should not be used in combination with each other (Bruce and Foster, 1982; Murch, 1985; Matthews and Mertins, 1987). However, with the rapid development of various displays (Tombling and Tillin, 2001) and their widespread use, it is not so much a question of comparing legibility between paper and displays, but comparing different types of displays.

Many researchers believe that TFT-LCDs (or LCDs for short) allow more effective visual perception (Menozzi et al., 1999, 2001; Nose et al., 1999; Shieh and Lin, 2000; Wright et al., 1999; Ziefle, 2001) in comparison to cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. LCDs also outperform CRTs when it comes to anti-glare effects (Choi and Miyasaka, 1993) and are also generally more popular than their CRT counterparts (Chen and Lin, 2004; Shieh and Lin, 2000). LCDs are the optimum choice when it comes to personal computer displays and television sets because of their better optical specifications (e.g., wider viewing angle, greater brightness), ever-growing size, and low energy consumption.

The main difference between LCDs and other types of displays is how the screen generates colors: LCDs function as subtractive-color displays, whereas CRTs function as integrative-color displays (Post and Reinhart, 1997). The light in LCDs is generated by regular or cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs). Since the flow of light is constant, it must be limited or veiled on some parts of the display. However, the light cannot be veiled completely and hence LCDs cannot display black as well as other types of displays. Each dot on an LCD screen is composed of three different permeable colors beneath which lies a layer of liquid crystals. Their shape and polarization is managed by an electrical field that is switched on or off by a thin-film transistor (TFT).

CRT displays have different optical traits than LCDs (MacKenzie and Riddersma, 1994; Post and Reinhart, 1997; Stix, 1989). The effects of contrast, brightness, and polarity measured while using CRT displays are thus not necessarily also valid for LCD displays.

With the growing popularity of LCDs in the last decade there has also been growth in research on LCD legibility. Some of the more interesting researches relating to this paper are summarized below.


                     Huang and Chiu (2007) investigated the effects of color combinations for figure/icon background, icon shape, and line width of the icon border on visual search performance on LCDs. Both icon color combination and exposure time have significant effects on the accuracy of icon legibility (Yeh et al., 2012). Shieh and Lai (2008) looked at the effects of target and background color combinations on subjective preference for stimuli presented on a visual display terminal under various ambient illuminations, luminance contrasts, and stimulus types. Their analysis showed that the main effect of color combination was significant for the three dependent variables. Black-on-white and blue-on-white were the most preferred combinations, whereas turquoise-on-green and turquoise-on-red were the least preferred. Fletcher and Sutherland (2009) together with Nugent (2009) sought to identify the luminance and contrast levels needed to minimize the threshold identification size of bright letters displayed over a dark background on LCDs under low and high lighting conditions. Lin and Huang (2009) studied the effect of color combination, which includes luminance contrast ratio and chromaticity contrast, and ambient illumination on visual perception time using LCDs. A normal ambient illumination level and high luminance contrast ratio seem to be the optimal choice for designing a workplace with LCDs. Chang et al. (2012) have shown that chromaticity and luminance have little effect on legibility speed, however they both significantly affect subjective preference. Participants in their research appeared to prefer medium luminance.

Based on the above literature outline and the deficiencies of previous studies, the main research question we address in this paper is: does the color combination of background and text on an LCD screen affect the legibility?

Since the effects of contrast, brightness, and polarity measured while using different types of displays are not necessarily valid for all of those types, there is an evident need for an empirical study on LCDs. Furthermore, we wish to compare the results across different electronic screen display types and printed text as a representative of traditional media.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

This study examines the legibility of various color combinations of text and background presented on LCDs by experimenting with the sequential repetition of two different tasks. The participants' first task was to identify characters displayed in the middle of an LCD. The study therefore controlled for the color combination of text and background, and the dependent variable was the number of correctly identified characters as a measure of visual performance. In the second task, the participants were asked to subjectively rate the legibility of each text/background combination on a ten-point Likert scale.

The colors used in the experiment were chosen from a number of suitable colors from a non-dithering color palette (Lehn and Stern, 2000). Although a very large number of color combinations might be utilized in an experiment of this kind, it was necessary to limit the present study to a smaller number of well-defined colors. To ensure the possibility of a comparison with previous studies, eight colors distributed across the entire spectrum were chosen in this fundamental research: (1) white; (2) yellow; (3) red; (4) magenta; (5) blue; (6) cyan; (7) green; and (8) black. The colors are described in Table 1
                        .

To allow the researchers to repeat the experiment or use the color combinations from this experiment for other experiments in the future, the colors are detailed with RGB triplets, CIE (1931) chromaticity coordinates (x, y), and luminance (L), which were measured on the display. In the CIE colorimetric colors are expressed on the basis of the international CIE X, Y, Z color system (CIE, 1931), which are mathematically defined by the coordinates of the absolute values of red, green, and blue, which are not mutually orthogonal but can be translated into mathematical orthogonal axes of brightness and chromaticity (x,y). In order to achieve uniform sensitivity of the detection of the changes across the grid the CIE (1986) proposed Uniform Color Space coordinates (u′, v′) required for the derivation of color differences which are also provided in Table 1.

Some early studies (Bruce and Foster, 1982; Pace, 1984) did not specify the various colors used in sufficient detail to enable later repetition of the experiment. Using color names such as “green” or “blue” can incorporate a great variety of color casts, ranging from light to dark hues. Some other experiments (Pace, 1984) did not properly control the brightness and contrast, which were adjusted by individual users to their preferred levels. However, more recent studies (Shieh et al., 1997; Shieh and Lin, 2000; Wang and Chen, 2003) remedy some of these issues by defining the colors by the CIE (1931) chromaticity coordinates. The latest studies also give information about colors with RGB triplets (Ling and van Schaik, 2002; Pearson and van Schaik, 2003; Hall and Hanna, 2004). However, the gamma values and color temperatures of the display's white points were not given.

Each of the eight colors presented above were combined with the rest (seven), resulting in 56 different color combinations of text and background. The combinations are shown in Table 2
                        , together with their assigned group, luminance contrast, color difference, and polarity of color combinations used in this study.

In the literature, many definitions for color difference exist, based on different color spaces. However, in terms of legibility, the simplified color difference formulation proposed by Lippert (1986) outperformed other definitions of color difference. Consequently, the color difference employed in this study for evaluating the influence of color difference on legibility in formal analysis is given as: ΔE(L, u′, v′) = ((155ΔL/L
                        max)2 + (367Δu′)2 + (167Δv′)2)0,5, where ΔL is the difference in luminance of a text and background, L
                        max is the maximum luminance of a text or background, Δu′ is the difference between u′ coordinates of a text and background, and Δv′ is the difference between v′ coordinates of a text and background. See Humar et al. (2008) for more details on color coordinates in different color spaces and color differences.

Because the number of color combinations tested (56) is very large for a single participant to go through, it was decided to split the combinations into four different groups marked with letters A–D. Each group consisted of 14 combinations. Participants were randomly selected to evaluate one of these four groups. Because the order of particular color combinations used in experiment was also randomized, the experiment involved 60 persons (and 840 measurements) for one series of tests. To provide for better estimates, we conducted 5 of such experimental series, so the overall sampling finally involved 300 persons (patrons in further text) where 4200 measurements were taken.

The participants in the experiment were undergraduate students at the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Economics. The group consisted of 152 males and 156 females. Their average age was 19.33 years, ranging from 18 to 24 with a standard deviation of 0.83. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. They were tested with Ishihara tests for color blindness in order to identify participants with color vision deficiencies (protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia). Eight participants, six males and two females, did not pass this test. They still participated in the experiment, although their results were not included in the analysis. All participants had at least basic computer experience.

To ensure an adequate and equal testing environment, all participants used the same equipment. Our experiment was conducted on a 19-inch Samsung SyncMaster 191T display. The screen resolution was set to 1280 × 1024 pixels without interpolation. The pixel size was 0.294 mm, the chromatic resolution was 24 bit, the luminance level of the white point was greater than 250 cd/m2, and the contrast ratio was 500:1. The response time was 25 ms with a viewing angle of 85°, and the luminance values of the working environment and CIE values of the colors used were assigned with a Minolta XY-DC/XY-1 color analyzer.

To further ensure equal conditions, we arranged the viewing conditions in conformance with the ANSI/HFS 100-1988 (1988) and ISO 9241-3 (1992) standards. Accordingly, the working environment had a neutral color (light brown) with no surfaces that would cause glare or reflection on the LCD. The only light source in the room where the experiment was being conducted was a shaded light on the ceiling; all other light sources were veiled. The ambient illumination in the room was less than 300 lux. The luminance values of the ambient were measured with a digital lux-meter.

The participants were seated in a position where the distance between the screen and the participants' eyes was 1.4 m, which is in accordance with Kroemer's (1993) suggestion; however, the preferred distance in the latest research has been shown to be between 0.68 and 0.76 m (Shin and Hegde, 2010). The screen center was slightly below the participants' eye height, forming a viewing angle of approximately 15°. The inclination of the monitor was 105°, which is in line with previous studies (Shieh and Chen, 1997; Shieh and Lin, 2000).

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

The experiment had two components: (1) a visual performance task followed by (2) a subjective rating task. In the visual performance task, a participant was exposed to 14 different color combinations from one of the groups (A–D) which were selected randomly. In the subjective rating a participant rated the legibility of all 56 color combinations on a ten-point Likert scale.

The participants took approximately 30 min to complete both tasks. Following completion, the participants were thanked and then fully debriefed.

The participants' task was to identify the characters displayed in the middle of the LCD. Each test consisted of 21 alphabetical characters arranged into six rows and organized in conformance with a Snellen chart (Snellen, 1862): one character in the first row, two characters in the second row, three characters in the third row, four characters in the fourth row, five characters in the fifth row and six characters in the sixth row.

The sizes of the characters varied from 3.8 mm in the first row to 1.4 mm in the sixth row with vertical spreads of between 5.6 mm and 3.7 mm. The space between characters in the same row was one blank space. To ensure the possibility of comparing the results with past studies of printed text and CRT, the font used in the experiment was Times New Roman. Characters used in the experiment were randomly chosen from the group of characters that are distinguishable among themselves (Snellen, 1862): E, F, P, T, O, Z, L, C, D, and B.

As mentioned, the combinations were split into four different groups because the amount of different text on background combinations was too large (56) for each participant to identify all of them. Within groups, the color combinations were ordered by utilizing a Latin square design approach.

Each participant received instructions before conducting the experiment. A trial test followed which allowed the participants to familiarize themselves with the test. Each test was triggered by pressing a key on the keyboard. Between each test the participants were exposed to a screen with a relaxing light gray color (10 cd/m2) to neutralize the effect of the previous color combination. Each participant identified aloud as many characters as he or she could see. The experimenter carefully recorded the characters. In the first task, the number of correctly identified characters was thus the visual performance measure. The time to perform the task was not limited, nor was the time to perform the task a measure of the performance.

Before running the experiments we conducted a set of tests with which we calibrated the measurement scale where we decided on the proper balance of the difficulty of the task and achieved scores.

After finishing the visual performance experiment, each participant was asked to subjectively rate the legibility of all 56 color combinations by responding to a question: “How legible do you find the characters presented in this color combination?” on a ten-point Likert scale, with 1 labeled “very poor legibility” and 10 “excellent legibility”. The participants were presented random sets of Snellen chart characters of size 3.5 mm in different color combinations and instructed to review them for their legibility. The time for completing this part of the experiment was not limited.

@&#RESULTS@&#

To analyze legibility, we conducted a multilevel analysis of relationship between visual performance scores and three physical characteristics of color combinations: luminance contrast, color difference and polarity. The basic model below expresses a linear relationship between test scores and variables describing each color combination characteristics:

                        ). The analysis is essentially performed by estimating a separate regression model for each patron, where his results are dependent from luminance contrast, color difference and polarity. In this way, the model is hierarchical since it incorporates two hierarchical levels. On the first level we have measurements for all patrons (as we explained, we have performed 14 measurements per patron.) On the second level, each patron represents the unit of analysis, and his measurements are grouped together. The model assumes that each patron might have a specific intercept coefficient and specific slope coefficients for explanatory variables. In general, a patron with a higher intercept is predicted to have a higher score. Similarly, differences in the slope coefficients for explanatory variables indicate that luminance contrast, color difference and polarity might not affect the results for all patrons in the same direction and level. In this way, the model accounts for differences between individual patrons. Important to note is that we assume that luminance contrast, color difference and polarity affect the results on the first hierarchical level, i.e. on the level of each measurement, but that the strength and direction of these influences might differ among patrons. Since regression coefficients may vary, the model has to account for this.

In hierarchical regression models, the variability of regression coefficients, estimated on the first level is usually modeled as a set of regression models on the higher level. In our case, these regression models are simplistic since we didn't introduce any additional explanatory variables which would explain possible differences between patrons, so we have regression coefficients which are defined around a central (mean) value γ which is equal for all population of patrons, and individual differences u

For our analysis, we firstly checked the dataset. There were no missing values or outliers, the only issue was the normality assumption about the dependent variable. Skewness was estimated at −1.214 and kurtosis at 0.524, while its mean value equals 15.26 and std. deviation 5.667. As a remedial measure for substantial negative skewness we performed a transformation of scores using the rule

                                    )

                        )+1 = 21 (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2001). In this way, skewness was reduced to −0.079 (with kurtosis −0.849, mean value 0.6767 and std. deviation 0.3808). Besides this, we conducted further calculations (as described below) by using maximum likelihood (ML) approach with ‘sandwich estimator’ to produce robust standard errors (Hox, 2010). ML approach by itself remedies the non-normality situation and provides for unbiased estimators, but this is not the case with estimators for standard errors, where we employed the robust standard errors technique.

As mentioned above, the experiment was done in five series with equal number of participants and measurements. We conducted the estimation of model (3) with measurements from four experimental series (involving 240 persons and 3360 measurements), thus leaving one of the experimental series for comparison purposes, to test for a predicting power of the model.

As a base model, we estimated the intercept-only model (M1) without the inclusion of any explanatory variables. The model estimates are presented in Table 3
                        . We can see that the intercept is 0.6767 (which is exactly the mean value of the dependent variable), and that there is a significant variability of the dependent variable across patrons (observed by 
                           
                              
                                 σ

                                    0

                        ).

The second model (M2) includes predictor variables. Its deviance, which expresses the lack of fit between model and data, is smaller than the deviance of the intercept-only model, which shows that M2 does a better job in explaining the variability in the dataset (Snijders and Bosker, 2012). Moreover, we can see that the regression coefficients for luminance contrast, color difference and polarity are significant. Coefficients are negative due to the transformation of the dependent variable, according to our expectations. Model M2 also shows that the regression coefficients for luminance contrast and polarity are different across patrons (

                        ), whereas the regression coefficient for color difference does not differ significantly across patrons, which is interesting. We performed the estimation of model (3) with the exclusion of color difference from the random part, and the results are practically equal to the results of M2, so they are not presented here.

Inspection of the residuals shows that they are normally distributed with mean value 0.000, std. deviation 0.240, kurtosis 0.185 and skewness −0.140. Their scatter plot against their standardized values shows no systematic patterns regarding the violation of assumptions of normality.

We estimated the difference of explained variance between M1 and M2. From Table 3 we can see that

                         for M1 equals 0.1451 and for M2 is 0.335. R
                        2 is thus estimated to be 1 − (0.1335/0.1451) = 0.0804, which is rather small. This is according to Snijders and Bosker (2012) who explain that estimated values for R
                        2 usually change very little when random regression coefficients are included in the model.

Because of this, we tested for the predictive strength of the model by employing a separate test sample of 840 observations from additional 60 patrons. The test was made by performing correlation analysis between measured results and scores, predicted according to the fixed part of model M2. The correlation coefficient of 0.588 shows correlation between predicted values and actual results, whereas its squared value suggests that the model explains 34.5% of variance in the test sample.

Additionally to the model results, we prepared a table of predicted test scores and ranking for each of the color combinations (Table 4
                        ).

Subjective ratings were analyzed by means of within-subjects ANOVA. There were no outliers and issues regarding the normality assumption. Since the sphericity assumption was not met (Mauchly's W = 0, χ
                        2 = 6192.78, d.f. = 1539, p < 0.001), we performed Greenhouse–Geisser correction with which we determined that subjective rankings differed significantly across color combinations, F (23,584, 7051.61) = 705.439, p < 0.001. The mean values and standard deviations of the participants' subjective ranks in the experiment are shown in Table 5
                        . The results are sorted by descending mean values of each subjective rank. The values range between 9.277and 1.083. The following color combinations have the highest rankings: black on white, black on yellow, blue on white, and blue on yellow. The combinations at the bottom end of the rankings are white on yellow, cyan on green, magentaon red, and yellow on white.

A similar within-subjects analysis of variance was conducted to compare the polarity with the subjective results. The results show a statistically significant (F (1, 16,798) = 97.814 (p < 0.001)) effect of polarity on subjective scores. In general, color combinations with darker text on a lighter background led to higher average values (6.44) than color combinations with lighter text on a darker background (4.82).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This paper studied the impact of color combinations on the legibility of text presented on LCDs using a number of correctly identified characters and the subjective ranking of legibility on a ten-point scale. The research also specifically focused on the relationship between legibility and polarity.

The results show a statistically significant influence of color combinations on legibility. Several researchers have also shown the same significant influence, but their studies included significantly smaller numbers (2–12) of different color combinations (Hall and Hanna, 2004; Ling and van Schaik, 2002; Shieh and Lin, 2000; Wang and Chen, 2003; Wu and Yuan, 2003) or different display technology (Humar et al., 2008). To our knowledge, this is the first study in this area that proves a statistically significant influence of text/background color combinations on the legibility of LCDs for a large sample of color combinations with different wavelengths that vary across the entire color spectrum. We used a relatively high number of subjects (308), significantly more than the number of subjects included in previous studies (Pace, 1984; Shieh et al., 1997; Lin, 2003) which were based on a small number of subjects (20–40) with a small number of different color combinations (5–25).

We found many important differences when comparing the research in this paper with previous research on paper (Le Courier, 1912), and from CRT displays (Humar et al., 2008).

The results reveal that the greatest difference is with the following combinations: black on white, red on green and red on yellow, which achieved higher rankings in our study than on Le Courier's scale. The first two also did not perform well on CRTs. Yellow on black and white on blue performed significantly better on CRT than on LCD. Two other noticeable differences are green on white and white on green, which have significantly lower ranks in our study than in Le Courier's study but are approximately the same on the CRT display scale. A combination that also ranked much higher when compared to other combinations in our research was white on black, which is ranked fifth here, but ranked tenth on Le Courier's scale.

The order of color combinations as shown in Table 6
                      for LCDs is different from the order for CRT displays. The most remarkable result is that for CRT displays, the highest ranked are contrastive color combinations with negative polarity, whereas for LCDs the highest ranked are contrastive color combinations with positive polarity.

The results of the research presented here show that the Le Courier and CRT scales are inappropriate for LCDs. We therefore suggest that the results presented in this paper should serve as a new table for predicting the legibility of texts displayed on LCDs.

Text presented in lecture halls often simultaneously appears on multiple visual displays (e.g., blackboards, projection screens, video monitors), which should be legible to the entire audience seated in an ideal viewing area (Cai et al., 2011). Therefore Table 6 also has a practical value for the reader when a certain color combination needs to be picked with different display options in mind.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study showed that color combinations have a significant effect on the legibility of text presented on LCDs. It has been proven that the Le Courier legibility table for subtractive colors and the legibility table for CRTs are inappropriate for LCDs. We therefore propose a new legibility table for LCDs (see Table 5).

Based on our research, we believe that this field of research still offers various interesting avenues for research. The current findings on the legibility on LCDs are not yet clearly linked with the context of readability or visual attention or any other trends in real world applications so this is one of the main topics for possible further research. Other future research could focus on other types of displays that are prevalent in current use, such as active matrix LCDs, which are mainly used in handheld devices, phones, and modern notebook computers. Another research option is legibility testing, with a focus on the color combinations most frequently used in modern webpage designs together with colors with various chromatic ties or achromatic levels and saturations, such as brown, gray, or light red.
