                  At about the same time (approximately 1989), R. Liu introduced the notion of simplicial depth and R. Randles the notion of interdirections. These completely independent and seemingly unrelated initiatives, serving different purposes in nonparametric multivariate analysis, have spawned significant activity within their quite different respective domains. A surprising and fruitful connection between the two notions is shown. Exploiting the connection, statistical procedures based on interdirections can be modified to use simplicial depth instead, at considerable reduction of computational burden in the case of dimensions 2, 3, and 4. Implications regarding multivariate sign test statistics are discussed in detail, and several other potential applications are noted.

In order to define affine equivariant order statistics and related quantities in the setting of multivariate data in higher dimensional space where there is no natural order, notions of depth function for the purpose of measuring centrality of points

                      have been developed, beginning with the seminal halfspace depth of Tukey (1975). When a quite different version, the simplicial depth, was introduced by Liu (1988, 1990), it became realized that in fact there are many viable and interesting implementations of the idea of depth function. Among the many versions of depth function that have been formulated, the most prominent in current practice are perhaps the halfspace, simplicial, Mahalanobis, spatial, and projection depths. A review of depth functions with respect to structural features is provided by Zuo and Serfling (2000a), and the wide range of their methodological applications is laid out by Liu et al. (1999).

In general, a depth function induces a definition of multivariate median, given by the point(s) of maximal depth. Also, corresponding quantile and rank functions are generated by the nested contours of equal centrality at levels decreasing from the “center”. Depth functions desirably are affine invariant. On the other hand, one may initially formulate some multivariate rank function and generate corresponding depth and quantile functions. For some discussion of such interrelations, see Serfling (2006a, 2010).

With either a depth function or a rank function in hand, one may formulate an associated multivariate “sign test” of a hypothesized “center”

                     . When the depth and rank functions correspond to each other, these are equivalent. The “center” might be formulated as the multivariate median according to a particular depth notion, or as the point of symmetry according to a given notion of symmetry. With respect to the latter, we will here refer to several key notions of symmetry, elliptical symmetry, central symmetry, elliptical directions, angular symmetry, and halfspace symmetry.

Our goal here is to establish and exploit a special relationship between the simplicial depth of Liu (1988, 1990) and the notion of “interdirections” introduced by Randles (1989) in formulating a new multivariate sign test. Specifically, we introduce an “interdirections depth” and show that it is linearly equivalent to the simplicial depth in dimension 
                        d
                        =
                        2
                      and approximately equivalent in higher dimension 
                        d
                        ≥
                        3
                     . In their direct formulations, the simplicial depth and the interdirections both pose a computational burden of order 
                        O
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 d
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     , which becomes quickly prohibitive as 
                        d
                      increases. However, for the simplicial depth, more favorable algorithms have been developed in the cases 
                        d
                        =
                        2
                     , 3, and 4. Also, the simplicial depth is conceptually simpler than the interdirections. Statistical procedures based on interdirections can thus be modified to use simplicial depth instead, thereby taking advantage of more efficient computational algorithms and greater conceptual appeal, without loss of practical effectiveness. In particular, we compare the sign test introduced by Liu (1990) based on simplicial depth and the above-mentioned sign test of Randles (1989).

We proceed as follows. The simplicial depth is reviewed in Section  2, along with details on its computation. The interdirections and our associated interdirections depth function are treated in Section  3. The special connection between the two depths is developed in Section  4, where also comparisons with respect to computation time are made. Several statistical procedures that use interdirections and which could profitably be modified to use simplicial depth instead are noted in Section  5, with selected multivariate sign tests for location treated in detail.

In the case of higher dimension, a standard approach toward overcoming computational complexity is to take just a random subset of the data.

                        , this is prohibitive for large 
                           n
                        . As discussed in Hallin and Paindaveine (2002a), this computational burden motivates the use of other test statistics that are more readily computed.

As mentioned in Section  1, not only do depth functions induce rank functions, but the converse holds. Thus, although the interdirections have been introduced strictly in the context of sign tests and related tests, it is important to explore whether there is an associated notion of “median”, just as in the univariate case the sign test is associated with estimation of a median. More comprehensively, we ask whether we can identify a productive “interdirections depth function”. Indeed, we now formulate and study such a depth function.

We show that the simplicial and interdirections depth functions are exactly equivalent in the bivariate case and nearly so in higher dimensions. Of course, taking computational burden into consideration, the bivariate case is the one of greatest practical significance.

Analogous simulations for dimensions 
                                    d
                                    ≥

                     Theorems 1 and 2, Remark 3, and the findings from Table 1 altogether suggest replacing interdirections approaches by simplicial depth approaches. The simplicial depth performs comparably to the interdirections depth in efficiency while offering some computational advantage as well as greater conceptual appeal. Of course, for dimension 
                        d
                        ≥
                        5
                     , both depths are prohibitive computationally, except for very small sample sizes. However, especially for 
                        d
                        =
                        2
                      and also for 
                        d
                        =
                        3
                      and 4, the computational advantage of the simplicial depth is substantial. On this basis, various statistical procedures involving interdirections may profitably be modified by substituting use of the simplicial depth. Multivariate sign tests for location are discussed in Section  5.1, and several other possibilities are noted in Section  5.2.

We discuss five multivariate sign tests for location.

On the basis of the above considerations, for testing a center of symmetry by a sign test, the simplicial depth approach using 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                         is simple conceptually, relatively attractive computationally, competitively efficient, and accompanied by asymptotic distribution theory under merely the angular symmetry assumption. Further, it is affine invariant. This sign test is worthy of more extensive investigation, not only for the bivariate case but also, through some variants, for higher dimension. It evidently captures in an efficient way information about location.

We note several other statistical procedures based on interdirections that are candidates for developing modifications based on simplicial depth to improve computational time while maintaining the same or comparable efficiency. Peters and Randles (1990) develop a type of signed-rank test for location based on the interdirections. Jan and Randles (1994) develop a signed-sum test of multivariate location using interdirections, and Randles and Peters (1990) and Um and Randles (1998) extend it to the multi-sample setting. Asymptotically locally optimal tests of multivariate location in the setting of elliptical symmetry using interdirections are developed by Hallin and Paindaveine (2002b). Similarly, Hallin and Paindaveine (2002c) construct interdirections-based tests against serial dependence, and Hallin and Paindaveine (2005) provide tests for linear models with VARMA errors. These various possibilities for modification using simplicial depth will be explored in separate studies.
