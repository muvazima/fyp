                     –INT for ranking a finite set of alternatives evaluated on multiple criteria. It belongs to the family of Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) methods which build a set of preference models compatible with preference information elicited by the Decision Maker (DM). The preference model used by UTA
                     
                        GMS
                     –INT is a general additive value function augmented by two types of components corresponding to “bonus” or “penalty” values for positively or negatively interacting pairs of criteria, respectively. When calculating value of a particular alternative, a bonus is added to the additive component of the value function if a given pair of criteria is in a positive synergy for performances of this alternative on the two criteria. Similarly, a penalty is subtracted from the additive component of the value function if a given pair of criteria is in a negative synergy for performances of the considered alternative on the two criteria. The preference information elicited by the DM is composed of pairwise comparisons of some reference alternatives, as well as of comparisons of some pairs of reference alternatives with respect to intensity of preference, either comprehensively or on a particular criterion. In UTA
                     
                        GMS
                     –INT, ROR starts with identification of pairs of interacting criteria for given preference information by solving a mixed-integer linear program. Once the interacting pairs are validated by the DM, ROR continues calculations with the whole set of compatible value functions handling the interacting criteria, to get necessary and possible preference relations in the considered set of alternatives. A single representative value function can be calculated to attribute specific scores to alternatives. It also gives values to bonuses and penalties. UTA
                     
                        GMS
                     –INT handles quite general interactions among criteria and provides an interesting alternative to the Choquet integral.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Ranking, choice or sorting decision with respect to a finite set of alternatives evaluated on a finite set of criteria is a problem of uttermost importance in many real-world areas of decision-making (Ehrgott, Figueira, & Greco, 2010; Figueira, Greco, & Ehrgott, 2005). Among many approaches that have been designed to support the Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), three of them seem to prevail. The first one exploits the idea of assigning a score to each alternative, as it is the case of MAUT - Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (Keeney & Raiffa, 1976). The second relies on the principle of pairwise comparison of alternatives, as it is the case of outranking methods (Roy, 1996). The third one induces logical “if…, then…” decision rules from decision examples, as it is the case of DRSA – Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (Greco, Matarazzo, & Słowiński, 2001; Słowiński, Greco, & Matarazzo, 2009). The value function, the outranking relation and the set of decision rules are three preference models underlying these three main approaches. It is known that in order to build such models, the Decision Maker (DM) has to provide some preference information.

The preference information may be either direct or indirect, depending whether it specifies directly values of some parameters used in the preference model (e.g., trade-off weights, aspiration levels, discrimination thresholds, etc.) or whether it specifies some examples of holistic judgments from which compatible values of the preference model parameters are induced. Eliciting direct preference information from the DM can be counterproductive in real-world decision-making because of a high cognitive effort required. Consequently, asking directly the DM to provide values for the parameters seems to make the DM uncomfortable. Eliciting indirect preference is less demanding of the cognitive effort. Indirect preference information is mainly used in the ordinal regression paradigm. According to this paradigm, a holistic preference information on a subset of some reference or training alternatives is known first and then a preference model compatible with the information is built and applied to the whole set of alternatives in order to arrive at a ranking, choice, or sorting recommendation.

Usually, from among many sets of parameters of a preference model representing the preference information given by the DM, only one specific set is selected and used to work out a recommendation. For example, while there exist many value functions representing the holistic preference information given by the DM, only one value function is typically used to recommend the best ranking, choice, or sorting of alternatives. Since the selection of one from among many sets of parameters compatible with the preference information given by the DM is rather arbitrary, robust ordinal regression proposes taking into account all the sets of parameters compatible with the preference information, in order to give a recommendation in terms of necessary and possible consequences of applying all the compatible instances of the preference model on the considered set of alternatives.

The recently proposed MCDA methods implementing robust ordinal regression on the three above-mentioned preference models have been described in Greco, Słowiński, Figueira, and Mousseau (2010). The first method in the series, called UTA
                     
                        GMS
                      (Greco, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2008), generalizes the UTA method (Jacquet-Lagrèze & Siskos, 1982) which applies ordinal regression to assess a set of additive value functions compatible with preference information provided by the DM. UTA aims at giving a complete ranking using one compatible value function, which is the one minimizing the sum of deviation errors or minimizing the number of ranking errors in the sense of Kendall or Spearman distance. In Jacquet-Lagrèze and Siskos (1982), the authors of UTA also recommend post-optimality analysis consisting in exploration of the vertices of the polyhedron of compatible value functions, in particular, the vertices for which one or more criteria get a maximum or minimum weight. UTA
                     
                        GMS
                      is considering instead the whole set of compatible additive value functions to compute necessary and possible preference relations.

Even if the additive model is among the most popular ones, some critics have been addressed to this model because it has to obey an often unrealistic hypothesis about preferential independence among criteria. In consequence, it is not able to represent interactions among criteria. For example, consider evaluation of cars using such criteria as maximum speed, acceleration and price. In this case, there may exist a negative interaction (negative synergy) between maximum speed and acceleration because a car with a high maximum speed also has a good acceleration, so, even if each of these two criteria is very important for a DM who likes sport cars, their joint impact on reinforcement of preference of a more speedy and better accelerating car over a less speedy and worse accelerating car will be smaller than a simple addition of the two impacts corresponding to each of the two criteria considered separately in validation of this preference relation. In the same decision problem, there may exist a positive interaction (positive synergy) between maximum speed and price because a car with a high maximum speed usually also has a high price, and thus a car with a high maximum speed and relatively low price is very much appreciated. Thus, the comprehensive impact of these two criteria on the strength of preference of a more speedy and cheaper car over a less speedy and more expensive car is greater than the impact of the two criteria considered separately in validation of this preference relation.

To handle the interactions among criteria, one can consider non-additive integrals, such as Choquet integral and Sugeno integral (for a comprehensive survey on the use of non-additive integrals in MCDA see Grabisch, 1996). The non-additive integrals suffer, however, from some limitations within MCDA (Roy, 2009); in particular, they need that the evaluations on all criteria are expressed on the same scale. This means that in order to apply a non-additive integral it is necessary, for example, to estimate if the maximum speed of 200km/h is as valuable as the price of 35,000€.

In this paper, we propose a new aggregation model which modifies the usual additive value function model so as to handle interactions among criteria without the necessity of expressing all the evaluations on the same scale. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce main concepts and notation. In Section 3, first we show by an example what means violation of the preferential independence hypothesis for an additive value function, and then we continue the same example to show that the well known Choquet integral is not able to represent properly the observed interaction between criteria. In Section 4, we recall basic concepts and properties of robust ordinal regression. Our main proposal, extending UTA
                     
                        GMS
                      to the case of interacting criteria, is given in Section 5. It starts with a reminder of the principle of robust ordinal regression, and then continues with presentation of the UTA
                     
                        GMS
                     –INT method. An illustrative example is provided in Section 6. The last section contains conclusions. All the proofs are deferred to the appendix.

We are considering a multiple criteria decision problem where a finite set of alternatives

                     ). To simplify notation, we will identify the family of criteria with set I of their indices. The family of criteria is supposed to satisfy consistency conditions (Roy & Bouyssou, 1993), i.e., completeness (all relevant criteria are considered), monotonicity (the better the evaluation of an alternative on considered criteria, the more it is preferable to another), and non-redundancy (no superfluous criteria are considered).

Let us explain, by an example inspired by Grabisch (1996), what means violation of the preferential independence hypothesis for an additive value function (1). Consider the case of a dean of some school that has to compare four students on the basis of their scores in Mathematics, Physics and Literature presented in Table 1
                     . Here,

                     . This confirms that the dean’s preferences cannot be represented by a multiple attribute additive value function.

The question arises, how to represent such a situation with a value function? The literature provides several proposals for handling interactions among criteria in preference modeling by value (utility) functions. Browsing the literature, one can observe that there are two groups of methods. One group of proposals constitutes an approach by decomposition and graphical representation of additive value functions under ceteris paribus assumption: these are GAI-networks (Gonzales & Perny, 2005) and UCP-networks (Boutilier, Bacchus, & Brafman, 2001). Another group of proposals consists in using a more advanced form of the value function than just additive; let us mention the multilinear utility function (Keeney & Raiffa, 1976), and the Choquet integral (Angilella, Greco, & Matarazzo, 2010; Choquet, 1953; Grabisch, 1996), considered to be more general than additive value functions.

GAI-networks, as well as UCP-networks, rely on the idea of Generalized Additive Independence (GAI) decomposition introduced in Fishburn (1967) to allow representation of interactions between attributes while preserving decomposability of the value function. In the GAI model, the value function is the sum of marginal value functions, each one related to a subset of criteria, such that each criterion is considered in at least one marginal value function. GAI networks give a graphical representation of subsets of criteria for which there is a marginal value function. UCP-networks determine subsets of criteria considered in the GAI decomposition on the basis of a graphical model exploiting conditional preferential independence in structuring decision maker’s preferences under the ceteris paribus assumption.

On the other hand, the multilinear utility function (Keeney & Raiffa, 1976) is expressed as a weighted sum of products of marginal utilities corresponding to single criteria, over all subsets of criteria. The Choquet integral can be seen in turn as an average of marginal values, not on the basis of weights assigned to each criterion, but on the basis of a capacity which assigns a weight to every subset of criteria. In this way, the Choquet integral takes into account interaction between criteria, and even distinguishes positive and negative synergy between criteria. For example, if between two criteria there is a positive synergy, the weight assigned to the two criteria considered together is greater than the sum of the weights of the two criteria considered separately. Negative synergy can be defined analogously.

The model we are proposing in this paper, does not rely on graphical representation nor GAI decomposition of the additive value functions, and thus it is more directly comparable to multilinear utility function and the Choquet integral. More precisely:
                        
                           (a)
                           if one considers couples of interacting criteria only (giving null weights to products of three or more marginal utilities), the multilinear utility model is a special case of our model where the positive or negative synergy related to a couple of criteria is represented by the product of marginal utilities multiplied by a positive or negative weight, respectively;

if one considers a 2-additive capacity (Grabisch, 1997; Mayag, 2010), i.e., capacity in which only interaction of couples of criteria is considered, the Choquet integral is a special case of our model where the positive or negative synergy related to a couple of criteria is represented by the minimum value of the two marginal values multiplied by a positive or negative weight, respectively; the weight multiplying the minimum marginal value is the value that the Möbius representation of the capacity gives to the couples of criteria: it is equal to the value that the capacity gives to the two criteria considered together minus the sum of the values that the capacity gives to the two criteria considered separately.

When using ordinal regression, the main problem of multilinear utility model and the Choquet integral model is that the marginal utilities cannot be determined using linear programming. In case, one would like to find a compatible model of this type using linear programming, the marginal utilities should have to be given as data of the problem. This is a strong hypothesis that one has to take into account in the interpretation of the results of application of these models in the ordinal regression approach (Angilella, Greco, Lamantia, & Matarazzo, 2004 for a discussion of this point with respect to the Choquet integral and for a heuristic to induce both the marginal value functions and a capacity compatible with the DM’s preference information).

Within robust ordinal regression, the Choquet integral has been considered to represent interaction between criteria in Angilella et al. (2010). Of course, in this approach, marginal values were also considered as given. This limitation has to be considered together with other weak points of the Choquet integral recalled at the end of this section.

                      – without distinction of criteria – that would permit to represent the dean’s preferences by the Choquet integral.

To cope with such a hard case of preference representation, one can consider some generalization of the Choquet integral. For example, one can use the Choquet integral with respect to a level dependent capacity (Greco, Matarazzo, & Giove, 2011) or the bipolar Choquet integral (Grabisch & Labreuche, 2005; Labreuche & Grabisch, 2006) (see also Greco, Matarazzo, & Słowiński (2002)). Let us analyze the above example using this latter integral.

                     This time, (12) and (13) are not contradictory, so we can conclude that the bipolar Choquet integral can represent the dean’s preferences. Observe, however, that apart from being much more complex than the basic Choquet integral, the bipolar Choquet integral shares the same problems of the basic Choquet integral, i.e.,:
                        
                           1.
                           Problems with respect to numerical codification. How to transform performances on criteria into numerical values? Moreover, how to express all performances on considered criteria using a single value scale in order to ensure full commensurability? This requires the DM to answer questions like: “is maximum speed of 180km/h worth a fuel consumption of 12l/100km”?

Problems with respect to non-additive weights (capacity). What kind of preference information should be elicited by the DM in order to arrive at the capacities? Is there an intelligible relation between the preference information provided by the DM and the obtained value of the capacity?

Problems with respect to interpretation of the Choquet integral. Is it possible to clearly justify preference of alternative a over alternative b in terms of values of the integral’s components (Roy, 2009)?

Applying a set of additive value functions compatible with preference information provided by the DM to multiple criteria ranking problems was implemented first in UTA
                     
                        GMS
                      (Greco et al., 2008) and GRIP (Figueira, Greco, & Słowiński, 2009) methods. These methods consist of three steps. They start with the preference elicitation process, lead through the statement of appropriate ordinal regression problems, i.e., definition of the set of compatible general additive value functions, and result in calculation of the necessary and possible preference relations on the set of all alternatives. In the following subsections, we recall major steps of the GRIP method.

The DM is expected to provide preference information on a set

                         of reference alternatives. These alternatives should be known by the DM well enough so that she/he is able to express preferences confidently with respect to them.

                        , monotonicity (22) always holds for any subset J of I and, consequently, we can relax the limitation that each criterion can interact with at most one other criterion. Therefore, in case of option (γ
                        +), if interactions of any criterion with more than one other criterion are accepted, one can also remove constraints (38).

                         for option (γ), with bonuses only, could require a “greater presence” of the synergy components as witnessed by the fact that

                        . Therefore, if there is no specific wish from the DM, we would recommend using option (γ
                        +) for the sake of simplicity. Let us remember that in case of option (γ
                        +) one can also relax the limitation that each criterion can interact with at most only one other criterion, which also speaks in favor of this option.

                        . Indeed, the DM’s preference model refers to considered set A of (real or fictitious) alternatives having evaluations in

                        , so it is not surprising that it may become wrong when another set of alternative is considered by the same DM. Nevertheless, to make our study more complete we propose below how to deal with requirement of monotonicity in the whole Cartesian product space

                                    i

                                    X

                        . First, remark that among the options considered for the presence of interaction components in the value function (20), there is option (γ
                        +) that ensures monotonicity in the whole Cartesian product space. In fact, as stated by the following proposition, any value function 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    U

                         being monotonic on A can be extended to the whole Cartesian product 
                           
                              X

                        Observe, moreover, that option (γ
                        +) can be considered as a particular case of options (α) or (β), and therefore, before introducing new variables and before reformulating the monotonicity conditions, as explained before, it is recommended to verify if the preference relation ≿ on A, and, more in general, the preference information supplied by the DM, can be represented using option (γ
                        +) which, by Proposition 3, ensures the existence of an extension to the product space without any further condition. Only when this is not possible, one should pass to apply Proposition 4.

In option (α), value function (20) takes into account all possible positive and negative interactions between pairs of criteria. Analogously, in option (β) only one of

In all these options, however, it is desirable to have a compatible value function with as small number of interactions as possible. In the following, we show how to infer, from the DM’s preference information, a value function (20) for option (α) and (β) and a compatible value function (46) or (47) for option (γ), involving minimal (in the sense of inclusion) sets of couples

                         of interacting criteria. Observe that there can be more than one of such minimal sets, and their intersection is very interesting because, if not empty, it contains couples of interacting criteria that cannot be removed from representation of the DM’s preference information. From this point of view, the minimal sets of interacting couples and their intersections resemble the concepts of reducts and core, respectively, in rough set theory (Pawlak, 1991).

Observe, thus that both for option (α) and for option (γ), once the set of couples of interacting criteria is fixed, the decision aiding process continues with a set of constraints where there are no more binary variables, while this is not the case for option (β), for which it is necessary to continue to take into account some binary variables. Thus for option (β), if the set of considered couples of interacting criteria is

Note that, when considering the Choquet integral, one can also identify a capacity compatible with a set of pairwise comparisons provided by the DM in result of solving an optimization problem (Grabisch, Kojadinovic, & Meyer, 2008; Marichal & Roubens, 2000; Mayag, Grabisch, & Labreuche, 2008), or even one can consider the whole set of capacities compatible with the DM’s preference information (Angilella et al., 2010). It should be observed, however that such capacity identification requires that all marginal value functions involved in the Choquet integral are known beforehand (in order to make all criteria scales commensurable). A methodology permitting to build the scales and a capacity for the Choquet integral has been proposed in Angilella et al. (2004), however, it is just a heuristic, not an exact algorithm. Remark that in our approach, the structure of interaction between criteria is identified together with the set of compatible value functions, taking into account the original performances of alternatives.

Let us conclude this section with an observation that it may be difficult for some DMs to select one of the minimal sets of couples of interacting criteria. In such a case, one could either select by default a minimal set of couples with the least number of couples, or decide to use one-by-one all minimal sets of couples for calculation of the corresponding possible and necessary preference relations, and then aggregate these results to the following conclusions inspired by considerations known from application of ROR in the context of group decisions (Greco, Kadziński, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2012):

Such preference relations answer to robustness concerns, since they are in general “more robust” than a preference relation corresponding to a single compatible value function

However, in real-world decision-making situations, a score is sometimes needed to assign to the different alternatives, and despite the interest of the preference relations provided, some users would like to see, and they indeed need to know, a “representative” value function among all the compatible ones. This allows assigning a score to each alternative.

Recently, a methodology to identify a “representative” value function in UTA

                         and GRIP, without loosing the advantage of taking into account all compatible value functions, has been proposed in Figueira et al. (2008) and Greco, Kadziński, and Słowiński (2011). The idea is to select among compatible value functions a value function which maximizes the differences

Notice that the concept of a “representative” value function thus defined is still based on the necessary and possible preference relations, which remain crucial for robust ordinal regression, and, in a sense, it gives the most faithful representation of this necessary and possible preference relations.

The dean of a school has to rank some students that are evaluated on Mathematics, Physics and Literature, as shown in Table 7
                     .

The dean gives the following preference information:

in case of Physics, score Good is preferred to score Medium more than score Medium is preferred to score Bad.

Remark that in the absence of any preference information, the necessary preference relation in the set of students corresponds to the dominance relation represented by continuous arrows in Fig. 1
                     . Moreover, in Fig. 1, the pairwise comparisons of students provided by the dean are represented by dashed arrows. Observe also that the above preference information concerns the set of reference students

In order to build a preference model as simple as possible, one has to check first if the given preference information can be represented by an additive value function and, in case this is not possible, one has to decide which option of preference representation with interactions, among (α), (β) and (γ), will be selected. For any option, one is also interested in finding the minimal sets of pairs of interacting criteria, as well as the sign of the corresponding interactions in case of option (β), permitting representation of dean’s preferences. In fact, these preferences cannot be represented by an additive value function, as can be easily verified observing that the preference of student

                      and we run again the same program, but this time the set of constraints is unfeasible. Thus, we stop the procedure, concluding that there are two alternative minimal sets of couples of interacting criteria, which are the following:
                        
                           •
                           the minimal set composed of the couple Mathematics and Physics,

the minimal set composed of the couple Mathematics and Literature.

These two possibilities are presented to the dean. He chooses the first minimal set of couples of interacting criteria, as the interaction between Mathematics and Physics fits best his intuition.

The Hasse diagram of the partial order corresponding to the necessary preference relation is graphically represented in Fig. 2
                      (for the sake of simplicity we omitted loops in each node). It includes the dominance relation and the preference statements of the dean (see Fig. 1). To make the possible preference relation ≿

In order to give a score to each student, we computed a representative value function according to the procedure described in Section 5.6. This representative value function is presented in Tables 10–12

the minimal set composed of the couple Mathematics and Literature interacting positively,

the minimal set composed of the couple Mathematics and Physics interacting negatively,

the minimal set composed of the couple Mathematics and Literature interacting negatively.

Considering the couple composed of Mathematics and Physics, both in case of positive interaction and in case of negative interaction, we get the same necessary and possible preference relations as for option (α). The representative value function assigns the same scores both in case Mathematics and Physics interact positively and negatively. These scores are different from those given by the representative value function for option (α), however the students are ranked in the same way.

Observe that the difference between option (β) and option (γ) is that under option (β) one can have couples of criteria for which there is a positive interaction and couples of criteria for which there is a negative interaction, while under option (γ) one can have positive interactions only or negative interactions only. Notice also that, as the considered decision problem have only three criteria, we can have only one couple of interacting criteria, because, on the contrary, we would have some criterion interacting with more than another one, and this would violate the assumption that each criterion can interact with at most one other criterion. Therefore, since the couple of interacting criteria can originate a bonus or a penalty, we have to conclude that option (β) and option (γ) are equivalent and, consequently, give the same minimal sets of couples of interacting criteria, the same necessary and possible preference relations and the same representative value functions in case the couple composed of Mathematics and Physics, both in case of positive interaction and in case of negative interaction, is selected.

We presented a robust ordinal regression method, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 UTA

                           -
                           INT
                        
                     , able to handle positive and negative interactions between criteria. The methodology is based on an additive value function preference model which includes “bonus” and “penalty” components corresponding to positively and negatively interacting pairs of criteria, respectively.

The 
                        
                           
                              
                                 UTA
                              
                              
                                 GMS
                              
                           
                           -

                      preference model compares favorably to the Choquet integral which is frequently used to handle interacting sets of criteria. It does not require all criteria to be defined on a common numerical scale, and its interpretation is more intuitive. Although in the present paper, we restrict to interactions concerning pairs of criteria (which is a reasonable hypothesis in practice), the 
                        
                           
                              
                                 UTA
                              
                              
                                 GMS
                              
                           
                           -
                           INT
                        
                      methodology can easily be extended to handle interaction between more than two criteria.

Moreover, the proposed methodology allows the DM to discover the pairs of interacting criteria and the compatible value functions from preference statements, whereas the existing literature supposes an a priori knowledge of either the interactions (e.g., Gonzales & Perny, 2005), or the marginal value functions (e.g., Grabisch et al., 2008). It should be emphasized that 
                        
                           
                              
                                 UTA
                              
                              
                                 GMS
                              
                           
                           -
                           INT
                        
                      uses interaction in a parsimonious way, i.e., computes a preference model involving a minimum number of interacting pairs of criteria. In particular, when the DM’s preference statements can be represented by a simple additive value function, then no interaction is considered.

Once the pairs of interacting criteria have been identified, a standard robust ordinal regression is performed to compute necessary and possible preference relations, as well as a representative value function. All this procedure is intended to be used iteratively, thus supporting the construction of a final recommendation.

In future work, it will be important to assess the practical usefulness of the methodology through experiments on some simulated data. For instance, an interesting issue would be to check the relation between the amount and quality of preference information provided by the DM and the need for representation of interaction.

The newly proposed preference model involving interactions can be used in a straightforward way in robust ordinal regression for sorting problems (Greco, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2010), group decision (Greco et al., 2012), extreme ranking analysis (Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012), and in case of hierarchical structure of the family of criteria (Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012). It has already been used in Angilella, Corrente, Greco, and Słowiński (2014) to successfully extend the multicriteria customer satisfaction method MUSA (Grigoroudis & Siskos, 2002). It is enriching the toolbox of multiple-criteria decision aiding methods for which the questions guiding the choice of the most appropriate methods proposed in Roy and Słowiński (2013) remain valid.

                      also for option (γ) with bonuses only, we must conclude that if ≿ can be represented for option (α), it can be also represented for option (β).
