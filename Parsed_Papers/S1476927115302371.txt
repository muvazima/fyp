                  The analysis of energy landscapes plays an important role in mathematical modelling, simulation and optimisation. Among the main features of interest are the number and distribution of local minima within the energy landscape. Granier and Kallel proposed in 2002 a new sampling procedure for estimating the number of local minima. In the present paper, we focus on improved heuristic implementations of the general framework devised by Granier and Kallel with regard to run-time behaviour and accuracy of predictions. The new heuristic method is demonstrated for the case of partial energy landscapes induced by RNA secondary structures. While the computation of minimum free energy RNA secondary structures has been studied for a long time, the analysis of folding landscapes has gained momentum over the past years in the context of co-transcriptional folding and deeper insights into cell processes. The new approach has been applied to ten RNA instances of length between 99nt and 504nt and their respective partial energy landscapes defined by secondary structures within an energy offset ΔE above the minimum free energy conformation. The number of local minima within the partial energy landscapes ranges from 1440 to 3441. Our heuristic method produces for the best approximations on average a deviation below 3.0% from the true number of local minima.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The present paper aims at a fast and sufficiently accurate method for the evaluation of data obtained from partial RNA energy landscapes in the context of the approximation of the number of local minima. The partial energy landscapes can be defined by an energy offset above the minimum free energy conformation or by a bounded distance in terms of elementary transition steps from a given conformation within the energy landscape. As a continuation of previous work presented in Sahoo and Albrecht (2012), we consider energy landscapes induced by RNA secondary structures and partial energy landscapes defined by energy offsets. The method can be used, e.g., in a pre-processing step before starting a comprehensive analysis (or complete generation) of local minima in partial energy landscapes for a priori information about the expected number of local minima. Here, we focus on the fast and reliable evaluation of data produced by steepest decent that starts out from samples of secondary structures, whereas for pre-processing steps, such as initial sample size selection and randomised generation of sample sets, we rely on existing tools for RNA secondary structure generation and free energy calculation (tailored methods for pre-processing steps are subject of current and future research).

As in Sahoo and Albrecht (2012), we utilise the framework presented by Garnier and Kallel (2002) for approximating the number of local minima in a fitness landscape (induced by an objective function, which is called fitness value): At the initial stage, M elements of the landscape are randomly selected. Each of the elements then ‘moves’ towards a local/global minimum S
                     
                        m
                      based upon steepest descent (being part of the attraction basin of S
                     
                        m
                     ). This way, local minima ‘collect’ instances originating from the M initial landscape elements, and the number of local minima having ‘collected’ exactly j of the M elements is denoted by β
                     
                        j
                     . The method proposed in Garnier and Kallel (2002) tries to utilise the information about the distribution of β
                     
                        j
                      for a prediction about the total number of local minima within the landscape. The authors associate with the normalised sizes of attraction basins the Gamma distribution, where an approximation of the crucial parameter γ of the density function can be obtained by using (a) a basic equation established in Garnier and Kallel (2002) for linking the Gamma distribution to expected values β
                     
                        j,γ
                      of sampling data β
                     
                        j
                      and (b) the χ
                     2-test with regard to β
                     
                        j,γ
                      and β
                     
                        j
                     . The method has been applied in Sahoo and Albrecht (2012) to the approximation of the number of local minima in partial RNA folding landscapes. The application employs a minimisation procedure for the χ
                     2-test over a square grid for two parameters (γ, r), where γ defines the density function and r is an auxiliary parameter that eventually leads to the required approximation. Since the χ
                     2-minimisation is running over a square grid, finding suitable (γ, r) is relatively time-consuming. Moreover, as demonstrated in Sahoo and Albrecht (2012), the quality of approximations is affected by the values of β
                     
                        j,γ
                      for large j (called tail values of β
                     
                        j,γ
                     , where j is close to the maximum j such that β
                     
                        j
                     
                     >0), together with large gaps between non-zero β
                     
                        j
                      for increasing j. The problem with tail values was observed and highlighted already in Garnier and Kallel (2002), see Section 5.3 therein. In the present paper, both problems, i.e., tail values and χ
                     2-minimisation, are addressed by a new heuristic that utilises a specific pooling procedure for tail values and substitutes the simultaneous χ
                     2-minimisation over a square grid by two linear χ
                     2-tests executed one after another and for γ-approximations only.

The new method is presented in the context of RNA folding landscapes, which is an important research area in Structural Biology. Research on RNA structure prediction has a long history, dating back to early work from around 1960 (Fresco et al., 1960) and further progress published in DeLisi and Crothers (1971) and Tinoco et al. (1971). Most of the computational methods related to RNA structure prediction centres around secondary structures, which are simplified models that admit a representation as outer-planar graphs, and the computation of minimum free energy conformations. The application of dynamic programming to secondary structure prediction, as presented in Nussinov et al. (1978) and Waterman and Smith (1978), eventually resulted – with various refinements and adjustments of energy functions – in the design of manageable polynomial time algorithms and powerful tools for folding simulations and associated program packages, such as Mfold by Zuker (1989), Zuker and Sankoff (1984) and RNAfold by Hofacker (2003) and Hofacker et al. (1994). In contrast, tertiary structure prediction, i.e., where RNA structures with so-called pseudoknots are included, has been shown to be NP-complete (Lyngsø and Pedersen, 2000). While, in the present paper, we also focus on secondary structures, we are not only interested in minimum free energy (MFE) conformations, but also in meta-stable structures above MFE conformations. Meta-stable structures have become the subject of recent research due to new insights into co-transcriptional folding and interactions between different types of RNA sequences.

The problem of calculating meta-stable RNA secondary structures (local minima) is considered, for example, in Flamm et al. (2002), Lorenz and Clote (2011) and Saffarian et al. (2012). The RNAsubopt tool by Wuchty et al. (1999) together with the barriers program (Flamm et al., 2002) allows the user, in principle, to identify all meta-stable conformations within an energy range ΔE above the MFE conformation. However, due to the rapid increase of conformations with increasing ΔE, the approach is only applicable to short sequences or small values of ΔE.


                     Lorenz and Clote (2011) describe the extension of computing the partition function over the set of locally optimal structures in RNA energy landscapes to the RNAlocopt tool that computes the exact, total number of locally optimal structures and the exact partition function for locally optimal structures, along with the capability of identifying the set of local minima. The underlying energy model is the Turner nearest neighbour model (Xia et al., 1998) without dangles. The algorithm is an extension of McCaskill's algorithm (McCaskill, 1990), where locally optimal structures are accounted for by additional terms in the recursion scheme. Based upon dynamic programming, RNAlocopt computes the total number of locally optimal structures in O(n
                     3) time, and the associated sampling of secondary structures takes O(n
                     2) time, which is comparable to other tools. We note that in the present paper, we target partial RNA landscapes, i.e., the information about the total number of locally optimal structures for a given RNA sequence is not directly applicable. RNAlocopt has been recently modified to support Turner 2004 energy parameters. A detailed and sophisticated combinatorial analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the number of saturated RNA secondary structures and locally optimal RNA secondary structures is carried out in Clote (2006) and Fusy and Clote (2014) for a variety of energy models and structural constraints.


                     Saffarian et al. (2012) present an algorithm for generating all locally optimal secondary structures assembled from a set of thermodynamically stable helices. The construction of locally optimal structures is divided into two steps: First juxtaposed base pair are processed, followed by nested (within juxtaposed positions) base pairs. The main step of the construction follows a recurrent relation which reminds of dynamic programming, although an estimation of worst case or expected run-time is not provided. Each element of the intermediate set of secondary structures is then further processed in order to generate locally optimal structures. The procedure is extended to the generation of locally optimal secondary structures from a given set of thermodynamically stable helices and computational experiments for six sequences of length up to 405nt are presented.


                     Kucharík et al. (2014) introduce basin hopping graphs as a new connectivity model of attraction basins within energy landscapes. Vertices represent local minima and edges connect vertices if the transition between the corresponding basins is energetically optimal in terms of the associated saddle point height. The authors present the two new tools RNAlocmin and BHGbuilder as basic implements for the approximation of basin hopping graphs. The tool RNAlocmin executes a modified Boltzmann sampling in order to generate sets of local minima. The modification of Boltzmann sampling tries to avoid oversampling of structures close to MFE conformation by using a parameterised thermodynamic temperature in Boltzmann weights. The BHGbuilder tool establishes the basin hopping graph by using a heuristic path-finding algorithm between the local minima identified by RNAlocmin. The authors present various comparisons to RNAlocopt from Lorenz and Clote (2011) regarding the coverage of local minima within a given time frame, which turn out to be in favour of RNAlocmin, partly with large differences in the number of detected local minima. However, one could argue that raising the temperature when running RNAlocopt could have increased the number of distinct locally optimal structures, which could affect the comparison to RNAlocmin. Kucharík et al. (2014) estimate the applicability of the overall approach to a range of RNA sequence lengths bounded by about 300nt.

In the present paper, we aim at improved approximations of the number ν of local minima in partial RNA folding spaces. The approximation of ν can then be used for evaluating the outcome of procedures searching for local minima as presented in Kucharík et al. (2014). A priori knowledge about approximations of ν provides information about the distance of the current number of identified local minima to the true number of meta-stable conformations. In the present application, the number of instances as well as energy parameters of partial landscapes above minimum free energy conformations are chosen in such a way that a comparison to data generated by RNAsubopt and barriers is computationally feasible. RNAsubopt and barriers are used to calculate all secondary structures and the true set of local minima, respectively, within the partial energy landscapes. The time complexity of our heuristic method can be estimated by

                      is the energy evaluation complexity (update of energy values when samples are ‘moving’ within the partial landscape), and D is the maximum number of steps executed in steepest descent (determined by the maximum energy difference between initial sample structures and their corresponding ‘target’ local minima). Our computational experiments suggest

                      with a relatively small constant factor, which implies a run-time estimation of

                     . Since we are using RNAlocmin (Kucharík et al., 2014) with energy updates in neighbourhood transitions, we can assume 
                        
                           E

                     =30,000). The implementation of the evaluation of data about the number of local minima detected by descent procedure applied to initial samples of secondary structures, along with examples of such energy landscape data, are available at http://kks.inf.kcl.ac.uk/projects/RNAapprox.php.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

Firstly, we introduce the concept of energy landscapes in the context of folded RNA structures, including information about the sequences and data we are using in our computational experiments. Secondly, we explain the mathematical background of the stochastic method devised by Garnier and Kallel (2002) for approximations of the number of local minima in fitness landscapes. Finally, we present the new method we propose for processing the data generated by the Garnier–Kallel algorithm.

Our new approximation methods is demonstrated for the case of meta-stable conformations (local minima) of RNA secondary structures, and we briefly introduce RNA sequences along with the main features of RNA foldings.

RNA macromolecules are the result of transcription from DNA helices, with the main, defining DNA components being the four nucleotides adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). During the transcription, thymine is substituted by uracil (U). Thus, an RNA macromolecule is defined by its sequence of nucleotides A, C, G, and U. The number of nucleotides defines the length n of the RNA sequence. Within the sequence, nucleotides are ‘held together’ by so-called backbone bonds. Out of the 4×3/2=6 possible nucleotide pairs, 2+1=3 pairs can establish hydrogen bonds, with energetically strong bonds for A–U and C–G (Watson–Crick pairs), and weaker bonding for G–U. Hydrogen bonds are the result of the electromagnetic attractive interaction of a hydrogen atom and an electronegative atom, such as nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine. Hydrogen bonds induce the folding process, which favours foldings with minimum negative free energy (indicating the amount of positive energy – e.g., heat – that needs to be applied for breaking up the hydrogen bonds).

RNA sequences can encode the information about proteins (messenger RNA, mRNA, or protein-coding RNA), or can execute control functions, like microRNA of length ∼22 nucleotides (non-coding RNA, ncRNA). Protein-coding RNA typically consists of a prefix called 5′UTR (untranslated region), followed by the actual protein encoding, and a suffix, called 3′UTR. The 3′UTRs play an important role in interactions between mRNA and microRNA (Lewis et al., 2003), which is why we focus on foldings of 3′UTRs; see also Fig. 1
                            below and Section 2.1.3.

In formal terms, the folded structure of an RNA sequence of length n is a node-labelled, undirected graph G
                           =(V, E), where V
                           ={1, …, n}, E

In particular, we utilise data generated by RNAsubopt (version 2.0.7) (Wuchty et al., 1999), the barriers implementation (version 1.5.2) (Flamm et al., 2002), and RNAeval (Hofacker et al., 1994).

Deletion of one or two base pairs: a single base pair is deleted as part of a helix, if at least two adjoined base pairs remain; otherwise, two base pairs are deleted.

                            is included and allows us to achieve a match between the set of local minima returned by barriers and the steepest descent procedure described below.

The neighbourhood operations do not include the shift move as defined in Flamm et al. (2000) and accounted for in Sahoo and Albrecht (2012). The reason lies in the newer version of RNAsubopt (2.x), and the analysis of the barriers source code reveals that the shift move is not part of the implementation for secondary structures where isolated base pairs are not admitted. This also results in different values of the number of local minima for the sequences considered in Sahoo and Albrecht (2012).

Exploring the neighbourhood of a secondary structure has been considered before, see RNAbor (Clote et al., 2012) and earlier versions of the tool. However, for consistency with RNAsubopt and barriers, we employ RNAlocmin (Kucharík et al., 2014) for executing steepest descent.

The single-step transitions (1) and (2) are utilised in a steepest descent algorithm that is executed within L(R). The steepest descent algorithm can be described as follows:

Out of the sequences studied in Sahoo and Albrecht (2012), we selected five longer sequences for the application-specific fine-tuning of the new heuristic method for evaluating the β
                           
                              j
                            data. Additionally, four sequences from Day et al. (2014) plus one sequence of length 504nt were selected for independently testing the approach. The selection of sequences is governed by the need of having verifiable data about the set of conformations in partial landscapes, including information about the number and structure of local/global minima. For each sequence, the set of conformations is generated by the RNAsubopt program (version 2.0.7) (Wuchty et al., 1999), and the number and structure of local/global minima is provided by the barriers implementation (version 1.5.2) (Gruber et al., 2008). For an offset ΔE above the minimum free energy conformation (global minimum), RNAsubopt produces a set of conformations that exponentially increases depending on ΔE. In order to be able to execute a large number of computational experiments on each of the sequences, we selected as partial landscapes the subset of conformations within the ΔE range above the minimum free energy conformation. The selection allows us to study sequences of length up to about ℓ = 500nt for a wide range of sample sets M
                           ={S
                           1, S
                           2, …, S
                           
                              M
                           }.

The ten sequences represent 3′UTRs of human RNAs, where the information about the sequences is drawn from the NCBI Nucleotides database and the Ensembl database. More details about the sequences are given in Table 1
                           . The Transcript IDs are from the Ensembl database.

The selection of sequences is partly based on the results of microRNA target predictions, with the main aim of collecting sequences of a certain length. For example, TargetScan (version 6.2) (Lewis et al., 2003) predicts NM_031420.2 as a conserved target of hsa-miR-21 and hsa-miR-590-5p, which is also supported by MicroCosm (miRanda) (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2008). NM_170726.2 is predicted as a conserved target of hsa-miR-184, and the same miRNA is also predicted by MicroCosm. Among the five test sequences, the 3′UTRs No. 7–10 (R7–R10) are all related to microRNA target prediction in the context of single nucleotide polymorphisms (Day et al., 2014). Sequence R6 (NM_001651.3) is predicted to be a target of hsa-miR-96.

Furthermore, we tried to design a set of sequences with varying ratios of the size of the subspace vs the number of local minima within this subspace, including sequences with ‘rugged’ partial landscapes close to the minimum free energy conformation.

In the following, we omit the version number in references to the particular sequences. Table 2
                            displays information about the subsets C
                           ΔE
                           
                           ⊂
                           C(R) (partial energy landscapes) associated with each of the sequences R from Table 1 and the energy range ΔE above the minimum free energy conformation. Since we are using the updated versions of RNAsubopt and barriers (no shift operation in neighbourhood transitions), the data reported in Table 2 for the first five sequences differ from the corresponding values presented in Sahoo and Albrecht (2012).

The sequences exhibit varying values of the ratio ru(ΔE, R)=|C
                           ΔE
                           |/ν, which can be seen as a simplified measure for the ‘ruggedness’ of energy landscapes. In the strong sense, rugged energy landscapes (e.g., in protein folding simulations) are associated with many local minima and high energy barriers separating local minima, cf. Lois et al. (2010). However, in the present paper we are dealing with steepest descent within partial energy landscapes (and not with overcoming high energy barriers), and therefore we think that using ru(ΔE, R) as a measure for ‘ruggedness’ is justified, since the value of ru(ΔE, R) affects the relation between the size of M and lm(M). The smallest value of ru(ΔE, R) (i.e., highest degree of ‘ruggedness’) is produced by NM_002127 (see Table 2). We point out that for sequences No. 1–5 the values of ru(ΔE, R) can be ordered in such a way that the successor is about twice the value of its predecessor, with the maximum value for sequence No. 1. The selection of ΔE results in a much larger range of ν values compared to the ones from Sahoo and Albrecht (2012), where for comparable lengths of sequences a compromise was sought between similar ν values but varying ratios of ru(ΔE, R) values. For sequences No. 6–10, the maximum value of |C
                           ΔE
                           | is about twice the value of the minimum |C
                           ΔE
                           |.

It is important to note that we achieved better approximation results when the secondary structures of a sample set M of size M were drawn from the top energy range of the given subspace C
                           ΔE
                            of conformations (RNAsubopt returns an enumerated list ordered by the free energy, which allows for a random selection of positions above a given free energy value; see also details provided in Section 4). Depending upon the relation between the size |C
                           ΔE
                           | and M, the elements S of M were randomly selected from the top third or top quarter of C
                           ΔE
                            with respect to E(S), if |C
                           ΔE
                           |≫3M.

In this section, we follow the description of the stochastic approximation procedure devised by Garnier and Kallel as presented in Garnier and Kallel (2002) (specifically, in Section 5). Here, we consider the approximation problem called ‘inverse problem’ by the authors, whereas the ‘direct problem’ relates to the probability that for a given sample size M each attraction basin consists at least one conformation from the sample set.

                        . Therefore, different local minima might be located within the same attraction basin. Merging such local minima into a meta-conformation and re-calculating the results of steepest could resolve the problem, but we noticed that the approximation results are affected only marginally. Consequently, local minima from the same attraction basin are counted separately.

                        a from values ν of about 34% over all eleven sequences considered in Sahoo and Albrecht (2012). Furthermore, for all eleven instances the best approximations were obtained for values of γ

                        0 is assumed to be known and r is identified from the equation. In our heuristic, we search within a given r-range for a value of r that minimises the absolute value of the difference between the LHS and RHS of (13).

The new method is generic and resulted in a much lower average deviation from values ν. The method was devised on a subset of five sequences considered in Sahoo and Albrecht (2012) and then tested on five sequences related to miRNA target prediction that were partly analysed in Day et al. (2014).

                                  tail values: In our approach, we apply the χ
                                 2-test from (11) to β
                                 
                                    j,γ
                                  values defined in (6) and (7). Properties, applications and limitations of the χ
                                 2-test have been discussed for a long time, see Hawkins (2009). Among the features often highlighted as limiting the applicability are small expected values (in our case, β
                                 
                                    j,γ
                                 ). Frequent recommendations expressed in the literature of how to deal with small expected values mainly comprise of two rules: (a) a lower bound β
                                 
                                    j,γ
                                 
                                 ≥
                                 h
                                 =5, i.e., the summation in (11) includes only positions j that meet the condition; (b) combining β
                                 
                                    j,γ
                                 
                                 <
                                 h in successive positions into a single position until the sum is equal to or exceeds the lower bound h, which is often called ‘pooling.’

In the present application, the expected values β
                                 
                                    j,γ
                                  relate to the number |B
                                 
                                    j
                                 | of local minima such that for j sample structures steepest descent terminates in an individual local minimum from B
                                 
                                    j
                                 . The case of single local minima attracting a large number of sample structures can be frequently observed in partial energy landscapes induced by RNA secondary structures, i.e., in other terms, β
                                 
                                    j,γ
                                 
                                 ≈1 is a legitimate setting for large j. Therefore, we selected h
                                 =1 instead of h
                                 =5. The selection is supported by computational experiments on sequences from Table 2, with better approximations for h
                                 =1.

We apply pooling with respect to h
                                 =1, where we do not introduce new notations for the modified β
                                 
                                    j
                                  and β

                                 . It is important to note that the β
                                 
                                    j,γ

Thus, from the five instances used for the design of the method, 8+2=10 subcases were identified by running each of the instances for about six different values of M.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The core data presented are from 33 runs defined by different values of M and the partial energy landscapes as displayed in Table 2 for each of the sequences. For a given sequence, each run takes as input the value of M, the set of data β
                     
                        j
                     , j = 1,…, M, and – for comparison purposes – the value of ν. The step sizes δ
                     
                        γ
                      and δ

                      indeed can be taken as the initial sample size, we found that rounding up to the next order of magnitude can speed up the approximation procedure. For example, for NM_170726 (ALDH4A1) we have

                     1
                     =1500 for the first approximation. For M

                     The value of gainfrac can be utilised for the decision about the termination of subsequent increases of values of M, as discussed in the next section.


                     Table 3
                      shows the results for three different values of M for each of the sequences and parameter settings as given in Table 2. By Δa we denote the percentage of the deviation of ν
                     a from ν (percentage relative to ν; the notation is in line with Eq. (18)). Accordingly, Δsel is equal to Δa for the sample size M selected for the analysis of best approximations.

For HLA-G (ℓ=386) we executed a very long run with M
                     =30,000 over a partial landscape with the higher value of ΔE
                     =2.4kcal/mol (in Table 2, we have ΔE
                     =1.6kcal/mol). The number of local minima returned by barriers is 22,662, hence M/ν
                     =1.32. The critical procedures (A)–(D) proved to be numerically stable. For the ratio M/ν
                     =1.32, the results were in the region of expected values, with Δa
                     =8.48% and a run-time of the β
                     
                        j

                     lm-r =
                     M
                     −lm(M). Since lm(M)≤
                     ν, we observe for the same sequence but increasing M changing selection cases out of the 10 (sub-)cases. For example, 
                        
                           M
                           
                              lm

                              lm
                              -

                           ′
                           ′

                              M

                                 ′

                     . This may lead to an intermediate increase of Δa, as, for example, for sequences No. 6 and No. 8.

Regarding the termination of subsequent increases of M for a particular RNA sequence (partial folding landscape), we distinguish between three cases:

We recall that the M samples are randomly selected from the top energy range of C
                     ΔE
                      in order to capture many local minima. If the M samples are drawn from the entire set C
                     ΔE
                     , the number of observed local minima lm(M) can be significantly smaller. For example, for sequence No. 1 (MRPL9; largest value of ru(ΔE, R), see Table 2), we have for a run with M
                     =6000 and random selection over the entire range only 683 local minima vs 826 recorded in Table 3 (21% more); for sequence No. 4 (PAX7; second largest value of ru(ΔE, R)) and M
                     =6000, the corresponding values are 946 vs 1020 (8% more); for sequence No. 3 (GMEB1; smallest value of ru(ΔE, R)) and M
                     =3500, the corresponding values are 1175 vs 1375 (17% more). This affects also the quality of approximations: MRPL9: 28.8% deviation vs 14.7% (Table 3); PAX7: 18.9% vs 13.8%; GMEB1: 22.9% vs 5.0%.

As mentioned already at the beginning of the section, the random selection of M samples may have an impact on the quality of approximations even for increasing values of M (although, only marginally; see in Table 3 sequences No. 5 and No. 8). Similarly, there are slight variations in the quality of approximations for fixed values of M, which can be seen already from the distribution of β
                     
                        j
                      values. For example, for ALDH4A1 and three random selections of M
                     =3000 initial secondary structures (one related to entry in Table 3), the distributions of β
                     1, …, β
                     10 are shown in Table 4
                     . The larger number of observed local minima slightly affects the quality of the approximation, and the random selection for three of the sample sets causes a much larger β
                     1 value and a smaller β
                     2, i.e., more local minima are detected by a single initial secondary structure, whereas for the first example more local minima are ‘visited’ by two initial secondary structures.

We observed that the number of transitions within attractions basins towards local minima is relatively small. For example, for sequence No. 1 (MRPL9) and the run from Table 3 with M
                     =6000, the total number of descent steps is 18,705, which means on average 3.12 transitions, and the percentage of secondary structures visited is 14.74% in relation to |C
                     ΔE
                     |. For sequence No. 4 (PAX7) with M
                     =6000 the total number is 19,724, which means on average 3.29 steps, and the percentage of visited secondary structures is 23.28%. For sequence No. 3 (GMEB1) with M
                     =3500 the values are 5143 transitions, 1.47 on average, and 41.54% of secondary structures visited. Of course, as explained in Section 2.1.3, the parameters for GMEB1 were chosen in such a way that the partial landscape has the lowest value of |C
                     ΔE
                     |/ν and about half the ratio of sequence No. 2, which explains the relatively high percentage of 41.54%.

For each individual S
                     ∈
                     M of length n, the time for executing a single step of steepest descent can be roughly upper bounded by 
                        O

                     , where 
                        O

                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                      covers the number of potential neighbourhood transitions and E
                     
                        n
                      is the time required for free energy calculations for each individual transition. Since we are using RNAlocmin for the steepest descent procedure, where the energy is updated only for base pair bindings affected by the transition, we can assume 
                        
                           E
                           n
                        
                        =
                        
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                     . Furthermore, let D denote the maximum length of a steepest descent pathway from elements of M within their respective attraction basin to the corresponding meta-stable conformation. For example, if all secondary structures from the sample set M are at most 10kcal/mol above the minimum free energy conformation, and if the free energy of secondary structures is calculated with a precision of 0.1kcal/mol (standard setting in RNAsubopt), then the value of D does not exceed 100. Therefore, the number of steps required for finding all meta-stable conformations associated with all S
                     ∈
                     M is bounded by 
                        O

If the secondary structures are encoded as natural numbers of length n (“·” → 0; “(” → 1; “)” → 2), one can apply a standard sorting algorithm that returns a sorted list L′ where identical secondary structures appear as consecutive elements of the sorted list.

                      of each comparison. From L′ one can then identify the values of individual β
                     
                        j
                     . The procedure also provides the information about j

In terms of real processing times, the generation of the information about ν is in the region of a few minutes (first RNAsubopt, then barriers) for the folding landscape data from Table 2. The steepest descent by using RNAlocmin and the generation of the β

However, for a genuine run-time comparison with RNAsubopt and barriers it would be necessary to implement modified versions, where only the information is generated that is used in our approximation method (RNAsubopt creates energy-ordered lists of secondary structures; barriers calculates connectivity information and rates between local minima). For the attempt we made to reduce the run-time of RNAsubopt by producing only secondary structure information essential for calculating a set of local minima without using barriers,

                        We are grateful to one anonymous referee for very specific suggestions about how to modify the subopt.c code for this purpose.
                      we observed noticeable differences in the sets of local minima calculated by the modified subopt.c code and by the original RNAsubopt version plus barriers (as presented, e.g., in Table 3). For example, only for MRPL9 (ℓ=407) the set of local minima is identical to the ν
                     =1870 local minima produced by RNAsubopt plus barriers. In percentages of the sets of local minima returned by RNAsubopt and barriers, the difference in local minima ranges from 0.9% (CBR1; ℓ=284) up to 12.5% (PAX7; ℓ=99), with a single extreme case of ALDH4A1 (ℓ=400) where only 503 local minima are identified by the modified code, whereas ν
                     =2020 in Table 3. Leaving out ALDH4A1 and MRPL9, the average percentage regarding the differences in local minima is about 3.6%. For the run-time comparison between the ‘descent+approximation’ run-time (T
                     da; which, of course, only approximates the number of local minima) and the ‘modified RNAsubopt’ (T
                     uns), we selected the M values indicated by the last column of Table 3. The run-times are all in the range of a few seconds. In terms of percentages of T
                     uns, the corresponding T
                     da values (percentages) are within the region of 80.9% (highest, for LIG3; ℓ=124) and 7.8% (MRPL9; ℓ=407), with higher percentages for the shortest sequences. The average value of T
                     da in terms of percentages of T
                     uns is 52%.

Since the total run-times T
                     uns range only between 0.646 sec (OXT; ℓ=99; 7% difference to barriers output; T
                     da time is 67.8%) and 13.608 sec (MRPL9; ℓ=407; 0% difference to barriers output;, T
                     da time is 7.8%), we were looking at much lager search spaces for the ten sequences from Table 3 (larger values of ΔE) and much larger values of M for the selection of secondary structure samples as initial points of the descent procedure (M ranging from 1×106 up to 2.5×106; the average deviation in the number of local minmia calculated by the approximations from the barriers output is 6.5%). We observed similar differences of the ‘modified RNAsubopt’ output to barriers, with 0.4% lowest (AQP5; ℓ=504) and 33% highest(ALDH4A1; ℓ=400) and an average value of 6%. The total run-time T
                     uns ranges between 2.88 min (PAX7; ℓ=99) and 19.65 min (AQP5; ℓ=504). While ‘modified RNAsubopt’ is up to 52% faster on the shortest sequences, the lowest percentages of T
                     da are 14.5% and 19.23% (for MRPL9 and AQP5, respectively). The average value of T
                     da in terms of percentages of T
                     uns is 53.9%. Taking out the two sequences of length 99, the average value is 34.5%. The data support the impression that the more the ‘modified RNAsubopt’ output complies with the RNAsubopt plus barriers output, the lower (in terms of magnitude) is the run-time T
                     da when compared to T
                     uns. Finding a modified version of RNAsubopt that produces an output identical to RNAsubopt+barriers in a reliable and fast way will require a detailed analysis of the neighbourhood transitions and energy checks executed in the subopt.c code.

With the proposed sampling method we are aiming at reduced computational costs and improved accuracy of approximating the number of meta-stable conformations in partial energy landscapes. On the ten sequences we analysed, the new pooling procedure along with the separation of γ
                     a and r
                     a calculations resulted in an average deviation of about 3% from the true number of local minima. The approximation procedure is applicable in a scenario where no a priori knowledge about the number of local minima is available, as discussed, for example, in Kucharík et al. (2014). We plan to incorporate the approach into procedures designed for the analysis of microRNA bindings to meta-stable 3′UTR conformations, which continues our work presented in Day et al. (2014), see also Ragan et al. (2011) and references therein. In particular, we are interested in the impact of SNPs located in miRNA–3′UTR binding regions on miRNA bindings to meta-stable structures. Such an analysis requires knowledge about the accessibility of binding regions in secondary structures representing relatively deep local minima, which applies to wild-type as well as to mutated sequences. We found that due to the vast amount of secondary structures located relatively close to MFE conformations, the application of RNAsubopt, barriers and similar tools is limited to sequences of length up to about 1000nt on standard computing facilities. As a first step, we plan to investigate the stability of procedures (A)–(E) on large M-instances along with gradually increasing the length of RNA sequences under consideration. Although RNAlocmin is relatively fast, we plan to investigate the suitability of β

                      data produced by random descent strategies. Furthermore, we plan to devise independent and simplified methods for pre-processing steps, such as estimating the initial value of M and the random selection of the initial sample set from the upper free energy range of the partial energy landscape under consideration.
