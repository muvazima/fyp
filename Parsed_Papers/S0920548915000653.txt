                  The number of applications for RFID systems is growing rapidly. Due to the conflict between large-scale use of RFID technology and inadequate security-related research, this paper proposes secure mechanisms based on tripartite credibility consisting of an enhanced security mechanism of LLRP and a tag participation third-party authentication mechanism. This paper first introduces relevant information about RFID systems and then details design and implementation of the proposed secure mechanisms. Finally, this paper evaluates the performance of the proposed mechanisms in terms of storage complexity, communication cost and computational cost and analyzes the security advantages compared to those of previous research.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a non-contact automatic identification technology that identifies targets to obtain relevant data using radio frequency signals without manual intervention in a variety of harsh environments [1]. Compared with other means of identification, RFID can identify multiple targets, moving targets and long-range targets. It has the advantages of robustness against moisture, dust and smoke. Currently, with the development of modern electronic technology, the emergence of low-power miniaturized chips promotes the rapid development of RFID applications [2]. RFID technology is now involved in all aspects of daily life, being widely used in various fields including production, manufacturing, retail, logistics, transportation, medical, inventory control and asset management to improve management efficiency [3].

In general, an RFID system consists of the tag, the reader, and the client. The tag, which is placed on the target, has a certain storage and computation capacity. As the tag stores the identity and special information of targets, it is the real data carrier in the RFID system. The reader exchanges data with the tag using a radio frequency signal. The essential function of the reader is to provide a means for data transmission with the tag. In addition, it offers some fairly complex functions, including signal state control, parity error checking and correction [4]. The client is simply accepted as a database system that is mainly used for storage, information processing and management of the RFID system. Generally, the client replies to queries from the reader through wired or wireless channel transmission.

EPCglobal is an RFID standard research institution jointly organized by UCC and EAN, and it has excellent speed, depth and breadth in setting global RFID standards [5]. Since its earliest days, EPCglobal has been committed to establishing a set of neutral, open and transparent global standards. EPCglobals goal is to solve the transparency and traceability of the supply chain [6]. Transparency and traceability mean that in the supply chain, all partners can understand the information on each individual item, including location, production date and so on. Low Level Reader Protocol (LLRP) is a protocol interface standard recently set by EPCglobal as the communication standard between RFID readers and clients [7].

LLRP is called low-level because it provides control of RFID air protocol operation timing and access to air protocol command parameters [8]. LLRP provides the formats and procedures of communication between a Client and a Reader, whose minimum unit is called messages [9]. Clients send messages including requests for capability discovery, device configuration, access operations, and inventory management to readers. Similarly, readers send messages such as the results of RF surveys, acknowledgements, access and inventory operation results to clients [10]. There is no mechanism for retransmission or re-request because LLRP is an application layer protocol. Consequently, maintaining the consistency of the readers status recorded by clients and real status is a prerequisite for the system to work properly.

As RFID technology is applied in more fields, the expectations for RFIDs development become higher [11]. RFID technology is currently in a rapidly rising period, and the technology is widely recognized to be one of the most promising application technologies of this century. Furthermore, a number of countries attach importance to RFID technology, hoping to develop it into a significant industry [12]. It is worth mentioning that Cisco predicts the global manufacturing sector will have 13.5 billion assets to apply to Internet of Things applications by 2022. The development of RFID technology has been in progress for more than 50 years, and the variety of RFID products will become increasingly diverse with advancing technology [13]. Therefore, the development of RFID technology will lead to new progress in a variety of areas such as the tag, the reader, application systems integration, middleware platform, and standardization.

Because the designers did not consider the security issues of RFID systems at the beginning, phenomena such as malicious tag damage, smart card copying, and mobile payment terminal impersonation appear frequently [14]. In particular, the leakage of military information and commercial secrets from RFID systems may cause serious consequences. RFID system security issues must be addressed urgently because security has become the bottleneck restricting the development of RFID technology [15]. The data exchange between the reader and the tag is carried over insecure wireless channels. Accordingly, attackers can easily intercept data exchange information to counterfeit the identity of communicating parties. There are also some security threats in LLRP, which is used between the reader and the client. For instance, the lack of sender authentication may cause security threats, and version negotiation error leads to interaction failure. This article improves the RFID security mechanism to address some of these security issues [16].

@&#RELATED WORKS@&#

Due to the common uses of RFID, security and privacy can have a significant impact on the development of RFID systems. Thus, as a part of the RFID system, enhancing the security mechanism of LLRP is very important. In the past few years, some researchers have done excellent work on the applications of LLRP, but few have paid attention to security.

The first work on LLRP was a class library for the LLRP specification. It was developed by Joe Hoag from the University of Arkansas. The library, which is written in Java, can conveniently encode/decode LLRP messages to/from their corresponding binary representation. Later, a LLRP Reader Agent [17] was developed with the help of this library. This agent has the popular characteristic of being able to communicate with any LLRP Reader. Therefore, it is integrated into an agent-based RFID middleware application called TagCentric.

Beginning with Sana Qadir and Mohammad Umar Siddiqi, researchers have turned their attention to the security requirements of LLRP. Reference [18] summarizes the existing work that has been done on LLRP. It also assesses the security vulnerabilities of LLRP and discusses possible security solutions. Then, it presents the TLS-LLRP endpoints that use TLS to establish a secure LLRP connection, details the metrics selected to indicate performance and outlines the experimental procedures accordingly.

Reference [19] acknowledges that there is no significant fault-tolerant mechanism that considers the protocols behavior, and it proposes an approach that monitors RFID failures resulting from misconfiguration errors of the LLRP protocol using the logging system of this protocol. The authors have identified all RFID failures to consider and found their associated causes in LLRP misconfigurations. The causes are recorded in a knowledge model. A log file analyzer uses this knowledge model to address the detected failure.

In the exploratory research of reference [20], various protocols for authentication and cryptography in low-cost RFID are investigated and qualitatively compared in terms of output and results.

Hash lock is commonly employed by several protocols to improve the security and privacy of RFID authentication. Reference [21] is a survey that closely examines those protocols in terms of their focus and limitations. The hash-lock method is used in various ways in these RFID authentication protocols to address the security and privacy problems of RFID technology.

In reference [22], after highlighting goals and problems, an approach called Triggered Hash Chains is proposed to address the problems. The approach combines the concepts of two very different, widely known RFID protocols, i.e., the Hash-based ID variation approach and the Hash chain approach. The resulting proposal joins the advantages of both protocols. The approach is evaluated using a variety of practically relevant criteria.

Based on all of the above research, this paper proposes secure mechanisms based on tripartite credibility for RFID systems that combine an enhanced secure mechanism for LLRP with a tag participation third-party authentication mechanism, analyzing the advantages of the new approach compared to previous work.

The specifications already include security features or have recommended the ideal security practice [23] as EPCglobal is intended to provide its users the services of security and privacy. However, any supply chain management system built using current RFID components is vulnerable to certain security threats because manufacturers simply do not adopt any of the recommended security features.

Most RFID systems do not apply any security mechanisms, and messages are transmitted without being checked or encrypted [24]. The main reason for this lack of security is that such features are considered to be possible to ignore or add in the future as they can severely degrade system performance [25].

In view of this special circumstance, reference [26] indicates the most serious threats in an intra-enterprise scenario where RFID operates to be the following: tag sniffing, malicious or compromised Readers, spoofing, eavesdropping, replay and man-in-the-middle attacks on the communication channel between Reader and Client or between Reader and Tag.

Due to the features of LLRP [27], there are still threats such as interactive failure resulting from wrong version negotiation and protocol shutdown resulting from a malicious Reader [28].

Based on the security features above, the following security services should be implemented in LLRP:
                        
                           •
                           Reader-Client mutual authentication and authorization;

Lightweight data encryption;

Integrity verification and privacy protection of messages;

Increasing the tolerance of failure in the negotiation process caused by parameter errors, to enhance protocol robustness.

The notations in Table 1
                      are used in this paper to describe the security mechanisms.

Notably, in following the discussion of an enhanced secure mechanism for LLRP, notation A is used to represent the Reader identifier instead of IDA
                      to simplify the representation. However, in the tag participation third-party authentication mechanism, notation IDA
                      is used to represent the Reader identifier to distinguish it from the ID of the Tag.

In addition, because various security keys can be derived from the same initial key, for example, K
                     0 for authentication is generated by f(K, 0) and K
                     1 for encryption is generated by f(K, 1), this paper simply says that message M is authenticated or encrypted by K instead being more specific.

The security mechanism design and analysis of this paper is founded on a basic assumption about RFID system channels. In addition, this paper also assumes that the basic password structure of these protocols, such as the pseudo-random generator function, the encryption mechanism, and the MAC mechanisms, are secure.

According to the above analysis, enhanced LLRP, as an important part of the proposed secure mechanisms, adopts the following methods to implement security enhancements:
                        
                           •
                           Before deploying readers to the network, security information is preset, including the preset key K, Reader ID, key generation function f, MAC algorithm and encryption function E.

A trusted authority is adopted to connect to clients and distribute security information to new joined clients, including the key generation function f, preset key K, MAC algorithm and encryption function E.

An efficient encryption algorithm is chosen to encrypt the LLRP messages, and additional MAC messages are adopted for integrity protection.

Before establishing a formal connection, security is achieved by means of an exchange of secure information and handshake authentication.

When a Reader asks to close the protocol connection, it is verified whether it is a malicious Reader using a re-authentication mechanism.

The proposed enhanced secure LLRP is based on the standard protocol and involves no modification to the detailed communication process of LLRP v1.1 except for adding an authentication mechanism before the connection is formally established and when an LLRP connection is going to be disconnected. Furthermore, a MAC algorithm and encryption function are adopted to achieve message integrity and data confidentiality protection. Fig. 1
                      shows the secured interaction actions:

As the number of deployed Readers in the RFID systems may be huge and not fixed and as each of them shares a unique individual key with the Client, it is unrealistic to store all these keys. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a strategy to reduce the storage cost and provide high flexibility. This paper adopts the key generation function f to achieve the above goals.

First, each Reader stores the key establishment function f, initial key K and symmetric encryption algorithm E, which are also possessed by the Client. This information is preloaded in the Readers before the deployment phase.

It should also be noted that the above preloaded information of the Readers is possessed securely by the Client because it is securely distributed from CA. For Reader A, the generation of its individual key is as follows (here, A indicates the unique ID of Reader A):
                           
                              
                                 
                                    K
                                    A
                                 
                                 =
                                 f
                                 
                                    K
                                    A
                                 
                              
                           
                        where the function f for key establishment is a pseudo-random function and is efficient enough to be used in RFID systems. Additionally, once the individual key KA
                         is generated, it will be stored by the related Reader within its lifetime. As the Client also possesses the efficient establishment function f and the initial key K, it does not need to store individual keys.

In the proposed enhanced secure mechanism of LLRP, Readers first acquire their individual keys usingthe following encryption: 
                           
                              E
                              
                                 K
                                 A
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    K
                                    A
                                 
                                 ,
                                 A
                                 |
                                 
                                    t
                                    0
                                 
                              
                           
                        . Here, t
                        0 is used to defend against replay attacks. The Reader_Hello message is as follows:
                           
                              
                                 Reader
                                 →
                                 Client
                                 :
                                 A
                                 ,
                                 
                                    E
                                    
                                       K
                                       A
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       A
                                       |
                                       
                                          t
                                          0
                                       
                                    
                                 
                                 .
                              
                           
                        
                     

It is worth noting that the key establishment information, including function f, initial key K, and symmetric encryption algorithm E, is preloaded in the Readers when they are deployed to the network. In addition, the above information is possessed by the Client securely because it is distributed from CA following the security mechanism.

When the Client receives a Reader_Hello message from Reader A, it records tA
                         and checks the request to establish connection. As the Client also possesses the initial key K, symmetric encryption algorithm E, and key establishment function f, it could calculate the individual key of Reader A in the same way.

Through the above process, the Client obtains the key KA
                         for encryption. In addition, because algorithm E is symmetric, the Client can decrypt and obtain the information of A|t
                        0. Then, the Client records t
                        0 and compares whether the transported information A is the same as the decrypted A. If the information is consistent, then the message is indeed sent from Reader A.

Then, the Client sends back a Client_Hello_Done message to confirm the Reader_Hello message and agree to establish a secure connection. The Reader_Hello_Done message is as follows:
                           
                              
                                 Client
                                 →

                         is the key for the entire connection process. Here, t
                        0, sent by the Client, is used for authentication when the related Reader attempts to close the normal connection, which can help resist replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. After the above phase, the involved Reader sends back a response nonce, after which the parties start transmitting the normal interactive information of LLRP.

To avoid sudden shutdown of the LLRP connection by malicious Readers, a Close_connection_ask message is used. This message is based on aforementioned information tA
                         and KA
                        . The Close_connection_ask message used to secure the connection is as follows:

When Reader A intends to end the LLRP connection, it will broadcast a Nonce
                        
                           A
                         and send its individual information (ID of Reader A) to the Client. In addition, tA
                         is recorded when the Reader_Hello message is received by the Client, and it is used here to achieve the identity authentication of the asking Reader. Note that tA
                         is recorded in the Client and also sent to the real Reader A in the Client_Hello_Done message, which means that only the Client and the related Reader possess it.

When Client receives Nonce
                        
                           A
                        , requesting to close the LLRP connection, it checks whether the identity of the asking Reader is trusted through its ID and tA
                         decrypted from

                         using the related 
                           
                              E

                        . By checking whether the information is consistent, the Client can judge the identity of the Reader. Once the information is proven secure, the normal close connection process will start.

In the proposed enhanced secure mechanism of LLRP, the concept of MAC is adopted to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data. The sender first calculates the digest value of data before sending it using the negotiated hash function h. It then calculates the MAC of the above digest value using function H and session key K (KA
                         for Reader A). Thereafter, it transmits the calculated value with normal data.

After the receiver receives the above sent message, it first restores the digest value from the message using the session key K and calculates the digest value of the received data using the hash function h. If they are equal, the message passes the certification; otherwise, the message must be resent. Fig. 2
                         shows the process.

After the above process, a Reader and Client that are connected through enhanced LLRP protocol can achieve mutual authentication. Based on this authentication, the mechanism of this section can achieve cryptographic authentication between Reader and Tag, thereby building a third-party security authentication mechanism among the Tag, Reader and Client as shown in Fig. 3
                     .

Readers authenticated through the enhanced LLRP protocol have permission to launch authentication to Tags with the help of the Client. To avoid confusion with the expressions in the previous section, IDA
                         is used in this section to represent the ID value of Reader A. In this process, the Reader generates a random number RA
                        , uses this random number and the Reader ID to perform a XOR operation, and then sends the result to the tag to be authenticated. To simplify the description, T is used uniformly to represent the tags that participate in the authentication process and m
                        1 is used to represent the messages above. Then, the process can be shown as follows:

Similar to the key generation function shared between Reader and Client, the Tag and Client share a function, h, used to calculate the corresponding secret key through the Tag ID. In this process, the Tag uses the function and its ID to calculate the secret key following the methods below:K
                        
                           T
                        
                        =
                        f(K,
                        ID
                        
                           T
                        ).

After receiving the message m1 sent by the Reader, the Tag can calculate the result of R
                        
                           A
                        
                        ⊕
                        ID
                        
                           A
                        . Then, it uses an individual key to encrypt the message using the Symmetric Encryption Algorithm and sends the receipt message to Reader A. The process can be shown as follows:

The client stores all safety-related information shared with readers and tags as an absolutely safe third party. Therefore, it can decrypt the encrypted message of any individual who declares their identity and has enough computing and storage capacity to verify the identities of readers and tags. After receiving the authentication message from the reader, the client processes the message to verify the credibility of the tag and the safety between tags and readers. The process is as follows:

After calculation verification, the client returns the verification result m
                        4 to the reader. To verify the validity of the message and exclude the possibility of replay attacks, it is worth noting that this mechanism uses a method of generating a random number by the reader. Additionally, the identity of the reader that participates in the process of messaging is guaranteed in the previous section concerned with LLRP enhanced protocol mechanisms. The identity of the tag is verified by the client in this section.

Compared with other security mechanisms in the field, the protocol is both efficient and safe. It achieves a third-party authentication in the client, the reader and the tag. The safety and performance of the mechanism is analyzed in detail in the next section.

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

In the enhanced secure mechanism of LLRP, the readers and client both keep the key establishment function f, encryption function E and preset key K throughout. In addition, each RFID Reader needs to hold only the information of its individual ID and responding time tID
                         before the normal data connection is established. In addition, the Client stores the KID
                        , t
                        0 and tID
                         of related Readers. As the function f used to generate related KID
                         from individual Reader IDs is a pseudo-random function with high computational efficiency, the client does not need to store related KID
                         in its memory, which further helps reduce storage space.

In the tag participation third-party authentication mechanism, for Reader and Client, no information other than the information storage required by the enhanced LLRP mechanism is needed for secure encryption. The tag is to be verified as a new party to join in this part of the mechanism, which should store information including the random function f used to generate the secret key, the value of the Tag ID and the encryption algorithm E. Thus, the Tag participation third-party authentication mechanism requires very little additional information beyond the enhanced LLRP mechanism between Reader and Client of the previous stage. For large-volume tags, the storage space required by the security information above is entirely achievable.

In the enhanced secure mechanism of LLRP, for the entire mechanism, the security part is negligible as the added part includes only a simple certification process before connection establishment and closure.

In the Tag participation third-party authentication mechanism, there is only one information interaction between Reader and Tag or between Reader and Client. The implementation of the overall security mechanism mainly depends on the calculation and judgment of the Client based on the message received from the Reader rather than complex information interaction. In addition, the interaction information in this mechanism is brief, and thus the communication cost to achieve the overall security mechanism is very small.

Both in the enhanced secure mechanism of LLRP and the tag participation third-party authentication mechanism, the computational cost of the proposed secure mechanism is negligible compared to that of previous research because the functions and algorithms adopted in the proposed secure mechanisms are of high computational efficiency; for example, the Key generation function f is a pseudo-random function, and functions H and h are both hash functions.

In addition, because the adopted encryption function E is a symmetric encryption algorithm, the proposed secure mechanisms are lightweight for RFID systems.

Overall, it is concluded that the proposed mechanisms in this paper are superior and more efficient in storage, communication and computation than those of previous research.

In this section, the ability of the secure mechanisms to protect RFID systems from several major security attacks is analyzed, including the enhanced secure mechanism of LLRP and the tag participation third-party authentication mechanism.

In RFID systems, few studies have been performed on securing LLRP connections. One of the main works is sub-protocols of TLS, proposed in Reference [18]. This approach comprises two main sub-protocols called the Handshake Protocol and Record Protocol, as shown in Fig. 4
                        .

The TLS Handshake protocol is mainly responsible for authenticating the identities of the communicating endpoints but also negotiates other cryptographic parameters required by a TLS session. The Record Layer is a layered protocol in which data are fragmented, compressed (optional), used for the generation of a message authentication code and finally encrypted. The security parameters needed by the Record Layer are negotiated during the TLS Handshake.

Compared with the mechanism in Reference [18], the LLRP enhancement mechanism proposed in this paper gives a detailed interactive scheme. It has a much simpler handshake protocol, requires lower storage complexity and communication cost, and can resist more types of attacks.

The Hash-Lock protocol was originally developed by Sarma et al., using metaID to replace the real ID of the tag in case of information leakage and tracking [29]. The protocol is shown in Fig. 5
                        . The main implementation process is as follows:
                           
                              •
                              The reader initiates the query request.

The tag returns metaID to the reader after receiving the query request.

The reader sends metaID to the backend server. When the server finds the corresponding tuple of metaID, the ID and the key of the tag in the tuple are returned to the reader, in which metaID=
                                 H(key).

The reader delivers the key of the tag received from the server to the tag.

After receiving the key, the tag calculates Hash function H (key) to compare with metaID. If the result is equal, the tag will return the real ID to the reader.

The reader judges whether the ID received from the server is equivalent to the ID sent by the tag. If they are equivalent, the authentication of the tag is successful; otherwise, the tag cannot be authenticated.

The Hash-Lock protocol ID does not have a dynamic refresh mechanism, and metaID remains unchanged. In addition, the ID is transmitted using an insecure channel in the form of plain text. Therefore, the Hash-Lock protocol is vulnerable to spoofing attacks and replay attacks, and the attacker can easily track the tag. Although the scholars made a series of improvements to account for its defects, the Hash-Lock protocol has the issues of high communication cost and high computational complexity compared with the tag participation third-party authentication mechanism proposed in this paper. Actually, the majority of protocols can achieve only one-way authentication of the tag to the reader or the reader to the tag. The tag participation third-party authentication mechanism and enhanced secure mechanism of LLRP in the paper as a whole ensure that only authenticated readers have permission to participate in the tag verification implemented by the reader and to participate in normal communication.

The OSK Protocol is also called the Hash chain protocol and is one of the proposed improved protocols to remedy the deficiency of the hash-lock mechanism [30]. It is also an enquiry-response protocol based on shared secrets; however, in the OSK Protocol, there is a reader initiating authentication using two different hash functions and the Tag always returns a different answer. The process of the OSK Protocol is shown in Fig. 6
                        . The main implementation process is as follows:
                           
                              •
                              The reader initiates the query request.

After receiving the query request, the Tag calculates a
                                 
                                    t,j
                                 
                                 =
                                 G(S
                                 
                                    t,j
                                 ) using the current key value S
                                 
                                    t,j
                                  and then returns a
                                 
                                    t,j
                                  to the reader.

The reader locates the database to look for the existence of IDt
                                 (1≤
                                 t

                                 n) and j(1≤
                                 j
                                 ≤
                                 m), which makes the equation a
                                 
                                    t,j
                                 
                                 =
                                 G(H
                                 (j
                                    −1)(S
                                 
                                    t,1)). Here, m is a threshold value to solve the asynchronous problems. If present, the authentication is successful and the reader will send IDt
                                  to the Tag; otherwise, the tag cannot be authenticated.

It can be seen from the above process that, compared to the proposed secure mechanisms in this paper, OSK Protocol is a one-way authentication protocol which means it can only authenticate the identity of the Tag. It is not hard to see, OSK Protocol is very vulnerable to reply and Spoofing attacks, once an attacker intercepts a a
                        
                           t,j
                        , it can launch replay attack as well as camouflage Tag to pass Authentication. What is more, every time above authentication process happens, the database conducts hash operations of J times for each Tag, which leads to large computation load. Meanwhile, the protocol requires two different hash functions, which also increase the manufacture cost of the Tags.

It is shown in Table 2
                         that compared with the two types of security mechanisms above, the proposed security mechanisms have stronger ability to resist threats. Its ability of defending against three major attacks is analyzed below.

Due to the lightweight requirement of RFID systems, symmetric encryption algorithm is suggested in this paper. Though symmetric encryption algorithm is relatively not secure compared to non-symmetric algorithm, it still fits most of the basic security needs by encrypting the interactive messages and mission-critical data. Even if some important messages are monitored, eavesdropper cannot easily acquire useful information and tamper it.

In the proposed mechanisms based on tripartite credibility, attacker cannot launch man-in-the-middle attacks, since even if the attacker gets parts of the transmitted information, it cannot reply to a reasonable response message. For example, if a fake Reader sends message

                            because it does not possess secure information of

                           , which means it can neither send following respond messages nor encrypt the interactive messages. What is more, the attacker also cannot request or respond to shut down the normal interactive connection.

Once the communication channel is monitored, the attacker can easily acquire interactive messages and launch replay attacks. This paper uses t
                           0 and tID that are stored in related Reader and Client to defend against such attacks. For example, if a message is sent twice from Reader to Client over a period of time, Client will detect the exception by checking the time stamp t
                           0 to see whether it is behind the former one (messages received by Readers are checked in the same way by comparing time stamp tID). Meanwhile, it will also check the identity of the related Reader, and the detailed mechanism is described in Section 5. In addition, this article also resists replay attack by generating random numbers to participate in operation, which is described in Section 6.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper proposes secure mechanisms based on tripartite credibility for RFID systems, which consists of an enhanced secure mechanism for LLRP and a tag participation third-party authentication mechanism and analyzes the advantages of the proposal compared to previous research. This paper first introduces some relevant information about RFID systems, including application problems and the latest research and then details the design and implementation of the proposed secure mechanisms. This paper then evaluates the performance of the proposed mechanisms in terms of storage complexity, communication cost and computational cost. Finally, the ability of the proposed secure mechanisms to defend against security attacks is analyzed compared with some major previous approaches.

This work is an important contribution to RFID security based on the reality of advancing research. Related future work includes developing methods of performance evaluation and researching more appropriate authentication and encryption schemes.
