                  Typical questionnaires administered by financial advisors to assess financial risk tolerance mostly contain stereotypes of people, have seemingly unscientific scoring approaches and often treat risk as a one-dimensional concept. In this work, a mathematical tool was developed to assess relative risk tolerance using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). At its core, it is a novel questionnaire that characterizes risk by its four distinct elements: propensity, attitude, capacity, and knowledge. Over 180 individuals were surveyed and their responses were analyzed using the Slacks-based measure type of DEA efficiency model. Results show that the multidimensionality of risk must be considered for complete assessment of risk tolerance. This approach also provides insight into the relationship between risk, its elements and other variables. Specifically, the perception of risk varies by gender as men are generally less risk averse than women. In fact, risk attitude and knowledge scores are consistently lower for women, while there is no statistical difference in their risk capacity and propensity compared to men. The tool can also serve as a “risk calculator” for an appropriate and defensible method to meet legal compliance requirements, known as the “Know Your Client” rule, that exist for Canadian financial institutions and their advisors.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In Canada, the securities industry is regulated by provincial and territorial securities commissions and self-regulatory organizations (SROs). In Ontario, the province where this study takes place, the Ontario Securities Commission collaborates with two major SROs: the Investment Dealers Association of Canada and the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada. Each SRO enforces an equivalent “Know Your Client” (KYC) rule
                        1
                        The Investment Dealer’s Association’s Regulation 1300.1 (d) states that “Each [financial advisor], when recommending to a customer the purchase, sale, exchange or holding of any security, shall use due diligence to ensure that the recommendation is suitable for such customer based on factors including the customer’s financial situation, investment knowledge, investment objectives and risk tolerance” (IDA, 2007). The Mutual Fund Dealers Association’s Rule No. 2.2.1 requires that “Each [financial advisor] shall use due diligence: (a) to learn the essential facts relative to each client and to each order or account accepted; (b) to ensure that the acceptance of any order for any account is within the bounds of good business practice; (c) to ensure that each order accepted or recommendation made for any account of a client is suitable for the client and in keeping with the client’s investment objectives; and (d) to ensure that, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c), where a transaction proposed by a client is not suitable for the client and in keeping with the client’s investment objectives, the Member has so advised the client before execution thereof” (MFDA, 2007).
                     
                     
                        1
                      (that most developed countries also have) which mandates that all 17,000 Canadian certified financial planners, investment dealers and wealth management advisors consider a client’s personal circumstances, financial status, investment objectives and risk tolerance when determining whether or not an investment opportunity is suitable for such client. Of these factors, financial risk tolerance is the most challenging to assess because no formal metrics exist. Intuitively, “knowing a client” involves the establishment of a relationship between a financial advisor and an investor through personal interviews. However, due to time constraints, advisors increasingly deal with clients through the telephone and/or E-mails. Moreover, while the Internet allows the financial services industry to offer investment services over the World Wide Web, it introduces a paradoxical challenge: how do financial institutions comply with the KYC rule and fiduciary investment standards if investors do not interact with advisors?

Current practice involves administering risk tolerance assessment questionnaires in person (especially for high net worth individuals) or over the Internet. These questionnaires help create a risk “profile” from which an appropriate investment portfolio can be recommended. However, the value of these risk profiles is debatable since questionnaires vary across institutions and do not provide a consistent profile of the same client who may consequently receive different advice from advisors depending on which test is used. This inconsistency – attributed to biases and stereotypes, invalid questions, a disregard for psychometrics, incorrect mathematical approaches and the treatment of risk as a one-dimensional concept – may potentially expose an investor to unnecessary risk.

Although financial risk tolerance has been studied extensively, there is a lack of consensus on its definition: the words “profile”, “attitude”, “capacity” and “tolerance” are often used interchangeably. In theory, risk tolerance is a multidimensional concept consisting of four key elements – propensity, attitude, capacity, and knowledge – which all must be individually assessed, and then combined to obtain a complete risk profile. To date, the reliability and validity of so-called risk assessment questionnaires have suffered without a universally-accepted definition of risk tolerance, resulting in misguided assessments that are either incomplete (when different elements are collated) or incorrect (when one element, such as capacity, is treated synonymously with tolerance). Moreover, advisors are inevitably influenced by demographic stereotypes, many of which are embedded in these questionnaires. Research on age, gender, income, etc., and their relationship to risk tolerance has yielded inconclusive results, giving rise to a need for better understanding of client demography and risk tolerance.

Most questionnaires are in multiple-choice form with the same scoring motif: each possible answer to every question is assigned a score. Upon completion of a questionnaire, a final risk score is generated by summing the scores of the selected answers for all the questions and then interpreted by the advisor (Bank of Montreal, 2007; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 2007; Royal Bank of Canada, 2007; Scotiabank, 2007; Toronto Dominion Bank, 2007). For example, a lower score may indicate a risk averse investor whereas a higher score might indicate a risk seeking investor. However, summation without weights inappropriately treats collected data equally when the relationships across questions (from which demographic and psychological variables are obtained) are unclear.

Addressing this mathematical simplicity, Ardehali, Paradi, and Asmild (2005) first used a nonparametric linear programming technique called Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to compute “risk tolerance scores” from data collected using a questionnaire created by a commercial firm, ProQuest (now FinaMetrica Pty Ltd.). DEA treated each response to each psychological question as one dimension of risk tolerance without prior knowledge of the relationship between the questions. The results were encouraging, but suggested that DEA would be an even more effective tool for obtaining a single risk tolerance index when accompanied by a questionnaire specifically designed for analysis with DEA, as ProQuest’s was not. The ideal questionnaire would thus have responses to questions that are easily manipulated (scored) for pre-selected variables, each representing one dimension of risk tolerance and thereby taking advantage of DEA’s mathematical strength.

The purpose of our research was to create a new survey tool supported with DEA to assess the relative risk tolerance of a group of investors: i.e. to create a questionnaire that characterizes risk by the four distinct elements mentioned. DEA generates risk tolerance “scores” between 0 and 1 for each client, where the most aggressive investors are given a score of 1, while all other clients are scored as fractions of the riskiest investors. In effect, this is the first step towards developing a risk “calculator” software package for financial advisors or Web-based securities sales systems to use in everyday assessments which may offer solid information on risk tolerance while satisfying the KYC rule.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a literature survey on risk and risk tolerance; Section 3 reviews relevant DEA theory and outlines the methodology of this work; Section 4 discusses the results obtained from DEA; and Section 5 summarizes the key findings and concludes with future research recommendations.

The financial services industry administers questionnaires to assess a client’s risk tolerance for two main reasons. First, while interviews provide a thorough assessment, advisors lack the time required to build a significant relationship with their client and prefer to use questionnaires when client portfolios are small. Second, assessment by interview can be unreliable because it is qualitative and generally unstructured with conclusions drawn from cognitive biases (Roszkowski & Grable, 2005). Hence, a quantitative instrument, such as a questionnaire, allows for a more standardized and repeatable assessment, as well as a translation of observations into numerical values. However, questionnaires vary across different financial institutions; Yook and Everett (2003) examined six “investor risk tolerance” questionnaires and reported that these did not provide a consistent picture of the same client who consequently received six different recommendations. This again motivates the need for a reliable measure of risk tolerance.

Research on the demography of risk has yielded results which have either led to conflicting conclusions or have challenged intuition. Inconsistencies can be attributed to the lack of consensus on the definition of risk tolerance and choice of experimental methodology. Most studies use census data collected by the Survey of Consumer Finances through which risk tolerance is elicited from one question with four possible answers.

                           Which of the statements comes closest to the amount of financial risk that you and your (spouse/partner) are willing to take when you save or make investments?
                                 
                                    1.
                                    Take substantial financial risks expecting to earn substantial returns.

                        Table 2.1
                         summarizes the effect of some demographic variables on risk tolerance.

Some researchers have shown that financial risk tolerance decreases with age because older individuals have less time to recover from any losses incurred from investments (e.g. Ahmad, Safwan, Ali, and Tasbasum (2011), Bajtelsmit and Bernasek (1996), Hallahan, Faff, and McKenzie (2004), Palsson (1996), Riley and Chow (1992), and Sung and Hanna (1996)), while others have argued that it increases with age (e.g. Grable and Lytton (1998) and Wang and Hanna (1997)) since younger individuals are likely to have limited financial resources to endure short term losses.

Most, if not all, studies have shown that women are less risk tolerant than men to degrees varying with situational context (e.g. Ahmad et al. (2011), Bajtelsmit and Bernasek (1996), Palsson (1996), Eckel and Grossman (2002), Grable and Lytton (1998), Grable (2000), and Roszkowski and Grable (2005)). One explanation for this difference is based on the inherent biological characteristics of the genders. Because women are responsible for child bearing and mothering, they naturally have higher levels of enzyme monoamine oxidase to reduce sensation, thereby making them more averse to ambiguous situations (Hallahan et al., 2004). It is also debated whether this difference is the effect of stereotyping by advisors (e.g. Fehr-Duda, De Gennaro, and Schubert (2006) and Roszkowski and Grable (2005)), or exacerbated by other variables such as age or income. For example, younger men are more risk tolerant than younger women, but older men are less risk tolerant than older women (e.g. Chaulk, Johnson, and Bulcroft (2003) and Grable and Lytton (1999)). It is also well-known that women earn less than men with the difference attributed to career work and experience, education, familial priorities, undervaluation of women’s skills and even discrimination (e.g. Boheim, Hofer, and Zulehner (2007)). Nonetheless, the gender difference in risk tolerance has serious repercussions as women generally accumulate less wealth than men (e.g. Neelakantan (2010) and Watson and McNaughton (2007)).

Although family transitions influence financial risk tolerance, the effects of marital status and parenthood are uncertain. Some studies reported that single persons are more risk tolerant than those who are married (e.g. Hallahan et al. (2004) and Sung and Hanna (1996)), while others have argued the opposite (e.g. Ahmad et al. (2011), Roszkowski, Delaney, and Cordell (2004), and Yao and Hanna (2005)). Other findings include: husbands being more risk tolerant than their wives; single men being more risk tolerant than single women; younger married individuals being less risk tolerant than older single individuals; and individuals with children being less risk tolerant than those without children (e.g. Chaulk et al. (2003) and Riley and Chow (1992)).

Individuals with a higher level of education, investment experience and financial knowledge are more likely to take financial risk (e.g. Ahmad et al. (2011), Finke and Huston (2003), Grable and Lytton (1999), Grable (2000), Hallahan et al. (2004), and Sung and Hanna (1996)).

Greater wealth and income correlates with greater financial risk tolerance as losses incurred from investments are more easily afforded (e.g. Finke and Huston (2003), Grable (2000), Hallahan et al. (2004), and Riley and Chow (1992)). Those who are self-employed, working in the private sector, professionals, and/or holding a higher ranking occupational status, are also more risk tolerant (Quattlebaum, 1998).

In risk assessment, words such as “profile”, “attitude”, “capacity” and “tolerance” are often used interchangeably, as if the only difference between them is semantic, possibly resulting in erroneous conclusions. Cordell (2001) defines risk tolerance as a multidimensional entity with four distinct elements: propensity, attitude, capacity and knowledge. Hence, to determine an individual’s overall risk tolerance completely, each component of risk (Fig. 2.1
                        ) should be evaluated.

Advisors often review a client’s past financial activity to infer something about his/her risk tolerance. Ratios associated with risk propensity include high-risk to low-risk investments, liabilities to assets or income, and amount spent on gambling to annual salary. Risk attitude is the “emotional” element, defined as the willingness to incur risk. Risk capacity refers to the financial ability to incur risk and is influenced by age, dependents, income, net worth, and time horizon. Risk knowledge reflects on one’s understanding of the risk-return trade-off. It is particularly important that overall risk tolerance remain differentiated from its elements in cases where assessment is difficult (i.e. for those with the willingness to incur risk but not the financial capacity, or those with the financial capacity to incur risk but not the willingness to do so). Other works that support the theory that risk tolerance is multidimensional include Jackson, Hourany, and Vidmar (1972), Nicholson, Soane, Fenton-O’Creevy, and Willman (2005), Soane and Chmiel (2005), and Weber, Blais, and Betz (2002).

In short, both practical experience and literature point to a general disagreement on what factors govern the extent to which people will accept financial risk. However, it can be concluded that a person’s feeling toward risk is rooted in their past experiences and cultural influences.

A new questionnaire (see Supplementary material) was designed specifically as to generate results that would be suitable for models processed with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). It was created after a comprehensive review of questionnaires obtained from over 30 banks and financial advisor groups. Every question from each such document was analyzed, with those appropriate for DEA adopted or slightly modified while others were significantly reformed. A novel feature was the incorporation of the multidimensionality of risk through four separate sections, each corresponding to an element of risk. As risk attitudes were determined by subjective psychological questions, possible responses were presented such that they could be scored using the Likert scale. All other elements were mostly gauged by objective demographic questions prompting for exact numerical values.

The questionnaire was successfully administered to 187 individuals from all over the world, distributed either on paper hardcopy or on a form over the Internet. The data represented slightly more men (58%) than women, and the average age was 39years old. The majority were married or in a stable relationship (66%) and over 50% had no dependents. Over 70% had at least a University-level Bachelor’s degree, with a high mean income ($90,100) and mean net worth ($331,800). Also, 71% were full-time workers, and while 82% reside in Canada, only 47% were born in Canada with much immigration from Asia and Europe (the typical Canadian population cross-section). For complete questionnaire results and descriptive statistics, please refer to Supplementary material. Greater diversity through a larger distribution would have mitigated biases in this sample; however, this sample size was sufficient for DEA to provide meaningful results. Furthermore, the questionnaire was reviewed by several financial institutions that agreed on its validity, but reliability tests have yet to be completed.

                        =1,…,
                        m) and output weights ur
                         (r
                        =1,…,
                        s) are derived from the data such that each DMU’s θ is maximized. Empirically efficient DMUs (with the highest observed output for a given level of inputs) form a piecewise linear efficient frontier and have a score of 1. Inefficient DMUs have a score between 0 and 1 based on their distance to the frontier.

DEA was applied to risk tolerance assessment, utilizing the methodology of Ardehali et al. (2005). Clients or investors were defined as DMUs with those who are most risk seeking providing an empirical risk frontier (Fig. 3.1
                        ). Selected from and consistent with the literature, inputs or risk inhibiting factors were defined as variables that decrease one’s ability or willingness to take risk while outputs or risk enabling factors were defined as variables that increase one’s ability or willingness to take risk. Thus, individuals with a “risk score” of 1 exhibited risk seeking behavior while all others were less risk tolerant and scored as fractions of the riskiest investors.

Since the analogy between determining production efficiency and measuring risk tolerance may be unclear, it is noted that traditional DEA terminology (e.g. “efficiency”, “production function”, “inputs”, “outputs”) is not pertinent to this research. Here, the power of DEA is its ability to act as a multi-criteria sorting tool with the objective function (3.1) serving as a benchmark to organize and classify individuals by their level of risk tolerance. Thus, the discussion of a more efficient (or risk tolerant) person being “a better performer” than one who is less efficient (or risk averse), or the statement that a risk averse person should intuitively aim to be more risk tolerant, is inappropriate. The DEA “risk” scores only show where an individual is on the continuum of conservative to aggressive financial risk tolerance, and the difference between two scores is simply interpreted as follows: a person A is more (or less) risk tolerant than person B based on certain criteria (enabling and inhibiting factors).

The data collected from the questionnaire were analyzed with a non-oriented Slacks-based measure of efficiency (SBM) model (3.2) to capture the effect of slacks (all inefficiencies) in the scores produced. The SBM efficiency score ρ
                        ∊[0,1] is a ratio of the average relative input consumption to the average relative output production (Tone, 2001), but note again that these concepts of input, output and efficiency are not pertinent in this application.

The preparation of data depended on the type of response which, as mentioned, was either close-ended in Likert form or open-ended and numerical. In fact, scale transformations for ordinal and exact data were performed similar to the work of Cooper, Park, and Yu (1999) on imprecise DEA. For each psychological question that served as a variable to gauge risk attitude, individuals selected one of five options on the Likert scale: “Strongly Disagree”, “Disagree”, “Neutral”, “Agree” and “Strongly Agree”. The choice was then converted to an ordinal number: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, respectively. It is noted that psychological questions are phrased such that increasing agreement (and a corresponding number) would translate to a greater willingness or ability to take risk. For each demographic question that served as a variable to determine risk capacity, respondents provided whatever value they considered to be correct. As a result, the ranges across questions of this nature were sample dependent and diverse (e.g. age can range between 21 and 80years old while net worth can range between −$50,000 and $5,000,000). However, because SBM can handle only semi-positive data and is not translation invariant, some of these data had to be scaled and categorized into one of 5 or 10 equal intervals so as to match closely to the Likert scale. For instance, given the range above, an age between 21 and 32years old would be converted to a “1”; 33–44years old would be “2”, and so on; with “5” equivalent to a 69–80years old person. The only exception where binning was not equal was for the number of years of investment experience. It was assumed that the marginal knowledge gained with time does not proportionally affect an individual’s judgment on risk; thus, 0–1years of investment experience was scaled to “1”; 2–3years: “2”, 4–5years: “3”; 6–10years: “4”; and, 11years and over: “5”. Another motivation behind this mapping is that the objective of the SBM is to obtain the lowest average value of ρ across all variables. This implies that DEA will emphasize on minimizing a variable with a greater possible reduction as determined by a greater range. Thus, because there is no evidence that one variable is more significant that another, the scaling of data for equal ranges was appropriate. Furthermore, variable returns-to-scale was selected for all models since it is less restrictive and the variables are not proportionally scaled. The model used is formulated as in Expression 3.2.

The data collected from the questionnaire were organized for desired variables applicable to five DEA SBM models, one corresponding to each element of risk (Table 3.1
                        ). Variables were selected based on the literature survey which provided information about whether to treat them as inhibitors (traditionally inputs, which decrease the willingness to take risk) or enablers (traditionally outputs, which increase the willingness to take risk).

There are two reasons for having multiple concurrent DEA models that make-up a first stage of analysis. First, it allows the various elements of risk tolerance to be considered independently, as the literature advises, for correct and complete assessment. Second, a “global” merging of all variables is inappropriate as some have different orientations depending on the element being investigated (i.e. the liabilities-to-asset ratio is an inhibitor in the Capacity Model but an enabler in the Propensity Model).

The first stage of analysis generated four DEA scores (one for each element) for each client. Each score is relative, ranging from 0 to 1, and indicates how a client relates that particular element compared to all other clients; that is, a score of 0 would suggest that a client is not in agreement with that element while a score of 1 would suggest full agreement. For example, scores of 0.5 and 0.9 for capacity and attitude, respectively, would imply that a client’s financial ability to incur risk is moderate, while his/her willingness to incur monetary risk is high compared to all other clients in the dataset.

A second stage of the analysis was conducted to provide a holistic examination of risk tolerance; that is, to observe the multidimensionality of risk and the effect of each element on overall risk tolerance (Fig. 3.2
                        ). Essentially, once the Attitude, Capacity, Propensity, and Knowledge scores were computed for each client, they were combined into a one-sided SBM model (as outputs with a dummy input variable) to generate a final risk tolerance score between 0 and 1 for each client; the riskiest investors were given a score of 1, while all others scored less than 1.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#


                        Table 4.1
                         presents the results from the first stage of the SBM DEA models.

The Attitude Model identifies 12 respondents as those most willing to incur financial risk, and consequently assigns these individuals a risk attitude score of 1. They generally have a greater mean income and net worth, compared to the rest of the sample, as well as a smaller liabilities-to-assets ratio and less formal education. Also, they are more likely to be married and born in North America – the latter point suggesting that immigrants may be more cautious than their native counterparts. Moreover, Table 4.2
                         presents the correlation coefficients of the variables translated from psychological questions and used in the Attitude Model. The weak correlations amongst these questions (A1 to A13a–h) suggest that they are not redundant and are important in assessing risk attitude.

The Capacity Model identifies 24 respondents as having the greatest financial ability to incur risk relative to the entire sample, giving these individuals a risk capacity score of 1. There are no clear factors that distinguish these individuals from their peers because income, net worth and earnings potential (as measured by the level of education), are the key determinants of financial risk capacity; and on average, this sample ranks well in these respects: 70% have at least a Bachelor’s degree, and mean income and net worth are over $90,000 and $330,000, respectively.

The Propensity Model identifies 5 respondents as having the greatest tendency to accept financial risk based on their past financial decisions, and assigns these individuals a risk propensity score of 1. They have a substantially higher net worth and income, and are likely to be older, married and have dependents. Although these results may seem counterintuitive, one must recall that the debt variables are positively correlated with propensity: the liabilities-to-assets and liabilities-to-income ratios. These riskier individuals most likely own a home (with a mortgage increasing their liabilities) as they have a good income to afford it as well as a motivation to do so (i.e. a spouse and children).

The Knowledge Model assigns only 2 respondents with score of 1. While general observations of the most investment knowledgeable persons cannot be made, knowledge scores are strongly correlated with age and level of education.

The relationships between attitude, capacity, propensity, and knowledge scores are plotted in Fig. 4.1
                        . Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (ρ) show that weak relationships exist between the elements – supporting the theory that risk tolerance is multidimensional and comprised of distinct elements that should be considered separately during assessment.

After observing multidimensionality, attitude, capacity, propensity, and knowledge scores were used as “outputs” with an input dummy variable in another SBM DEA model to generate an all-encompassing risk tolerance score for each individual. This Second Stage Model identified 14 out of 187 respondents as the most overall risk tolerant investors, assigning them a final risk score of 1. The mean, median and minimum final risk tolerance scores are 0.504±0.198, 0.460 and 0.193, respectively.

Question 14 of the questionnaire (see Supplementary material) explains to each participant that the data collected will be used to compute to a final risk score between 0 (risk avoiding) and 100 (risk seeking). This then prompts them to guess what their own score will be. Thirty-six women and 67 men assessed themselves as more risk tolerant than shown by DEA whereas 43 women and 42 men assessed themselves as less risk tolerant. Also, the average score from Question 14 is 0.540 – close to the second stage average of 0.504. This implies that DEA estimates risk tolerance well within the self-assessment scores with any discrepancy in scores likely due to precision: second stage scores are generated to 3 significant digits whereas self-assessed scores are provided as an integer in intervals of fives or tens (i.e. one significant digit).

In all models, the majority of individuals that are identified as “riskiest”, and thus influence the form of the risk frontier, are men. In fact, women’s scores are consistently lower than those of the men (Table 4.3
                        ), suggesting that they may perceive risk differently than men; t-test results show that the differences between genders in attitude and knowledge scores are particularly significant.

One approach to assessing risk tolerance – as taken here – is to evaluate each individual relative to the highest risk taker. For robustness, an alternative inverse two-stage DEA model was run based on the lowest risk taker (i.e. reversing the variable orientation in Table 3.1) and compared for consistency. Since the DEA scores generated from the inverse model and those from the original model are highly correlated (Pearson coefficient of 0.832), this shows the methodology’s validity.

A new kind of questionnaire specifically designed for post-processing by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was created as a measurement tool for risk tolerance assessment. To accommodate the demographic, socioeconomic and psychological nature of the data, Slacks-based measure (SBM) of DEA efficiency models were selected to provide an all-encompassing final risk score. The findings that arose from these DEA models are consistent with the literature and the use of this questionnaire as a method for risk assessment has proven to be feasible. In particular, the incorporation of the multidimensionality of risk was successful and validated; risk attitude, risk capacity, risk propensity, and knowledge, share a weak correlation with one another – implying that these elements of risk can correctly be assessed separately. This work also offers insight into the relationship between risk and certain demographics, e.g. there is an inherent difference in the way men and women perceive the concept of financial risk.

Finally, despite the need for a greater and more diverse sample, these results, which are representative of high net worth individuals, are still extremely encouraging. This questionnaire is the first of its kind to determine risk with multidimensionality, and logical scientific and mathematical backing. It is important to note that the validity of this approach to risk tolerance assessment cannot be proven by measuring the satisfaction from successful investments because it is beyond the scope of this project. Rather, it is rooted in the careful selection and scoring of questions, the value of DEA as a multi-criteria sorting or classification tool, and the thoroughness of a two-stage analysis – all leading to a more comprehensive assessment. As such, this work significantly contributes to the construction of a “risk calculator” that may be used by financial institutions for risk tolerance assessment to recommend the appropriate investment portfolio. Ultimately, the risk calculator can serve as a web-based evaluation system that could feed into automated securities sales systems, and be an additional means to learn about risk and its trends.

Future research opportunities include: matching DEA generated scores to portfolios of financial institutions; comparing relative DEA frontiers to a theoretical, absolute risk frontier; establishing mathematical relationships between variables using multivariate analysis; and imposing the Assurance Region (which limits the region of input and output weights to specific ranges) to SBM instead of creating one’s own ranges and intervals.
