               Abstract
               
                  E-selling is an activity that is distinct from e-commerce, e-marketing and e-retailing. E-selling is conceptualized to be computerâ€“human dialog characterized by the digital spatio-temporal locus, the psychology of online persuasion, and complex perceptions of value. This definition warrants that flow user experience and human immersion are key premises for understanding e-selling. The ability to combine these with the different value drivers is identified as the key to e-selling success. This theoretical and conceptual article opens new avenues of research and design into online service design and user engagement.
