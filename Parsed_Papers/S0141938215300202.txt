                  A series of Eu3+-activated Li2Mg2(WO4)3 (LMW) materials were synthesized by high temperature solid state reactions. The phosphor can be effectively excited by 394nm near ultraviolet light and emit intense red light with high color purity. Prepared phosphors can be indexed to LMW with particular lyonsite structure. The occupation of Eu3+ in LMW is selective. Most of Eu3+ comes into 1A sites without inversion symmetry. The present research suggests that LMW is a suitable host for luminescence applications and Eu3+-activated LMW is a promising phosphor for phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recently, phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes (pc-white-LEDs) have been widely used in the field of lighting and display. The eventual performance of these pc-white-LEDs strongly depends on the luminescence properties of the phosphors employed. Thus, relevant devices would be remarkably advanced by the discovery of optimized phosphor materials. The most commonly used red phosphor for near ultraviolet (UV) LEDs is Y2O2S: Eu3+ 
                     [1–3]. However, it has poor absorption in near UV region. Simultaneously, it is chemically unstable for its nature of sulfide and uneconomical for the usage of rare earth oxide in the host. Therefore, a red phosphor with high absorption in the near UV region, satisfying chemical stability and low cost, is urgently needed for commercial applications. In order to obtain desirable color purity, Eu3+ is indispensable for red phosphors. Therefore, the current pivotal task is to find a stable, cheap and easily synthesized host. Simultaneously, such a Eu3+ doped phosphor should be fit for near UV LEDs which have been extensively commercialized now.

Lyonsite is a mineral which can be the archetypal structure for large numbers of materials, such as perovskite, garnet, apatite, and spinel. Oxide classes such as these can accommodate a wide variety of metal cation while retaining their unique structure. Adaptable framework structures can have different properties because of the varying elemental compositions [4]. Currently, investigations about lyonsite structure mainly focus on two properties: ionic conduction and catalysis. Li2Mg2(WO4)3 (LMW) is a peculiar lyonsite-type tungstate found in 1994 [5]. It is orthorhombic in Pnma (62) space group with lattice parameters: a=5.1129Å, b=10,462Å, and c=17.612Å at room temperature (RT). Few studies involve the luminescent properties of rare earth ions in LMW till now. Thus we prepared a series of pure and Eu3+ doped LMW and investigated their luminescence properties and structure. The results indicate that Eu3+ activated LMW is a promising red phosphor for pc-white-LEDs and LMW is a desirable host for luminescent materials. The results found in this work can blaze a new way in finding a proper phosphor.

All the phosphors were synthesized by high temperature solid state reaction (HTSSR). Raw materials Li2CO3, MgO, WO3, and Eu2O3, were weighed according to the composition of Li2−
                     
                        x
                     Mg2−
                     
                        x
                     (WO4)3, Eu3+
                     
                        x
                      (x
                     =0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10). The weighed materials were put into an agate mortar and ground with an agate muller for 2h. Then they were heated up to 700°C in a tubular furnace. The samples were preserved at 700°C for 30h with twice intermediate regrinding. To be clear, these samples are abbreviated as LMW, LMW-2, LMW-4, LMW-6, LMW-8, and LMW-10, respectively.

Phase identification of prepared phosphors was carried out by a Beijing MSAL-XD-2 powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The excitation, emission spectra and decay curves of all the samples were measured with a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The morphology of the samples was studied with a Hitachi S3400N scanning electron microscope (SEM). The absorption spectra of the samples were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. All the measurements were performed at room temperature. As for the details of these instruments, the reader can refer to our previous literatures [6,7].

@&#RESULTS AND ANALYSIS@&#

In order to determine the phase structure, the powder XRD analysis was carried out. The XRD patterns of several typical samples are shown in Fig. 1
                     . JCPDS card No. 82-1804 (LMW, found in the International Center for Diffraction Data) is also listed in Fig. 1 for comparison. From Fig. 1, one can see that the XRD patterns of samples LMW-0, LMW-2, and LMW-6 are consistent with the standard card. Thus these samples can be indexed to LMW with a single phase. Impurity peaks appear from LMW-8 on and get enhanced in LMW-10. It indicates that the solid solution extreme of Eu3+ in LMW is 6%mol. The effective radii of involved ions in samples are as follows. r(Li+
                     6)=0.76nm, r(Mg2+
                     6)=0.72nm, r(W6+
                     4)=0.42nm, and r(Eu3+
                     6)=0.947nm (Here subscribe denote the coordination number of cation) [8]. Doped Eu3+ is bigger than any cation in the host. It is almost impossible for Eu3+ to replace W6+ sites because there is a notable difference in charge number and ionic radii between W6+ and Eu3+. Therefore, only Li+ and Mg2+ ions can be substituted by Eu3+. The reason for the appearance of impurity peaks might be that substitution of one Eu3+ for one Li+ and one Mg2+ introduces volume unbalance and change of the number of total ions. From Fig. 1, we can also see that the intensity of the main diffraction peaks is different. This indicates that samples with different composition have different crystallinity. The strongest diffraction peak at 26.40° can be the best probe. Pure LMW presents the strongest diffraction intensity for its best crystallinity. All samples can be ranked according to crystallinity from high to low as LMW, LMW-2, LMW-4, LMW-6, LMW-8, and LMW-10. The reason for the change of main diffraction peaks is also volume unbalance and change of the number of total ions.

The SEM image of one typical Eu3+ doped sample, i.e. LMW-6, is shown in Fig. 2
                     . From Fig. 2, it is observed that the particle size is inhomogeneous within ranges from 0.2 to 2.0μm. It is well know that the particle size can significantly affect luminescence intensity of phosphors. The general rule is that sample with larger particle size presents higher luminescence intensity. The particle size of prepared phosphors with HTSSR method generally is in micrometer. Though the particle size of our samples is inhomogeneous, they also can present a good luminescence performance. This can be proved by the measurements of excitation, emission and absorption spectra (see later).


                     Fig.3
                     (a) shows the excitation spectrum of a typical sample LMW-6 monitoring the emission at 613nm corresponding to 5D2
                     →
                     7F2 transition of Eu3+. The excitation spectrum is composed of one broad band between 240 and 310nm and a group of excitation lines in UV and visible region. The broad band can be attributed to the combinations of charge transfer (CT) transitions from W6+-O2− to Eu3+-O2− 
                     [9]. The excitation lines are ascribed to the typical Eu3+ intra-4f6 transitions, including the peaks with maximum at 362 (7F0
                     →
                     5D4), 383 (7F0
                     →
                     5G2−4), 394 (7F0
                     →
                     5L6), 416 (7F0
                     →
                     5D3), 466 (7F0
                     →
                     5D2), and 536 (7F1
                     →
                     5D1) nm, respectively [10–12]. The 7F0
                     →
                     5L6 transitions of Eu3+ at 394nm are more intense than the CT band. Many excitation lines overlap together and form an excitation band from 370 to 410nm. The perfect matching of this excitation band with the emission wavelength of near UV LED chips makes these phosphors used in white LEDs conveniently.

The emission spectra of all Eu3+ doped samples were recorded with a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The emission spectrum of one typical sample LMW-6 excited with 394nm was shown in Fig.3(b). Some emission lines are observed from 500 to 750nm. The strongest emission line at 613nm with a crystal field spiting component at 621nm is attributed to the transitions from 5D0 to 7F2. The second strongest emission line at 592nm can be attributed to the transitions from 5D0 to 7F1. The other emission lines can also be observed at 705nm (5D0
                     →
                     7F4), 656nm (5D0
                     →
                     7F3), but they are much weaker than the former two ones.


                     Fig. 4
                      shows the emission spectra of all Eu3+ doped samples. These spectra show almost the same shape, except for different intensity. The subgraph of Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the relative intensity of Eu3+ luminescence with the concentration of Eu3+. As the concentration increases, the emission intensity increases and reaches the maximum value at x
                     =0.06, which was taken as the optimum concentration. Beyond this optimum concentration, the intensity decreases due to the concentration quenching effect, which can be attributed to the electric multipole interaction between the neighboring Eu3+ ions.

As is well-known, if Eu3+ occupies a site in the crystal lattice with inversion symmetry, the magnetic dipole (MD) transition 5D0
                     →
                     7F1 of Eu3+ dominates; if there is no inversion symmetry at the site of Eu3+, the main emission is the electric dipole (ED) transition 5D0
                     →
                     7F2 
                     [13,14]. The emission from 5D0
                     →
                     7F2 transitions is much stronger than the one from 5D0
                     →
                     7F1 transitions (Fig. 3(b)). This indicates that most of Eu3+ occupies a site in the crystal lattice without inversion symmetry. The predominance of emission from ED transitions makes emitted red light have high color purity.

The decay curve of a typical sample LMW-6 is shown in Fig. 5
                     . It is well fitted with a single exponential function, and the decay time τ was determined to be about 0.86ms. This value has the same order of magnitude with the value of 0.43ms found by Loiko et al. in KY(WO4)2 
                     [15] and 1.167ms found by Liu et al. in NaY(WO4)2 
                     [16].

To prove that phosphors can be used in UV LED devices, absorption spectra of samples in our experiments were recorded. The absorption spectra of un-doped LMW and LMW-6 are shown in Fig. 6
                     . From Fig. 6, it is observed that the absorption spectrum of LMW-6 is composed of the strong absorption from 200 to 400nm and three absorption bands peaking at about 394, 464, and 535nm. However, un-doped LWM does now absorb visible light. It also presents strong absorption from 200 to 400nm. Obviously, the strong absorption in UV region can be attributed to host absorption, and doped Eu3+ are responsible for three absorption bands at 394, 464, and 535nm. The position of the absorption is consistent well with excitation spectra. In these absorption peaks, the strongest one at 394nm is coupled well with the absorption of the LED radiation. This proves that these phosphors can substantially absorb the LED radiation and used in UV LEDs.

The CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates of the phosphors are calculated and listed in Table 1
                     . It is obvious that all the samples own similar color coordinates. This indicates that the doping concentration of Eu3+ has no effect on the chromaticity of phosphors. In order to show the chromaticity more clearly, the corresponding data dot (A) is labeled in Fig. 7
                     . The relevant data dots of red emission of Eu3+ in KY(WO4)2 (C) [15] and NaY(WO4)2 (B) [16] are also presented in Fig. 7. The color purity of the red emission of Eu3+ in LMW is not as good as in KY(WO4)2 and NaY(WO4)2.

The crystal structure of LMW is shown in Fig. 8
                     . Fig. 8 is the projection of structure onto the (100) plane. WO4 forms tetrahedra with W in its center. (1/3Li+2/3Mg)O6 is an octahedron with (1/3Li+2/3Mg) in its center. LiO6 is a prism with Li in its center (see Fig. 8). In the general formula for lyonsite-type oxides A16(BO4)12, A is composed of Li+ and Mg2+ while B is composed of W6+. The structural connectivity of LMW is based on an array of pseudohexagonal oxygen atoms, and built up of isolated WO4 tetrahedra linked by AO6 chains. The most unique features of the structure are the hexagonal tunnels that consist of AO6 polyhedra. Isolated WO4 tetrahedra are joined to the inside of the tunnel [4]. There are three unique A sites. Two sides of the hexagonal tunnel are created by zigzag sheets of edge-sharing 1A-centered trigonal prisms, while the remaining four sides are composed of columns of edge-sharing 2A-centered octahedra. 3A is in the center of the tunnels. Infinite chains of face shared 3AO6 octahedra pass through the center of these tunnels. In fact, the geometric conformation of 2AO6 and 3AO6 octahedra is same. Both are centrosymmetric. However, there is no inversion symmetric center in 1A-centered trigonal prisms.

As mentioned above, only those A ions can be substituted by Eu3+. Both 2A and 3A are in the center of octahedral with higher inversion symmetry. However, 1A is in the center of trigonal prisms without inversion symmetry. From the analysis about the emission spectra of Eu3+ above, it is concluded that most of Eu3+ occupy 1A site without inversion symmetry. However, it is possible that a few lucky Eu3+ come into 2A and 3A sites. Thus there is also emission corresponding to the MD transition of Eu3+. It is also observed that 1A sites occupied by doped Eu3+ is close to WO4 tetrahedra. This is advantageous for the energy transfer from WO4 tetrahedra to doped Eu3+.

Here, we have to point out that it is possible for the presence of Eu2+ in these phosphors. Generally speaking, Eu2+ is instable at high temperature in air. However, in some particular structures, Eu3+ can be spontaneously reduced to Eu2+ even if in air [17]. The compensation mechanism of charge and volume in the substitution of doped cation for replaced ones is the main reason of the self-reduction of Eu3+. If one Eu3+ replaced one Li+ or Mg2+, two net positive unit charges or one net positive unit charge would form in the structure. From this point of view, self-reduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+ is advantageous for the stability of the structure. However, as Eu2+ presents bigger radius than Eu3+, it would cause bigger volume unbalance. This is disadvantageous for the stability. Here, we do not rule out the possibility of the existence of Eu2+. However, the luminescence of the Eu2+ cannot be detected by our spectrophotometer. The reason for this might be the fact that the ground state of Eu2+ locates in a high energy level. The excited state of Eu2+ presents higher energy and comes into the conduction band of the host LMW. Any electron with higher energy in conduction band will dissipate its energy in the host lattice without light emission.

The largest percentage, by a wide margin, of the existing lyonsite-type compounds are molybdate. Generally, tungstate and molybdate have similar structure and properties. Another lyonsite-type compound is vanadate, which is also a kind of excellent hosts for luminescence applications. Thus, it is expectable there are many lyonsite-type compounds which are desirable hosts for luminescence applications. For instance, He et al. reported a multi-wavelength excited novel red-emitting phosphor Eu3+-activated Li2Zn2(MoO4)3 
                     [18].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Multi-wavelength excited red phosphors Eu3+ doped LMW were successfully prepared by HTSSR. Obtained phosphors can be effectively excited with 394nm near UV light and present strong red emission. The XRD measurements and structural analysis show that prepared phosphors can be indexed to LMW with a unique lyonsite structure. Doped Eu3+ in LMW mainly occupies those interspaces among adjacent hexagonal tunnels without inversion symmetry. Energy absorbed from near UV light by the host can be effectively transferred to doped Eu3+. This makes the phosphor emit red light with good color purity. All these research results suggest LMW is a novel host for luminescent materials and Eu3+-activated LMW is a promising phosphor for pc-white-LEDs. This research will turn our attention to a new class of compounds, i.e. lyonsite structures which can fit to serve as the host for phosphors. In the near future, more and more compounds with lyonsite structures will be investigated as the host of luminescent materials.

The work presented in this paper was carried out in 2015. While the original manuscript of this paper was under review after its submission in October 2015, another independent paper also reporting the synthesis and characterization of the phosphor material described in this paper was published elsewhere [19]. In our independent research work, the results indicate that Eu3+ doped Li2Mg2(WO4)3 is a promising red phosphor which can be effectively excited with multiple excitation wavelength. The main conclusions in our work are consistent with the published work. It is worth pointing out that the occupation of Eu3+ in Li2Mg2(WO4)3 was discussed in detail in our work.
