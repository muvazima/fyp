@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The problem of “smoothly rounding” the sharp corners of a nominal shape is a key requirement in many geometric design contexts. In consumer products or architectural design, for example, rounded corners are often preferred on the basis of aesthetic or ergonomic considerations. The rounding or “filleting” of sharp corners in load-bearing mechanical components plays a critical role in minimizing stress concentration effects, and thus prolonging fatigue life. In the layout of highways or railways, the precise variation of curvature along a turn between linear segments determines the maximum safe traversal speed, due to the instantaneous centripetal acceleration it incurs.

The focus of this study is on the design of 
                        
                           
                              G

                      corner shapes with planar Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves, a family of curves compatible with the standard Bézier/B-spline representations of modern CAD systems, that offer attractive computational advantages over “ordinary” polynomial curves (Farouki, 2008). Despite its ubiquitous applications, this “corner rounding” problem does not appear to have received much attention. Walton and Meek (2009) formulated a scheme for 
                        
                           
                              G

                      blending of the corners on polygonal curves using “ordinary” cubic and PH quintic segments. The unique 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      PH quintic corner described in Section 4 below may be regarded as a special case of this scheme, but it offers no residual degrees freedoms for fine-tuning the corner shape.

A substantial literature on design of “spiral segments” has accumulated (Baass, 1984; Habib and Sakai, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012; Hartman, 1957; Meek and Walton, 1992; Walton and Meek, 1996a) including the use of PH curves (Farouki, 1997; Habib and Sakai, 2007; Walton and Meek, 1996b, 1998, 2002, 2004, 2007, 2013) in this context. However, spiral segments are not directly applicable to the corner rounding problem, since they have monotone curvature variation, and a 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      rounded corner shape must incorporate vanishing end-point curvatures. It is, in principle, possible to construct a 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      rounded corner shape by splicing spiral PH curve segments together.

                        Such a solution is presented in Section 6 below.
                      But a single-segment solution, which is 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              ∞
                           
                        
                      over its interior, is obviously preferable whenever possible.

The solution procedure (and the analysis of the existence of solutions) is much simpler if the PH curve corner-rounding problem is addressed directly, rather than as an application of existing spiral-segment methods. Invoking the complex representation of planar PH curves, it is shown that 
                        
                           
                              G

                      rounded corners with the desired symmetry and unimodal curvature properties can be constructed using little more than the solutions of quadratic equations. For brevity, the focus of this study is on rounding right-angle corners (the case of most practical importance). However, the methods can be extended without undue complication to the case of corners with acute or obtuse angles.

The plan for the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the construction and basic properties of planar PH curves, and their advantageous features in the corner rounding problem. The simplest solution, the

                      PH cubic corner, is then derived in Section 3, and is found to be unique and to closely approximate a circular arc. Quintic PH curves are necessary to obtain a 
                        
                           
                              G

                      corner, and in Section 4 it is observed that the 
                        
                           
                              G

                      PH quintic corner is also unique, with a unimodal curvature distribution. Proceeding to degree 7 PH curves in Section 5, a

                      corner incorporating one free parameter is constructed. The curvature remains unimodal over a certain range of this parameter, which can be exploited to fine tune the extremum curvature. As an alternative, another

                      scheme based on splicing together two PH quintic curves is described in Section 6, that provides two free parameters for shape adjustment. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the main results of this study and identifies some possible topics for further investigation.

To construct smooth PH curve corner shapes, it is convenient to adopt a standardized coordinate system. Solutions obtained in this system can be transformed to specific model coordinates through a suitable combination of scaling, translation, and rotation transformations.

                      PH quintic corners shown in Figs. 1 and 3. Unlike the former, it is curvature-continuous and does not closely resemble a circular arc. Also, the extremum curvature is only ∼1.4974, as compared to ∼3.8378 for the latter. The three corner shapes, and their curvatures versus fractional arc length (the total arc lengths are somewhat different), are compared in Fig. 6

                     Fig. 12
                      illustrates the influence of the λ and μ parameters on the corner curvature profile. If either parameter is reduced below the nominal value, the extremum curvature increases. If either is increased above the nominal value, the curvature profile assumes a bimodal configuration. These effects are more pronounced with variation of the μ parameter than with the λ parameter.

                      planar Pythagorean-hodograph curves have been presented. The simplest consists of a (unique) single PH quintic segment – in this case, the extremum curvature is relatively large, but the corner shape is nevertheless aesthetically quite attractive.

                      corners defined by a single PH curve of degree 7 comprise a one-parameter family, offering scope for adjustment of the curvature distribution. A nominal value for this parameter was identified, that generates an appealing corner shape with a smooth unimodal curvature distribution, and a modest extremum curvature. Finally, a

                      corner based on splicing together two PH quintics was proposed, with two free parameters for shape adjustment. Nominal values for the parameters were identified, and their influence on the curvature profile was studied.

                      corner constructions can be easily implemented using the complex representation of planar PH curve, and incur little more than the solutions of quadratic equations. It should be noted that sign ambiguities arise at various points in the solution procedure, and inappropriate choices can yield curves with unacceptable shape properties (negative curvature or tight loops) that nevertheless satisfy the specified boundary conditions. The appropriate signs, and ranges for the free parameters, are indicated throughout the presentation to ensure that such undesired extraneous solutions are circumvented.

                      corners in terms of PH curves offers several important advantages over “ordinary” polynomial or spline curves, including exact arc length measurement, rational offset curves, and the availability of real-time interpolator algorithms to drive CNC machines directly from the analytic curve description for manufacturing or inspection applications.
