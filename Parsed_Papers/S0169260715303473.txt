                  Background and objective
                  Cell migration, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis are the main processes in tissue regeneration. Mesenchymal Stem Cells have the potential to differentiate into many cell phenotypes such as tissue- or organ-specific cells to perform special functions. Experimental observations illustrate that differentiation and proliferation of these cells can be regulated according to internal forces induced within their Extracellular Matrix. The process of how exactly they interpret and transduce these signals is not well understood.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A previously developed three-dimensional (3D) computational model is here extended and employed to study how force-free substrates and force-induced substrate control cell differentiation and/or proliferation during the mechanosensing process. Consistent with experimental observations, it is assumed that cell internal deformation (a mechanical signal) in correlation with the cell maturation state directly triggers cell differentiation and/or proliferation. The Extracellular Matrix is modeled as Neo-Hookean hyperelastic material assuming that cells are cultured within 3D nonlinear hydrogels.
               
               
                  Results
                  In agreement with well-known experimental observations, the findings here indicate that within neurogenic (0.1–1kPa), chondrogenic (20–25kPa) and osteogenic (30–45kPa) substrates, Mesenchymal Stem Cells differentiation and proliferation can be precipitated by inducing the substrate with an internal force. Therefore, cells require a longer time to grow and maturate within force-free substrates than within force-induced substrates. In the instance of Mesenchymal Stem Cells differentiation into a compatible phenotype, the magnitude of the net traction force increases within chondrogenic and osteogenic substrates while it reduces within neurogenic substrates. This is consistent with experimental studies and numerical works recently published by the same authors. However, in all cases the magnitude of the net traction force considerably increases at the instant of cell proliferation because of cell–cell interaction.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The present model provides new perspectives to delineate the role of force-induced substrates in remotely controlling the cell fate during cell–matrix interaction, which open the door for new tissue regeneration methodologies.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The ability of Stem Cells (SCs) to differentiate into multiple cell types allows multiple tissues to be generated and reconstituted from a single cell source. Despite the advantages, the results may sometimes be disastrous if SCs differentiate at an inappropriate place and time or into undesirable phenotypes. This can lead to a pathological state or non-functional tissue construction. To avoid such abnormal conditions, cells have to be particularized in such a way as to differentiate or proliferate in response to appropriate biological stimuli.

Experiments have shown that, besides other factors [58,59], the mechanical structure of cellular micro-environments plays an important role in cell differentiation and proliferation [21,22,31,71]. For instance, Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) differentiate into specific phenotypes with high sensitivity to the tissue rigidity where they reside in. The mechanical interaction between a cell and its Extracellular Matrix (ECM) is considered symbiotic. Although cells are able to remodel their surrounding micro-environment, the mechanical structure and characteristics of their surroundings can also regulate intracellular signaling. This mutually dependent relationship between cells and their surrounding matrices is often referred to as dynamic reciprocity [13]. Consequently, besides other cell reactions [38,39,41], cells may respond to changes in their mechanical environment, such as changes in matrix rigidity, by undergoing differentiation and/or proliferation [13,43]. For instance, experiments have demonstrated that for soft matrices that resembling brain tissue (0.1–1kPa) SCs differentiate to neurogenic cells, for intermediate matrices that mimicking cartilage tissue (20–25kPa) they differentiate into chondrogenic cells, and comparatively hard matrices that mimic the tissue of collagenous bone (30–45kPa) they differentiate into osteogenic cells [13,26,40,56]. Although MSCs have demonstrated quicker differentiation and an increase in the proliferation rate when cultured on osteogenic substrates [40,42], mechanical forces induced into their micro-environment can actively accelerate these processes [34,35]. This has been attributed to protein anchorage densities and configurations which are proportional to substrate stiffness and rigidity [69]. However, the process of how exactly mechanical force regulates the MSC lineage specification is not well-known [40].

The findings of Kurpinski et al. [34] indicate that mechanical strain due to force inducement increases MSC proliferation and plays an important role in MSC differentiation. They show that the differential cellular responses to an anisotropic mechanical environment in a force-induced micro-environment have important implications in tissue engineering and remodeling due to alterations in the signaling pathway. In another study, the same group demonstrates that these mechanical stimulations play unique and important roles in the regulation of MSCs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In addition, they suggest that an accurate combination of micro-environmental cues may promote MSC differentiation [35].

Previous observations concerning cell differentiation and proliferation at the SC-material interface may assist to control a broader range of stem cell behaviors. Murphy et al. [52] have documented a series of diverse work reporting that inherent material properties, such as chemical functionality, adhesivity, binding affinity, nanostructure or degradability, can be engineered to dictate stem cell fate decisions due to dynamic micro-environment of the SC-material interface. In other words, materials can send signals to SC micro-environment by their nano-structural properties, such as surface topographies, and also receive signals from cells by means of molecular sequestering, as in the binding and unbinding of growth factors through material-associated ligands. Therefore, the cell fate and behavior can change due to this dynamical variation of cell-material adhesiveness, nano-structure, stiffness and ECM degradability. For instance, switching of degradable hydrogels into non-degradable ones demonstrates that cell-traction forces are crucial for osteogenic lineage specification of human MSCs in 3D substrates. Although, it is proved that substrate stiffness lead to stem cell differentiation [13,26], it is not yet well-known how extent “switching” material stiffness can trigger broad phenotypic changes, or how the rate of change in material stiffness can influence cell behavior. Therefore, emerging material-screening strategies may quickly improve our mechanistic knowledge about effects of distinct inherent material properties. Beyond the available investigations that considering the effect of elastic modulus on MSC differentiation, many experimental investigations reviewed by Murphy et al. [52] confirm that the inherent material properties, such as dynamic changes in stiffness and frequency-dependent stress responses, may also regulate the MSC lineage specification.

Among the wide range of biomaterials employed as cell substrate for in vitro investigations, hydrogels are a relevant option. These are composed of water-swollen networks of cross-linked polymer chains. While hydrogel stiffness depends on factors such as its concentration and cross-linking, due to its nonlinear behavior, the stiffness can be altered as a result of internal contractile forces exerted by cells or by another internal compressing and/or stretching forces exerted within it [1,2]. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to enhance the local stiffness of the hydrogel, including plastic compression [6], cross-linking techniques [3] and magnetic field alignment of collagen-based hydrogels [1]. A helpful alternative approach to remotely induce an internal force within hydrogels and to change their relative local stiffness is to incorporate magnetic nanoparticles within them. Inducing magnetic force on these magnetic nanoparticles causes compression and/or stretching of the hydrogel, leading to an increase in the bulk elastic modulus and the hydrogel rigidity.

Several numerical models have been developed for considering the general patterns of tissue reconstruction resulting from the external mechanical stimuli during fracture healing [9,10,20,30,32,36,37,66]. For example, Stops et al. [66] have considered cell differentiation and proliferation within a collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold subjected to mechanical strain and perfusive fluid flow. Kang et al. [30] developed a model for bone fracture healing based on the density of different cell phenotypes by coupling cell differentiation and proliferation to the magnitude and frequency of the mechanical stimuli. Although these models are useful to predict tissue repairing, they consider neither cell differentiation and/or proliferation due to the mechanosensing process during cell substrate interaction nor the nonlinearity of cell micro-environment. The dermal equivalent (DE) for skin tissue contains a dermis substitute of human fibroblasts which grow into a 3D collagen matrix. It is widely used in many processes such as fibroblast proliferation and migration, ECM matrix remodeling, wound healing response and skin grafting. Ramtani and Geiger [62] have specifically studied DE, in order to model its mechanical behavior under unconfined compression loading. To model the experimentally observed mechanical behavior of the DE, they employ an internal state variable approach which is implemented through finite deformation viscoelasticity. In their model, the parameters of the optimized material are identified according to the stated thermodynamic restriction. Their considered non-linear model assume incompressible, homogeneous and mechanically isotropic specimens in which the strain energy is decomposed into elastic and viscous terms simultaneously. The elastic component is expressed by Fung's exponential function including first and second deformation tensor invariants, which verifies stress-free initial state and convexity of the elastic potential conditions. The viscous strain energy is formulated as a function of two invariants, the deformation and the rate of deformation tensors. Their results indicate that both the strain rate and the time of culture are essential. Since under low strain rate, the DE responds elastically while under higher strain rate (0.1s−1), the viscous contribution is obvious and consequently the levels of stresses are notably increase.

A numerical model considering cell differentiation and proliferation based on the mechanosensing process within a force-free linear elastic substrate has been previously developed and presented by the present authors [47]. The main aim of the present work is to extend the previously presented model to include the effect of the nonlinearity of the hydrogel on cell differentiation and proliferation when an internal force is applied within the substrate.

Hydrogels are frequently used to study cell adhesion and responses to substrate stiffness. Since hydrogels become stiffer as they are strained, cell response strongly depends on the compression and tension loads applied in such substrates. This stiffening can be regulated by applying an internal force in the cell micro-environment to modulate and control its differentiation and proliferation [29,53,72]. A Neo-Hookean hyperelastic material model is here employed to model nonlinear behavior of hydrogel substrate materials undergoing deformations [15,63]. Sanabria-DeLong et al. have demonstrated that the proposed constitutive model is properly predict the nonlinear behavior of hydrogels for a wide range of stiffness [63]. Although in this model the stress-strain relationship is initially linear, at a certain threshold the stress-strain curve reaches a plateau. The strain energy density function for a compressible Neo-Hookean material in 3D can be expressed as [54]

Two main cellular elements regulate cell migration; active cellular elements, generated as a result of the overlap between actin filaments and myosin II, and passive cellular elements, arising due to the resistance of microtubules and the cell membrane. The former generates active contractile stress that mainly depends on the minimum, ϵ
                        min and the maximum, ϵ
                        max, cell internal strains, while the latter produces passive mechanical strength that is proportional to the passive cellular stiffness and the cell internal deformation. Therefore, by approximating each cellular element with a linear elastic spring, the net cell stress transmitted to the ECM can be calculated as [44,45,51]

Contraction of the actin–myosin apparatus drives forward the cell body due to the traction force generated by the cell. This force is proportional to the net stress transmitted by the cell to the substrate. Although the present model is applicable for any cell configuration [46,51], we assume a spherical configuration for the sake of simplicity. So, using discrete finite element methodology and representing the cell by a connected group of finite elements, the nodal traction force can be expressed as [44,50]

                         is the resultant of the nodal traction force for all the cell membrane, which means that both the traction force in the front of the cell and the adhesive force at the cell rear are taken into account.

On the other hand, the drag force resists cell motility [46,75]. The main objective here is to define a velocity-dependent opposing force associated with the viscous character of the substrate.

This is generated by actin polymerization, distinguished from the cytoskeletal contraction [75]. This causes cells to move along a directed random path following the effective signal. Therefore, the direction and magnitude of the protrusion force are chosen randomly at each time step. It is worth noting that the order of the protrusion force magnitude is the same as that of the traction force but with a lower amplitude [28,50,75]. So, it can be described as

Guided by experimental observations [41,70], it is considered that first the cell exerts sensing forces on the cell–substrate interface to diagnose its surrounding micro-environment. It is assumed that these forces act at each finite element node of the membrane towards the cell centroid. Therefore, the cell internal strain at each finite element node of the cell membrane can be written as

During mechano-sensing process the cell contracts itself by exerting sensing forces towards its centroid. Therefore, nodes with less internal deformation will have a higher stress and consequently higher traction force. So that, the resultant of the nodal traction forces will have the direction of minimum internal deformation. Accordingly, the resultant of the traction force and the random protrusion force presents the polarization direction of the cell, which is the opposite direction of drag force. So, the net cell polarization direction can be calculated using from Eq. (10) as

The resultant direction is in agreement with the work of He et al. [23] where they consider the cell polarization direction along the maximum principal stress in cell layer.

In reality cells inside a multicellular system do not preserve a spherical shape but deform so as to be tangent to each other during migration [57]. So, to avoid interference between two cells, a useful simplification here is to consider ||x
                        
                           ij
                        ||≥2r, where x
                        
                           ij
                         is a vector passing through the centroid of two cells i and j (see Fig. 1
                        ).


                        In vivo, the cell sends out pseudopods to sense its micro-environment. When two or more cells come into contact with each other, common vertices of the cells (for instance vertices n
                        1:n
                        4 in Fig. 1) engage each other so that the cell cannot send out any pseudopod in those vertices [5,67]. Therefore, in this condition, it is assumed that cells are not able to exert any sensing force at those common vertices. Although in such a situation the vertices in contact never play any role in the mechanosensing process, the nodal traction forces are not zero in those vertices [50,49].

Cells may respond to the mechanical properties of their ECM, such as substrate stiffness, by differentiation, proliferation and/or apoptosis [21,22,31,71]. Experiments demonstrate that a specific deformation range sensed by a cell leads to a specific differentiation [10,34,73]. This refers to distinguishing between their original tissue, the magnitude and duration of the mechanical signal received by the cell and the degree of preconditioning. Besides, experiments show that cell apoptosis may occur because of the deformation threshold which is durable for a typical cell [21,31]. Experimental observations by Kearney et al. [31] indicate that tensile strain induced on MSCs mediates cell apoptosis. For instance, the findings of Gladman et al. [21] indicate that, depending on the duration of the imposed strain, injury beyond 20% of the tensile cyclic strain leads to significant neuronal cell death.

Here, it is considered that MSCs are prone to differentiate into a certain cell type i, where i
                        ∈{s, c, l} represents lineage specifications of osteoblasts, s, chondrocytes, c, and neuroblasts, l. Mechano-regulation of differentiation is introduced in terms of cell internal deformation in the cell polarization direction. Deformation of each node located on the cell membrane in the cell polarization direction can be calculated as [47]

On the other hand, experimental observations illustrate that cell differentiation and proliferation are time-dependent [12,11,74]. For instance, it is well known that MSCs [12] and chondrocyte [74] need a certain time to become sufficiently mature to undergo differentiation or proliferation. Therefore, according to this argument, the cell differentiation and proliferation is linked also to a maturation time, the time that the cell needs to be active in the differentiation and/or proliferation stage [30,11]. This maturation period is different for every cell type and can be moderated via the mechanical signals received by a typical cell. Stronger mechanical signals (less internal deformation) decrease the cell maturation time, increasing the differentiation or proliferation rate. However, after cell culture, even within hydrogels that produce the strongest mechanical signals, cells need a minimum time period to start differentiation or proliferation [11]. Therefore, it is assumed that the cell maturation time is linearly proportional to the internal deformation as

                        MI=1 means that a typical cell is fully mature and is ready to differentiate or proliferate if it receives the appropriate mechanical signal. MI=0 indicates a young cell, which means that the cell is not yet able to start the differentiation or proliferation process, even in the presence of the appropriate mechanical stimulus. It is assumed that the evolution of cell MI is an irreversible process. Considering these conditions, the process of MSC differentiation and apoptosis can be related to mechanical signals and maturation as [30,47]

Cell proliferation is the process of generating two daughter cells from a single mother. It occurs in four defined steps comprising the first growth phase, the synthesis phase, the second growth phase and the mitosis phase, respectively [16,68]. During the first growth phase (G1) the cell synthesizes biological material in order to grow. Then the cell enters the synthesis phase (S) to replicate the sister chromatids. Afterwards, the second growth phase (G2) provides time for proofreading to ensure the DNA is properly replicated and packaged prior to cell division. Finally, cell division (cytokinesis) occurs and a mother cell is divided into two daughter cells in the mitosis phase (M). In this critical phase some cells may temporarily stop proliferation and enter into the quiescence state (G0) while others participate in the cycle of cell proliferation [16,68].

The main objective here is to model the proliferation process through a biologically proper environment. Therefore, it is assumed that there are no concerns about nutrients or oxygen shortage for the cells in culture. The dominant phases of cell division are modeled by splitting the cell proliferation cycle into two main steps. It is hypothesized that during the G1, S and G2 phases the cell grows and matures in such a way that if a fully mature cell receives an appropriate mechanical signal, one mature mother cell enters into the M phase and is divided into two non-mature daughter cells. Therefore, in the present model, the cell is either under maturation or in the proliferation phase as [47]

The present nonlinear constitutive model is implemented in the commercial Finite Element (FE) software ABAQUS [25] through a coupled user-defined element (UEL). The developed model is applied in several numerical examples to study cell differentiation and proliferation within force-free and force-induced substrates with different degrees of stiffness. It is assumed that the cell is located within a substrate with dimensions of 1000μm×500μm×500μm, far from the boundaries of the matrix in such a way that there is no effect of the boundary conditions on the cell behavior. To remotely exert an internal force within the substrate, it is assumed that magnetic nanoparticles are encapsulated in a hard sphere with the same cell's radius and embedded in the center of the substrate. The matrix is meshed by 128,000 regular hexahedral elements and 136,161 nodes. The calculation time is about one minute for each time step, corresponding to approximately 6 hr of real cell–matrix interaction [47]. Initially the cell is assumed to have a spherical shape. The properties of the matrix and the cell are enumerated in Table 1
                     .

@&#RESULTS@&#


                        In vivo, cells are continuously subjected to mechanical forces that, among other cues, are believed to control their growth and lineage specification. These mechanical forces, directly applied to the substrate, cause strain transfer into the cells through either focal adhesions or membrane. In vitro, there are several methods by which a force can be imposed within the cell substrate, such as encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles or using bioreactor systems [3,33,65]. Here, it is assumed that there are magnetic nanoparticles encapsulated within a rigid sphere located in the middle of the substrate. Initially, the substrate stiffness is set to lower bounds of neurogenic (0.1–1kPa), chondrogenic (20–25kPa) and osteogenic cells (30–45kPa) tissue stiffness [8]. Then, cell-cultured hydrogel is induced by a force in the longitudinal direction to increase the substrate rigidity. For example, Fig. 2
                         shows osteogenic substrate deformation due to an applied traction force of 5μN. As seen in Fig. 2a, the left and right hand sides of the rigid sphere undergo tensile and compressive deformations, respectively. Thus, pores in those regions are elongated in longitudinal and lateral directions, respectively, (Fig. 2b). Although in this situation the direction of the pores is different in the two regions, the pore density in both regions is the same [65]. Consequently, the cell behavior in both regions under compression or tension is identical since the cell feels the same rigidity as seen in Fig. 2c.

The present model is applied to study MSC proliferation and differentiation in a substrate with nonlinear behavior such as hydrogel. Fig. 3
                         represents the MSC response when it interacts with a nonlinear substrate within the range of osteogenic like tissue stiffness. Initially, it is assumed that a MSC is located near to a rigid sphere while no internal force is applied to the substrate. As the MSC maturates in a force-free osteogenic substrate, one mature mother MSC proliferates delivering two daughter cells in a non-mature state after ∼9.75 days (Fig. 3a). Subsequently, maturation of new mesenchymal daughter cells may be followed by differentiation or proliferation, depending on the mechanical signal, γ, received by the cells. Afterwards, initial MSC differentiation occurs after ∼20.25 days (Fig. 3b) and the process is followed by MSC differentiation and proliferation of both MSC and osteoblast (Fig. 3c). Likewise, as in the linear elastic model previously presented by the same authors [47], there is a sudden considerable jump in the average net traction force in the instance of MSC differentiation and proliferation (Fig. 5
                        ). This is qualitatively consistent with the observations of Fu et al. [18]. In the case of MSC differentiation, this is attributed to the quality of the ECM and the adhesion of a typical cell [76]. In the case of cell proliferation, this occurs due to cell–cell interaction which causes an asymmetric distribution of the internal cell deformation [47,49].

Here two different numerical examples are designed to study the lineage specification of MSCs in osteogenic substrates. To avoid repeating MSC proliferation, the results are represented starting from the instant of MSC differentiation. First, it is considered that the substrate stiffness is equal to the lower bound of osteogenic substrates (30kPa) [8] without inducing any internal force within the substrate. In order to study the effect of force-induced substrate, an internal force (5μN) is applied in the middle of the substrate in the longitudinal direction which increases the substrate local stiffness around a rigid sphere. The differentiation of MSCs into osteogenic phenotype for both cases is presented in Fig. 6
                        . During cell–substrate interaction, MSC is gradually maturated. Once it is completely mature (MI=1), it differentiates into osteoblast within force-free and force-induced substrates after ∼7.25 days and ∼5.75 days, respectively. MSC differentiation within a substrate with a stiffness resembling that of osteogenic tissue is observed in many experimental findings [13,14,26]. MSC differentiation into osteoblast is followed by osteoblast proliferation after ∼14.75 and ∼11.75 days in force-free and force-induced substrates, respectively. So, each new osteoblast may again proliferate into many osteoblasts when both the strength of the mechanical signal received by the cell and its maturation state are appropriate (see Fig. 6a and b). Comparing the density of each cell phenotype in Fig. 7
                         and taking into account the results in Fig. 6, it can be seen that MSC differentiation and proliferation of osteoblasts is accelerated within force-induced substrate. This is due to the decrease in the cell maturation time when the substrate is induced with an internal force (see also Fig. 4
                        ). The expedition of MSC differentiation into osteoblast within force-induced substrates is consistent with well known experiments [34,35]. It is worth noting that, as shown in the previous work of the same authors [47], in both cases MSC differentiation into osteoblast as well as osteoblast proliferation lead to an instant increase in the average magnitude of the net traction force (results are not shown here), consistent with the experimental findings of Fu et al. [18].

To study the fate decision of MSCs within force-free and force-induced chondrogenic substrates, two simulations are performed here. Again, to avoid the demonstration of the MSC proliferation process, the results are presented starting from the moment of MSC differentiation. The substrate stiffness is set to be the lower bound of chondrogenic tissue stiffness (20kPa) [8] and it is induced by a 3μN force in the longitudinal direction. MSC located near the rigid sphere is gradually maturated. Within force-free and force-induced chondrogenic substrates, completely mature MSC starts to differentiate into chondrocyte after ∼10.25 and ∼7.75 days, respectively. As seen in Fig. 8
                        , as the new cell phenotype is mature when the mechanical signal is appropriate, it proliferates into many chondrocytes. However, according to Figs. 7 and 8 the density of chondrocytes within the force-induced chondrogenic substrate (cell no.=8) is greater than the force-free one (cell no.=17). Our findings, consistent with experimental observations, indicate that differentiation and proliferation processes are accelerated within a force-induced chondrogenic substrate due to the increase in the matrix stiffness within the range of chondrogenic tissue stiffness [34,35]. This is due to the increase in the substrate rigidity and consequently a decrease in the cell maturation time [7] (Fig. 4). Furthermore, consistent with the observations of Fu et al. [18], MSC differentiation into chondrocyte produce a jump in magnitude of the net traction force. As a consequence of chondrocyte proliferation and its associated cell–cell interaction, the average magnitude of the net traction force increases (results are not shown here).

Experimental observations demonstrate that MSC culture within substrates resembling neurogenic tissue leads to neural precursor cells [13,24]. As in the previous examples, the results starting from the instant of cell differentiation are presented. MSC is located around a rigid sphere within a substrate with stiffness of the lower bound of neurogenic tissue (0.1kPa) [8] and then a 0.1μN force is applied in the longitudinal direction to increase the substrate local stiffness. The results of MSC differentiation and proliferation of neuroblasts are shown in Fig. 9
                        . When MSC is maturated, it differentiates into neuroblast within both force-free and force-induced substrates. However, as in previous numerical examples, differentiation is quicker in the case of force-induced neurogenic substrates (after ∼28.5 days and ∼25.5 days for force-free and force-induced substrates, respectively). The acceleration of MSC differentiation due to the increase in the substrate stiffness within relatively soft substrates is observed by Fu et al. [18] in the case of adipoblasts. MSC differentiation into neuroblast causes a decrease in the magnitude of the net traction force, which was observed in the previous experimental [18] and numerical [47] works. This is because, within a neurogenic substrate, MSCs are more contractile than neuroblasts. Afterwards, MSC differentiation is followed by proliferation of neuroblasts into several cells within force-free and force-induced substrates. As concluded from Figs. 7 and 9, within a force-induced substrate neuroblast density is higher, which means that its proliferation is quicker. This occurs because the stimulation of the substrate by an internal force increases the substrate rigidity and in turn advances the instant of cell maturation (see Fig. 4). In this case, as in the previous ones, the cell–cell interaction increases the average magnitude of the net traction force due to neuroblast proliferation (data are not presented here).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

MSCs are self-renewing and have significant potential to undergo lineage specification. Many studies [13,34,35,40] have been devoted to achieving a better understanding of the mechanisms which regulate the lineage specification of these cells. Recent experimental studies demonstrate that the mechanical properties of cell micro-environments and the stimulation of the micro-environment by an external force trigger many aspects of cell response such as differentiation and proliferation [13,40]. Although the precise mechanical pathway by which the cell micro-environment controls the cell differentiation and proliferation is not still well-known, various hypotheses have been proposed to clarify how mechanical signals regulate cell fate [10,40].

Recently, a 3D numerical model was developed by the same authors to study the influence of substrate stiffness on cell fate [47]. To acquire accurate control over cell differentiation and proliferation, the previous model is extended to investigate the effects of substrate induced internal force on cell fate. We believe that this is the first nonlinear numerical model to interpret existent knowledge of cell fate when the cellular micro-environment is induced by a substrate internal force.

In this study, we have investigated how 3D force-free and force-induced substrates affect cell proliferation and differentiation of MSCs. The results are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations [13,14,18,26,34,35,76]. We found that for a typical cell, cell internal deformation, which is developed through integrins during focal adhesions, is a key molecular mechanism in the mechanosensing process. Therefore, any change in the substrate rigidity due to a matrix induced internal force changes the cell internal deformation which in turn moderates the cell proliferation and differentiation [17,34]. This is why within a substrate stimulated by an internal force, cell differentiation and proliferation is accelerated [14,35]. In line with our previous work [47] and experimental observation [18], in the case of force-free and force-induced substrates, the net traction force generated by a typical cell may lead to a sudden increase (osteoblasts and chondrocytes) or decrease (neuroblast) in the moment of MSC differentiation. This sudden jump or drop in the net traction force may be due to the perfect alignment of stress fibers of the cell when the matrix and the cell stiffness are similar at the moment of MSC differentiation. Moreover, in all cases considered here, proliferation of a typical cell significantly increases the average net traction force. This is due to the cell–cell interaction which results in an asymmetric distribution of the traction force on the cell membrane, as discussed in [45]. In addition, the cell behavior in terms of cell differentiation or proliferation strongly depends on the cell maturation. Consistent with the observations of Her et al. [24], our findings illustrate that cells might need a longer time to become fully mature within force-free substrates (see Fig. 4) which is another reason for quicker cell fate achievement within force-induced substrates.

Altogether, the results obtained from the present model, in agreement with the previous experimental observations [14,18,34,35,76], show that internal force exerted within the cell micro-environment can play an outstanding role in remotely controlling the lineage specification of MSCs and cell proliferation, which open the door for new tissue regeneration methodologies. Although this 3D numerical model can successfully predict fundamental aspects of cell maturation, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis within nonlinear substrate, further investigations into physical and mechanical factors such as colony size and cell shape are essential for a better understanding of the precise mechanism behind cell fate decisions.
