@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

As an induction motor is extensively used, in addition to seeking high efficiency and energy conservation, how to enhance stability and safety becomes a key point. If the operational status can be monitored by effective equipment and repaired before the motor shows initial failure symptoms and serious damage [1,2], the system reliability can be enhanced, and maintenance costs after damage can be reduced. Since factory productivity will not be interrupted, this increases the economic benefit of the system.

In recent years, foreign and domestic experts and scholars studied detection methods for induction motor fault feature signals [3] and obtained many theoretical results and practical applications. According to experimental results, each detection method has certain identification characteristics [4]. If only one detection method is used, the cause of a failure often cannot be correctly diagnosed, and there may even be misrecognition. In order to increase the fault recognition rate to remedy the deficiencies of each detection method, this study uses vibration signal detection [5] and electrical signal detection [6] of the stator for measurement and analysis in order to implement complementary effects.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the system framework and signal processing of electrical and mechanical sensors are presented. In Section 3 the hardware circuit and graphic user interface of the motor condition monitor are introduced. Subsequently, in Section 4 the experimental results and validation are presented. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

A motor operating state monitoring system is constructed in this study, which uses a voltage sensor and current sensor to measure the three-phase voltage and current signal. The triaxial accelerometer measures the vibratory magnitude in x, y, and z directions, the self-made signal acquisition device transmits analog signals to the measuring system for real-time analysis processing and display, and then, the measuring system actively shows the spectrograms of various phases. Thus, the user can see the spectral distribution of the motor on a touch screen and further analyze and monitor motor health conditions. Fig. 1
                         shows the framework of this system.

Before the motor condition is measured, the signal passes through an analog low pass filter (LPF) for anti-aliasing filtering. Then, the signal is sent to the microcontroller for A/D conversion and digital filtering, and the signal is filtered again to guarantee the integrity of the signal. Finally, the Fast Discrete Fourier Transform is implemented for a clean signal, and the result is displayed on the touch screen, so that the user knows the current motor operating conditions. The process is shown in Fig. 2.
                        
                     

The output of the Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter is related to the previous output and input signals. Thus, the past output can influence the current output value, called a recursive filter. A unit impulse input's output response is an infinite sequence; thus, it is also known as an IIR filter [7–9]. The architecture is shown in Fig. 3.
                        
                     

An IIR filter can be expressed as the following nth-order difference equation:

If the difference equation of (1) is expanded, it is observed that the system output y[n] equals the linear combination of the current input x[n], the input delay signal x[n-i], and the output delay signal y[n-k] of the system, where the input delay signal is the previous input, and the output delay signal is the previous output. This study uses Matlab software to simulate the signature waveform of a digital filter, and the digital filter parameters are set according to the present system's required sampling frequency, shown in Fig. 4.

A triaxial accelerometer, made by PCB Piezotronics, is used to measure the vibratory magnitude of the motor, and the model number is 629A31. A miniature transformer is used as a voltage sensor, with optional withstand voltages of AC 110 V and AC 220 V, a wattage output of 4 W, and an output voltage of AC 6 V. The current sensor is made by Chauvin Arnoux, Model E3N, and the measurement range has two optional gears. The pictures are shown in Fig. 5.
                        
                     

The original signal, which contains equipment and circuit noises, is measured by sensors. The amplitude of the original signal is greater than the receptacle range of the microcontroller. Therefore, the signal cannot be sent directly to the microcontroller for analysis, as it must be processed. The signal processing circuits of the accelerometer, voltage sensor, and current sensor are introduced, as follows.

Due to the specification requirements of the triaxial accelerometer, a DC 24 V is supplied to the electronic circuit and a constant current diode is applied to provide fixed 4 mA current to the accelerometer. The accelerometer signal output passes through the voltage follower to remove the loading effect and enters the magnification circuit for the user to choose the appropriate magnification. A level increasing circuit is used to increase the voltage level. Finally, the 2-level filter filters the signal. The circuit architecture is shown in Fig. 6.
                           
                        

As the single-phase voltage of a motor is AC 220 V, the extracted electrical signals cannot be sent directly to the microcontroller. Therefore, a miniature transformer selects the AC 220 V joint option, which is reduced to AC 6 V. This self-made voltage step-down circuit is used for the secondary buck, and the signal is processed by appropriate level upgrading and an inverse circuit. The circuit architecture is shown in Fig. 7.
                           
                        

The current clamp meter has two optional magnifications. The first option is a peak at 100 mA∼10 A and the second option is a peak at 1 A∼100 A. The common ground for the two options is the relative maximum current output peak at DC 1 V, and the acceptable maximum voltage of the microcontroller is DC 3.3 V. Based on these characteristics, it is unnecessary to amplify or reduce the current signal of the current clamp meter, provided the measurement signal passes through the level increasing circuit, which converts the AC signal into a DC signal to be sent to the microcontroller for A/D conversion. The circuit architecture is shown in Fig. 8.
                           
                        

In this experiment the signals measured by an industrial computer are compared with the signals measured by the self-made measuring system, and the errors are recorded in order to validate the accuracy of this experiment. Finally, the measured data are transferred to the computer, which uses Matlab software, for another analysis to validate the accuracy of measuring system FFT, as shown in Fig. 9.
                        
                     

Five three-phase induction motors are prepared for this study. Specifications include the number of poles at 4 P, a rated output of 2 HP, a rated efficiency of 79.4%, a line frequency of 60 Hz, and a rated speed of 1720 rpm. Four types of faults are made based on the motors of the same specifications, including the turn-to-turn fault of a stator coil, rotor bar breaking, bearing outer race breakage, and eccentric misalignment. The turn-to-turn fault of the stator coil is made by destroying the insulation of the Phase A coil of the stator and the coils making contact with each other in order to short circuit the coil. As the turn-to-turn fault is very dangerous, for the consideration of safety, only one coil is short circuited for testing. As the rotor bar's breaking fault has the same fault feature at different breakage positions, there will be other characteristic frequencies unless other fault types are initiated. This experiment uses basic bar breaking, where two rotor bars are broken by manual drilling. The hole depth is about 3 cm, and the hole size is about 0.7 cm. In terms of the bearing fault, a common fault is outer race damage. Thus, the bearing's outer race, in this experiment, is a molten 1 cm hole by manual electric heating. In the experiment on misalignment eccentricity fault, the relative shift of the motor and loading equipment is made by tilting the test platform, and the inclination is measured by a level meter in order to create a misalignment fault. It inclines 0.05 cm to the Y-axis, as shown in Fig. 10.
                        
                     

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

The healthy motor data are used as the pattern for measuring the motor fault. The data of a healthy motor and a faulty motor are compared in order to remove the power supply harmonics and analyze the fault type by fault feature and equation. Fig. 11
                            shows the three-phase current spectrum of a healthy motor measured by an industrial computer. Fig. 12
                            shows the three-phase current spectrum of a healthy motor measured by a measuring system. It is observed that, in addition to the dominant frequency of 60 Hz, there are odd power supply harmonics, and this is the feature of a healthy motor. In future measurements of faulty motors, the odd power supply harmonics can be neglected, thus, increasing the accuracy of fault recognition. Figs. 13
                            and 14
                            show the vibration spectrum of a healthy motor measured by an industrial computer and a measuring system, which is the same as the current spectrum, and there are a few harmonics or noises. Table 1
                            compares the spectra of a healthy motor measured by an industrial computer and a measuring system. The results show that the error rates are lower than 10%.

As shown in Figs. 15–18
                           
                           
                           
                           , the current signal and vibration signal analysis results are almost identical to the features of a healthy motor. Thus, there is no obvious fault feature measured. It is noteworthy that there is a little signature waveform of the vibration spectrum from 600
 to 700 Hz. Thus, the feature cannot be validated by theorem derivation. According to literature, the shorted-turn fault can be judged according to the characteristic frequency of a double power supply frequency. However, as the fault feature is not obvious in the figure, the turn-to-turn fault is not severe enough, resulting in a slight difference in spectral amplitude. Table 2
                            shows the turn-to-turn fault spectra.

It is observed in Figs. 19–22
                           
                            that the current spectrum feature has relatively high amplitudes at about 54 and 66 Hz. According to literature, there is a characteristic frequency of a rotor bar breaking, compared with the feature spectrum of 54.336 and 65.664 Hz as calculated by industrial computer, and the feature of rotor bar breaking has been successfully judged. Figs. 21
                            and 22
                            show the vibration spectrum of a rotor bar breaking. It is observed that there are a few harmonics from 600 to 700 Hz, and as the other characteristic frequencies are slightly different from the data of a healthy motor, it means that the current signal is more apparent than a vibration signal when recognizing a rotor bar breaking fault. Table 3
                            shows the rotor bar breaking fault spectra.


                           Figs. 23–26
                           
                           
                           
                            show the current and vibration signal spectra of an industrial computer and a measuring system. Their comparison shows an obvious characteristic frequency at 540 Hz, with values of 72 mA and 71.29 mA, respectively, and an error rate of 1.35% in the permissible error range. The vibration spectrum has many characteristic frequencies from 600 to 700 Hz. There is a characteristic frequency conforming to the bearing outer race damage equation, meaning the fault feature is successfully measured. Table 4
                            shows the bearing outer race damage spectra of an industrial computer and a measuring system where the error rates are lower than 10%.


                           Figs. 27–30
                           
                           
                           
                            show the current and vibration spectra of an eccentricity fault measured by a measuring system, compared with an industrial computer, where the vibration spectrum error of eccentric misalignment fault feature is within 5%. The industrial computer and measuring system have the same characteristic frequencies in the current spectrum. Table 5
                            shows the eccentricity fault spectra comparison results.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A motor condition monitoring system, based on an ARM Cortex-M4 platform for online abnormality detection, is presented herein. The motor's operational signals, including three phase voltages, currents and 3-axis vibrations, are processed by the proposed circuit for noise cancellation and then are measured for digital processing and spectrum display for fault detection on a touch screen. Four major defects, including the shorted-turn of the stator, rotor bar breakage, bearing outer race and eccentricity, are tested to examine the feasibility of the proposed system. Through spectrum analysis, the characteristic frequencies under different defects show distinguishable patterns which can help users identify the possible types of defects in the motor. A sound motor only has the 3rd, 5th and 7th order harmonic frequencies and all have low amplitude that belongs to the general status for normal operation. The frequency spectrum of rotor bar breaking motors shows a side frequency besides the main frequency. The difference between side and main frequencies is related to the slip ratio. The turn-to-turn fault of motors is not easy to distinguish from the vibration spectrum, but can be identified from the current spectrum. On the contrary, the bearing damage and eccentricity fault of motors can be easily identified from the vibration spectrum which shows it much better than the current. Therefore, vibration detection is suitable for rotor faults, and electrical detection is better for stator defects. Comparing the experimental results to the commercial motor fault detection module shows that the proposed system can offer promising online spectrum analysis and malfunction detection.
