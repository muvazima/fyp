                  As input flows of secondary raw materials show high volatility and tend to behave in a chaotic way, the identification of the main drivers of the dynamic behavior of returns plays a crucial role. Based on a stylized production-recycling system consisting of a set of nonlinear difference equations, we explicitly derive parameter constellations where the system will or will not converge to its equilibrium. Using a constant elasticity of substitution production function, the model is then extended to enable coverage of real world situations. Using waste paper as a reference raw material, we empirically estimate the parameters of the system. By using these regression results, we are able to show that the equilibrium solution is a Lyapunov unstable saddle point. This implies that the system is sensitive on initial conditions that will hence impede the predictability of product returns. Small variations of production input proportions could however stabilize the whole system.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recycled materials are of increasing importance in modern production economies. Thus, from an economic and ecological point of view, the integration and control of such inputs in existing production systems is of considerable importance. The management of these product returns is a central element in reverse logistics tasks which attempts to cover the cost-efficient flow of raw materials or finished goods “from a point of consumption to the point of origin” (Rogers & Tibben-Lembke, 1998). The use of secondary materials is challenging in practice, due to the fact that product return rates are highly volatile over the course of time. An example can be seen in Fig. 1
                     , that depicts growth rates of the industrial collection of waste paper in Austria. As Norek (2002) points out, this variability of returns directly impacts production costs, and it is thus important at a “tactical level for procurement decisions, capacity planning and disposal management” (Toktay, van der Laan, & De Brito, 2004).

As a consequence, the lack of control of these inputs may make firms reluctant to expand their usage of secondary materials. Hence, the knowledge of the causes for this variability in product returns is crucial for managerial decision making. Nevertheless, as Norek (2002) points out, “returns management strategies may be the most neglected part of many supply chain practices”. By focusing on the waste paper industry as a reference industry, this article explicitly addresses the question of efficient product returns management and identifies the main drivers of the dynamic behavior of waste paper returns in a stylized production-recycling system. In such a system, production in one period causes return flow of products in another period. These returns can then be used for the production of new products in the following period.

The paper/carton board industry is one of the oldest industries making use of secondary raw materials. Its usage of waste paper in order to produce new paper or carton board is thus widespread. In contrast to other waste streams, the collection systems for waste paper are well-established in many European countries, the US and Asian countries. While recycling rates are constantly increasing (see for example European Recovered Paper Council, 2013), return streams continue to show high variability. This problem was already addressed by Pearce and Grace (1976), who analyzed various policies in order to stabilize secondary raw material markets.

In order to explain these fluctuations, we distinguish between exogenous and endogenous factors. While exogenous factors come from the model’s outside world, endogenous factors are inherent to the model itself. The most commonly mentioned exogenous factor for explaining waste paper quantities is the GDP. McCarthy and Lei (2010), for instance, use regression analysis to quantify the (positive) impact of a GDP increase on the available amount of waste paper. Again focusing on the waste paper industry, further factors such as the number of housing starts (Duckett, 1978), the index for industrial production (Turner & Grace, 1977), the unemployment rate (Li & Luo, 2008) or the degree of urbanization (Berglund, Söderholm, & Nielson, 2002; McCarthy & Lei, 2010) are all found to be influencing factors on the availability and/or the demand for waste paper.

Especially when the market for waste paper is analyzed from a macroeconomic point of view, it can be seen that fluctuations in the amount of available waste paper are heavily amplified by fluctuations in global trade. According to figures from the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI, 2012), China represents by far the biggest demand market for European and US waste paper. This may not simply be the result of China’s huge demand for raw materials, but may also be caused by China’s large surplus in the balance of trade. As more products are transported from China to European or US destinations than in the opposite direction, the transportation cost from Europe/US to China are much lower than from China to Europe/US (according to trade data from EUROSTAT, data on transportation cost from CEPALSTAT and evidence from the US market for waste paper from Forstall (2002)). In addition, the accessibility and availability of collection facilities, as well as consumers’ awareness of the importance of waste paper recycling, are both major factors in determining long-run collection rates and hence determining available amounts of waste paper.

The bullwhip effect, i.e. the tendency of a supply chain to develop increasingly large fluctuations of order and inventory quantities is a major source of supply chain inefficiency according to Yao and Zhu (2011). While the bullwhip effect is well-studied in forward supply chain management, there is still few literature on this in the context of closed-loop supply chains. With respect to forward supply chains, Lee, Padmanabhan, and Whang (2004) identify demand signal processing, order batching, fluctuating prices of products as well as rationing gaming to be the major sources for the occurrence of these fluctuations. Yao and Zhu (2011) then focus on the role of IT usage in dampening the bullwhip by using electronic linkages between buyers and sellers within a supply chain.

The present article focuses on the effect of variations of some structural parameters like the collection rate, production conditions or the landfilling rate on the variability of product returns. The framework for our analysis is a simplified production-recycling system, where returns are a function of past periods’ production. In contrast to the existing literature on the dynamic behavior of closed-loop supply chains, which mainly relies on simulations studies, we analyze the dynamics of product returns by using a system of nonlinear difference equations. This allows us to calculate an equilibrium point of the system in closed form. Using this system of difference equations, we are able to derive conditions for the system to convergence to its equilibrium or for chaotic behavior. In particular, the Lyapunov exponents allow us to gain insights into parameter constellations, where chaotic behavior can be expected. The comparison of two different production functions (linear and CES, i.e. constant elasticity of substitution) also yields insights on how the qualitative behavior of the system is influenced by various production conditions.

The analysis of a discrete dynamical system allows for the characterization of the qualitative properties of the system in closed form. This permits rigorous sensitivity analysis that does not rely on simulation studies. The results then enable us to derive managerial implications in order to develop strategies for effective reverse logistics decision making.

The present paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview on the existing related work, while Section 3 then describes the framework of our model. The production-recycling system is modeled as a discrete nonlinear dynamical system. Section 5 analyzes the qualitative properties of the system by using the theorems from Section 4.1. Sections 5.1 and 5.2 derive and discuss the insights gained from the two models for the effective management of product returns.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) is concerned with sustainability considerations in the forward as well as in the reverse chain (see for example Bloemhof-Ruwaard & Nunen, 2005; Gupta & Palsule-Desai, 2011), where the increase of product return quantities is considered to be a major goal of SSCM. While on the one hand, the usage of secondary materials in production processes is clearly desirable from an ecological point of view, the high variability of product returns over time also raises problems in managerial decision making. As a result, the dynamic behavior of closed-loop supply chains is attracting growing attention in both research and practice.

As chaotic behavior limits the predictability of product returns, it is crucial to know when a dynamic system may behave chaotically. The facilitating factors for chaotic behavior in supply chains were analyzed by Hwarng and Xie (2008) in a forward supply chain setup. The authors used the classical beer distribution model and quantified the system’s degree of chaos by calculating Lyapunov exponents.

Another research stream explains fluctuations that occur in both forward and closed-loop supply chains by the bullwhip effect. Zhou and Disney (2006) studied the reasons for the bullwhip phenomenon within a closed-loop supply chain in continuous time using control theory. The authors found that returned products can be used to reduce inventory variance and hence dampen the bullwhip. According to the authors, a closed-loop supply chain turned out to be more cost-efficient than a conventional forward supply chain. In contrast, analyzing the beer game using system dynamics, Huang and Liu (2008) found that the system’s tendency to show bullwhip like behavior is always greater in closed-loop supply chain than in a forward supply chains. This finding is also supported by Chatfield and Pritchard (2013), who conclude that supply chains with return quantities exhibit a larger bullwhip effect, using an agent-based simulation approach and seeing returns as negative order quantities. Adenso-Dìaz, Moreno, Gutiérrez, and Lozano (2012) then relativized these conflicting results by using a system dynamics approach in a similar setup as Huang and Liu (2008). They found that the bullwhip effect may be dampened or amplified by the level of the collection rate.

The literature on the value of information (see for example De Brito & van der Laan, 2009; Ketzenberg, 2009; Toyasaki, Wakolbinger, & Kettinger, 2013) also addressed the significant uncertainties regarding the timing and quantities of product returns and the role of information systems. Identifying various information scenarios can be used to formulate forecasting models specifically for reverse logistics (see Goh & Varaprasad, 1986; Kelle & Silver, 1989; Krupp, 1992; Srivastava & Srivastava, 2006; Toktay et al., 2004). These models assume product returns to be a function of past sales.

The impact of various policy scenarios, is analyzed by Vlachos, Georgiadis, and Iakovou (2007), who derive their results from a general system dynamics model of a closed-loop supply chain. Also using the system dynamics approach, Georgiadis (2013) specifically focused on issues concerning the paper industry.

Similar to Georgiadis (2013), in this paper we also focus on issues concerning the waste paper industry. In contrast to his system dynamics approach, our results do not rely on simulation studies. In order to derive explicit stability regions, the dynamics are investigated by means of a system of difference equations. In their article on the dynamics of a simple forward supply chain, Larsen, Morecroft, and Thomsen (1999) also investigated a system of difference equations. However, in contrast to our work, they considered a linear system without providing explicit stability regions. Hwarng and Xie (2008) studied the dynamics of a forward supply chain by means of a system of difference equations. In particular, they focused on the occurrence of chaotic behavior by calculating Lyapunov exponents. The managerial implications of chaotic behavior in forward supply chains are investigated from a management perspective by Wilding (1998) and Riggle and Madey (1997). In a linear closed-loop supply chain model with time-delay, Huang, Yan, and Qiu (2009) apply a control theory approach in order to deal with various uncertainties arising in closed-loop supply chain management. In contrast to our study, the authors analyze a linear model and focus on issues concerning the Chinese steel manufacturing industry.

Our production-recycling system is described by a set of first-order nonlinear difference equations. The equations describe the process of production, the demand for finished products and the demand for virgin materials. Finished products are assumed to enter a stock of products on the market, where a certain fraction of this stock is recycled each period. We formulate two models that are different with respect to the assumed production function. One model assumes a linear production function that allows us to calculate stability regions in closed form. The second model assumes a CES production function and relies on numerical analysis of stability regions. Using the CES production function, makes the model more flexible and hence the model’s ability to reflect real-world situations is increased.

The focal firm is assumed to use two production inputs exclusively: Virgin or primary materials, and returned or secondary materials. The production process is described by a linear production function of the following form:

In order to investigate the influence of the distribution of factor inputs and the elasticity of substitution between virgin and secondary materials, the linear production function from the previous section is replaced by the general constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function:

                      that summarizes the whole set of equations for each of the two models. Based on this difference equation, we calculate an equilibrium for each of them and then analyze the behavior of the systems in the proximity the equilibria.

To address the question whether the equilibrium is stable or unstable, the qualitative behavior of the system is analyzed in the proximity of the equilibrium solution. For this purpose Eq. (8) is linearized around its equilibrium (9). The eigenvalues of the characteristic equation can then be used to describe the qualitative properties of the system. The characteristic equation of the dynamical system can be obtained from replacing

The results obtained in the previous sections are now used to characterize the qualitative properties of the two models proposed and discuss the implications for managerial decision making. As there are many parameters involved in both models, we restrict our attention to various values of selected parameters, while the remaining parameters are assumed to take values as described in Table A.2 in Appendix A. The parameter values for the model with the linear production function are chosen prototypically and are independent of any particular industry. However, we use our model with the CES production function to explicitly discuss issues concerning volatility of waste paper returns. We therefore estimate the parameters of the CES production function using a real-world dataset.

                         to be positive. Hence, a positive equilibrium cannot be a repeller, i.e. unstable. Using Theorems 2 and 4, we are now able to calculate the explicit parameter ranges required for the equilibrium to be stable or being a saddle point. According to theorem (2) the positive equilibrium (9) is an attractor if and only if

                        , for a given 
                           
                              β
                           
                        , there is a range of values for the recycling rate 
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                        , where a stable solution can be expected. While Atasu, Van Wassenhove, and Sarvary (2009) derive optimal collection rates from a social planner’s optimization problem, our model contributes to the discussion on optimal collection rates by allowing for the calculation of ranges for collection rates that will stabilize product returns over time. Stable flows of product returns allow a recycler to adjust its capacity planning to a certain inflow quantity and hence allows for cost-efficient operation. A theoretical foundation for determining cost-effective collection rates can be found in Berglund (2003). For an exemplary landfilling rate of

                         in order to guarantee that the system remains stable. For the case of the waste paper industry, Villanueva and Eder (2011) discuss reasons for landfilling of waste paper. These include its usage as insulation material or its use in domestic coal. Thus, the use of waste paper for applications other than in the production of new paper is restricted when a certain collection rate is given, and when stability of the production-recycling system is to be guaranteed.

The calculation of explicit stability regions for the model using the CES production function is analogous to that of the model using the linear production function and is thus not discussed here. However, the regions for the equilibrium to be stable or to be a saddle point can easily be calculated numerically.

When applying the model with the CES production function to issues concerning the return volatility of waste paper, the parameters of the CES production function are estimated for a dataset from a large European carton board producing company. Since this company produces carton board by using waste paper and certain virgin materials (for example, wood pulp) in their production processes, the company faces a situation similar to that described in the model. Using this dataset on production and input quantities, we obtain the following regression results for Eq. (7):

Using these regression results and the parameter values from Table A.2, the regions of stability or the equilibrium to be a saddle point, are illustrated in Fig. 4
                        . As can be seen from Fig. 4, achieving a higher, stable recycling equilibrium may be difficult to realize in practice. First, the region for stability decreases when the collection rate 
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                         is increased. Second, it turns out that in our model, the elasticity of the equilibrium with respect to the recycling rate 
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                         is a convex decreasing function of 
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                         for almost all parameter constellations. This implies that augmented collection rates will, on the one hand, result in smaller increases in the equilibrium solution and, on the other hand, will move the equilibrium away from an area of stability. With a waste paper collection rate of 
                           
                              70.62

                         (see CEPI (2012)), the implied recycling equilibrium is a saddle point. Holding all other parameters constant, a decrease of the share parameter 
                           
                              δ

                        , the equilibrium would become stable. When

This model therefore sheds light on the political discussion concerning the ideal balance of primary and secondary fibers in the production of new paper or carton board (see for example Tiuri (1994)). While the sole usage of primary fibers may not be desirable from an ecological point of view, the sole usage of secondary resources would incur high collection costs.

In order to shed more light on the dynamic behavior of returns, we calculate the system’s Lyapunov exponents that quantify the system’s sensitivity on initial conditions. Here, we follow the common definition of chaotic behavior of a discrete dynamical system, as found for instance in Alligood et al. (1996). An orbit of a dynamical system is called chaotic, if the system is sensitive on initial conditions and not periodic. The Lyapunov exponents therefore indicate parameter constellations where chaotic behavior can be expected. Following Perron (1930) however, a positive Lyapunov exponent of a second-order nonlinear difference equation (using its first-order approximation) is not a sufficient condition for an orbit to be chaotic. Leonov and Kuznetsov (2007) carry this argument to the context of a discrete dynamical systems. Since Leonov and Kuznetsov (2007) point out that the Perron effect (i.e. stability with a positive Lyapunov exponent) is a special case that is only possible at the boundaries between stable and unstable regions, the Perron effect is neglected in the present paper. The occurrence of chaotic behavior limits the predictability of returns and thus impedes the efficient integration of returns in production processes.

As common to the literature, we calculate the Lyapunov exponents using a numerical procedure based on the well known Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization procedure (see for example Alligood et al. (1996)). As Eq. (8) is a second-order difference equation, we transform it into a system of two first-order difference equations by introducing a new variable

                         that determines the elasticity of substitution is a major driver for the system to behave chaotic. As the elasticity of substitution

                        , i.e. good substitutability between the production inputs. Using the regression results from Table 1
                        , we see that the current situation of this focal firm lies in the region with a positive largest Lyapunov exponent, i.e. a Lyapunov unstable region. In this point the system shows sensitivity on initial conditions, that will impede the predictability of future return quantities.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

In this article we presented two models describing a simple production-recycling system by using a set of nonlinear difference equations. The model that uses a linear production function, allowed for the derivation of the stability and saddle point region in closed form. The second model that assumes CES production, does not allow for closed form stability region, but produces more complex, yet realistic solutions and therefore can be adjusted to real world situations much better.

Our model using the linear production function contributes to the discussion on efficient collection rates of secondary materials when stabilizing return quantities are targeted. This model enables us to explicitly calculate ranges for the collection rate that result in a stable equilibrium.

The estimation of the parameters of the model assuming CES production allows us to adapt the model to a setting prevalent in the waste paper industry. Using these regression results, we are able to show that the recycling equilibrium for this model currently is a saddle point that is Lyapunov unstable. This implies that the system in the current situation reacts sensitive on initial conditions. However, even small variations of the parameter that determines the usage of secondary or primary fibers in production could stabilize the whole system. Additionally, an increase in the elasticity of substitution between the production inputs generally causes a rise of the largest Lyapunov coefficient and hence will facilitate chaotic behavior of return flows. On the one hand, sensitivity analysis indicated that the system’s area of positive largest Lyapunov coefficients will increase when the factor productivity is increased. On the other hand, increasing the equilibrium value requires an over-proportional increase of the collection rate, and thus decreases the system’s area of stability.

Models of this kind could be extended in several ways: By including additional firms that compete in buying the secondary raw materials, the model could become even more realistic. As the usage of secondary materials by a relatively large number of companies leads to fiercer competition in acquiring such materials, non-cooperative game theory in combination with the analysis of dynamical systems would be an eminently suited method to address these issues. This can be observed in the paper and carton board industry, where many companies intensively use waste paper as a production input. Another possible extension would be to introduce multiple products of a focal firm and compare the qualitative behavior of product returns assuming different rates of secondary material usage for each of the products.

Thus, the stability conditions for A and B in (ii) are derived from the inequalities on the right-hand side in (B.1) and (B.2). Solving these yields
