                  This research studies the performance of circular unidirectional chaining – a “lean” configuration of lateral inventory sharing among retailers or warehouses – and compares its performance to that of no pooling and complete pooling in terms of expected costs and optimal order quantities. Each retailer faces uncertain demand, and we wish to minimize procurement, shortage and transshipment costs. In a circular unidirectional chain all retailers are connected in a closed loop, so that each retailer can cooperate with exactly two others as follows: receive units (if needed⧹available) from the left “neighbor” and send units (if needed⧹available) to the right, and a retailer who receives units from one neighbor is not allowed to send any units to its other neighbor. If the chain consists of at least three nodes and demands across nodes are i.i.d., its performance turns out to be independent of the number of nodes. The optimal stocking is therefore solved analytically. Analytical comparative statics with respect to cost parameters and demand distributions are provided. We also examine thoroughly the cases of uniform demand distribution (analytically) and normal demand distribution (numerically). In the uniform case with free transshipment, a unidirectional chain can save up to 1/3 of the expected cost of separate newsvendors caused by uncertainty. For three nodes, the advantage of complete pooling over unidirectional chaining does not exceed 19%.

                     Horizontal Inventory pooling is a powerful cost reducing tool in supply chain management (Eppen, 1979). Horizontal pooling is performed among retailers or warehouses located at the same echelon of a centrally-managed

                      supply chain, in which each retailer faces uncertain demand. The purpose of the current study is to provide an extended analysis of limited pooling of inventory through a circular unidirectional chain. We also compare the performance of the circular unidirectional chain to that of other (extreme) configurations of inventory sharing.

Throughout the study we focus on a single-period problem, a setting appropriate for perishable products, products with seasonal demand and products with long lead times. We conduct virtual inventory pooling, often referred to as lateral transshipments in the literature. At the beginning of the period, and before actual demand is revealed, each location (viewed in this work as a node in a graph) places and (instantaneously) receives an order from the upper level in the supply chain. After demand at each node is observed and satisfied locally to the extent possible, units are transferred (instantaneously) from nodes with excess inventory to nodes with excess demand. Lateral transshipments thus serve as emergency supply sources. Each item transshipped between two locations saves a unit shortage cost, but incurs a unit transshipment cost. The problem of determining the optimal replenishment and transshipment quantities has been widely addressed in the literature (e.g., Krishnan & Rao, 1965; Tagaras, 1989). An extensive review on the topic of lateral transshipments is available in Paterson, Kiesmüller, Teunter, and Glazebrook (2011).

If one wishes to pool inventories, he must decide on the sharing configuration of the system. That is, for every node, we need to define the nodes it can cooperate with. A directed link between two nodes represents their possibility to share inventory unidirectionally (thus, two links are required so that both nodes can send to and receive from each other). We assume that the unit production (procurement), shortage and transshipment costs are identical across nodes. Our main purpose is comparing the performances of different inventory sharing configurations and obtaining general insights into the solution properties rather than developing ways to solve (large) instances of a particular configuration. We thus find it useful to consider symmetric configurations with i.i.d. demands. Additionally, if demands are not i.i.d., there is no analytical solution for the sharing policies in question. Consequently, in most of the parts of this study, unless explicitly stated, we assume that demands at all nodes are i.i.d. However, later we computationally analyze a system with different demand distributions as well.

There are two extreme inventory sharing configurations. The first is no inventory pooling (NP), in which each location operates alone. No transshipment is performed in such a system. The other extreme configuration is complete inventory pooling (CP), where each retailer is allowed to share inventory with all others (bidirectionally), with no limitations but often at transshipment costs (usually, simply referred to as “pooling”). It has been shown that when the pooled system is managed optimally, inventory pooling always reduces the expected cost of the system (e.g., Eppen, 1979; Gerchak & He, 2003) because the aggregate inventory problem constitutes a relaxation of the collection of separate inventory problems. Moreover, pooling could be beneficial even at the presence of transshipment cost (e.g., Krishnan & Rao, 1965).

From the pooling perspective, complete pooling is clearly the most effective arrangement (Tagaras, 1989). However, complete pooling has three main drawbacks. First, it requires constructing and maintaining many links between the nodes. The existence of each link may be associated with a (high) fixed cost, which is independent of the amount transshipped along the link. This cost (referred to as the “establishment cost” henceforth) is incurred for establishing and maintaining the infrastructure that would allow inventory sharing between a pair of nodes. In particular, the fixed cost usually consists of (but is not limited to) the cost of drivers, trucks, fixed payments to a third party for delivery, information systems, any kind of administration associated with pooling, etc. Second, systems under complete pooling tend to have high computational complexity, especially if a variable transshipment cost is present. The third reason concerns multi-period systems (a possible extension of our setting). From a practical standpoint, complete pooling may be difficult to operate despite its theoretical effectiveness. In complete pooling, the actual links selected for transshipment may vary from one period to another (according to the demand realization) – possibly confusing for the retailers. In this paper we present a simpler approach with fewer possibilities of selecting the “from-to” pairs of nodes.

One moderate sharing configuration which constitutes partial inventory pooling and requires far fewer links is a circular unidirectional chain. This configuration has been found to be very effective in reducing shortage costs in inventory systems (e.g., a recent study by Lien, Iravani, Smilowitz, & Tzur, 2011) and capturing much of the benefits of total flexibility in a manufacturing environment (e.g., Jordan & Graves, 1995). We define a “circular unidirectional chain” as a configuration where all retailers are connected unidirectionally in a closed loop, such that each retailer cooperates with two other retailers (the neighboring nodes). Items may be sent to only one neighboring node, and may be received only from the other neighboring node. In our chaining setting, a node which receives units due to a shortage is not allowed to further transfer units to other nodes. As such, our rules of chaining are more restrictive than in previous transshipment literature (e.g., Lien et al., 2011). Note that the issue of which node will actually transship to which does not arise here, as the symmetric shortage and transshipment costs do not affect transshipment decisions. From a practical point of view, such policy is much simpler to operate.

Ignoring the costs of establishing links and of transshipment, circular unidirectional chaining with no-pooling level inventories is clearly superior to no-pooling for any demand realization (and thus in expectation). That is also true when the chain and the system without pooling use their respective optimal quantities. Further, circular unidirectional chaining, even if it orders optimally, is clearly inferior to complete pooling in terms of expected costs. The extent of this gap is an issue explored here.

Our research is thus motivated by the tradeoff between the possible benefits of consolidation of demands and the high (and certain) establishing cost of each link, as well as the high computational complexity associated with complete pooling at the presence of transshipment costs. We aim to determine whether a restrictive and “minimalistic” circular unidirectional chaining configuration is effective enough in reducing shortages. Bidirectional chaining, although more effective than unidirectional, is considerably more complex to manage and optimize (Kalikhman, 2011). Although we do not explicitly consider the savings achieved by pooling versus the establishment cost, this fixed cost could easily be incorporated at the end. If one has information about the establishment cost of each link and the cost of no pooling, he can easily obtain the net savings from creating a circular unidirectional chain, and compare the cost of a circular unidirectional chain to that of complete pooling when both systems include the corresponding establishment cost, according to the number of links in each.

An issue of independent interest is the relative magnitudes of the optimal order quantities in different sharing policies. It is not obvious that the optimal order quantity always decreases with inventory pooling (e.g., Gerchak & Mossman, 1992; Yang & Schrage, 2009).

The paper makes two main contributions: first, it provides an extended analytical approach to circular unidirectional chaining, including the optimality condition, and offers various insights on this sharing configuration, which, besides being very lean and economical in terms of the number of links, is easier to solve than complete pooling with positive unit transshipment cost (see Section 2). Further, circular unidirectional chaining can serve as an approximation of complete pooling in terms of expected costs. Such approximation is easier to compute than exact expected cost of complete pooling, primarily because it is lean. We find combinations of the problem parameters for which the approximation is good (i.e., the unidirectional chain is close to complete pooling), as well as those for which it is not. Note that a symmetric system is of interest, since it serves as an approximation of symmetric complete pooling. Also, a symmetric system allows exploring the effect of number of retailers, without a need to define their order along the chain.

A recent work by Lien et al. (2011) has shown that a configuration of chaining (either uni or bi-directional) with the requirement that each retailer uses its own units for transshipment (but is allowed to receive units at the same time), is superior to other configurations suggested in the literature, such as grouping configurations. Unlike Lien et al. (2011), who focus on the design of transshipment networks and assume that the order-up-to level can be found by using an infinitesimal perturbation analysis procedure suggested by Herer, Tzur, and Yucesan (2006), we provide an analytical study of circular unidirectional chaining, including the optimality condition and comparative statics for the case of general demand distribution, and show that our model of unidirectional chaining can be viewed as an extension of the multi-location newsvendor model. Further, we provide a comparison between the policy of unidirectional chaining and those of no pooling and complete pooling (which were not included in the study of Lien et al. (2011)). Moreover, Lien et al. (2011) make transshipment decisions before satisfying demand locally.

Another relevant study is that of Kranenburg and van Houtum (2009), who investigated an inventory system where only some of the locations are allowed to serve as sources of lateral transshipments, while receiving items is allowed by all locations. The base-stock levels are found through a greedy heuristic, and it is shown numerically that such partial pooling achieves much of the benefits of complete pooling. This study differs from ours both by the configuration and by the solution approach. Other researchers also studied the transshipment problem with partial pooling. Axsäter (2003) and Olsson (2010) addressed unidirectional linear transshipments in a supply chain, a problem which can also be regarded as unidirectional product substitution. Note that in a linear chain the nodes at the “ends” are treated differently than the others. These two works are to be contrasted with ours. First, in our setting, a closed loop is created. Additionally, in the setting of Axsäter (2003), it is allowed to transfer items between two warehouses which are not neighbors, through intermediate warehouses. That is not allowed in our setting. Further, unlike Axsäter (2003) and Olsson (2010) who consider continuous review models, we study a periodic review system. Finally, Axsäter (2003) and Olsson (2010) attempt evaluating the transshipments in a unidirectional system, and their approaches are extensions of the well-known “order-up-to S” and (R,
                     Q) models. We provide an exact analytical investigation of a unidirectional chain under the restrictions stated above.

Our chaining policy was inspired by the work of Jordan and Graves (1995), who examined the benefits of limited manufacturing flexibility. They showed that a chaining configuration captures most of the potential benefits of total flexibility, with far fewer links. Later, on the basis of their work, Graves and Tomlin (2003) also found the chaining configuration to be very efficient in a multistage supply chain.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the main existing results on NP and CP, and then builds the model of circular unidirectional chaining (UDC) for general demand distribution. In Section 3, analytical comparative statics and other insights on the general case are provided. Section 4 provides a detailed analytical illustration of the model with uniform demand distributions, and Section 5 presents the results of a numerical study with normal demand distributions and offers additional insights. Section 6 concludes the paper and proposes some topics for a future research.

Before formulating the UDC model, we shall summarize the main existing results on no pooling and complete pooling. In the no-pooling setting, each node (retailer⧹warehouse) faces a separate newsvendor problem. Consider a symmetric system of n separate nodes, and let q be the quantity ordered by each node.

Now, consider a symmetric system of n nodes, which operates under complete pooling. The symmetry implies that there is no importance for choosing the “from-to” flows. Complete pooling is often viewed as a single location facing the aggregate demand of all nodes (denoted by

                        where the first term is the procurement⧹production cost, the second term reflects the expected shortage cost, and the third term represents the expected transshipment cost. One can see that (4) is not proportional to the number of nodes. In addition, (4) is not easy to compute, especially for large n’s. Maintaining a unidirectional chain appears to be much easier (see Section 2.2). If the total quantity of CP is equally divided among the nodes, then the expected cost per node is decreasing

It is interesting to consider the case of free transshipment, as such is often the case (t is typically considerably lower than c, and sometimes, especially for small items, the unit transshipment cost is negligible). Additionally, the case where t
                        =0 has a closed-form optimal solution. If t
                        =0, the optimal quantity of the aggregate system is:

                        which serves as a limit of the optimal quantity as t tends to zero. That is useful when unit transshipment cost is negligible, which is often the case with small items.

We shall now formulate the model of circular unidirectional chaining with i.i.d. demands. Consider a unidirectional chain with n nodes. Since all nodes are connected in a closed loop, we define the predecessor of node 1 as node n. The symmetry of the problem and its convexity (will be shown later) imply that before demand is realized, all nodes order the same quantity, denoted by q. The proof found in Appendix A for the CP case can be easily modified to fit a UDC setting.

In addition to the basic notation defined in Section 2.1, let U
                        
                           UDC
                         be a random variable representing the system-wide shortage in the system after transshipment is performed, and let U
                        
                           i
                         be a random variable representing the shortage at an arbitrary node i after transshipment is performed. Let T
                        
                           i−1,i
                         be the amount transshipped uni-directionally from node i
                        −1 to node i, and let T
                        
                           UDC
                         denote the total amount transshipped along the chain. The expected system-wide cost is:

If node i has shortage, there will still be shortage there after transshipment in the following cases: (a) Node i
                        −1 has no surplus after satisfying its own demand. In this case, the shortage at node i is (X

                        −
                        q)+, and (b) node i
                        −1 has surplus after satisfying its own demand, but the surplus at node i
                        −1 is smaller than the shortage at node i. In this case shortage at node i is (X

We note that the expression for the underage at node i, as well as the amount transshipped from node i
                        −1 to node i, can be found by considering only two adjacent nodes (i
                        −1 and i) at a time. This is also the case when taking the expectation over all realizations. The expected underage at node i is:

In the case of general demand distribution, the support is restricted to [0,∞) since demand cannot be negative. Eq. (6) can be easily specialized to other supports (e.g., see the case of uniform demand distribution in Section 4). In Section 5, we consider a normal demand distribution and ensure that the probability of negative demand is negligible.

By further calculations, we simplify (6) as follows:

From (7) and (9), one can see that the expected underage that remains at node i after transshipment equals the difference between the expected underage before transshipment and the expected amount received by node i, which makes an intuitive sense.

Since all cost functions in UDC are proportional to n (see Eq. (5)), we will focus on the cost per node rather than on the total cost. By substituting (7) and (9) into (5), the expected CPN equals:

                        t) is the net saving per transshipped item. Hence, the expression in Eq. (10) is intuitive: the expected cost per node in a UDC is the sum of the procurement cost and the expected shortage cost, minus the net expected savings resulting from enabling transshipments (last term in Eq. (10)). From (2), (7) and (9), we immediately have the following intuitive observation:
                           Observation 1
                           For any given q, the expected CPN in a circular unidirectional chain is lower by (b
                              −
                              t)E[T
                              
                                 i−1,
                                 i
                              ] than the expected CPN in a system with no inventory pooling.

Since in the UDC the expected cost per node is independent of the number of nodes (for any n
                        ⩾3), we have the following observation:
                           Observation 2
                           For n
                              ⩾3, adding a node to a unidirectional chain constitutes no improvement on the performance of the chain.

Consequently, the advantage of UDC over NP (in terms of optimal expected costs) is independent of n, and the advantage of CP over UDC (for n
                        ⩾3) is increasing in n.

By differentiating the expected CPN expression with respect to q, we obtain:

                        so the expected CPN is convex, which implies convexity of the expected system-wide cost. A global (unique) minimum thus exists. Convexity also follows from our setting being a special case of Herer et al. (2006) who proved convexity for the general setting (but our proof is much simpler). Further, it can be shown that since b
                        >
                        c then q
                        =0 is not optimal, and neither is q
                        =∞. The practical meaning of q
                        =0 not being optimal is, that even when transshipment cost exists, some production is beneficial.

Equating (11) to zero, the key optimality condition can be written as:

                        so the three cost parameters influence the solution through only two ratios, t/b and c/b. Note that the right-hand-side of the optimality condition is the same as in the basic newsvendor problem. Moreover, if t
                        =
                        b (which means that pooling constitutes no advantage), Eq. (12) reduces to the optimality condition of a basic newsvendor model. Note that (12) can be rewritten as follows:

                        F(q) is the probability of a single node not being short. The term [F(q)]2 is the probability of both nodes not being short. The integral term reflects the probability of one node being short, but not the other, so that the shortage can be covered by the surplus of its neighbor. Overall, {•} reflects the probability of a single node not remaining short after transshipment. (b

                        t) is the net saving from transshipping a single item, and t can be regarded as a “saving” when no transshipment is needed. Hence, the left-hand-side (LHS) of (12) and (12′) represents the probability of a node not remaining short, similarly to the LHS of the optimality condition in a basic newsvendor model.

Having presented the optimality condition, we proceed by studying the properties of the optimal quantity per node of UDC. The results provided in the current section contribute to the understanding of the behavior of UDC. Given that there is no closed-form solution for the case of general demand distribution, these results are of interest. Whenever the notation q

                           Step (1) is true since F is increasing. Steps (2) and (3) are true since F
                           ⩽1. The last expression is clearly positive, implying that dq
                           ∗/db
                           >0, which makes an intuitive sense.□


                     Propositions 1 and 2 imply that q
                     ∗ is increasing in the critical cost ratio and reflect basic properties of a UDC, which are known to hold in the two extreme configurations as well. Hence, the comparative statics of the intermediate configuration (UDC) are similar to those of NP and CP. From a managerial standpoint, Propositions 1 and 2 enable a manager evaluate the direction of change in the optimal stock levels when either c, b, or both of them have changed.
                        Proposition 3
                        
                           The optimal quantity per node of UDC may increase or decrease in the unit transshipment cost.

The denominator of (14) is clearly positive, while the sign of the numerator (which contains no bor t), can be either positive or negative.

When selecting the order quantity, the option of transshipments is taken into account. Since a higher unit transshipment cost results in less transshipment across the system, one would actually expect

                                       UDC

                            to increase with t. However, the effect of increasing t is twofold: on the one hand, if a node faces shortage, it tends to rely on itself rather than on receiving units from its predecessor and thus to order more; on the other hand, if a node faces overage, knowing that its successor would rely mainly on itself, it would send him a smaller amount, and thus it tends to order less. Hence, the sign of

                            is not straightforward.□

In order to illustrate the results derived in Section 2 and to obtain some numerical results without running a simulation, we will now consider a case of uniformly distributed demands. Throughout this section, we assume t
                     =0 (a case of interest, as stated in Section 2). First, we discuss the structure of UDC with demands being distributed on [μ
                     −
                     k,
                     μ
                     +
                     k], 0<
                     k
                     ⩽
                     μ, and subsequently we compare this UDC with NP.
                        6
                        In order to obtain numerical values, an assumption on μ and k is necessary at the end of this comparison.
                     
                     
                        6
                      Then, for simplicity, we restrict our discussion to the case n
                     =3 and μ
                     =
                     k
                     =0.5, and compare UDC with CP.

                     , so the optimal expected CPN is increasing (linearly) in μ. A managerial insight that could be drawn from this fact is that a change in the value of μ will always affect the per node optimal quantity, as well as the optimal expected CPN. Moreover, for c/b
                     <0.5, the marginal increase⧹reduction in the objective values is constant, regardless of the initial value of μ. Note that for c/b

                     >
                     c), so the optimal expected CPN is strictly increasing in k. A constant change in demand variability will result in a constant change in the optimal expected CPN (and in the optimal order quantity, too), regardless of the initial variability of demand.

Here again, further analysis depends on whether c/b is larger than 0.5. If indeed c/b
                     >0.5, then using first-order conditions we obtain the unconstrained minimizer:

Note that for c/b
                     <0.5, (17) is smaller than (22), which implies that the unidirectional chain will keep a lower level of physical stock than the system with separate retailers. This is to be contrasted with the case c/b
                     >0.5, in which (20) is larger than (22), implying that the chain will keep a higher level of physical stock.

The optimal expected cost per node in a system with no inventory pooling is obtained by specializing Eq. (2) to the uniform case and substituting (22) into (2):

To obtain a unitless measure, we consider the ratio of the optimal expected CPN of UDC to the optimal expected CPN of NP. Note that the expected CPN can never drop below cμ. The cost per node caused by uncertainty is referred to as the Controllable Cost Per Node (CCPN). The expected gross CPN (denoted by GCPN) can thus be written as a sum of the expected controllable and uncontrollable costs: E[GCPN](q)≡
                     E[CCPN](q)+
                     cμ. Since the term cμ is common both in NP and UDC, what mainly interests us is how much of the controllable costs of NP can be saved by UDC. Let α
                     
                        UDC,NP
                      denote the ratio of the optimal expected CCPN of unidirectional chaining to that of no pooling. It represents the saving from creating a UDC instead of operating under no pooling, assuming each system orders optimally. For c/b
                     <0.5, we have:

                     while the ratio in the region c/b
                     <0.5 (given by Eq. (23)) will not be affected.


                     Fig. 1
                      illustrates the behavior of (23) for c/b
                     <0.5 and (24) for c/b
                     >0.5. The ratio α
                     
                        UDC,NP
                      is continuous for all 0<
                     c/b
                     ⩽1, and is decreasing and convex in c/b for c/b
                     <0.5, and is increasing and convex in c/b for c/b
                     >0.5.

The function α
                     
                        UDC,NP
                      thus attains a global minimum at c/b
                     =0.5, which means that the highest advantage of UDC over NP is achieved when the penalty cost plus the net profit loss from missing a sale equals the unit procurement cost (b
                     −
                     c
                     =
                     c). This is a case where UDC saves 1/3 of the expected controllable costs per node of NP. Note that the ratio is flat around the minimum. For very large values of c/b, it does not matter much how the systems stocks (due to the indifference between surplus and shortage), so the advantage of inventory pooling is lower than for moderate values of c/b. The behavior at the other boundary is explained by the fact that if production⧹procurement cost is very low relatively to shortage cost, both configurations will not rely much on transshipment and will order high quantities, so the benefit of pooling declines.

We shall now compare UDC with CP in terms of expected costs and optimal quantities. Since in CP the system-wide costs are not proportional to n, we compare the system-wide expected controllable costs in both systems. For simplicity, let us focus on the case n
                     =3 and μ
                     =
                     k
                     =0.5. Due to the independence of demands across nodes, the optimal quantity of CP is determined by the convolution of demands. Let Y

                     Fig. 2
                      illustrates the behavior of (27). The ratio α
                     
                        CP,UDC
                      is continuous for all 0<
                     c/b
                     ⩽1. Note the symmetry with respect to c/b
                     =0.5. The highest advantage of CP over UDC is attained approximately at c/b
                     =0.25 and c/b
                     =0.75 (with α
                     min
                     =0.81). This means that CP can save at most 19% of the expected cost of UDC caused by uncertainty. The ratio is very flat in the region 1/6<
                     c/b
                     <5/6 (the gradient is effectively zero). Hence, for the region 1/6<
                     c/b
                     <5/6 the ratio is independent of c/b. The behavior of the ratio is similar to that of α
                     
                        UDC,NP
                      – a relatively high advantage of pooling for intermediate values of c/b, and low advantage at the extremes. As c/b
                     →1−, it becomes less important how one stocks. As c/b
                     →0+, each node tends to rely on itself rather than on other nodes, so there will be few transshipment, and pooling will have a limited benefit (in particular, CP will have little advantage over UDC). Similar behavior is observed under normal demand distribution (see Section 5, Fig. 5b). For a system with more than 3 nodes, we expect the gap between CP and UDC to increase, because when n increases, the performance per node of CP improves, while the performance per node of UDC keeps constant.

Lastly, let us briefly discuss the relative magnitude of the optimal quantities. For the region 0⩽

In this section, we provide additional insights obtained by investigating the case of normal demand distributions. Although we have found the optimality condition for a general demand distribution in unidirectional chaining, we have no closed-form solution for the normal case, so the following numerical study, with a non-negligible transshipment cost, is conducted.

We consider the case where each system orders optimally, and examine the impact of problem parameters both on the optimal quantities and the expected costs, thus presenting an extensive picture. First, the per node optimal quantity of each policy is found (for each combination of the problem parameters studied): for no pooling, it is computed by

We address both the case of i.i.d demands and the case of independent but not necessarily i.d. demands. After the optimal quantities and the associated optimal expected cost (both gross and controllable) are found, the policies are compared through the two ratios α

The search procedure is based on a gradient search with a finite differencing (sometimes referred to as Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis, e.g., Herer et al., 2006). The initial point for the search is the optimal quantities of NP. For UDC, it iteratively generates a series of points,

                        . The search is terminated after executing a predetermined number of steps, K. The same applies to CP (whose cost for a given demand is provided in Eq. (3)). Due to the problems of UDC and CP being jointly convex in the order quantities, this procedure with the selected stepsize and the unbiased estimator for the gradient is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution (Boyd & Mutapcic, 2007). The optimal expected cost of UDC and CP (for the whole system) is found by averaging the cost over the U replications at the last step (step K). The optimal expected cost of NP is given by Eq. (1). In all cases, convergence was achieved long before K steps, and the U replications performed at each step provided the desired precision. To reduce variance, the same set of demand realizations is used at each of the steps according to the Common Random Number technique (e.g., Law & Kelton, 1991; Ross, 2006). In addition, the same set of demand realizations is used to find the optimal quantities of both UDC and CP. We use σ
                        ≪
                        μ, which reflects a realistic distribution of non-negative demand.

The results and comparative statics presented below are based on particular examples and are provided for illustration purposes. However, we actually conducted a large numerical study and considered multiple cases (not reported here), whose results support the findings given in the following examples.

For illustration purposes, we shall now provide two examples with ten retailers each – one with i.i.d. normal demands, and the other with independent but not identically distributed normal demands.

Consider the following example. A ten-retailer system with the following unit cost structure: c
                           =1, c/b
                           =0.11, t/b
                           =0.25. Demand at each node is distributed normally with a mean of 250 and a Coefficient Of Variation (COV) of 0.05. The experiment was run with K
                           =1100 and U
                           =10,000. Table 1
                            presents the average optimal order quantities per node, as well as the optimal expected costs (both gross and controllable), for each of the systems.


                           Table 1 suggests that the more links a system has, the less inventory it carries (this is true for c/b
                           <0.5). In Table 2
                           , one can observe the relative advantage of the policies one over another.

From Table 2 it can be seen that when gross costs are considered, pooling has very little advantage. However, it is worth considering the controllable costs. UDC can save as much as 20.4% of the controllable costs of NP (recall that this would require only 10 links to be constructed). By further adding links and creating CP, one can save 26.6% of the controllable costs of UDC (note, however, that this would require as much as 80 additional links – a large difference). Hence, UDC captures a considerable portion of the benefits of CP with far fewer links.

Consider the following example. A six-retailer system with c
                           =1, c/b
                           =0.25, t/b
                           =0.5. Demand at each node has a COV of 0.2. The experiment was run with K
                           =1100 and U
                           =15,000. Table 3
                            provides the mean and the standard deviation of demand at each retailer, along with their optimal quantities for each sharing configuration.


                           Table 3 suggests that the quantity ordered by each node decreases with pooling (intuitive since the critical ratio is larger than 0.5). Obviously, it is also increasing in the mean demand, and, as the critical ratio is greater than 0.5, in the standard deviation. Table 4
                            summarizes the average optimal quantity (over all nodes), the system-wide controllable cost and the ratios of controllable

                              When considering gross costs in this example, the relative advantage of UDC over NP, as well as that of CP over UDC, is around 3%.

                            due to the critical ratio being larger than 0.5). Table 4 suggests that UDC can save 14% of the controllable costs of NP, at a cost of constructing only 6 links. CP can save 14.5% of the controllable costs of UDC, at a cost of creating as much as 24 links in addition to those of the chain.

In the symmetric case, it is interesting to examine the impact of change in the various problem parameters.

                              This is an average over all nodes. In the case of identical demands, the per node optimal quantities are converging to the same value. This holds for all cases concerning identical demands.

We have already established analytically that for any demand distribution, the per node optimal order quantity of any of the systems studied is decreasing in c/b. Fig. 3 suggests that the average optimal order quantities per node tend to the median demand when flexibility is added to the system (for c/b
                           >0.5, one can observe the “anomaly” in inventory systems, also mentioned by Yang & Schrage (2009)). Note that for c/b
                           =0.5, all systems order the median (mean) of demand distribution. The inequality

                           <0.5 is already known for normal demands (e.g., Yang and Schrage). The interesting result is that these extreme per node optimal quantities always bound the per node optimal quantity of UDC, regardless of the value of t/b. Fig. 4
                            illustrates the impact of c/b on the average optimal expected CPN, for the same scenario. The dimensions of the vertical axes are cost units. The left vertical axis reflects the GCPN, while the right vertical axis represents the CCPN. Obviously, the expected CCPN behaves similarly to the expected GCPN, as the two axes only differ by the constant cμ (equals 250 in this example).

For each value of c/b, costs clearly decline when flexibility is added to the system. For each policy, the average optimal expected CPN is decreasing in c/b. It seems that for all policies,

                            presents the ratios of the average optimal expected GCPN (a) and CCPN (b) for the same scenario.

From Fig. 5(b), one can observe that the benefit from pooling declines for very small and very large values of c/b, which is intuitive and corresponds to our results concerning the uniform distribution is Section 4 (note, however, that in the current section transshipment cost is non-negligible). Since the CCPN is computed by subtracting a fairly large constant (cμ) both from the numerator and the denominator, the ratios of the GCPN differ from those of the CCPN. For the ratios of the CCPN, the highest relative advantage is attained at c/b
                           =0.5 (as is the case in the uniform demand distribution in Section 4), while for each ratio of the GCPN, the highest relative advantage is attained at different values of c/b. Whenever the line of CP/UDC is found above the line of UDC/NP, it indicates that the improvement that can be achieved by UDC is higher than can further be achieved by CP (relatively to UDC). Note that in any case, the advantage of CP over UDC does not exceed 37.7%.

                                 (namely, the optimal quantity per node undergoes the same linear transformation as the random demand).
                              

The proof appears in Appendix B. As the normal and uniform families of distributions are location-scale, X
                           
                              α,β
                            belongs for them to the same family. Thus it is sufficient to solve the problem for a single normal (uniform) distribution, and easily infer from that the solution to any normal (uniform) distribution.

                            is also linearly increasing in σ/μ. Our numerical results suggest that such is also the case with

                            when t
                           >0. We have also found that the three systems considerably differ in their optimal quantities for high coefficients of variation.

In Fig. 6
                           , one can see the impact of σ/μ on the average optimal expected GCPN (left vertical axis) and CCPN (right vertical axis) for the scenario n
                           =10, c/b
                           =0.25, t/b
                           =0.188. σ/μ varies within the range [0.033,0.33] with a stepsize of 0.033. μ is fixed to 250 while σ varies accordingly.

For each of the policies, the optimal expected cost is increasing in σ/μ, as expected. The difference in the optimal expected CPN increases as σ/μ grows. For large coefficients of variation, pooling has a greater advantage. Moreover, the optimal expected cost of UDC is linearly increasing in the coefficient of variation. That is true for any location-scale distribution (see, for instance, our analysis of uniform distribution in Section 4). In Fig. 7
                           , the relative advantage (in terms of costs) as a function of the COV is presented for the same scenario, both for the GCPN (a) and the CCPN (b).

Both ratios of the optimal expected GCPN are decreasing in σ/μ, as seen in Fig. 9(a). That is intuitive. The higher is the variance, the higher is the benefit of inventory (risk) pooling. Further, the difference between the two ratios increases as σ/μ grows, which is intuitive as well. It appears that the ratios of the optimal expected CCPN do not behave similarly to those of the GCPN. When each system orders optimally, all ratios of the controllable costs seem to be independent of σ/μ (due to the term cμ being netted both from the numerator and the denominator).


                           Fig. 8
                            shows the change in the average optimal quantities per node as a function of t/b. The data used in this example is n
                           =10, c/b
                           =0.1, σ/μ
                           =0.05, μ
                           =250. t/b varies within the range [0.01,0.99] with a stepsize of 0.02. b is fixed to one while t varies accordingly. We used K
                           =1100, U
                           =15,000.

While the optimal quantity of NP is not affected by t/b, those of the pooling policies are increasing in t/b. In the general case ofUDC, the sign of dq
                           ∗/d(t/b) is not clear. For normal demands and c/b
                           <0.5 the sign seems to be positive (confirmed by all scenarios studied by us), while for c/b
                           >0.5 it is rather negative. Note that

                            seems to increase linearly in t/b, meaning that as t and b approach each other,

                            is expected to increase by the same rate regardless of the distance between t and b. As t/b grows, the optimal quantities per node approach each other, which is intuitive (the systems tend to order larger quantities so that there will be fewer transshipment). In Fig. 9
                           , one can observe the change in the average optimal expected GCPN (left vertical axis) and CCPN (right vertical axis), for the same scenario:

While the performance of NP is, of course, independent of t/b, the average optimal expected costs per node in UDC and CP are increasing in t/b and seem concave. For these policies, it is also seen that the average expected CPN is converging to that of NP for t/b
                           →1− (hence, the relative advantage of pooling declines as t and b approach each other). Fig. 10 illustrates the relative advantage (in terms of costs) for the discussed scenario. The relative advantage is monotonically increasing in t/b, in contrast with Section 5.3.1. One can see that UDC can save up to 30% of the controllable costs of NP. In addition, the highest (controllable) advantage of CP over UDC is attained at t/b
                           =0.01 and equals 53.3%. However, this large advantage quickly diminishes as t/b grows. The graphs in Fig. 10
                           (a) cross at t/b
                           =0.25 with a relative advantage of 1.7%, while in Fig. 10(b) they cross at t/b
                           =0.31 with a relative advantage of 20%. Note that in a considerable portion of the cases, UDC achieves higher advantage (over NP) than CP does (over UDC).

We have examined the impact of the number of retailers on the optimal quantity if demands are independent but not identically distributed. This was done by adding one node to an existing system at a time. For NP, adding a node clearly has no effect on the others since the retailers do not cooperate. For CP, the optimal quantity ordered by each node would decrease if c/b
                        <0.5 and a node is added (e.g., Cai & Du, 2009). To investigate the impact of n on UDC, consider the following experiment. c
                        =1, c/b
                        =0.25, t/b

                           i
                        
                        =0.2, μ
                        1
                        =125 and μ
                        
                           i
                        
                        =
                        μ
                        
                           i−1
                        +25. We investigated a varying number of nodes in the system, from 3 to 21.

It appears that adding a node to an existing chain with non-identical demands affects only the adjacent nodes of the one being added, while for the other nodes, the impact of the newly added node fades away. For instance, when Node 10 is added to the system, this affects nodes 8, 9 and 1 only. Note that in this example, each node added to the system has higher mean demand than the previous. Hence, adding Retailer 10 causes

                        (a) provides a detailed look at Retailer 10, whose behavior is similar to that of Retailers 3–18, illustrating the fast convergence rate. The optimal quantity of Retailer 10 converges for systems containing at least 13 retailers. Fig. 11(b) provides a detailed look at Retailer 1. One can see that the optimal quantity of Node 1 tends to decrease as nodes are added, since with every node added, the quantity ordered by the predecessor of Node 1 increases (due to its increased demand parameters), causing Retailer 1 to rely on transshipments and to order less.

One of the purposes of analyzing UDC is to provide an approximation of CP, as for some demand distributions, the expected UDC cost might be easier than CP to calculate (e.g., the uniform example in Section 4, in which the complexity of calculating CP increases with the number of nodes). Note that UDC will always overestimate CP in terms of expected cost. Since this might result in a considerable overestimation, it is necessary to find the ranges of parameter values for which the approximation is acceptable.

If one considers the expected GCPN, then UDC provides a very good approximation of CP. For the 129 cases

                           The data sets that constitute the 129 cases are those that appeared in Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4.

                         does not exceed 0.1. That is not surprising, since the expected GCPN of both configurations contains the same large constant. In addition, the case where Δ
                           G
                        
                        =0.1 is characterized by a high COV (0.33). If, however one considers the expected CCPN, the approximation may not be as good as in the case of GCPN. We observed the following:

An important managerial insight arising from these results is that one can decide, depending on the known system parameters, whether it is possible or beneficial to use a UDC instead of CP. Moreover, in almost 30% of the cases, complete inventory pooling is not needed, as it requires the construction and maintenance of many links without contributing much to operational cost saving. Finally, in about 30% of the cases, it is possible to evaluate the performance of a system operating under CP by computing the expected cost of a UDC, which is somewhat leaner and simpler (with an overestimation of up to 15%) (see Table 5
                        ).

Distinguishing the results of the asymmetrical case from the other results, we observed an average Δ
                           C
                         of 0.219, which is considered acceptable. The maximal Δ
                           C
                         is 0.28, while the minimal is 0.07. Note that for the asymmetrical case, we used a relatively high COV of 0.2 (recall that the difference in the optimal expected CPN increases as σ/μ grows). Nevertheless, UDC seems to approximate CP well.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Our work analyzes a circular unidirectional chaining configuration of inventory sharing, and compares its performance, in terms of optimal quantity and expected cost, to that of no pooling and complete pooling, known as extreme inventory sharing policies. UDC requires only n links between the retailers. Compared to NP, it is very effective, especially in the following cases: intermediate values of c/b; low and moderate values of t/b; high coefficient of variation. Further, CP has little advantage over UDC in the following cases: low to moderate coefficient of variation; very low and very high values of c/b; intermediate and high values of t/b; small number of nodes. UDC provides a good, or, at least, acceptable approximation of CP in around 40% of the cases. These results can serve to select the most appropriate configuration at the network design stage, based on the cost parameters and demand distribution of the inventory system.

We provided an analytical investigation of UDC, and proved that if demands are i.i.d. and unit costs are identical across nodes, the expected CPN can be found by considering two adjacent nodes at a time. That enables obtaining an analytical solution to the problem. We provided the optimality condition and analytical comparative statics. The optimal quantity per node is strictly increasing in the critical ratio, and is linearly increasing in σ/μ (for c/b
                     <0.5). If a linear transformation is applied to the demand random variable, then the per node optimal quantity undergoes the same transformation. For the case of uniform demand distribution and free transshipment, UDC can save up to 1/3 of the controllable costs of NP – a considerable amount compared to the low number of required links. By enabling complete inventory pooling (for n
                     =3), one can save only up to 19% of the controllable costs of UDC, while that would require creating far more (n
                     2
                     −2n) additional links.

By studying a normal demand distribution, preliminary experiments have shown that, for c/b
                     <0.5, per node optimal quantity of UDC and CP was found to increase in t/b. The expected CPN was found to decrease in c/b, increase in σ/μ and (for UDC and CP) in t/b. We also conclude that for identical demands, a unidirectional chain of n
                     ⩾3 nodes is no better than one consisting of fewer nodes. Adding a node to an existing chain constitutes no improvement on the performance of the entire chain. Thus, only CP exhibits the economies of scale (beyond n
                     =3). Even if demands are not identical, then, for a sufficiently large system, adding a node to an existing chain has no effect on nodes 2 through n
                     −3.

Currently, we are focusing on circular bidirectional chaining, which is more flexible than UDC and thus closer to the performance of CP. Note that if the retailers sell several non-substitutable and not complementary products, then even if demands at a node are not independent, one can consider one item at a time. If demands at different nodes are symmetric but not independent, then one can still consider two nodes at a time, but the optimality equation is more complex, as we have a bivariate distribution. An interesting question at the network design stage (which we do not address) is the following. Suppose any two retailers could become connected at a cost. How to best turn the locations into a unidirectional chain? Assuming that the relative costs of establishing a link are unrelated to the relative costs of using that link for transshipment, the design stage would constitute a Traveling Salesperson Problem. Note that there are (n
                     −1)! possibilities, but a greedy scheme, like modified minimal spanning tree, may be optimal.

A solution where two arbitrary nodes order different quantities is dominated by the solution of equally dividing the purchased quantity among the nodes. Any solution involving unequal quantities can be shown sub-optimal in a similar way.□
