                  In this article we generalize the aggregation theory in efficiency and productivity analysis by deriving solutions to the problem of aggregation of individual scale efficiency measures, primal and dual, into aggregate primal and dual scale efficiency measures of a group (e.g., industry). The new aggregation result is coherent with aggregation framework and solutions that were earlier derived for other related efficiency measures and can be used in practice for estimation of scale efficiency of an industry or other groups of firms within it.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Analysis of economies of scale has been one of the fundamental subjects in economics, operations research and production management, both in theory and especially in practice. Indeed, the issue of attaining optimal scale of operations frequently appears among priority questions on management agendas of various types of companies, whether private or public. In this article we focus on the scale efficiency, which combines both the notion of optimal scale and the notion of (relative) production efficiency. Our particular interest is in how to appropriately measure the scale efficiency of a group—an industry consisting of firms, a firm consisting of plants, a union consisting of countries, etc.

For several decades, many studies in various economics and business literature challenged the issue of proper measurement of scale economies for various contexts and for various estimators. These studies include the seminal works of Hanoch (1975), Panzar and Willig (1977), Føsund and Hjalmarsson (1979), Banker (1984), Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (1984), Färe and Grosskopf (1985), Färe, Grosskopf, and Lovell (1986), Banker and Thrall (1992), Banker, Bardhan, and Cooper (1996), Føsund (1996), Golany and Yu (1997), as well as more recent works of Føsund and Hjalmarsson (2004), Krivonozhko, Utkin, Volodin, Sablin, and Patrin (2004), Hadjicostas and Soteriou (2006, 2010), Podinovski, Føsund, and Krivonozhko (2009), Zelenyuk (2013a, 2013b, 2014), Peyrache (2013), to mention just a few.

In previous studies, researchers primarily focused on the measurement of scale economies for an individual or disaggregate decision making unit (DMU). In the present work we will focus on the issue of how to appropriately aggregate such individual scale efficiency measures, or their estimates/scores obtained from these measures for individual DMUs, into aggregate measures (or aggregate scores) of scale efficiency of a group. Indeed, after obtaining many individual scale efficiency scores, researchers may truly need a proper way to summarize these many scores into one or few numbers to present to their audience concisely. Clearly, one could simply use a sample average of individual estimates—but which one: the arithmetic or the geometric? More importantly, a problem with a sample average, whether arithmetic or geometric, is that it ignores a relative weight of each DMU in the aggregation. On the other hand, while a weighted average can account for a relative weight of each DMU, a critical question arises along the use of a weighted average: Which set of weights should be used? Indeed, conclusions and related policy implications may heavily depend on the weights chosen for the aggregation. Therefore, our primary focus is on deriving the weights for the aggregation of scale efficiency measures, which has not been done in the literature so far.

Studies on the aggregation problem in efficiency analysis go back to at least the seminal work of Farrell (1957), who coined the term structural efficiency of an industry. This notion was then criticized and elaborated by Føsund and Hjalmarsson (1979), who introduced the notion of efficiency of an average unit, and by Li and Ng (1995) who synthesized these latter works, considering them in the context of aggregation weights based on shadow prices. (See also a related discussion in Ylvinger (2000).) On the pure theoretical front, in their seminal work, Blackorby and Russell (1999) unveiled several impossibility theorems for a general aggregation problem of efficiency measures. One important implication of their work was that any positive result on aggregation in efficiency measurement must involve additional assumptions. This route was taken by Färe and Zelenyuk (2003) who, upon accepting certain assumptions on aggregate technology, optimization behavior and prices, and applying a revenue analogue of the fundamental theorem from Koopmans (1957), derived a solution to the aggregation problem for the output oriented Farrell-type technical efficiency measures. Similar approach was later used for deriving various aggregation results, such as aggregation of input oriented technical efficiency measures (Färe, Grosskopf, & Zelenyuk, 2004), aggregation of productivity indexes (Zelenyuk, 2006), aggregation within and between the sub-groups (Simar & Zelenyuk, 2007), aggregation of economic growth rates (Zelenyuk, 2011), aggregation of scale elasticities (Färe & Zelenyuk, 2012), but these works do not answer how the commonly used scale efficiency measures should be aggregated.

In the present work, we generalize the existing approach of aggregation of efficiency measures to the context of aggregation of scale efficiency measures, such that it is coherent with and encompass previous aggregation results for the related efficiency measures. This is a new theoretical result that can be relatively easily applied in practice for obtaining aggregate scale efficiency measures from suitable estimates of the individual scale efficiency scores.

The paper is structured as following: Section 2 briefly outlines the theory of measuring scale efficiency on individual level. Section 3 briefly outlines useful relationships between various efficiency measures that will be used in derivations of solutions to the aggregation problem. Section 4 proposes a solution to the aggregation problem from the perspective of mathematical (functional equations) approach. Section 5 outlines economic approach to solve the aggregation problem. Section 6 presents some special cases and Section 7 concludes.

To keep our context general yet as simple as possible, let us consider a group of n decision making units (plants or firms or countries, etc.), hereafter DMUs, indexed by 
                        
                           k
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,

                     . Our main focus in the paper will be on aggregate efficiencies-measures that would represent various types of efficiency of a group of DMUs (e.g., a firm consisting of plants, an industry consisting of firms, etc.). We also want such aggregate measures of a group to be related or constructed from the individual efficiency measures obtained for each DMU in such a group.

This is a common assumption in economics, which is coherent with the principle of decreasing marginal rate of technical transformation regarding the substitution between outputs that is commonly assumed in microeconomics theory. Note, however, that for our general developments we do not assume convexity of

                     , i.e., the reciprocal of (2.3) gives a score between 0 and 1, with 1 standing for full or 100% technical efficiency level, output oriented.

                        Note there appears to be some confusion in the literature about this measure. Some authors use the output oriented Farrell technical efficiency measure defined as a reciprocal of (2.3), which in some cases might be preferred as it immediately has a convenient scale between 0 and 1. While the derivations below can be written with this definition as well, we used definition (2.3) because it is more convenient for our derivations that follow, and may help avoiding confusions because previous works on aggregation of efficiency we refer to also used (2.3). To avoid confusions, we also refer to (2.3) as ‘Farrell-type measure’ rather than ‘Farrell measure’.

Originally, Farrell (1957) focused on (an input analogue of) this measure for the context of a particular case of activity analysis model. Later, in their seminal paper, Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) resurrected Farrell’s approach and unveiled interesting dual characterization of his efficiency measure, with shadow price and shadow revenue-cost ratio interpretations, sparking a new area in operations research and econometrics and coining it as data envelopment analysis (DEA). While the DEA would be a natural estimator of (2.3), other estimators, such as regression-based methods, including stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), or a synthesis of them, such as stochastic-DEA method (e.g., see Simar & Zelenyuk, 2011) can work for our context as well. Therefore, we will consider our theoretical developments for a general case, regardless of what estimator is to be used for it. Also note that, besides not requiring convexity of T, unlike in the commonly assumed DEA context, we also allow for each DMU

                      to have its own unique technology (with possibility to be inefficient w.r.t. it), for the sake of generality. Clearly, assuming a common technology (as is often done in practice) would be a special case, and we briefly return to it in Section 6.

We will also use a dual characterization of the output correspondence and of efficiency measures-the revenue function, which for a DMU

To achieve our aggregation result, throughout this work we will focus on the output price vector p that is the same across all DMUs, which one could think of as a benchmark or a reference price vector selected for the purpose of aggregation. For example, if we consider a microeconomics context, then p could be taken to be a vector of equilibrium prices at the output markets. Alternatively, p can also be chosen to be the vector of shadow prices for the outputs for the considered group of firms (e.g., see Li & Ng (1995) for a motivation), etc. The differences in prices that one may face in practice can then be viewed as a variation or noise around these benchmark (equilibrium or shadow or other selected common) prices.

Besides serving as an alternative (dual) complete characterization of technology of a DMU, due to duality theory in economics, the revenue function (2.4) also serves as the dual to the Farrell’s output oriented technical efficiency measure (2.3), given regularity conditions, convexity of

                      is independent from the output levels, which happens due to optimization behavior over outputs involved in (2.4) and (2.10) and due to benchmarking with respect to the same actual revenue py.

Our goal now is to find a proper way to aggregate the scores yielded by these individual scale efficiency measures, which we will derive with a help of important relationships and decompositions of the efficiency measures that we outline in the next section.

In our further derivations we will utilize the following well-known decomposition of individual revenue efficiency measure, that hold for any

In words, (3.6) decomposes the CRS-hypothetical-based revenue efficiency measure of a DMU k into four components: (i) the output oriented technical efficiency measure, (ii) the output oriented allocative efficiency measure, (iii) the output oriented technical scale efficiency measure, and (iv) the output oriented allocative scale efficiency measure. Now, the question is how to coherently aggregate all these measures from individual level into a group level, so that, preferably, such decomposition is also maintained at the aggregate level.

One way to describe the problem of aggregation we face here is by formulating a goal to find a sequence of aggregation functions

While our primal focus in this paper is on aggregation equations regarding the primal and dual measures of scale efficiency, i.e., on (4.5) and (4.6), it is natural to desire that our aggregation solutions to (4.5) and (4.6) are also coherent with solutions to aggregation problems regarding the other efficiency measures. For example, it is natural to desire that the functions

Admitting such framework implies that the aggregation problem we face here is an example of a system of functional equations. If, in addition, we require that the weights of the aggregation (denoted here with

                     A weakness of such an approach, however, is that while formally answering the question about the aggregation function, this approach does not answer the question about what exactly the aggregation weights should be. A natural choice for the weights here in the output oriented or revenue-focused approach could be, for example, the observed revenue shares, i.e.,

                     . This would be in the spirit of Farrell (1957) definition of structural efficiency of an industry. However, one could also argue that other weights (e.g., cost shares) might also be adequate. Moreover, there is no particular (economic) reason for the weights to be the same in all aggregation functions rather than being different for aggregating different efficiency measures. For example, some of the aggregation equations might have weights being the maximal (i.e., optimal w.r.t. p) revenue shares, given by

                      (e.g., see a related discussion on weights in Ylvinger (2000) and Färe & Zelenyuk (2007)). In fact, in the next sections, taking economic approach will indeed yield different weights for different efficiency measures.

It is worth noting here again that the issue of weights can often be even more important than the issue of aggregating functions-mainly because the aggregating functions are usually some type of averages and so usually yield similar results, especially for small variations of the scores being aggregated, while different weights can easily lead to dramatically different results and even may imply radically different policy implications. Our goal therefore is to derive some meaningful, economically compelling weights, as we do in the next section.

The goal of this sub-section is to define and outline characterization of aggregate technology. This aggregate technology will then be used to derive an aggregation scheme for aggregating scale efficiency such that it is coherent with aggregation of other related efficiency measures. To achieve this goal, let us denote the input and output allocations among DMUs within a group of interest by

Based on this set-characterization of the aggregate CRS-hypothetical technology, we can define the aggregate dual (revenue-based) characterization of technology and of efficiencies, analogous to those we did on the individual level, in (2.10), (2.11) and (2.13).

                        Intuitively, with this CRS-hypothetical aggregate revenue function (5.5), we look at what is the maximal level of total revenue the group can obtain by selling (at prices p) output produced from the endowed input allocations X (without their reallocation across DMUs) if the technology were given by

                        . Similarly as in (5.2), because the adopted aggregation structure (5.4) allows for reallocation of outputs but not for reallocation of inputs, the same nature of aggregation is then inherited by the aggregate CRS-hypothetical revenue function as well as by all the efficiency measures based on it.

Similarly to (2.11), the respective aggregate revenue efficiency w.r.t. the aggregate CRS-hypothetical technology can be measured by

                        Intuitively, (5.6) is a measure of CRS-hypothetical aggregate revenue efficiency of the group that takes the maximal revenue obtained from selling (at prices p) output produced from X (without their reallocation across DMUs) and compares it to the actual revenues of the group,

In this sub-section we establish relationships between the disaggregate (primal and dual) scale efficiency measures and their aggregate analogues under the aggregate technology structure defined in (5.1) and (5.4). In other words, we are interested in deriving aggregation functions and aggregating weights that relate the aggregate or group scale efficiency measures with their disaggregate or individual scale efficiency measures that are commonly estimated in practice. With the derivations that follow, we will justify the use of weighted arithmetic average aggregating function, where the weights (and the aggregation function) are derived from the economic optimization behavior and specific assumptions on aggregation of technologies and on output prices. Following Färe and Zelenyuk (2003) (also see Koopmans (1957)), we have

                        Incidentally, note that the weights for aggregation of the allocative efficiency measures are different from those used for aggregation of the revenue and technical efficiency measures and, in particular, they account or correct for the technical inefficiency of the revenue shares used for weighting.

By the same line of proof as for (5.8) (see Färe & Zelenyuk (2003, 2007)), analogous result follows for the aggregate revenue function based on the aggregate CRS-hypothetical technology, i.e., we have

In words, (5.16) says that the aggregate revenue efficiency measure w.r.t. the aggregate CRS-hypothetical technology, can be obtained by aggregating the individual revenue efficiency measures w.r.t. the individual CRS-hypothetical technology defined in (2.11), where the aggregating function is also the arithmetic average with individual weights given by the actual revenue shares of the individual k in the actual total revenue of its group.

Furthermore, note that from (5.7), it follows immediately that

                        i.e., we can decompose the aggregate revenue efficiency w.r.t. the aggregate CRS-hypothetical technology into two components: (i) the aggregate revenue efficiency (w.r.t. the aggregate technology) and (ii) the aggregate revenue scale efficiency.

More importantly, we can obtain the aggregate revenue scale efficiency of a group,

Note that the weights that came out in the aggregation scheme (5.18), and described by (5.19), are different from those obtained for aggregation of revenue functions, technical and allocative efficiencies-here, they are the efficient revenue shares w.r.t. the individual revenue functions.

In turn, the characterization of the aggregate revenue scale efficiency given in (5.18) and (5.19), helps decomposing

                        Incidentally, note again that the weights that came out in the aggregation of the primal scale efficiency measures, in (5.21), are the same as those derived for the aggregation of the dual (revenue-based) scale efficiency measures, described by (5.19). On the other hand, the weights that come out in the aggregation of allocative scale efficiency measures, in (5.22), and described in (5.23) are different from those we derived earlier for the aggregation of revenue functions or for the aggregation of technical and allocative efficiency measures, as they also account for the primal scale inefficiency.

Finally, combining the statements above, we also get a desirable decomposition of the CRS-hypothetical revenue efficiency on the aggregate level—analogous to the decomposition we have on the disaggregated level that appeared in (3.6), i.e., we have

                        In words, with the aggregation scheme derived from the revenue version of the Koopmans’ theorem (and given our assumptions on the aggregate technology, same output prices, standard regularity conditions, etc.), we are able to decompose the aggregate CRS-hypothetical revenue efficiency measure into four components of different types of aggregate efficiency measures, namely: (i) the aggregate technical efficiency measure, (ii) the aggregate allocative efficiency measure, (iii) the aggregate primal scale efficiency measure, and (iv) the aggregate allocative scale efficiency measure. Incidentally, note that the product of the last two gives the aggregate dual scale efficiency, while the product of the first two gives the aggregate revenue efficiency measure. We thus attained the main goal of this paper—derived a coherent and economically compelling aggregation scheme for scale efficiency measures that embraces previous aggregation results, with a natural decomposition (5.24) that is analogous to decomposition (3.6) that exists at individual level. In the next sub-section we will discuss an important issue of proper stratification that is pertinent particularly to the context of aggregating scale efficiency measures.

Various types of stratification of a group into sub-groups may be motivated for various empirical contexts, e.g., private vs. public firms in an industry, foreign vs. local firms, sub-groups of firms under different regulation regimes, sub-groups of countries in different economic unions or organizations (e.g., OECD vs. non-OECD countries, EU vs. non-EU, developed vs. developing countries, etc.) Accounting for such differences in a group and adapting aggregation scheme to such stratification may be vital in practice. The issue of efficiency aggregation within a sub-group and across several sub-groups into a larger group was first analyzed in Simar and Zelenyuk (2007) for the context of aggregation of technical and revenue efficiency measures. Similar approach can be applied here as well.

Importantly, even when there is no exogenous categorical variables that divide an analyzed group into distinct sub-groups, for the case of scale efficiency measurement there is a natural justification for stratifying a group of considered DMUs into potentially three sub-groups: (i) DMUs that are scale efficient, (ii) DMUs that are scale inefficient due to not exhausting the scale economies (i.e., too small to be scale efficient) and (iii) DMUs that are scale inefficient due to experiencing dis-economies of scale (i.e., too large to be scale efficient). Stratifying into these three groups, especially into the last two, and then proper aggregation within these sub-groups and between them is particularly important here because the reciprocals of the individual scale efficiency measures, whether primal or dual, give a score between 0 and 1 regardless of whether the firm is in group (ii) or in group (iii). In other words, the standard individual scale efficiency measures we considered above are not indicative of the source or cause of the scale inefficiency and ignoring this fact in producing the aggregate scale efficiency scores, whether primal or dual, would lead to missing important information about the scale economies. To do a proper aggregation, one should first stratify the estimates into the three groups and then apply the aggregation formulas derived above to aggregate the scale efficiency scores of DMUs within each of these three sub-groups separately. The resulting aggregate efficiency scores of sub-groups can then be aggregated into a larger group that consists of all or some of the sub-groups, using proper between-weights—the weights that would ensure hierarchical consistency of aggregation, as discussed in more details in Simar and Zelenyuk (2007).

It is now worth considering some interesting special cases for our aggregation problem. First of all, note that if all DMUs exhibit (or are to be measured with respect to) the same technology then the formulas derived above can still be applied without any changes.

Secondly, note that for all the types of efficiency measures considered here, except the allocative scale efficiency component, the aggregate efficiency is equal to one (i.e., 100% efficiency of the certain type) if and only if each individual efficiency score is equal to one.

Thirdly, note that each DMU in the group exhibits CRS technology if and only if

                     Although having no allocative inefficiency is a sufficient condition for the dual and primal (individual and aggregate) scale efficiencies to coincide, it is certainly not a necessary condition. Indeed, a much weaker condition for the dual and primal (individual and aggregate) scale efficiencies to yield equivalent results for any DMU k is for the technology of this DMU k to be output scale homothetic (see Zelenyuk (2014)), i.e. to satisfy the following property

                     i.e., the aggregate primal and dual scale efficiency measures are also equal.

Finally, in case information on output prices needed to compute the aggregation weights is unavailable, additional assumptions can be imposed to derive price-independent weights (see Färe & Zelenyuk (2007) for details).

In this paper we developed a theory for aggregation of scale efficiency measures across DMUs (firms, industries, countries, group of countries, etc.). The derivation is based on assuming optimization behavior, additive aggregation structure on the output sets and the same (e.g., equilibrium) output prices across all DMUs. An advantage of the resulting aggregation scheme (and aggregation weights, in particular) is that it is not ad hoc but derived from certain assumptions coherent with economic theory, and coherent with previous aggregation results.

This paper is just the first layer of theoretical foundation for analyzing aggregate scale efficiency measures. Its goal was to provide mathematical structure with economic theory foundation for such aggregation. The next layer shall be a statistical foundation. Indeed, besides presenting an average of results, researchers and practitioners are often interested in some measures of spread of the sample, such as the standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and interquartile range, as well as in the possibility to use some statistical testing procedures for inferring on various hypotheses. A hypothesis of an interest, for example, might be whether the true aggregate scale efficiency for a particular sub-group is different from unity (i.e., 100% efficiency) or some other level of interest. Another hypothesis of interest might be whether the aggregate scale efficiency scores are equal across different sub-groups or not, or across time for the same sub-groups, etc. Estimating characteristics of the sampling distribution of a statistic for a weighted mean where weights are random variables as well and related testing is a challenging task. A potential solution here would be to adapt the bootstrapping approach proposed in a different context by Efron (1979). This is a subject in itself, in some way similar to the recent work of Simar and Zelenyuk (2007) for bootstrapping the aggregate efficiency scores obtained via the DEA method, and we leave it for further research.

It is also worth noting that the derived weights (and the theory in general) may not be unique and perhaps better weight (and theories in general) could also be derived-and we hope this particular work will stimulate this to happen. A natural extension to the present work that might generate different weights would be to allow for reallocation of inputs between DMUs in the technology aggregation structure and one of the ways to do this is to adapt the approach of Nesterenko and Zelenyuk (2007) to the case of aggregation of scale efficiencies.

Another interesting research question is an extension of the presented theory to the intertemporal context—to measure changes of aggregate scale efficiency over time, as a component of aggregate Malmquist productivity index or other indexes, by extending the work of Zelenyuk (2006).

Similar aggregation theories can also be developed for the case when efficiency measures are based on other functions, e.g., hyperbolic distance function, the directional distance functions, etc. and these would be other natural paths for related future research (see Färe, Grosskopf, & Zelenyuk (2008) and Bobykin & Zelenyuk (2010) for some related results).

Overall, we believe that the aggregation solution with economic theory justification derived for the aggregation of scale efficiency in this paper must serve as a very useful platform for future applied as well as theoretical work.
