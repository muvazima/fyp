                  This paper extends possibilities for analyzing incomplete ordinal information about the parameters of an additive value function. Such information is modeled through preference statements which associate sets of alternatives or attributes with corresponding sets of rankings. These preference statements can be particularly helpful in developing a joint preference representation for a group of decision-makers who may find difficulties in agreeing on numerical parameter values. Because these statements can lead to a non-convex set of feasible parameters, a mixed integer linear formulation is developed to establish a linear model for the computation of decision recommendations. This makes it possible to complete incomplete ordinal information with other forms of incomplete information.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The exact specification of attribute weights and normalized scores of an additive multiattribute value function (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976) can be challenging due to many reasons, such as urgency of the decision or lack of resources (e.g. Weber, 1987). A complete specification of parameters may not be needed, if less information would produce the same unequivocal decision recommendation or if the aim of the analysis is to discard inferior alternatives to establish a smaller set of good decision candidates. A complete specification can even be undesirable if the model seeks to capture multiple decision-makers’ (DMs’) preferences, for example. Indeed, several Preference Programming methods accommodate incomplete preference information through intervals of weight ratios or normalized scores which model alternatives’ attribute-specific values, for example. The methods thus allow the DMs to characterize their preferences with the degree of accuracy they are confident with. The resulting set of feasible parameters then contains the ones that correspond to the DM’s ‘true preferences’ (e.g., White et al., 1982, 1984; Salo and Hämäläinen, 1992).

The assessment of multi-attribute alternatives usually requires subjective evaluations (Moshkovich et al., 2002). According to Larichev (1992), numerical evaluation can even affect negatively the reliability of the analysis. Indeed, Moshkovich et al. (2002) argue that ordinal statements – as ordinal comparisons of actual or hypothetical alternatives – tend to be more reliable, less time-consuming and better understood by the DMs. Thus, they are widely used in the elicitation of normalized scores and attribute weights. One benefit of ordinal information is that it does not necessitate a quantitative measurement scale; for example, stakeholders’ disagreements about appropriate quantitative measures can be resolved by using ordinal information, as in the application by Grushka-Cockayne et al. (2008). There are several methods which first elicit a rank-ordering for the attribute weights or apply Likert-type scales or rank-orderings to classify alternatives, and then convert these ordinal statements into numerical point estimates (see Barron and Barrett, 1996; Sarabando and Dias, 2010). The decision recommendations provided by such conversions can, however, be sensitive to the selected numerical point estimates.

The Preference Programming methods avoid these conversions by modeling pairwise comparisons between attribute weights (e.g., Kirkwood and Sarin, 1985; Hazen, 1986) and normalized scores (Salo and Hämäläinen, 2001) as constraints on the model parameters (for recent applications, see Kangaspunta et al., 2012; Liesiö and Salo, 2012). Most of these methods assume that the DM provides either a full rank-ordering of the alternatives or the attributes, or that she makes several individual separate pairwise comparisons among them. In the RICH method (Salo and Punkka, 2005), the relative importance of the attributes is modeled with incomplete ordinal information. The DM can, for example, state that attributes cost and environmental aspects are among the three most important ones. The method, however, does not capture other forms of preference statements about the relative importance of attributes and the alternatives’ attribute-specific values can be evaluated only through score intervals.

The Preference Programming model developed in this paper captures incomplete ordinal information about both the alternatives and the attribute weights. Such information is elicited through statements which associate a set of alternatives or attributes with a set of rankings. For example, the DM can specify three alternatives of which one has the ranking one (i.e., it is the most preferred) with regard to attribute environmental aspects; or she can specify the two most important attributes; or state that a given alternative is among the three least preferred ones. Such preference statements can be particularly helpful in modeling a joint preference representation for a group of DMs who cannot agree on exact numerical parameter values. For example, if each group member is asked to specify the most preferred alternative with regard to environmental aspects, the group’s preferences can be expressed by a statement that the most preferred alternative is among the ones that are specified by the group members. Similarly, for example the group’s statement concerning an alternative’s ranking can be formed by taking the union of its members’ opinions. The form of the incomplete ordinal statements is flexible in that the statements can be given with regard to any subset of attributes and within any set of alternatives (or attributes). Taken together, incomplete ordinal information can be used, for example, to classify attributes or alternatives without assigning exact numerical values to these classes.

Mathematically, the set of weights and normalized scores that are consistent with incomplete ordinal statements can be non-convex, as shown by Salo and Punkka (2005) in the context of attribute weights. In this paper, the computational challenges caused by this non-convexity are resolved by employing binary variables to retain the linearity of the model. The decision recommendations can therefore be computed efficiently; in addition, it is possible to introduce even other forms of incomplete information about the alternatives’ normalized scores and the attribute weights. This possibility to incorporate both ordinal and numerical information in the same model improves possibilities for capturing the DM’s preferences. For example, it makes it possible to exclude extreme realizations of model parameters so that the preference information model better matches the DM’s true intensions, as noted by Sage and White (1984). Indeed, if only ordinal information about the alternatives is used, these extreme parameters can rule out dominance relations between alternatives.

The possibility to use both incomplete ordinal and numerical preference statements can be particularly helpful in problems which involve attributes without a natural measurement scale and are therefore difficult to evaluate numerically, or in ‘large’ problems in which the first phase of the decision support process is to screen the initial set of alternatives. In such cases, even a statement like “these 2 alternatives are among the 5 best ones” may help discard many alternatives through dominance relations so that not all alternatives need to be considered, thus leaving fewer alternatives for more detailed evaluation.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses Preference Programming methods. Section 3 formalizes incomplete ordinal information and constructs the corresponding mixed integer linear formulation. Section 4 considers uses of incomplete ordinal information in decision support. An example is presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.

                           )
                        
                      have led to the development of elicitation approaches that accommodate incomplete information about the attribute weights or the alternatives’ attribute-specific normalized scores. In these approaches, incomplete information is often modeled through set inclusion, whereby the DM’s preferences are captured through preference statements which impose constraints on the model parameters. These statements – such as intervals of normalized scores, attribute weights and attribute weight ratios (e.g., Kirkwood and Sarin, 1985; Salo and Hämäläinen, 1992, 2001) and ordinal statements (e.g., White et al., 1984; Kirkwood and Sarin, 1985; Hazen, 1986; Pearman, 1993) – lead to linear constraints on the normalized scores and attribute weights (for reviews, see Weber, 1987; Salo and Hämäläinen, 2010).

In Preference Programming, the (pairwise) dominance relation is used for the comparison of alternatives. Specifically, alternative x
                     
                        i
                      dominates x
                     
                        k
                      if its value is higher than or equal to that of x
                     
                        k
                      for all feasible parameters and strictly higher for some feasible parameters (e.g., White et al., 1982; Kirkwood and Sarin, 1985; Hazen, 1986). A dominated alternative should not be selected, because the alternative that dominates it yields a higher or equal value for all feasible parameters. A rational DM is thus interested in non-dominated alternatives. The set of non-dominated alternatives can become smaller, if the model parameters are further constrained (White et al., 1982). Many early methods provide tailored algorithms which examine the relevant extreme points of the feasible region to resolve dominance relations (e.g., White et al., 1982; Kirkwood and Sarin, 1985; Hazen, 1986). More generally, the non-dominated alternatives can be computed through linear programming.

Ordinal information consists of comparisons in which numbers are not used to describe strength of the preference. Kirkwood and Sarin (1985) present dominance conditions when strict or weak ordinal statements about the relative importance of the attributes are given. Pearman (1993) extends this work by presenting a computational model which uses an ordered metric that rank-orders attribute weight differences, too. Park et al. (1996) extend this approach by applying the ordered metric for normalized scores.


                     Hazen (1986) establishes a mathematical relation between the non-dominated and the potentially optimal alternatives which have the greatest overall value with some feasible parameters. He also shows how the consistency of preference statements, dominance relations between alternatives, and potentially optimal alternatives can be solved when the preferences are expressed through strict ordinal comparisons of hypothetical alternatives.

The RICH method (Salo and Punkka, 2005) introduces the notion of incomplete ordinal information to the elicitation of attribute weights. This information is elicited through statements, which associate a set of rankings with a set of attributes. These sets do not have to be equal in size; statements like “the two attributes a
                     1 and a
                     2 are among the three most important ones” or “either a
                     1 or a
                     2 is the most important among the three attributes” can be captured. Incomplete ordinal information has been applied for attribute weight elicitation in several applications (e.g., Ojanen et al., 2005; Salo and Liesiö, 2006; Liesiö et al., 2007; Mild and Salo, 2009).

Because the feasible region for the attribute weights may be non-convex, the computation of decision recommendations in RICH is based on extreme point enumeration. This approach has limitations in that only ordinal information can be used to characterize the attribute weights while the alternatives’ normalized scores can only be modeled as intervals or point estimates.

In the next section, the use of incomplete ordinal information is extended by developing a model for the evaluation of both attributes and alternatives. This model eliminates the above limitations and can therefore be used in conjunction with any other forms of incomplete information that correspond to linear inequalities on the model parameters.

If the DM’s preferences fulfill certain conditions, such as mutual preference independence and difference independence (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976; Dyer and Sarin, 1979), the alternatives’ overall values can be modeled with a measurable additive value function

                           i
                         with regard to this attribute. The multiplication of these two terms in (2), however, leads to non-linearities and consequently poses computational challenges when analyzing incomplete preference information about the weights and normalized scores. The following formulations are therefore based on representation (1), in the recognition that attribute weights and normalized scores are consistent with this representation through (2).

In Preference Programming, incomplete information leads to constraints on feasible scores. For example the statement “the normalized score of x
                        1 with regard to attribute a
                        1 is between 0.5 and 0.6” would lead to the constraint

By definition, the alternatives in X

                        X
                        ∗ that are not dominated by any alternative in X are non-dominated alternatives (among X). It is not advisable to choose a dominated alternative, because the values of those alternatives that dominate it are at least as high for all feasible scores. If x

                           k
                         with feasible scores S, then x
                        
                           i
                         dominates x

                        S, unless their overall values are equal throughout S′. Thus, as a rule, dominated alternatives will remain dominated, even if further preference information is obtained (White et al., 1982). Dominance relations can be checked by linear programming.

                        1,…, r
                        ∣X∣) in which r
                        
                           k
                        
                        =
                        r(x
                        
                           l
                        ; X) is the ranking of the alternative with the kth smallest index in X (i.e., ∣{x
                        
                           i
                        
                        ∈
                        X∣i
                        <
                        l}∣=
                        k
                        −1). We use rank-orderings such that if the ranking of alternative x
                        
                           k
                         is smaller than that of x
                        
                           i
                        , then x
                        
                           k
                         is either strictly preferred to x
                        
                           i
                         or they are equally preferred. For example, if X
                        ={x
                        1,
                        x
                        4,
                        x
                        5}, then the rank-ordering r(X)=(1,3,2) corresponds to rankings r(x
                        1; X)=1, r(x
                        4; X)=3 and r(x
                        5; X)=2, meaning that x
                        1 is the most preferred alternative of the three (or, more specifically, no other alternative is preferred to x
                        1), followed by x
                        5 and then x
                        4. The rank-orderings can be defined with regard to any non-empty attribute set A′⊆
                        A.


                        Incomplete ordinal information refers to ordinal statements which associate a set of alternatives (denoted by I) with a set of rankings (J) (cf. attribute weight elicitation proposed by Salo and Punkka, 2005). For example, if I
                        ={x
                        1} and J
                        ={1}, then the ranking of alternative x
                        1 is one. Thus one such a statement does not specify unique rankings for all alternatives if there are more than two alternatives.

                              A′) is an incomplete ordinal statement (IOS), if ∅≠

                                    ∅

                                    {
                                    j
                                    ∈
                                    Z
                                    |
                                    1
                                    ⩽
                                    j

                                    |
                                    X
                                    |
                                    }
                                 
                              .

In Definition 2, the set X includes the alternatives under comparison and A′ is the set of attributes with regard to which this comparison is made. Whenever there is no risk of confusion, references to these sets are omitted by adopting the notational conventions r(X)=
                        r and (I,
                        J)=(I,
                        J,
                        X,
                        A′).


                        Definition 2 does not assume that sets I and J have equally many elements. Indeed, if the number of alternatives in I is equal to or less than the number of rankings in J (that is, ∣I∣⩽∣J∣), then the ranking of each alternative in I is in J. For example, the statement that x
                        1 is either the best or the second best one of {x
                        1,
                        x
                        2,
                        x
                        3} with regard to attribute a
                        4 is captured by the IOS (I,
                        J,
                        X,
                        A′)=({x
                        1},{1,2},{x
                        1,
                        x
                        2,
                        x
                        3},{a
                        4}). This statement is compatible with four rank-orderings r
                        =(r(x
                        1; X),
                        r(x
                        2; X),
                        r(x
                        3; X)), that is, (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3) and (2,3,1).

On the other hand, if ∣I∣>∣J∣, it is assumed that the rankings in J are attained by alternatives that are in I. For example, stating that some two alternatives among x
                        1,
                        x
                        4 and x
                        7 are overall the two most preferred alternatives in the set X
                        ={x
                        1,…,x
                        10} can be modeled as (I,
                        J,
                        X,
                        A′)=({x
                        1,
                        x
                        4,
                        x
                        7},{1,2},{x
                        1,…,
                        x
                        10},
                        A).

The rank-orderings that are compatible with an IOS (I,
                        J,
                        X,
                        A′) are denoted by R(I,
                        J,
                        X,
                        A′) (or R(I,
                        J) for short) and defined as follows (Salo and Punkka, 2005).

                         capture this inference. For example, the statement (I,J)=({x
                        1,
                        x
                        2},{2}) imposes the requirement that the ranking of x
                        
                           i
                        ,
                        i
                        ∉{1,2}, is not 2. If it is at most 2 (i.e., y
                        2(x
                        
                           i
                        )=1), then it must also be smaller than 2 (i.e., y
                        1(x
                        
                           i
                        )=1); but if it is higher than 2 (i.e., y
                        2(x
                        
                           i
                        )=0), then it cannot simultaneously be smaller than 2 (i.e., y
                        1(x
                        
                           i
                        )=0). Ranking 2 is then attained by x
                        1 or x
                        2, because r is a bijection. Fig. 1
                         illustrates the above inference.

To model the scores S(I,J), we introduce a real-valued milestone variable z
                        
                           j
                         to distinguish between the values of alternatives with rankings j and j
                        +1. In view of (4) and (5) and the above interpretation of the binary variables, if y
                        
                           j
                        (x
                        
                           i
                        )=1, then v(x
                        
                           i

In practice, one often-used procedure to evaluate alternatives is to divide them into classes so that alternatives in ‘class one’ (alternatives I
                        1) are preferred to those in ‘class two’ (I
                        2), and so on. Such classification into p classes can be modeled with p

                        0∣=0. Often this ordinal information is complemented by assigning equal values to all alternatives in the same class to represent value differences between the classes (e.g., Lindstedt et al., 2007; Salo and Liesiö, 2006; Könnölä et al., 2007, see also Corner and Kirkwood, 1991). Our framework makes it possible to relax the assumption that all alternatives in the same class have exactly the same value. Yet, it makes it possible to define intervals for the values that the alternatives in a class can have and to constrain value differences between the classes. Thus, incomplete ordinal information can be used for ex ante sensitivity analysis on the values associated with the classes, for example.

Technically, the alternatives’ values and value differences can be bounded by constraints on the milestone variables. Variable z
                        
                           j
                         is a lower bound on the value of the alternative with ranking j – and consequently also on the values of alternatives with rankings smaller than j – and, similarly, an upper bound on the value of the alternatives with rankings j
                        +1,…,∣X∣. Specifically, the following numerical bounds help complement the above classification procedure, but they can technically be used to complement other statements, too.
                           
                              (a)
                              A statement that the value of the alternative with ranking j is at least 
                                    b

                        J)=(X,{1,…,
                        j}) can be introduced to allow numerical statements that employ z

                           i
                        ). The above bounds constrain the milestone variables and consequently the scores of all alternatives in X, as well. Because this leads to a smaller feasible region for scores, dominance relations hold also after the introduction of these constraints. Therefore, the dominated alternatives can be ignored in the specification of these bounds if the DM is not interested in how they compare with non-dominated ones.

The proposed model admits several kinds of ordinal preference statements as a complement to numerical information about the parameters of an additive value model. This is useful, because multi-criteria decision analysis methods are often applied to problems in which some attributes are described by numerical database entries, and for some attributes natural measurement scales do not exist (e.g., Mild and Salo, 2009). Although numerical evaluation of the latter attributes is used and may even be required to reach a single non-dominated alternative, the use of incomplete ordinal information on these attributes can reflect the DM’s preferences better and help identify and discard dominated alternatives. Indeed, screening is often the first task of a decision support process. It reduces the set of relevant alternatives and guides further work on data collection: As additional statements keep the already established dominance relations intact and may establish new ones, all evaluations and assessments can be focused on non-dominated alternatives. In effect, incomplete ordinal information offers novel possibilities for screening when only some attributes are described by numerical data or statements (cf. the example in Section 5). Discarding alternatives with incomplete ordinal information before thorough numerical assessment or data collection can save time and costs, because fewer alternatives need to be evaluated numerically.

In group settings, the DMs may have different opinions about the alternatives’ performance or the relative importance of the attributes. In addition, their ability to understand and to answer the elicitation questions can differ. If the group seeks to establish a joint preference characterization, incomplete ordinal information can be used to model these different opinions. First, despite of the DMs’ differences, they may still agree on ‘less restrictive’ statements, such as “cost is among the three most important attributes”, or “alternative x
                     1 is not the most preferred”. If the group’s analysis is assisted by a facilitator, she can even suggest such statements based on the group’s discussion. Ordinal information can even help the group focus its discussion on differences among their opinions instead of arguing over numerical parameters.

Second, the flexibility of ordinal statements makes it possible to employ several preference elicitation processes in group settings. For example, all group members k
                     =1,…, K can be asked to choose the three most preferred alternatives I
                     
                        k
                     , whereafter the group’s preferences are described by the IOS (∪
                        k
                     
                     I
                     
                        k
                     ,{1,2,3}) so that all alternatives with ‘votes’ can be among the three most preferred alternatives. This group’s statement can be then specified by removing alternatives from the set I
                     =∪
                     
                        k
                     
                     I
                     
                        k
                      – on the condition that more than three alternatives have received votes. If an alternative is among the three most preferred ones by all DMs, an additional statement (∩
                        k
                     
                     I
                     
                        k
                     ,{1,2,3}) can be introduced. Considering different attributes – or even all attributes holistically – with different sets J leads to additional statements and consequently reduces the set of feasible scores.

We consider an illustrative example in which a student uses an additive model to help her select a business school for an MBA degree. The alternatives consist of the thirty US business schools which ranked best in the 2009 The Financial Times (FT) ranking (Top MBA Programmes, 2010). The student’s aim is to discard some of these schools with an additive multi-attribute model and to then examine more closely the schools that remain non-dominated after her analysis.

The model consists of seven attributes, five of which are based on the data and the results of the FT 2009 annual business school ranking. The additional two non-educational attributes account for possibilities to pursue her hobbies. The evaluations with regard to these attributes have been added to this example to illustrate the application of subjective incomplete ordinal statements.

The student performs the analysis in two phases. First, she makes use of the information in the FT’s data and results, and provides incomplete ordinal statements with regard to non-educational attributes. In the second phase, information on the non-educational attributes is further specified by acquiring more information about the schools that remain non-dominated after the preference statements in the first phase. The schools are denoted by X
                     ={x
                     1,…,
                     x
                     30}. The attribute-specific evaluations are explained in the following. The data is summarized in Table 1

School x
                              1 outperforms all other schools in each of the three rankings and is assigned a [0,1]-normalized score 1. No school is worst in all three rankings, and the student considers a fictitious school that ties ranking 30 each year to correspond to the least preferred level. Thus, constraint z

                              =0 is introduced. Comparing to these two points of reference, the student introduces two further milestones: all alternatives which are ranked among the ten best ones have normalized score of at least 0.5 and those outside of the top twenty cannot exceed score of 0.2. These statements lead to constraints z

                              Alumni recommendations are based on a query in which alumni were asked to name three business schools which would be their primary sources of recruitment. In the FT ranking, the results of this query have been converted into a rank-ordering (r
                              3). In this example, the student exploits this rank-ordering as ordinal information about the scores

She therefore accounts for all possibilities between the extreme cases that none of them and all of them are employed. This assumption results in the intervals

                              Hobby 2 is evaluated by the student. Her evaluation is based on an article, in which three persons familiar with this hobby have named ten best and five worst universities of X with regard to this hobby. These lists are quite close to each other: there are eight schools (schools I
                              T10
                              ⊂
                              X) that belong to all three top ten lists and four schools (I
                              B5) that are assigned to bottom five in all three lists. Based on agreed schools, the student introduces preference statements (I
                              T10,{1,…,10}) and (I
                              B5,{26,…,30}). To exclude equal scores among all alternatives, she bounds the top ten schools’ normalized scores from below by 0.7, which also serves as an upper bound for schools whose ranking is worse than ten. Similarly, the normalized score 0.1 distinguishes between the five least preferred and the other schools. The most and least preferred levels are not necessarily achieved by any of the schools in X.

The attribute weights are constrained by (i) two incomplete ordinal statements (I,

                     7) and states that among the non-dominated schools, x
                     1 and x
                     10 are the two least preferred. This is captured by the statement ({x

                        ND1 and constraints the normalized score of x

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In response to the difficulties in eliciting numerical preference information for additive value models, we have developed a model for capturing incomplete ordinal information about the alternatives’ values and the relative importance of attributes. Such information can be elicited through paired sets of alternatives (or attributes) and associated rankings. For example, statements like “alternatives 1 and 2 are among the three most preferred alternatives with regard to cost”, or “alternative 1 is not the most preferred one with regard to environmental factors” can be modeled. The statements lead to a set of feasible scores.

Incomplete ordinal statements about the alternatives’ values are flexible in that they can be given with regard to any set of attributes, among any set of alternatives. The DM can also match the accuracy of the statements with the available information or the level she considers appropriate in terms of how specific decision recommendations are needed or what the costs of data collection are.

Because incomplete ordinal information can result in a non-convex set of feasible scores, we have developed a mixed integer linear formulation to model these scores. In this model, the number of binary variables employed depends on the preference statements. For example, binary variables are not employed to model convex feasible regions.

The linearity of the formulation makes it possible to complement incomplete ordinal information by other statements that are modeled with linear constraints, such as point estimates or intervals of normalized scores, weights, and weight ratios; or by numerical bounds on the developed model’s milestone variables. These possibilities help rule out unintended extreme realizations of the model parameters and thus help capture the DM’s intended preference specification. Hence, the model treats numerical and ordinal information jointly without transforming numerical information into ordinal information or vice versa.

While the proposed model admits different kinds of incomplete ordinal statements, some preference elicitation questions can be easier to answer to than others. Furthermore, the statements differ in how conclusive dominance relations they produce. Hence, a possible direction for further research is to design elicitation procedures that address these issues by exploiting the characteristics of incomplete ordinal information. To avoid striving for unnecessarily strict statements and to allow different opinions in group settings, the elicitation procedures should admit ‘loose’ statements, which can be further specified by tightening the given statements or by introducing complementary numerical information along the lines discussed in Section 3.5. One specific elicitation procedure that could be examined in more detail is the classification procedure discussed in Section 4. The modeling ideas of incomplete ordinal information could be used in incomplete classification, in which alternatives can be assigned to several classes, for example: “This research proposal is either ‘good’ or ‘great’ with regard to international collaboration” (cf. e.g. Guo et al., 2007).
