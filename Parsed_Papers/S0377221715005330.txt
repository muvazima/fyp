                  A problem of profit oriented disassembly line design and balancing with possible partial disassembly and presence of hazardous parts is studied. The objective is to design a production line providing a maximal revenue with balanced workload. Task times are assumed to be random variables with known normal probability distributions. The cycle time constraints are to be jointly satisfied with at least a predetermined probability level. An AND/OR graph is used to model the precedence relationships among tasks. Several lower and upper–bounding schemes are developed using second order cone programming and convex piecewise linear approximation. To show the relevance and applicability of the proposed approach, a set of instances from the literature are solved to optimality.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Disassembly process plays a crucial role in material and product recovery. It is a required condition for an efficient treatment of end-of-life (EOL) products (Ilgin & Gupta, 2010, 2012). The objective of disassembly is to separate EOL products subassemblies and components for recycling, remanufacturing and reuse. To carry out disassembly operations with higher productivity rate, disassembly lines are used (Güngör & Gupta, 2002).

From practical point of view, disassembly process is more complex than assembly. In fact, in a disassembly environment, a product is broken down into several components and subassemblies whose quality, quantity and reliability cannot be controlled as in an assembly environment. The structure and quality of EOL products are strongly uncertain and even the number of components in such products can not be predicted. Moreover, an EOL product may contain certain hazardous material which necessitates special handling at a workstation of a disassembly line. Due to technical or economic restrictions such as irreversible connections of components of a product and low revenue obtained from retrieved parts, disassembly is usually a partial process (Lambert, 2002).

Because of the peculiarities given above, the design and balancing of disassembly lines (known as DLBP: disassembly line balancing problem), is a hard optimization problem and needs adapted solution methods. A disassembly line consists of an ordered sequence of workstations connected by a material handling system which is used to transport work–pieces from one workstation to another. As aforementioned, certain parts or subassemblies may be hazardous and require a particular treatment incurring a supplementary cost.

The studied optimization problem consists in assigning a given set of disassembly tasks (of an EOL product) to an ordered sequence of workstations, while respecting precedence and cycle time constraints. Cycle time constraints are to be jointly satisfied with at least a certain probability level (

                     ) fixed by the decision maker. Task times are assumed to be independent random variables with known normal probability distributions. The main objective is to maximize the profit produced by the line by optimizing the number of needed workstations of the line and the depth of the disassembly process. Subsequently, the idle times at workstations should be as smooth as possible.

Although the main purpose of this paper is to study stochastic DLBP, it is also shown that the obtained results remain valid for stochastic assembly line design and balancing problem (ALBP).

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the relevant literature on disassembly and assembly line design and balancing under uncertainty. A formal description of the studied problem is given in Section 3. Section 4 presents the developed solution approach. Numerical experiments and optimization results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper with future research directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

In this section, papers dealing with line design and balancing under uncertainty of the task processing times for both disassembly and assembly are discussed. In addition, problems that have studied the case of disassembly/assembly processing alternatives are reviewed.

Only limited studies in the literature have taken into account the task processing times variability that characterizes the disassembly context in DLBP. A fuzzy colored Petri net model with a heuristic solution method was proposed in Turowski and Morgan (2005) to study the human factors that cause uncertainty of task times. A collaborative ant colony algorithm for stochastic mixed–model U–shaped DLBP was developed in Agrawal and Tiwari (2006). Task times were assumed to be stochastic with known normal probability distributions. A binary bi–objective non linear program was developed in Aydemir-Karadag and Turkbey (2013) for DLBP under uncertainty of the task times. Task times were assumed to be independent random variables with known normal probability distributions.

Several mathematical models have also been developed for DLBP under uncertainty of task processing times. In Bentaha, Battaïa, and Dolgui (2014a), uncertainty was modeled using the notion of recourse cost and a sample average approximation method was developed to solve the studied optimization problem. In Bentaha, Battaïa, Dolgui, and Hu (2014d), uncertainty was modeled using workstation expectation times. In Bentaha, Battaïa, and Dolgui (2014b), a stochastic program was developed for the joint problem of disassembly line balancing and sequencing under uncertainty. In Bentaha, Battaïa, and Dolgui (2014c), a Lagrangian relaxation was proposed to maximize the disassembly line profit under task times variability where workstation expectation times are considered.

To model the possible disassembly process alternatives and precedence relationships among tasks, some of the existing papers have used directed graphs called AND/OR graphs. There are two types of such graphs: AND/OR graphs constituted of tasks and AND/OR graphs constituted of tasks and subassemblies. The first type is considered in (Altekin & Akkan, 2012; Altekin, Kandiller, & Ozdemirel, 2008; Güngör & Gupta, 2001, 2002), the second in (Bentaha et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2014c, 2014d; Koc, Sabuncuoglu, & Erel, 2009; Lambert, 1999). The latter which includes an explicit representation of subassemblies as well as tasks, is used in this paper. It is explained in detail in Section 3.

Even if uncertainty level is lower in assembly, however, different sources from the assembly environment may cause the task time variations, as for example, non qualified operators, machine failures, complex assembly tasks, etc. To deal with this uncertainty, the following models were proposed in the literature. Task times were assumed to be random variables with either known continuous probability distributions (Zhao, Liu, Ohno, & Kotani, 2007), or known or unknown symmetric probability distributions (Betts & Mahmoud, 1989; Raouf & Tsui, 1982), or known independent normal probability distributions. This third case has received quite some attention: earlier papers have focused on optimizing straight assembly lines where heuristic (Carter & Silverman, 1984; Chakravarty & Shtub, 1986; Fazlollahtabar, Hajmohammadi, & Es’haghzadeh, 2011; Kao, 1979; Lyu, 1997; Shin, 1990; Silverman & Carter, 1986), metaheuristic (Cakir, Altiparmak, & Dengiz, 2011; Erel, Sabuncuoglu, & Sekerci, 2005) and exact solution methods (Henig, 1986; Kao, 1976; Sarin, Erel, & Dar-el, 1999) were proposed. The case of ALBP with station paralleling was studied in (McMullen & Frazier, 1997). Optimization of U–lines was investigated in (Bagher, Zandieh, & Farsijani, 2011; Baykasoğlu & Özbakır, 2007; Chiang & Urban, 2006; Guerriero & Miltenburg, 2003; Özcan, Kellegöz, & Toklu, 2011). Two heuristic approaches to the assembly line re-balancing problem were developed in (Gamberini, Gebennini, Grassi, & Regattieri, 2009; Gamberini, Grassi, & Rimini, 2006). In Liu, Ong, and Huang (2005), the authors studied the problem of minimizing the cycle time of the line to be designed.

Robust balancing of assembly lines with interval task times and stability analysis of optimal solutions for ALBP have been proposed, respectively, in (Gurevsky, Hazır, Battaïa, & Dolgui, 2013b; Hazır & Dolgui, 2015) and (Gurevsky, Battaïa, & Dolgui, 2013a; Sotskov, Dolgui, & Portmann, 2006). Robust balancing of an assembly line with uncertain demand has been presented in Chica, Óscar Cordón, Damas, and Bautista (2013). For cycle time minimization, two robust models and exact solution method for ALBP with interval uncertainty for task times have been proposed in (Hazır & Dolgui, 2013).

Particularly, for the case of task times following known normal probability distributions, exact and heuristic approaches were designed to solve integer linear programs with disjoint probabilistic constraints, for straight and U–lines (Ağpak & Gökçen, 2007; Urban & Chiang, 2006) and two–sided lines (Özcan, 2010).

Modeling of process alternatives and precedence relationships among tasks for assembly line balancing is undertaken in (Capacho & Pastor, 2006, 2008). The authors introduced and defined a new graph using the notion of Alternative Subgraphs. To solve this problem, an exact approach has been proposed in Scholl, Boysen, and Fliedner (2009) and heuristic approaches in Capacho, Pastor, Dolgui, and Guschinskaya (2007). It should be noted that Alternative Subgraphs graph is exclusively constituted of tasks and does not represent the possible subassemblies as does AND/OR graph used in this study.

As it can be seen, joint satisfaction of cycle time constraints with a certain probability level has not been considered neither for DLBP nor for ALBP. The next section presents the developed formulation for the former problem that with some reduction can be also applied for latter problem.

The aim is to assign disassembly tasks from set I to an ordered sequence of workstations from set J, while satisfying precedence and cycle time constraints under uncertainty of the task processing times. The value of |J| represents the worst case for the number of workstations of the line. For a given problem instance, |J| corresponds to the number of tasks of the longest disassembly process alternative (longest in terms of number of tasks). The goal is to design a line providing the maximal profit and resulting in a number of stations

                      is the amount of time allocated to each station to complete its assigned tasks. It is the ratio of the planning period length to the number of products that need to be disassembled in order to meet the demand.

The following assumptions are used. A single type discarded product has to be partially (or completely) disassembled on a straight paced line. All received EOL items contain all initial parts with no addition or removing of components. Certain components of the EOL products are hazardous. A task can be performed at any workstation but cannot be split between two workstations. Task processing times are independent from the order in which the tasks are performed. Each component or subassembly has a certain non negative resale value but can be 0. A fixed cost per operating a time unit of an opened workstation and an additional fixed cost per operating a time unit for treating a hazardous part are given.

Task times are assumed to be mutually independent random variables with known normal probability distributions, i.e.

                     . The normal–distribution assumption is motivated by its several theoretical characteristics mainly, here, the central limit theorem. The results obtained for the lower and upper bounds can only be used for normal–distribution assumption of the workstation times. The time of a given workstation is the sum of processing times of the tasks assigned to it. This is particularly true for normal–distribution assumption of each task processing time. In the case of task times assumed to be random variables following a different probability distribution, the resulted time of each workstation is not guaranteed to be normally distributed for any number of tasks assigned to it. A disassembly task i ∈ H ⊂ I is called hazardous if its execution generates a hazardous subassembly or component. The additional time which could be generated by handling hazardous material is assumed to be taken into account while estimating processing times of the corresponding hazardous tasks.

All possible alternatives for the disassembly process and precedence relationships among tasks and subassemblies, for an EOL product, will be modeled by an AND/OR graph (Bentaha et al., 2013b; Koc et al., 2009). An example of such a graph for the disassembly of a piston and connecting rod (composed of 16 components) is given in Fig. 1. Each subassembly of an EOL product to be disassembled is represented by a node Ak, k ∈ K in the AND/OR graph and each disassembly task by a node Bi, i ∈ I. Set K contains the indices of all possible subassemblies that can be generated by the tasks from I.

Two types of arcs define the precedence relations between the subassemblies and tasks: AND–type and OR–type arcs. These arcs are represented in the graph with solid lines. For instance, if a task generates two subassemblies, or more, then it is related to these subassemblies by AND–type arcs. If, for a given subassembly, one or more tasks can be performed, but only one must be selected, this subassembly is related to these tasks by OR–type arcs. Table 1
                      summarizes all possible disassembly tasks that can be performed on the piston and connecting rod. For each task, the corresponding generated components and/or subassemblies are given. In order to handle the case of partial disassembly, where the product is not necessarily disassembled till obtaining single components, all tasks are connected (with dashed lines) to the dummy task 
                        s
                      introduced into the precedence graph in Fig. 1 as a sink node.

Only a subset I
                     * of set I is selected by the optimization procedure, therefore only the tasks of I
                     * have to be assigned to the workstations of the line. The level of disassembly depends on the profit generated by the corresponding line. The recycling or reuse of certain parts or subassemblies generates profit while the cost of operating opened workstations and additional cost incurred by the treatment of hazardous parts are considered as negative revenue.

The optimization procedure consists of two phases: (1) A number of workstations of the line to be designed is obtained while maximizing line profit. Cycle time constraints are jointly satisfied with at least a probability (
                        
                           1
                           −
                           α
                        
                     ). In this first phase, using piecewise linear approximation techniques, several second–order cone programming formulations are developed providing lower and upper bounds on the optimal profit of the line; (2) for the number of workstations obtained in phase 1, an optimal balance is determined. The goal of this second step is to study the impact of balancing the workstations workload on the probability of cycle time constraint satisfaction resulted from the first step.

Phase 1 consists of maximizing the profit of the line to be designed. The following Chance Constrained 0–1 Binary Program (CCBP) has been developed to formulate this problem.

                        The terms of the objective function represent, respectively, the earned profit of retrieved parts, the cost of operating workstations and the additional cost for handling hazardous parts. If the dummy task 
                           s
                         is assigned to a workstation j, then j defines the number of stations. Constraint (1) imposes the selection of only one disassembly task (OR–successor) to begin the disassembly process. Without loss of generality, we assume that at least one task is required for the disassembly process. Naturally, this task has to be selected from the alternative disassembly tasks realizable for the initial EOL product. Only one alternative has to be selected. The following disassembly options will be determined by the corresponding A-node and B-nodes connected to it. Constraint set (2) indicates that a task is to be assigned to at most one workstation. Constraints (3) ensure that only one OR–successor is selected. Constraint set (4) defines the precedence relationships among tasks and subassemblies. Constraint (5) imposes the assignment of the dummy task 
                           s
                         to one station. Constraints (6) ensure that all selected disassembly tasks are assigned to lower or equal–indexed workstations than the one to which

                         represents the number of opened workstations. Theoretically, the resulted program defines a simple ALBP of type 1 with stochastic task times and Joint Probabilistic Constraints (JPC–ALBP). Indeed, the simple ALBP of type 1 is defined as the minimization of the workstations number under AND–precedence relationships among tasks and cycle time constraints.

Along this paper, several lower and upper–bounding schemes will be developed for program (CCBP). From the results above, it follows that these same schemes will be applicable for the stochastic ALBP with joint probabilistic constraints.

Hence, although the probability mentioned above may decrease or increase, the optimal value of (CCBP) remains unchanged unless this possible decrease or increase of probability will be seen, respectively, as additional cost or profit.

The developed solution approach is detailed in the next section.

In this section, the computational complexity of (CCBP) is first established in subsection 4.1. Then, in order to solve program (CCBP), a lower and several upper–bounding schemes are proposed in subsection 4.2. The development of these schemes is based on convex piecewise linear approximation (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004; Magnani & Boyd, 2009) and second order cone programming (Alizadeh & Goldfarb, 2003; Lobo, Vandenberghe, Boyd, & Lebret, 1998; Nemirovski & Shapiro, 2007; Prékopa, Yoda, & Subasi, 2011).

Consider the special case of problem (CCBP) defined as follows: task times are deterministic, there is no hazardous task, profits of recovered parts are set to 0, the EOL product is completely disassembled and only one disassembly alternative exists, i.e. precedence relationships among tasks are restricted to AND ones. An instance of such a special case is described with a finite set

                         of tasks, task times

                        –hard problem.

Problems of chance constrained programming are widely studied in the literature (Blackmore, Ono, & Williams, 2011; Branda, 2012; DePaolo & Rader Jr., 2007; Liu, Wen, & Xu, 2013; Mesfin & Shuhaimi, 2010; Nemirovski, 2012; Poojari & Varghese, 2008; Reich, 2013; Shen, Smith, & Ahmed, 2010; Wang, Guan, & Wang, 2012; Watanabe & Ellis, 1994; Zhang & Li, 2011; Zorgati & Van Ackooij, 2011). A special case of linear programs with joint probabilistic constraints has been studied in Cheng and Lisser (2012). Coefficients of the constraint matrix were assumed to be normally distributed and the vector rows independent. In our case, the coefficients are the task times and each row vector is composed of the processing times of the tasks assigned to a workstation. It is clear that task times of stations are independent of each other since all task times are already assumed to be mutually independent. Therefore, the main results concerning lower and upper bounds of the continuous program studied in Cheng and Lisser (2012) remain valid for the problem (M–CCBP) with 0–1 binary variables.

                           Moreover, the optimal value of (SOCLB) is a lower bound of (M–CCBP); it is, then, an upper bound of (CCBP). This lower bound is based on the lower bound defined in Cheng and Lisser (2012) for continuous decision variables.

In this subsection, four approximations of (M–CCBP) will be defined, the value of each one represents an upper bound (a lower bound for (CCBP)). They are based on Bonferroni’s inequality (Galambos, 1977), Jagannathan’s approximation (Jagannathan, 1974), another approximation proposed in Cheng and Lisser (2012) and a variant of Bonferroni’s approximation.

                           The first upper bound approximation (SOCUB1) of (M–CCBP) is defined by replacing the (ak, bk
                           ) values in (SOCLB) by their values defined in (40). This approximation, based on the one given in Cheng and Lisser (2012), defines an upper bound of (M–CCBP) if

Problems (SOCLB), (SOCUB1), (SOCUB2), (SOCUB3), (SOCUB4) and (MMEW’) were implemented with MS Visual C++ 2008. ILOG CPLEX 12.4 was used to solve them on a PC with Pentium(R) Dual–Core CPU T4500, 2.30 Gigahertz and 3 Gigabyte RAM. These models have been applied to the problem instance illustrated in Fig. 1 and to five other instances available in the literature. The input data for each instance is given in Table 2. These instances are used as benchmarking problems and contain process alternatives for disassembly. The names of the problem instances are respectively composed of the first letters of authors’ names and the year of publication as follows: BBD13 represents a compass (Bentaha et al., 2013c), BBD13a is a piston and connecting rod (Bentaha et al., 2013a), KSE09 is just a sample product created by the authors in Koc et al. (2009), L99a and L99b are respectively a radio set and a ball-point pen (Lambert, 1999) and MJKL11 is an automatic pencil (Ma, Jun, Kim, & Lee, 2011). In Table 2
                     , the columns ‘AND–relations’ report the number of disassembly tasks with no successor in subcolumn ‘0’, with one AND–type arc in subcolumn ‘1’ and with two AND–type arcs in subcolumn ‘2’. The column ‘arcs’ gives the total number of AND–type and OR–type arcs.


                     Table 3 reports the results of phase 1 obtained for the studied instances using the proposed upper bound and the first lower bound of (CCBP), i.e. the symmetric optimal values of (SOCLB) and (SOCUB1), respectively. These two bounds will be called main bounds. The number of points for convex piecewise linear approximation was 15,

                      percent, 25 percent of the disassembly tasks were assumed to be hazardous and the first point of input data for piecewise approximation was 0.0001; all sampled points were equidistant. The remaining parameters were randomly generated.

Columns ‘UB’ and ‘LB’ report the upper and lower bound values, respectively. Column ‘Gap’ reports the optimality gap

The obtained results show that, for each problem instance, the line to be designed is composed of at least two workstations. However, a single workstation can be preferred in some cases as shown with instance KSE09. All instances were solved to optimality in short time.

                      is made in order to avoid infeasibility in solving program (SOCUB4).


                     Table 4 shows that the returned
                     
                      objective values for all instances were optimal for program (CCBP) except the objective value for instance KSE09. Programs (SOCUB2) and (SOCUB3) provided optimal values for all processed instances.

In order to analyze the impact of the number of points (or segments) of the piecewise linear functions used to approximate the non linear functions of problems (SOCLB) and (SOCUB1), the benchmark problems were solved for 5 points, 10 points and 20 points. The results have shown that even with 5 interpolation points, (SOCLB) and (SOCUB1) returned optimal objective values for (CCBP).


                     Table 5 reports the optimization results of the line balancing or idle time leveling phase. In this case, the problem (MMEW’) was solved. A reassignment of tasks (of line profit maximization phase) in line balancing phase is represented with value 1 in column ‘Reassignment’, it is 0 otherwise. This value is

As for DLBP, two phases were defined for the problem of simple assembly line design with joint probabilistic constraints (JPC–ALBP) introduced in Section 3. The first phase consists in minimizing the number of workstations, the second one in balancing the workload of the line derived from phase 1. The 25 used instances are available for users on the web site <http://alb.mansci.de>. The main parameters of the input data for each instance are given in Table 6; columns ‘|I|’, ‘|

Task times for all instances were assumed to be independent normal random variables with known means μi, i ∈ I and standard deviations σi, i ∈ I. The used means are the same as defined on the web site, while standard deviation values are equal to μi
                        /10, i ∈ I. The lower bound |

The optimization results of the idle time leveling phase are grouped in Table 8
                        . Only instances for which an optimal solution of the problem JPC–ALBP is found in 1 hour were considered. For all processed instances, except for instance Mertens, probabilities of jointly satisfying cycle time constraints were increased. In such cases, the solution of the second phase is preferred to the solution of the first phase since it defines the same objective value and a better balance of the stations workload. The obtained results have shown that although

The results above demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mathematical models and solution procedures both for disassembly and assembly lines. Limitations of the developed models concern mainly the normal distribution assumption for the disassembly task durations and their mutual independence. The further work should relax these assumptions.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, a profit oriented disassembly line design and balancing problem was studied. The cases of partial disassembly and the presence of hazardous material were integrated and disassembly task times were assumed to be random variables with known normal probability distributions. To solve the addressed problem with an assessment of solution quality, a two phases approach was considered. In the first phase, a mixed integer program with joint probabilistic constraints, along with one lower bound and four upper bounds, were proposed for the line design.

The developed lower and upper bounding schemes were based on second order cone programming and convex piecewise linear approximation. Cycle time constraints were to be jointly respected with at least a probability level fixed by the decision maker. At this phase, the goal was to maximize the line profit. In the second phase, a 0–1 binary linear programming formulation was developed in order to balance the workload along workstations for the line derived from the first phase.

It is shown, in this study, that under some assumptions the studied problem can be reduced to the assembly line balancing problem. For this reason, the developed optimization procedure can be also applied for the case of assembly.

This paper is the first work dealing with such chance constrained disassembly and assembly problems proposing a lower and several upper bounding schemes and efficient exact models. The developed models were evaluated using a set of instances from the literature. For the disassembly line design phase, all the problem instances were solved to optimality in a short amount of time. As an example, the radio set instance consisting of 30 tasks is solved to optimality in less than 1 second. The results of the line balancing phase showed that it is possible to balance the workload of the designed disassembly line and in the same time improve (increase) the probability of jointly satisfying the cycle time constraints. This fact is occurred with the piston and connecting rod instance, where the probability has passed from 98.0 percent in the line design phase to 98.5 percent in the line balancing phase.

The optimization results in the case of assembly confirmed those of disassembly, mainly, in the line balancing phase. In fact, it is shown that the probability of jointly satisfying cycle time constraints can be increased. In particular, for the 83 tasks instance, this probability has passed from 96.3 percent to 98.2 percent. In the line design phase, the minimal number of workstations for most of the 25 processed instances were determined within reasonable computation time. For example, the 148 tasks instance with cycle time value of 7 is solved in less than 10 minutes.

The optimization results showed that the proposed lower and upper bounding schemes help to solve optimally the defined problems for both assembly and disassembly problem instances.

For future research, a cutting–plane algorithm will be investigated and compared to the default interior point algorithm of the solver Cplex. Other industrial and real life instances for the case of disassembly will also be considered.
