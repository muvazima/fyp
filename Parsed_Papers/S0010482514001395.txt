                  A simulation based computational method was conducted to reflect the effect of intervention for those at high risk of type 2 diabetes. Hierarchy Support Vector Machines (H-SVMs) were used to classify high risk. The proportion transitioning from the high risk state to moderate state, low state or the normal state was calculated. When Body Mass Index (BMI) decreased by 5% (weight loss 3–5kg), the proportion of Class A transferring to a lower state was 15–25%, and risk also appeared reduced for Class B1. In Class C, when cholesterol (CHOL) was decreased by 2.5% (0.13–0.34mmol/L), 10–25% transitioned to a lower risk state. The method could help determine risk transition by the adjustment of sensitive risk factors. This might provide the basis for implementing intervention in cases in a high risk state.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Type 2 diabetes is a serious and expensive disease. Lifestyle intervention is effective and cost-effective from the perspective of the health system and society [1]. It is widely recognized that the incidence of type 2 diabetes is high and increasing gradually throughout the world. In order to predict the effect of intervention at the initial stage, simulated computational research was conducted. This research could provide effective guidance and improve the efficiency of intervention. Recent research demonstrates that the risk of type 2 diabetes can be reduced by successful lifestyle intervention [2–4]. Interventions such as weight loss and enhanced physical activity are significant predictors of risk reduction [5,6].

Lifestyle modification focused on modest weight loss (5–10%) and moderately intense physical activity could significantly reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes (by 58%, as shown in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)) and cardiometabolic risk factors in high-risk individuals [7,8]. The World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends strategies for the prevention of type 2 diabetes, which has a strong association with obesity [10]. Several intervention studies, in China (“Da-Qing Study”) [11,12], in Europe (“Malmo study” [13,14], “Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study” [15–17]) and in the United States (“Diabetes Prevention Program”) [18] have shown that lifestyle changes were able to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by around 50% among at-risk individuals. Rautio [19] assessed the predictors of success with lifestyle intervention (weight loss ≥5% and improved glucose tolerance) in individuals at high risk in a 1-year follow-up in a primary health care setting. The intervention period required a long time, usually six months to one year, or even much longer, until the study period was finished, before the effect of the intervention could be known.

The aim of this study was to simulate the effect of intervention in those at high risk of type 2 diabetes. According to their present health status, sensitive risk factors were adjusted, and the effect of intervention was simulated. At the same time, the importance of the sensitive risk factors was verified. This research could supply predictions of the effect of intervention in the early stages of intervention implementation. That might help to give effective guidance, improve the efficiency of the intervention, and save money.

The research was undertaken on 59,839 cross-sectional health examination records in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Mining Bureau and Public Security Bureau in Beijing, Xi׳an, Wuxi and Anyang in China from 2001 to 2008. The 59,839 cases included 34,377 men (57.40%) and 25,462 women (42.60%), all adults aged 20–84 years without diabetes. The outcome without diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of the 1997 criteria [20]. The specific distribution of subjects judged by gender and age is presented in 
                        Table 1. The validation data came from the Beijing Hospital Medical Center, including 1132 high risk subjects in 2007 and 2008, consisting of 59% men and 41% women. The validation data were independent of the experimental data.

The high risk state was identified using the risk state determination (RSD) system which was available at http://www.isclab.org/rsd/RSDAssess.php. The high risk criteria are shown in 
                        Table 2. A schematic diagram of the RSD system is shown in 
                        Fig. 1. In the RSD system, the inputs were risk factors such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Cholesterol (CHOL), Triglyceride (TG), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), age, etc., and the output was the risk state. The 6-year follow-up test result of the RSD system is given in 
                        Table 3. Four risk states were determined using RSD, including high risk, moderate risk, low risk and the normal state, as shown in 
                        Tables 4 and 
                        5.

The distribution of high risk subjects by gender and age is shown in

@&#METHODS@&#

The high risk state, the moderate risk state, the low risk state and the normal state are the four risk states of type 2 diabetes. Those in the high risk state have the highest risk of developing type 2 diabetes among these four states. Based on high risk cross-sectional data, a simulated computational method was proposed in this research. Qualitative analysis and quantitative calculation were combined to realize the high risk simulated computational model, and machine learning and mathematical statistics methods were applied to construct this model. Constructing subgroup attribution models by H-SVMs, sensitive risk factors were quantitatively adjusted in the corresponding subgroup. The high risk state was distributed into four subgroups: Class A; Class B1; Class B2 and Class C. Then we computed the transition state proportions from high risk to lower states (moderate risk, low risk and normal) separately. There were four main steps in the entire process: subgroup attribution; degree of intervention computation; RSD determination and statistical analysis.

In order to further refine the high risk state, three grades were divided through subgroup attribution. These were the high degree (Class A), moderate degree (Classes B1 and B2) and low degree (Class C). The process of generating the classification model is shown in 
                           Fig. 2.

According to the sensitivity calculation results [21], the sensitive risk factors for high risk subjects were determined. Sensitive risk factors have much more influence on changes in glucose than other factors and are presented in 
                              Table 7. The four subgroups had different sensitive risk factors and different high risk grades. Class A had the highest risk in the high risk state, followed by Classes B1, B2 and C.

The classification model was trained using the H-SVMs algorithm. At first, men >50 at high risk were divided into four classes: Class A, Class B1, Class B2 and Class C, as shown in 
                              Fig. 3. Class A was separated from the rest of subjects and used to generate model 1. Class A was separated from Classes B1, B2 and C. Similarly, Class B1 was trained to generate model 2. Class B1 was separated from Classes B2 and C. Then Class B2 was separated from Class C by model 3. The Weka 3.5.8 program was used to train the classification models. The training parameters were Gamme=0.50, Cost=1.00 and radial basis function kernel. The Gamme was related to the number of input factors. The three models had the same input. A default value of 1.00 for the Cost was usually used, and the radial basis function kernel was used to improve the classification precision. Thus, men ≤50, women >50 and women ≤50 at high risk were separately trained to generate classification models in the same way.

In order to determine the precision of the classification the models, validation data from Beijing Hospital Medical Center for the years 2007 and 2008 were input into the generated models. The results are shown in 
                              Table 8. In the Class A to B1, B2, and C model, TP was the number in Class A that was predicted as Class A, TN was the number in Classes B1, B2 and C that was predicted as Classes B1, B2 and C, P was the number in Class A, and N was the number in Classes B1, B2 and C. The mathematical formulation of the classification precision is as follows:
                                 
                                    (1)
                                    
                                       classification
                                       
                                       precision
                                       
                                       =
                                       
                                          
                                             TP
                                             +
                                             TN
                                          
                                          
                                             P
                                             +
                                             N
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           

A similar definition was applied to the other models, such as Classes B1 and B2, the C model and Class B2 to C model.

The ROC curve reflected the balance between the sensitivity and specificity of the model. The area under the curve could be used to assess the classification precision. The closer the area was to 1.00, the higher the classification precision. ROC curves for the other models were achieved in the same way. The ROC curve of high risk men >50 is given in 
                              Fig. 4, reflecting the sensitivity and specificity of the Class A to B1, B2, C model.

The sensitivity was the ratio of Class A that was predicted as Class A. The mathematical formulation is as follows (the definitions of TP and P are the same as in formulation (1)):
                                 
                                    (2)
                                    
                                       sensitivity
                                       =
                                       
                                          
                                             TP
                                          
                                          P
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           

The specificity was the ratio of Classes B1, B2 and C that was predicted as Classes B1, B2 and C. The mathematical formulation is as follows, where the definitions of TN and N are the same as in formulation (1):
                                 
                                    (3)
                                    
                                       specificity
                                       =
                                       
                                          
                                             TN
                                          
                                          N
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           

According to gender and age, high risk subjects were divided into men >50, men ≤50, women >50 and women ≤50, and these four subgroups were divided into Class A, Class B1, Class B2 and Class C separately. So 16 subgroups of high risk subjects were achieved. The classification results are presented in 
                              Table 9.

The calculated average values of sensitive risk factors are shown in 
                              Table 10. The order of the risk factors in these subgroups was according to their order of sensitivity. In the men >50 subgroup, BMI in Class A was higher than in other classes, and CHOL in Class C was higher than in other classes. The men ≤50, women >50 and women ≤50 subgroups showed a similar phenomenon. As shown in Table 9, the subject number of Class C was limited and some risk factors values were high, which caused high average values in Class C.

The degree of intervention was the reasonable adjustment value of sensitive risk factors in the subgroups. In the realistic intervention [2], the incidence of type 2 diabetes can be reduced through adjusting risk factors by lifestyle intervention. Thus in this simulation, if the high risk state changed, the sensitive risk factors should be adjusted to reasonable values.

The sensitive risk factor was adjusted. And the proportions at risk who either retained their high risk status or transitioned to a state of lower risk state were calculated. In high risk men >50 Class A, the sensitive risk factors (BMI, TG and Waist), as shown in Table 7, were decreased by 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively, at the same time. If two or more conditions including BMI≥25kg/m2, TG≥1.70mmol/L or Waist≥90cm were satisfied, these abnormal factors would be decreased simultaneously. The flow diagram is shown in 
                           Fig. 5. After decreasing BMI, TG and Waist, the subject was input into the RSD system. Then the proportion of high risk men >50 Class A making a transition was computed separately.

Then every risk factor was adjusted by 2.5%, 5% and 10%, one by one. At first, BMI was decreased by 2.5%, 5% and 10%. The flow diagram is shown in 
                           Fig. 6. Then the adjusted subjects were input into the RSD system. We computed the proportion who retained their high risk state or transitioned to a state of lower risk (moderate risk, low risk and normal group). Then TG was decreased by 2.5%, 5% and 10%. The proportion of state transfer was calculated. Finally, waist was decreased by 2.5%, 5% and 10%. The flow diagram is shown in Fig. 6. Then the proportion of the high risk subjects making a transition was computed separately.

In high risk men >50 Class B1 the same adjustment was done. In high risk men >50 Class C, CHOL was decreased 2.5%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%. Then we calculated the proportion of Class C which either retained their high risk state or transitioned to a lower risk state.

Similar adjustments were done in high risk men ≤50, women >50 and women ≤50.

After adjusting the sensitive risk factors, the subjects in different subgroups were determined using the RSD system. The status of high risk subjects might shift to a lower state (moderate risk or low risk) or remain at high risk. The number of subjects retaining their high risk or transferring to a lower risk state was recorded separately in every subgroup.

A statistical analysis of the determined subjects was conducted. The risk transition state proportion of the high risk transferring to a lower risk or retaining their high risk status was computed after adjusting the sensitive risk factors. The transition state results are given in Section 3.

@&#RESULTS@&#

To explore suitable adjustment values of sensitive risk factors and compute the transition state proportion, the sensitive risk factors were attempted to change. In high risk Class A including four groups (men >50, men ≤50, women >50 and women ≤50), sensitive risk factors were first adjusted by 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% at the same time, and then the sensitive risk factors in these four groups were changed by 2.5%, 5% and 10%, one by one. In high risk Class B1, the sensitive risk factors were also adjusted. In high risk Class B2, only GLU>5.85mmol/L; the other risk factors were normal. Thus, it was advised to retest GLU and 2-h postprandial glucose in this subgroup. In high risk Class C, CHOL was reduced by 2.5%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%.

To prove the effectiveness of the front three sensitive risk factors, the adjustment results between the front three risk factors and the back three risk factors were compared. In detail, the proportion keeping their high risk state and the proportion transitioning from a high risk to a lower risk state or the normal state were compared. After adjustment, the least sensitive subjects who still retained their high risk Class A status were analyzed. The abnormal proportions of different risk factors in the most sensitive subjects, whose risk status changed from high risk Class A to low risk or the normal state were computed.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

When adjusting sensitive risk factors in different subgroups simultaneously, the simulation computation was conducted at the same time. The number and proportion of high risk Class A in a transition state are presented in 
                        Table 11.

In the high risk Class A group, when the sensitive risk factors were decreased by 5% simultaneously, we found that approximately 70–81% of the subjects retained their high risk status and 19–30% transitioned to a lower state. According to the data statistics, most weight was in the range of 60–100kg. If the intervention period was a half year, the weight loss would be 3–5kg. When it was decreased by 10% at the same time, 54–73% of subjects retained their high risk status and 27–46% transitioned to a lower state. Weight loss was 6–10kg.

According to Table 7, BMI was the sensitive risk factor in the Class A of men >50, men ≤50, women >50 and women ≤50 groups. When only BMI was reduced in the high risk Class A group, the number and proportion in a transition state are presented in 
                        Table 12.

When BMI was reduced by 2.5%, 85–92% subjects kept high risk state and 8–15% transitioned to the lower states. When BMI was changed by 5%, 75–85% kept high risk state and 15–25% transitioned to the lower states. The weight loss was 3–5kg. However, when BMI was reduced by 10%, 28–32% transitioned to the lower states.

According to Table 7, in high risk men >50 Class A group, TG was the sensitive risk factor. When TG was changed in this group, the number and proportion of transition state populations changed as shown in Supplementary Table 1. When TG was reduced by 2.5%, 1.7% subjects transitioned to lower states (moderate risk state and normal state). These proportions were 4.46% and 10.23% when TG changed by 5% and 10%, respectively. Thus, when TG was reduced, the proportion of transition state to the lower states was less than the proportion of BMI adjustment. Moreover, reducing TG was more difficult than reducing BMI, even requiring medication.

In high risk men >50 Class A group, women >50 Class A group and women≤50 Class A group, Waist was a sensitive risk factor. The number and proportion of transition state populations are shown in Supplementary Table 2. When Waist was reduced by 5%, 4.6–6.6% of subjects transitioned to a lower state. And when Waist was reduced 10%, approximately 10% of subjects transitioned to a lower state.

In high risk men ≤50 Class A group and women >50 Class A group, CHOL was the sensitive risk factor and the number and the proportion of transition states are shown in Supplementary Table 3. When CHOL reduced 5%, 9–22% subjects transitioned to lower states. In the men ≤50 Class A group, the transition state proportion improved a lot, reaching 23%. So reducing CHOL in high risk men ≤50 Class A group might be more effective.

Therefore, in high risk Class A, when BMI was reduced 5% or 3–5kg weight was lost, 15–25% transitioned from the high risk state to lower states. And the factors TG, Waist and CHOL would be reduced as well, with BMI decreasing.

In the high risk Class B1 groups, GLU was >5.85mmol/L. When GLU was >5.85mmol/L, the risk determination rule of RSD was that the subjects were determined as high risk directly, except those with 6.0mmol/L >GLU>5.85mmol/L, age >60, BMI<26kg/m2 and without family history of diabetes who were determined as in the low risk state. Thus, in the high risk Class B1 groups, most of the subjects could not satisfy the exception condition. In the simulated computation study, even if we changed the sensitive risk factors, GLU was still >5.85mmol/L. However in the actual intervention study, changes in risk factors would bring changes in GLU. When GLU was less than 5.85mmol/L, the subjects could not be directly determined to be high risk state in the RSD system and the risk state would change from high risk to a lower risk state. This was a shortcoming in the simulated computation. According to the sensitive risk factors of Class B1, BMI was the common risk factor. Combining the experiment results of Class A, it might be feasible that BMI was reduced 5%. And the weight loss was 3–5kg.

In the high risk B2 Class, the risk factors were normal, only GLU>5.85mmol/L. We advised to retest GLU and 2-h postprandial glucose in this subgroup.

In high risk men >50 Class C, men ≤50 Class C and women ≤50 Class C, CHOL was the sensitive risk factor. The number and proportion in transition states are shown in 
                        Table 13. Because in Class C, GLU≤5.85mmol/L and sensitive risk factor was abnormal, the number of subjects that met them was not large. The proportion transitioning from the high risk state to a lower state was made more significant by reducing CHOL. When CHOL was decreased by 2.5%, 10–25% of subjects transitioned to a lower state.

From the analysis of the above high risk transition state, we could determine the degree of intervention of the sensitive risk factors and the proportion in the high risk state transferring to lower risk states in these 16 subgroups. The results are shown in 
                        Table 14. In this table, the proportion of Class A, Class B1, Class B2 and Class C occupying the high risk category are shown as well.

In order to illustrate the adjustment effectiveness of the front three risk factors, the adjustment between the front three and the back three risk factors was compared. When the front three risk factors were adjusted simultaneously, the proportion of populations still in the high risk state was less than the proportion when the back three risk factors were adjusted together. The proportion distribution is presented in 
                        Table 15.

In the above four groups (men >50, men ≤50, women >50 and women ≤50), when the front three risk factors were adjusted by 5%, the average proportion still in the high risk state was 14.97% lower than when the back three were adjusted by the same amount. Especially in women >50, this proportion was 23.43% lower. And in men ≤50, this proportion was 18.22% lower. Therefore, adjusting the front three risk factors was easier to cause the transition state (from the high risk state to moderate state, low risk state or normal state) than adjusting the back three risk factors.

In 
                        Table 16, we present that the proportion in transition (from the high risk state to the low risk state or the normal state) of adjusting the front three risk factors was higher than adjusting the back three risk factors. It illustrates that the front three factors are more sensitive than the back three risk factors.

In the high risk Class A subgroup, after we adjusted the front three risk factors, the subjects which were still kept high risk Class A state (the least sensitive subjects) are given in 
                        Table 17.

In the keeping high risk Class A men >50 subgroup, the initial values of BMI and TG were high in the front three risk factors. No matter TG was reduced 5%, 10%, 15% or 20%, TG was still higher than 1.70mmol/L. In this keeping high risk Class A subgroup, after BMI was reduced by 20%, the BMI in all was still larger than 25kg/m2; after BMI was decreased by 15%, 83.33% were larger than 25kg/m2; after BMI was decreased by 10%, 90.38% subjects were larger than 25kg/m2; after BMI was reduced 5%, 93.09% subjects were larger than 25kg/m2.

In the keeping high risk Class A men ≤50 subgroup, the primitive values of CHOL and BMI were high in the front three risk factors. No matter CHOL was decreased 5%, 10%, 15% or 20%, CHOL was still higher than 5.18mmol/L. After BMI reducing 20% still keeping high risk Class A, the BMI were all still larger than 25kg/m2; After BMI reducing 15%, 91.78% subjects׳ BMI were larger than 25kg/m2 in keeping high risk Class A subgroup. After BMI reducing 10%, 91.74% subjects׳ BMI were larger than 25kg/m2 in keeping high risk Class A subgroup. After BMI reducing 5%, 95.93% subjects׳ BMI were larger than 25kg/m2 in this group.

In the keeping high risk Class A women >50 subgroup, the primitive values of CHOL and BMI were high in the front three risk factors. No matter CHOL was reduced 5%, 10%, 15% or 20%, CHOL was still higher than 5.18mmol/L. After BMI reducing by 20% or 15%, the subjects׳ BMI were all still larger than 25kg/m2 in the keeping high risk Class A subgroups. After BMI was reduced by 10%, 93% of the subjects׳ BMI were larger than 25kg/m2 in keeping high risk Class A subgroup. After BMI was reduced by 5%, 93.95% of the subjects׳ BMI were larger than 25kg/m2 in keeping high risk Class A subgroup.

In the keeping high risk Class A women ≤50 subgroup, the primitive values of BMI were high in the front three risk factors. No matter BMI was reduced by 5%, 10%, 15% or 20%, BMI was still higher than 25kg/m2.

Therefore, in the least sensitive and GLU≤5.85mmol/L subjects who were still keep high risk Class A state, were mainly caused by primitive values being high in the front three risk factors. This indicates that adjusting the front three factors were more effective than adjusting the back three factors.

The most sensitive subjects were those whose risk state changed from high risk Class A state to low risk or normal state after adjustment. The abnormal proportions of different risk factors are presented in Supplementary Table 4. The abnormal standards were BMI≥25kg/m2, TG≥1.70mmol/L, Waist≥90cm (men) and Waist≥80cm (women), CHOL≥5.18mmol/L, DBP≥90mmHg, HDL≤1.03mmol/L (men) and HDL≤1.29mmol/L (women). The risk factors were arranged according to the order of sensitivity as mentioned in Supplementary Table 4.

In the most sensitive subgroups presented in Supplementary Table 4, with the proportion of adjustment increasing, the abnormal proportion of the front three risk factors became lower and the abnormal proportion of the back three risk factors changed relatively little.

All in all, adjusting the front three risk factors was more effective than adjusting the back three risk factors in the high risk Class A transition state.

@&#EVALUATION@&#

Validation data, which came from the Beijing Hospital Medical Center in 2007 and 2008 were used to evaluate this simulated computation method. The high risk distribution is shown in Supplementary Table 5. Adjusting the sensitive risk factors according to Table 14, and the proportions in the transition state are shown in 
                     Table 18. The transition state proportions of Class A and Class C at high risk were in the range of 15–25% (Class A) and 10–25% (Class C). This was consistent with the result of the simulation computation.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this research, a computational method was proposed. It aimed to simulate the effect of intervention on type 2 diabetes. Adjusting the sensitive risk factors of subgroups in the high risk state, the proportions transitioning from the high risk state to lower risk states were obtained using simulation computation. Thus, the effect of intervention could be simulated in the high risk state. The feasibility of the sensitive risk factors adjustment was proved through a comparison between the front three and the back three risk factors. The degree of intervention of the sensitive risk factors in different subgroups was simulated. The results accorded with the medical rule, which conversely proved the effectiveness of the subgroup attribution method. The Finnish National Diabetes Prevention Program (FIN-D2D) [8] research indicated that moderate weight loss in this very high-risk group was especially effective in reducing the risk of diabetes among those participating in the program, to investigate 1-year outcomes of a national diabetes prevention program in Finland. The relative risk of diabetes was 0.31 (95% CI 0.16–0.59) in the group who lost ≥5% of their weight, 0.72 (0.46–1.13) in the group who lost 2.5–4.9% of their weight, and 1.10 (0.77–1.58) in the group who gained ≥2.5% compared with the group who maintained weight. The Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group [18] did a lifestyle modification program with the goals of at least a 7% weight loss and at least 150min of physical activity per week. The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58% and metformin by 31%, as compared with placebo. The lifestyle intervention was therefore significantly more effective than metformin.

In this research, in high risk Class A, when BMI decreased 5% or the weight loss was 3–5kg, the transition state from the high risk state to a lower state was 15–25%. Lifestyle modification advice was given in the application, such as 3–4 sessions of physical exercise (20–30min per session) per week and controlling the diet. The physical exercise combined aerobic and anaerobic exercise. And we advised eating every meal 70–80% full. In high risk Class B1, it might be feasible that BMI was reduced 5% and the weight loss was 3–5kg. In high risk Class C, when CHOL was reduced 2.5% (0.13–0.34mmol/L), 10–25% of subjects transitioned to a lower state.

The limited sensitive risk factors were adjusted in the research; however in practice, once the sensitive risk factors were changed, other risk factors would have changed as well. This made the transition state proportion higher in practice than the simulated computation. However, changing the multivariate sensitive risk factors would be closer to the reality. Therefore, the simulated computation could supply the theoretical basis for the targeted intervention. And it would improve the intervention efficiency.

The high risk state subjects were analyzed; however, we did not know whether the moderate and low risk states needed intervention, or how effective an intervention would be. Thus, in future work, this research can be conducted. Because of time limitations, only the simulated computation was done. The actual intervention will be carried out in the next step of the work to verify the simulation computation.
