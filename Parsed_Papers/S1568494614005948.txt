                  In this paper, the Thyristor-Controlled Series-Compensated (TCSC) devices are located for congestion management in the power system by considering the non-smooth fuel cost function and penalty cost of emission. For this purpose, it is considered that the objective function of the proposed optimal power flow (OPF) problem is minimizing fuel and emission penalty cost of generators. A hybrid method that is the combination of the bacterial foraging (BF) algorithm with Nelder–Mead (NM) method (BF-NM) is employed to solve the OPF problems. The optimal location of the TCSC devices are then determined for congestion management. The size of the TCSC is obtained by using of the BF-NM algorithm to minimize the cost of generation, cost of emission, and cost of TCSC. The simulation results on IEEE 30-bus, modified IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test system confirm the efficiency of the proposed method for finding the optimal location of the TCSC with non-smooth non-convex cost function and emission for congestion management in the power system. In addition, the results clearly show that a better solution can be achieved by using the proposed OPF problem in comparison with other intelligence methods.
