                  To meet the main requirements of output displacement, bandwidth frequency and accuracy in noncircular turning, a fast tool servo (FTS) system based on piezoelectric (PZT) voltage feedback is developed. A flexure hinge structure is designed to amplify the output of PZT actuator and topology optimization is done to reduce the mass and compliance of the structure so that the output displacement and response frequency of FTS can be improved. A compound controller, into which repetitive techniques, PI and feed-forward control, are introduced, and the method that PZT voltage of the actuator is treated as feedback are put forward. The feasibility and reliability of this system are proved well by turning experiments.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In industrial applications, many workpieces with an irregular surface are much better in improving the performance than traditionally flat or cylindrical ones. For instance, piston skirt and pinhole are noncircular surfaces in order to obtain more uniform pressure and improve the bearing capacity [1,2], and bearing rings also do not have a shape of a cylindrical surface in the machining process to diminish the effect of clamping forces [3].

Fast tool servo (FTS) plays a key role in free-form (non-axisymmetric) surface machining, noncircular turning, and can be used in conjunction with traditional machine tools, e.g. NC lathe, to accomplish machining the asymmetric geometric feature of these surfaces with respect to spindle rotation. For instance, the shape of the piston skirt is not a perfect cylinder, but middle convex in axial section and varying ellipse in cross section.

                      is the profile of noncircular section of a piston at a certain height of the piston skirt, typically, an ellipse curve. The radial feeding of a cutting tool is

                        R
                        −

                        ]
                     , 
                        R
                      is the long axis of ellipse, 
                        r
                      is the short axis of ellipse, 
                        θ
                      is the rotational degree, and 
                        θ
                        =
                        2
                        π
                        ω
                        t
                        /
                        60
                     , where 
                        ω
                      is the spindle speed in rpm.

In order to meet the requirements of noncircular turning or boring, FTS has to have large low frequency output displacement, high small signal bandwidth. In gasoline piston skirt turning, the output displacement of FTS is over 
                        300
                        
                        μ
                        m
                      and the tool feeding frequency is 
                        f
                        =
                        2
                        ω
                        /
                        60
                     . When the spindle speed is 3000rpm, the response frequency of FTS, in which FTS will accurately respond to a control signal, is at least 100Hz.

The methods of actuating FTS fall into the following categories: piezoelectric [4–6], magnetostrictive [7], Lorentz force which includes permanent magnet motors, voice coil and linear motor [8–11], and electromagnetic [12,13].

Piezoelectric (PZT) actuators with their infinite resolution, high stiffness and high frequency are widely used in many areas. Otherwise, because the maximum output displacement of the stacked actuator, d
                     33 type, is only 1/1000 of their length, and it has to be amplified to meet the long-travel requirement. A flexure-hinge structure is designed to magnify the output displacement of the PZT actuator.

Though the PZT actuator can be much increased in the output displacement, the whole FTS also in mass due to the amplifying structure is incorporated in it. The response frequency of FTS heavily depends upon the mass and the stiffness of tool holder and servo, in this paper, optimization is done to reduce the whole mass for bettering its frequency bandwidth. The controller, which employs the repetitive control techniques based on PZT voltage feedback and supplies high dynamic stiffness to the tool feeding mechanism, is put forward.

The maximum stress of amplifying structure is on the free edge of a right circular flexure hinge [14], and is reversely dependent on its stiffness under the same deforming. The principles of design are to keep the maximum stress as low as possible and to obtain the maximum stiffness on the basis of having the output displacement satisfied in noncircular piston turning. These principles can also ensure the system to have higher natural frequency and better anti-vibration capability.


                     Fig. 2
                      is the schematic diagram of FTS. The structure based on the right circular flexure hinge is used to amplify the output of the PZT actuator. Because of the asymmetry of the amplifying structure, the tool feeding pathway is not only mainly in the Y direction but also very slightly in the X direction, and this effect is diminished by the round flexure hinge on the tool bar. Both the main cutting force F
                     
                        z
                      and the feed force F
                     
                        x
                      are carried by linear bearing. The thrust force F
                     
                        y
                     , which is transferred to the amplifying mechanism, is about 300N when the maximum amount of feeding is 0.5mm.

The flexure hinge is an elastic joint, which connects rigid bodies or links, for small displacement. The flexure hinge is relatively slender, and often used to develop a compliant mechanism, when compared with other parts in the compliant mechanism. It functions as a rotational joint, however, without friction, wear and backlash.

The right circular flexure hinge [15–17] is precise in rotation, and its rotation center does not displace as other types of flexure hinge, and it is always treated as a torsional spring only around the Z-axis, see Fig. 3
                        . In the right circular flexure hinge, 
                           t
                           /
                           R
                         ratio (t is the neck thickness, R is the radius) is a very important factor, and different compliance equations should be chosen at different 
                           t
                           /
                           R
                         ratios to obtain more accurate result [18].

The force analysis of flexure-hinge amplifying structure is illustrated in Fig. 4
                        . The flexure hinges are simplified as rotational spring, and PZT actuator as a spring–mass structure.

Thus, the undamped natural frequency of amplifying structure is as below:

According to the above analysis, the stiffness of this FTS is mainly dependent on the stiffness of amplifying structure and the contact stiffness between PZT actuator and amplifying structure. The response frequency of this FTS is heavily determined by the mass of amplifying structure attached to PZT actuator, though the frequency bandwidth of PZT actuator is relatively high. To increase the response frequency, a topology optimization for compliance optimization should be done on the amplifying structure to reduce its mass and to increase its modal frequency.

Topology optimization is started with the landmark paper of Bendsoe and Kikuchi [19], and a SIMP method is used in this paper. In topology optimization, a finite element analysis must be carried out in each iteration. From iteration to iteration, the properties of each finite element in a designed space such as Young's modulus and density are modified until the optimization objectives are fulfilled.

In this finite model, except for the yellow part which is the undesign space, the other is design space in which the element density could be changed during each iteration:

                         is the compliance and the modal frequency of the structure from iteration to iteration, the minimum compliance and the maximum modal frequency are achieved at last. Actually, the process technique of the structure should be taken into account, for the optimization result is not a real part which can be manufactured.

Some parameters of original amplifying structure are compared to the redesigned one in Table 1
                        . The modal frequency increased from 219.3Hz to 305.5Hz, the mass decreased from 2.399kg to 1.866kg and the maximum stress increased slightly. The main geometric parameters of amplifying structure are R=4mm, t=2mm, b=40mm, L
                        1=68mm and B=3.

Because of the hysteresis of PZT, an appropriate mathematic model has to be established in order to achieve high control quality but not to result in a very complicated control structure and algorithm. The periodic feature of noncircular turning should be taken into account when the controller is designed.

Piezoelectric actuator can be modeled as the linear lumped second order mechanical system by both the linear piezoelectric equation and Newton's law. Its mathematic model is the following:

In noncircular turning, both input reference and main disturbance are periodic so the tracking precision of periodic command has to be taken into account.

Repetitive control is put forward by Inoue et al. [20] and based on internal model principle [21]. In a stable system, an internal model is employed to generate a periodic signal which has the same period with input reference so that the system could track an external periodic signal asymptotically. Any signal with period of L will be generated by a time-delay system possessing positive feedback. In noncircular turning,

                        . Since not any order of frequency can be tracked in practice, a low-pass filter, F(s), is incorporated to stabilize the system:

Because the feed-forward control is an open-loop control for the measurable disturbance, it does not change the characteristics of the feedback control system. Theoretically, a feed-forward control method can be used to eliminate the main error caused by disturbance.

Piezoelectric ceramic has not only an actuator function but also a sensor function, the electric potential is varying when external forces are exerted on it. This piezoelectric voltage is treated as a feedback, the relationship between output displacement and piezoelectric voltage is as below:

Because the contact stiffness between amplifying structure and PZT actuator is another key factor that affects the bandwidth frequency of FTS, the PZT actuator should be preloaded.

A high resolution laser displacement sensor (LC-2401, Keyence Co.) is used to measure the static output displacement of FTS with piezoelectric voltage feedback, the open-loop and close-loop results are shown in Fig. 11
                     . The maximum output displacement of the FTS is 
                        442

                        m
                      and close-loop accuracy of it is 
                        2

The cutting tool's movement can be decomposed into combinations of movements in radial and axial orientation. Not only does the control system guarantee the combined tool's movements in line, but also does it achieve the real-time control according to the discretized data of the noncircular surface. Due to tremendous computational intensity, a control card which has a DSP chip, DSP-TMS320C32, has to be used. The radial movement of the cutting tool is a function of the rotational angle, and an 8-bit photoelectric encoder is also utilized to measure the rotational angle.

In turning process, a sinusoidal signal is used as an input reference to detect the capability of tracking periodic signal. The frequency of reference is a sinusoidal signal with 100Hz frequency, 
                        400
                        
                        μ
                        m
                      peak-to-peak amplitude and the sampling frequency is 12.8kHz when the spindle speed is 3000rpm. The result and error of PI controller tracking the sinusoidal signal are shown in Figs. 12 and 13
                     
                     , respectively. When repetitive controller is being introduced into the controller, the result of tracking sinusoidal signal is much better, and tracking error is attenuated and less than 
                        3
                        
                        μ
                        m
                      after tens of periods, see Fig. 14
                     , and it is much better than the error of the PI controller. The experimental results also indicate that the feed-forward control is useful in inhibiting the disturbances.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In noncircular piston turning process, a new FTS based on piezoelectric voltage feedback is developed. This paper details not only in prototype of a flexure hinge structure and its optimization design but also in controller design that a repetitive control is employed to improve the tracking capability of periodic reference, PI to eliminate the steady state error, and the system is simplified by using PZT voltage. The experimental results indicate that compound control method, which is based on repetitive, feed-forward control and traditional PI, is effective. This system is feasible and reliable.
