                  An equivalent multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear model of the standard transceiver for OFDM/OQAM systems is derived. Specifically, the impulse response of the equivalent filter that determines the effect on each output of the symbol sequence transmitted on each subcarrier, both with reference to AWGN and multipath channels, is obtained. The derived model is exploited for the design of the optimum single-tap per-subcarrier equalizer according to the maximum signal-to-interference ratio criterion. It is shown that the optimum single-tap equalizer in the absence of guard subcarriers is the inverse of a specific coefficient of an impulse response of the derived MIMO model. This coefficient under particular conditions leads to the conventionally used single-tap equalizer given by the inverse of the channel frequency response at the frequency of the considered subcarrier. The effects of guard subcarriers and the inclusion of the noise term in the cost function are also studied.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the last years, filter-bank based multicarrier (FBMC) systems have been considered for high data-rate transmissions over both wired and wireless frequency-selective channels. One of the most famous multicarrier modulation techniques is orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), other known types of FBMC systems are filtered multitone systems [1] and OFDM based on offset QAM modulation (OQAM) [2] whose use has been suggested in many scenarios [3].

While the OFDM approach inserts the cyclic prefix after the IFFT, OFDM/OQAM systems (aiming at improving the spectral efficiency) do not use it. Then, in order to combat the effects of frequency-selective channels, they complement the IFFT with a set of digital subchannel filters, obtained by complex modulation of a single filter, usually called polyphase network (PPN). The use of the PPN implies some fundamental differences between OFDM and OFDM/OQAM systems [3]: e.g., the adoption in the latter case of pulse shaping filters very well localized in time and frequency [4–6].

In this paper we derive an equivalent model of the OFDM/OQAM standard transceiver with multiple inputs and outputs. Its inputs are represented by the symbol sequences transmitted on each active subcarrier; the outputs of such a model are the sequences of the decision variables used for final decisions at the receiver outputs. The derived model, which is exact and not approximate, provides an expression for the impulse response of the equivalent filter that determines the effect on each subcarrier output of the symbol sequence transmitted on each subcarrier, both with reference to AWGN and multipath channels; moreover, the complete characterization of the equivalent noise process is provided. A similar model has been derived in [7,8] and [4]. However, the equivalent model in [7] is explicitly expressed only with reference to the asymptotic approximation of a large number of subcarriers, the model in [8] is not explicitly derived but some of its properties are directly used for channel estimation, and, finally, in the model described in [4] the existence of the linear relation is clearly shown but the analytic expressions of the overall impulse responses are not derived. Moreover, in [7] and [4] the characterization of the additive disturbance depending on the channel noise is neglected.

The obtained equivalent model is exploited for the design of the optimum (according to the maximum signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) criterion) single-tap per-subcarrier equalizer for OFDM/OQAM systems, which can be easily implemented in practice and is considered important for maintaining a step-by-step equivalence between OFDM/OQAM and OFDM complexities. It is shown that the optimum single-tap equalizer in the absence of guard subcarriers is simply the inverse of a specific coefficient of an impulse response of the derived model. This coefficient under particular conditions leads to the conventionally used single-tap equalizer given by the inverse of the channel frequency response at the considered subcarrier frequency. Moreover, the effects of guard subcarriers and the inclusion of the noise term in the cost function are studied.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the OFDM/OQAM standard transceiver is recalled and, in Section 3, its equivalent model is derived. In Section 4 the optimum single-tap equalizer is derived, in Section 5 some realistic issues related to the implementation of the proposed methods are considered, and in Section 6 some simulation results are reported. Finally, in the conclusions, the main results are summarized.

                            When the expression (29) is taken into account, the conditions (5b) and (5c) imposed to the prototype filter imply the condition in the right-hand side of (30) and, therefore, guarantee the optimality of the receiver (20) on AWGN channel; this is well known in the literature (see [6], for example).

The expression of the deterministic term on multipath channel is obtained by resorting to (25) and (26):

Moreover, it allows to derive the standard implementation of the zero-forcing single-tap per-subcarrier equalizer [17]. In fact, from (31) it follows that, on the kth subcarrier, the coefficient multiplying the useful term

The overall model (31) describes the effects determined at the receiver output by the multipath channel. However, it is interesting to note that the same model can also describe the case where a prefilter is applied at the transmitter output in order to reduce the channel distortion under the assumption that the transmitter knows the channel state. In such a case, therefore, the pulse 
                              h
                              [
                              ⋅
                              ]
                            in (32) describes the cascade of the prefilter (at the transmitter output) and the multipath channel. Consequently, the derived model can also be exploited in scenarios similar to that considered in [18] where the prefilter optimization is considered. However, we consider in the next sections only the case where the pulse 
                              h
                              [

                              ]
                            in (32) is fixed.

Therefore, it becomes interesting to investigate the conditions under which

In this section, we consider some realistic issues related to the implementation of the proposed method for the design of the single-tap equalizer. In particular, we extend the method to the cases where some guard subcarriers are present and where the noise term is included in the cost function in Subsections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively. Moreover, we discuss the application of the proposed method to a multiuser scenario in Subsection 5.3 and, finally, we address the evaluation of the complexity for generating the coefficient

In the previous section we have used the assumption (42) for deriving (46) from (45). However, since some guard subcarriers are usually employed in the realistic systems, it is reasonable to modify the expression (46) to write the

For such reasons, the SINR design procedure coincides with the SIR design procedure except for the need to add the quantity

The considered transceiver scenario refers, for sake of clarity, to the case where a single transmitter is using the subcarriers in the set 
                           A
                         and a single receiver is present. However, we can trivially extend the considered scenario to the downlink of a multiuser OFDM/OQAM scenario where a single transmitter operates with reference to several receivers; in such a case, each receiver is associated with a different channel response 
                           h
                           [
                           ⋅
                           ]
                         and is interested to a subset of the active subcarriers with indices in 
                           A
                        . The coefficient 
                           
                              
                                 W
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                           
                         to use on the subcarriers of interest is straightforwardly determined, for each receiver, by the same proposed method. The use of the proposed method for the uplink of a multiuser OFDM/OQAM scenario is less straightforward; however, also in such a scenario, the model derived for point-to-point transceiver can be easily exploited in order to derive the optimum coefficients 
                           
                              
                                 W
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                           
                         on each subcarrier of interest provided that the impulse responses (from each transmitter to the single receiver) are available.

Let us evaluate the computational complexities of the three methods for single-tap equalizer design by assuming that the channel impulse response

                        , the flops required by the three equalizers are 19,456, 19,470, and 2,765,824, respectively, i.e., the complexity increase of the improved equalizer in comparison with the standard equalizer is irrelevant while the complexity of the optimum equalizer is more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of the other two equalizers. Moreover, the number of real-valued samples to store in memory is 2M times larger than that required by the improved equalizer.

We have first used the derived transceiver model in order to simply express the SINR of the decision variable obtained at the output of the three single-tap receivers. Using such expression, we have compared the improved single-tap equalizer (51) with the standard single-tap equalizer on channel A; in order to appreciate the effects of the interference symbols on the useful decision variable, the background noise power level is set so that the ratio γ in (39) is fixed at

The results show that often the SINR advantage is much limited on channel A; in particular, a small advantage of the improved equalizer is obtained only on a very small fraction of subcarriers and only in correspondence of the larger values of the bandwidth. In fact, for larger bandwidths, the path delays become longer in terms of discrete-time samples and the assumption, on which the standard equalizer is based, about the property of the ambiguity function to be slowly varying in intervals long as the channel delay spread becomes less realistic. In particular, using the general expression (32) with reference to the prototype filter considered for simulations and the approximate expression for

                     . Therefore, when the channel exhibits limited variations in the subcarrier bandwidth, the approximation (36) holds; instead, when the channel is not constant in the subcarrier bandwidth, the approximation (36) does not hold any more and the improved equalizer outperforms the standard single-tap equalizer.

We have also compared the optimum single-tap equalizer (49) with the improved equalizer (51). We have considered the difference (in dB) between the SINR achieved by the optimum equalizer and that achieved by the improved one. When an internal subcarrier is considered, such a difference results to be null in 100% of the channel realizations. Only on the four extreme subcarriers, an interesting performance advantage is obtained. Since the computational complexity of the optimum single-tap equalizer is much larger than that of the other two single-tap equalizers, as shown in Subsection 5.4, and since, coherently with the theoretical derivations in Subsection 5.1, its performance advantage is only present at the extreme subcarriers (where, moreover, a smaller interference power is present), we have limited our further analysis to the performance comparison between the standard and the improved single-tap equalizers. Furthermore, we have included in the experiments also the multitap equalizers proposed in [22] with the number of taps chosen in the following set 
                        {
                        3
                        ,
                        5

                        7
                        }
                     ; such structures perform obviously better than a single-tap equalizer but their inclusion is motivated by the need to compare the advantages that can be obtained by using the improved single-tap equalizer with that achieved by the multitap equalizer, which, however, requires to pay a price in terms of increased transceiver latency. Finally, we have also included for comparison purposes the classical OFDM system with the same number of subcarriers and with a cyclic prefix set to 
                        M
                        /

                     .

We have reported in Figs. 3 and 4
                     
                     , the average BER for a bandwidth of 
                        10
                         
                        MHz
                      and 
                        25
                         
                        MHz
                     , respectively, exhibited by the receivers under comparison with reference to the case where the 4-QAM symbol constellation is used. We can note that, moving from 
                        10
                         
                        MHz
                      to 
                        25
                         
                        MHz
                     , the result of the comparison between the single-tap and the multitap equalizers changes; however, in both cases, the performance of the standard single-tap equalizer coincides with that of the improved one, thus confirming with reference to the BER analysis, the results already obtained in terms of SINR analysis shown in Fig. 2, coherently with the results obtained in [23]. More specifically, the performance advantages shown in Fig. 2 are small and are obtained on a so small fraction of subcarriers that they do not determine appreciable differences in terms of average BER. We have also performed simulation results for the case where the 64-QAM symbol constellation is used. The results show more significant differences between the single-tap and the multitap equalizers, which exhibit a performance advantage over the single-tap equalizer also when the bandwidth is 
                        10
                         
                        MHz
                     , as shown in Fig. 5
                     ; however, again the BERs of the two kinds of single-tap equalizer are perfectly equivalent. This confirms the importance of having carried out the analysis in terms of SINR reported in Fig. 2 that shows the equivalence of the two equalizers on a large fraction of subcarriers for the different channel realizations but also the superior performance of the improved equalizer on a fraction of subcarriers so small that they do not affect the average BER.

Finally, we have also performed the same simulation experiments on channel ITU-A Extended, where the longer delay of the last path affects the approximation (36), and, therefore, allows one to achieve performance improvements by using the improved single-tap equalizer instead of the standard one. We have first studied the SINR achieved at the equalizer output using the model derived in Section 3. The results reported in Fig. 6
                      are obtained analogously to that reported in Fig. 2 with reference to the channel ITU-A. They show that the improved equalizer, which has practically the same complexity of the standard equalizer, can achieve a significant performance advantage on specific channel realizations while on a large percentage of subcarriers it achieves an interesting advantage (and, obviously, the SINR difference in dB never achieves negative values). Moreover, the experiments on channel ITU-A Extended confirm that the optimum equalizer exhibits the same SINR of the improved equalizer on the internal subcarriers.

We have also analyzed the equalizer performance in terms of average BER; in Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10
                     
                     
                     
                     , we have reported the average BER in correspondence of a bandwidth equal to 
                        10
                         
                        MHz
                     , 
                        15
                         
                        MHz
                     , 
                        20
                         
                        MHz
                     , 
                        25
                         
                        MHz
                     , respectively, achieved by the different receivers under comparison when the 4-QAM constellation is used. In general, we can notice that the performance of each receiver worsens when the bandwidth increases. However, also the performance advantage of the improved equalizer in comparison with the standard equalizer becomes more significant when the bandwidth increases. In particular, for a bandwidth of 20 and 
                        25
                         
                        MHz
                     , the performance of the improved single-tap equalizer is closer to that of the multitap structure with 3 taps than to that of the standard one. Therefore, the performance comparison on channel ITU-A Extended shows that the proposed equalizer guarantees an interesting performance improvement. On the same channel, we have also evaluated the BER of the considered receivers also when the 64-QAM constellation is employed. The results, reported in Fig. 11
                      with reference to a bandwidth of 
                        20
                         
                        MHz
                     , confirms that an interesting performance advantage is achieved by the proposed equalizer in comparison with the standard one. We make also note that, on the channel ITU-A Extended, the maximum multipath delay is larger than the cyclic prefix of the OFDM system that, therefore, exhibits a significant performance loss.

We have derived the MIMO relation between the outputs of the OFDM/OQAM receiver and the sequences of symbols at the transmitter input. Such a relation has been exactly expressed in (31); moreover, in subsection 5.1 it has been shown that the sum over

                        ∈

                      is adopted in the design of the prototype filter. The derived model has been exploited to design the optimum single-tap equalizer, which is often considered in such transceivers in order to limit the increase of computational complexity in comparison with the standard OFDM system.

It has been shown that the optimum single-tap equalizer in the absence of guard subcarriers is simply the inverse of a specific coefficient of an impulse response of the derived model. This coefficient under particular conditions leads to the conventionally used single-tap equalizer given by the inverse of the channel frequency response at the frequency of the considered subcarrier. Moreover, the effects of guard subcarriers and the possible inclusion of the noise term in the cost function have been studied; furthermore, we have shown that there is practically no design complexity increase associated with the use of the proposed equalizer. Finally, we have shown that it can achieve interesting performance improvements in comparison with the standard equalizer.
