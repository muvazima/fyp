                  The single-product, single-period newsvendor problem with two decision variables, namely price and stock quantity, is considered. The performance measure, in addition to the expected revenue, includes the variance of the income scaled with a risk parameter. We present conditions for the concavity of this risk-sensitive performance measure and the uniqueness of the optimal solution for both risk-averse and risk-seeking cases under the additive demand model, and compare the results to others previously published. These conditions are introduced in terms of the lost sales rate elasticity. Furthermore, we provide numerical examples that aim to endorse the theoretical results herein explained.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The newsvendor problem has been widely studied since it first appeared at the end of the XIX century. It is still the subject of further research that addresses more complex and realistic situations based on previous work. The problem, in its basic formulation, aims at finding an optimal replenishment policy of a perishable product in the face of an uncertain, stochastic demand. Such a solution is selected in a way that maximizes the expected profit, which is calculated as the difference between the expected income and the purchase cost of the good in question. Many modifications to this basic model have been proposed throughout the years, introducing additional complexity to the problem.

On one hand, research efforts have focused on a profit-maximizer individual or business that wants to maximize the expected profit. The literature offers us a very diverse range of assumptions and approaches to different demand and inventory models. For example, Whitin (1955) introduced the effect of price in the stochastic demand, thus adding this decision variable to the problem, on top of the stocking quantity. Petruzzi and Dada (1999) used this price-demand relationship in several ways while presenting a single-period approach that maximized expected profit and established theorems that indicated how to select the stocking policy based on the statistical distribution that conferred the demand its stochastic nature. Such demand was presented in the form of an additive and in the form of a multiplicative model. Moreover, they presented a closed, analytical expression to determine the optimal price as a function of such stocking policy and compared it to the so-called riskless price as done by Mills (1959). Also, they showed how pricing decisions affect demand uncertainty under various modeling assumptions. Federgruen and Heching (1999) introduced a multi-period model for inventory control with backlogging which included a price-dependent stochastic demand and analyzed the optimal pricing and replenishment strategies to be set simultaneously in each period and how they compared when prices can be set bi-directionally or when only markdowns are allowed. Kocabiyikoglu and Popescu (2011) unified and introduced the concept of lost sales rate (LSR) elasticity and explained the monotonicity of the optimal price and stock as a function of this new concept. Moreover, they set the properties that the LSR elasticity must possess for the profit to be jointly concave as a function of pricing and stocking decisions and for the problem to have a unique optimal solution.

On the other hand, and as opposed to the norm in financial analysis, a tradeoff between expected return and risk in planning problems has been absent for many years. All the articles mentioned above presented a price-dependent demand and a profit-optimizer decision maker that is risk-neutral. This decision maker seeks to maximize the expected profit by finding an appropriate balance between expected income and expected costs. However, these models do not take into account the variance of the income, and therefore it is likely to select an optimal policy that maximizes the expected income but presents a variability that turns this decision into a risky bet. Some research efforts have taken place with respect to this approach. However, albeit the demand keeps its stochastic nature, in many cases it is not presented as a function of the price and therefore the optimization is sought by means of only selecting an optimal quantity of product to purchase, thus disregarding pricing decisions. To the best of our knowledge, it was Lau (1980) who first considered a mean-standard deviation payoff criterion within the newsvendor model, although he only gave the equation whose root provided the optimal quantity. Chen and Federgruen (2000) presented this mean-variance analysis for different planning problems, namely, the newsvendor problem, the base stock problem and the (R, nQ) model. When dealing with the newsvendor problem, they applied a single-stage model that optimized a utility function for risk-neutral, risk-averse and risk-seeking decision maker over a feasible region given by an efficient frontier. Later on, Choi, Li, and Yan (2008) introduced stockout costs in the mean-variance analysis and presented results for various risk attitudes under demands that followed well-known statistical distributions. Wu, Li, Wang, and Cheng (2009) focused on the impact that stockout costs have on the optimal ordering decisions when comparing classic models and mean-variance analysis models, showing via numerical results that, for a given stockout price, a mean-variance analysis yields a lower optimal order quantity and a lower optimal value of the problem. Özler, Tan, and Karaesmen (2009) offered a one-stage, multi-product approach with value-at-risk considerations that included mathematical programming results for the case of one and two products and an approximation to the N-product case. Wang and Webster (2009) introduced an alternative approach by using a piece-wise linear loss-aversion utility function. Wang, Webster, and Suresh (2009) studied the newsvendor problem within the expected utility framework and considered three different classes of utility functions, namely, constant absolute risk aversion (CARA), decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA), and increasing absolute risk aversion (IARA), whereas Choi and Ruszczyński (2011) examined this model with an exponential utility function used to model a risk-averse decision-maker with a constant risk coefficient in the sense of the Arrow–Pratt measure.

In the present paper, our aim is to combine the two approaches introduced above. That is, we present a mean-variance analysis of the newsvendor problem that includes a stochastic, price-dependent demand. This problem was presented before by Agrawal and Seshadri (2000), but it was approached from the perspective of the expected utility framework, selecting concave utility functions to model risk-averse situations and finding the relation of optimal pricing and stocking strategies with respect to the levels of risk aversion. There have been other similar efforts; in particular, Chen, Xu, and Zhang (2009) proposed a model based on a conditional value-at-risk decision criterion (CVaR), where it was analyzed how the optimal price and stock quantity changed when varying the η-quantile of the function they sought to maximize. Our work is focused on an alternative approach that penalizes the variability of the profit in the objective function and rests in earlier research done by Filar, Kallenberg, and Lee (1989) and Baykal-Gürsoy and Ross (1992) when tackling Markov decision processes. On this basis, we perform such analysis for an additive demand model under several risk assumptions, in order to yield results that allow us to discern how the newsvendor’s risk attitude affects the optimal stocking and pricing policies. In addition, these results are extended to the field of economics by providing an interpretation in terms of the (LSR) elasticity.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the problem formulation. In Section 3, we focus on the risk-averse environment and set forth the assumptions under which the risk-sensitive performance measure can be both sequentially optimized and simultaneously optimized. We also provide insight about the behavior of the optimal pricing and stocking decisions as a function of the risk aversion, and show numerical examples where these results can be visually analyzed. In Section 4 we approach the problem again under a risk-seeking environment and state similar conditions under which the performance measure presents a predictable behavior. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Section 5.

Consider a decision maker who sells a perishable product, and has the ability to decide on the quantity to produce or buy and the price to set for the good he or she sells. Moreover, such a decision must be based on the expected revenue for the upcoming period, the production/procurement costs and the variability of the revenue. Assuming that the demand for a period is random and a function of the price we introduce the following risk-sensitive performance measure:

                     . This random variable with support [A, B], where A < 0 and B > 0, has a probability distribution given by the continuous density function f and the cumulative distribution function F. We assume that F is twice differentiable everywhere on its domain. Furthermore, x is the inventory level set for the good, c is the production/procurement cost per unit of finished product and 
                        
                           D
                           (
                           p
                           ,
                           ϵ
                           )
                        
                      is the demand for a single period given the price p and the realization of the random variable 
                        ϵ
                     . Finally, λ is a risk parameter greater than 0 for risk-averse cases, smaller than 0 for risk-seeking cases and equal to 0 in risk-neutral cases.

Although the risk-sensitive performance measure defined in Eq. (1) lacks economic meaning, optimizing Eq. (1) must be understood as maximizing profit while minimizing variance (for a risk-averse newsvendor) or while also maximizing variance (for a risk-seeking newsvendor). Furthermore, the parameter λ can be considered as a scaling factor that balances the expected profit and the variance of the profit. In addition, the expression above contains several assumptions. It assumes that the procurement costs increase linearly with the quantity bought. Implicitly, this means that batch production is not more convenient economically than item-by-item production and the economies of scale do not apply. The introduction of the variability of the revenue weighted with the parameter λ is a different approach compared to that presented by Chen and Federgruen (2000), who presented the attitude towards risk modeled by a utility function that was concave, convex and linear for risk-averse, risk-seeking and risk-neutral settings, respectively. It is also different from CVaR-based models as shown by Chen et al. (2009). Finally, we introduce the demand

(A1) indicates that the price to be set has to be bigger than the unit cost of production and smaller than pmax
                     . The latter will never be greater than the price at which the riskless demand for the product, y(p), equals 0. When y(·) is a linear function, this value turns out to be

As indicated by Petruzzi and Dada (1999), for a selected value of z we face shortages if

Understanding the behavior of the functions above is crucial for the analysis that will be shown later. On one hand, μ(·) is an increasing function of z in [A, B], for

Sequential optimization seeks optimization of a function of several variables by sequentially selecting the optimal values of each variable that will, at the end, produce the maximum of the function that we need to maximize. Zabel (1970) proposes a method by which it is possible to find the optimal price that maximizes the performance measure for a given z. Then, this function can be expressed in terms of only one variable, z, and consequently optimized. However, finding the optimal price requires concavity of p with respect to z. To this end, we have

The optimal price for a given z, p
                              *(z), is smaller in the risk-averse case (λ > 0) than in the risk-neutral case (

                              ). This conclusion is correct both mathematically and intuitively, for a risk-averse individual will set lower prices to make sure that sales are as high as possible, and endorses the results obtained by Agrawal and Seshadri (2000). The price in the risk-neutral case is in turn smaller than or equal to the optimal riskless price as observed by Petruzzi and Dada (1999). However, the results of Agrawal and Seshadri (2000) claim that the optimal risk-neutral price equals the optimal riskless price, whereas the model proposed in this paper suggests that the optimal risk-neutral price is in between the optimal risk-averse price and the optimal riskless price.

The result above endorses that obtained under CVaR considerations by Chen et al. (2009) and also that yielded by the use of the expected utility framework by Agrawal and Seshadri (2000). In that sense, the model proposed here provides certainty with respect to the behavior of the optimal order quantity in additive models of the form 
                                 
                                    a
                                    −

                                    p

                                    ϵ
                                 
                               in the face of risk-averse environments.

Unlike the approach we took in Section 3.1, we focus now on giving conditions to jointly optimize price and quantity decisions simultaneously, thus guaranteeing that (2) has a unique solution.

The result shown by Theorem 2 also matches that found by Kocabiyikoglu and Popescu (2011) for a risk-neutral individual (
                                 
                                    λ
                                    =
                                    0
                                 
                              ).

Notice that this condition for joint concavity is very restrictive as it requires the LSR elasticity to be greater than or equal to 
                           
                              
                                 1
                                 2
                              
                           
                         in the whole domain of the function under study. This condition is sufficient to guarantee that (p
                        *, z
                        *) is a maximum, but it is not necessary. If P(.) were not jointly concave, the state of (p
                        *, z
                        *) as a critical point would not be altered, for the only necessary and sufficient condition for criticality is that the Hessian matrix is negative semidefinite at that precise point and this is guaranteed if

                                 ≥

                         which is in turn a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique maximum in P(·) (Cachon & Netessine, 2006).

In order to illustrate the ideas previously exposed, we proceed with several numerical examples using different distribution functions for the random variable 
                           ϵ
                        . In particular, we present 
                           ϵ
                         as a random variable uniformly distributed in [A, B], and a random variable normally distributed with mean 
                           
                              μ

                         and standard deviation

                         and truncated below A and above B. For both cases, we use the following parameters to define the problem:

                         ≥ 22.5 in the first two cases and pmax
                         ≥ 23.83 in the case of the uniform distribution with expectation different from 0. Table A.1 contains, for these three distributions, the optimal values of p, z and P(p, z) for each value of λ that was put to the test. All tables and figures referenced can be found in Appendix A and Appendix C, respectively.

With respect to the uniform distribution centered at 0, Fig. C.1 shows the optimal price p
                        *(·) and its first two derivatives for different values of λ that range from λmax
                        , representing the most risk-averse newsvendor, to 0, representing a risk-neutral newsvendor. In this case, the impact of risk-aversion on the optimal price p
                        *(·) is not very significant, being 2.32% when

                         but it is interesting to verify that increasing risk-aversion leads to smaller optimal prices and how this price is concave in [A, B]. Also, Fig. C.2 shows how the LSR elasticity

                              *
                           
                         is always greater than

                         which in turn guarantees that P
                        *(·) is concave. Note that since p
                        *(·) differs very little for different values of λ, the curves of

                         almost overlap. Also, the optimal value of the objective function P
                        * is inversely proportional to the value of λ and its optimum value changes only 3.45% between the most risk-averse situation and the risk neutral situation. It is worth mentioning that in this case

                                    (
                                    p
                                    ,
                                    z

                         and therefore the performance measure is jointly concave.

In the case of a truncated normal distribution, when comparing the most risk-averse situation with the risk-neutral case, the optimal price p
                        * reveals a difference of 2.44% at 
                           
                              z
                              =

                         which is very similar to that is found in the previous numerical example. Again, and endorsing the theoretical results, p
                        *(·) is concave and

                                       ˜

                         which guarantees the existence of a unique optimum. Such optimum yields a gap of 3.02% between the most risk-averse case and the risk-neutral scenario. This difference is as well very similar to that is shown for the uniform distribution (3.02% vs. 3.45%). Unlike the uniform case, this distribution does not provide P(·) with joint concavity, as there are some values of

                                 (
                                 p
                                 ,
                                 z
                                 )
                              
                           
                         under 
                           
                              
                                 1

                        .

Finally, the uniform distribution with mean different from 0 yields a bigger gap of the optimal price at the right extreme of the interval, with this price at the risk-neutral case being 5.12% greater than in the most-risk averse case for

                         using the same parameter values specified at the beginning of this section. The results can be found in Table A.2 and show, as claimed by Lemma 2, that the risk-aversion is inversely proportional to the optimum value of z
                        *(20).

In order to show the effect that risk aversion has on the profit, Tables A.1 and A.2 also include the expected profit and the standard deviation of the profit for each case considered. These can be calculated directly from (1). Intuitively, the expected profit and the standard deviation of the profit should decrease as the level of risk aversion increases. Indeed, this is the case in all the different scenarios presented.

Whereas the expressions of all the partial derivatives previously obtained are still valid for risk-seeking situations, the conditions under which the performance measure is concave are greatly modified by the fact that λ < 0. We turn now our attention to this case in which, again, we are seeking the maximization of

Furthermore, we set forth the following assumptions, some of which were explained formerly (we refer the reader to Section 3 for the justification of the first three of them). The fourth assumption will become relevant in the next section. Note that in this case we have not included any assumption on the value of λ; this condition will be addressed as part of the analysis that will follow.

                         the price p

                        . For that reason, we need to further restrict the possible selection of values for λ.

In the risk-seeking case (λ < 0), the optimal price for a given z, p
                              *(z), is greater than that is found for the risk-neutral case (
                                 
                                    λ

                              ). This conclusion is correct both mathematically and intuitively, for a risk-seeking individual will set higher prices in his pursuit of greater profit, accepting the risk of selling less as a result of such decision.

Once the conditions for P( ·, z) to be concave is established, analogous to what was shown for the risk-averse case, we address the concavity of P
                        *(·).

We proceed now to present some examples for the risk-seeking case. As the reader may have noticed, this case is more intrincated than the risk-averse case, with more conditions to be satisfied for obtaining a desirable behavior of the performance measure. Our experience has been that selecting λ according to Theorem 3 induces a more significant impact on the optimal value of the objective function. These examples gave way to a larger range of values for the risk parameter, as we only require that

                        Theorem 3 provides a more complex expression than Theorem 4 that needs to be evaluated at any z ∈ [A, B]. Despite this hindrance, it was not particularly difficult to find instances where this condition was satisfied and allowed us to get significant results. All the tables and figures referenced in the next lines can be found in Appendix B and Appendix D, respectively.

Fig. D.2 shows for the most risk-seeking case that

                         is always above the necessary and sufficient condition expressed by Eq. (13), thus conferring concavity to the performance measure for this value of λ. For clarity, we omit similar curves for other tested scenarios but, as the fourth chart in this figure shows, all cases satisfy (13). In this example, there is a considerable gap in the optimal value of the objective function between a risk-neutral scenario and the most risk seeking case, with the latter being 29.31% larger than the former.

These parameters produce a noteworthy effect on the objective function that is even more remarkable than that in the last example: the risk-neutral case yields an optimum value which is 77.80% lower than that of the most risk-seeking scenario. Likewise, the optimal price, is 17.81% lower when

Table B.1, in turn, displays the optimal pricing and safety stock decisions along with the optimum value of the objective function, the expected profit, and the standard deviation of the profit that they produce for the different values of λ that were attempted. Note that in both cases the impact of risk-seekingness in the nature of the profit as a stochastic variable is remarkable, to the point that, when

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The approach that our model intends to give to the newsvendor problem aims at serving as a comparison with previously used models based on CVaR measures and the expected utility framework. Here we introduce a simple yet powerful variation of the single-period, price-dependent demand newsvendor problem with two decision variables (namely, price and stock quantity) by including the variability of the demand scaled by the attitude towards risk that the seller has. Such attitude can be risk-averse or risk-seeking. The latter is much scarcer in the literature and can be taken as a starting point for future research efforts. It also presents more difficult situations under this model given the complexity of the conditions that have to hold for the performance measure to behave appropriately. However, we show that when those conditions apply, the impact of a risk-seeking newsvendor on the objective function can be remarkable.

We present results that back those found for risk-averse situations in other works with different models, plus we add conclusions for risk-seeking cases along with other findings that, despite being intuitive, need mathematical endorsement. For instance, it was shown that the optimal price for a given safety stock z, p
                     *(z), is smaller in risk-averse cases than in risk-neutral cases. Conversely, in risk-seeking cases, this price is greater. In both scenarios, however, it is an increasing function of z. This price is also concave in z for the risk-averse case, whereas such concavity is guaranteed in a smaller range of λ for the risk-seeking case.

Furthermore, it was found that the optimal safety stock as a function of the price, z
                     *(·), always decreases as we face an increase in risk-aversion. Intuitively, one might think that the opposite would happen in risk-seeking cases (i.e., 
                        
                           
                              
                                 z

                              *

                      always increases as we turn to be more risk-seeking). However, this result is true only provided that

Finally, we comment on the values of λ. The restrictions that our models set on the range of values that this parameter may take have to be considered as a scaling measure of risk. Out of the proposed ranges for λ, the concavity of the objective function is not guaranteed, although it might occur. In particular, if we are concerned about a risk-averse environment, it makes sense to set the most averse case to the maximum value that λ can take (i.e.,

                     . Similarly, we can identify the most favorable risk-seeking case according to the lower bounds described in Theorem 3 or Theorem 4, whatever suits us best, and evaluate different risk measures according to this scale. Having such bounds on the risk parameter is reasonable. It is seldom that the results hold for the entire range of λ . Even in models with the exponential utility function (in which the decision maker is equipped with a constant risk coefficient) or other measures of risk, the degree of risk aversion is somewhat bounded to obtain certain results. On the other hand, in real life problems, λ is usually small, or close to zero. Hence the results for large λ are not meaningful.

The model proposed here also has some limitations which in turn provide research opportunities for the future. In particular, the demand is linear with respect to the price. Other relationships between price and demand that will yield different conditions for the concavity of the objective function can be proposed. It would also be interesting to see how the results found in this paper change when the risk measure is different. The standard semideviation proposed by Choi and Ruszczyński (2008) is a reasonable alternative, although the analysis of the optimality conditions for the concavity of the objective function seems more complicated in this case. Further research can also be done if we consider censored demand that originates when there is a loss of information that does not allow us to observe the true demand. This occurs, for example, in the case of stockouts. Recent research efforts have been made in this area (see Besbes & Muharremoglu, 2013; Huh, Levi, Rusmevichientong, & Orlin, 2011; Rudi & Drake, 2014; Sachs & Minner, 2014) from which new approaches and ideas can be drawn from. For more comments on research and an excellent survey the reader is referred to Qin, Wang, Vakharia, Chen, and Seref (2011).

Therefore, there exists a point z
                           * ∈ (A, B) at which the function P
                           *(·) attains its maximum. We claim that such a point is unique by showing that P
                           *(·) is a concave function. Indeed,

                        Proof
                        Given the complexity of Eq. (12), we proceed to see how 
                              
                                 
                                    z
                                    ˜
                                 
                                 *
                              
                            varies with changing λ. Thus, if we rename the left-hand side of (12) as g(λ, z), the following holds

                        Proof
                        The first-order derivative of P
                           *(·) at the points A and B is given by (E.2) and (E.3), respectively. Therefore, there exists a point z
                           * ∈ (A, B) at which the function P
                           *(·) attains its maximum. Such maximum is unique if P
                           *(·) is a concave function and we refer to Eq. (E.4) in order to prove it. Imposing concavity requires that

                        We analyze again (E.5) under the light of the implicit function theorem, but this time with the condition λ < 0. The numerator in this equation is still nonnegative, but the second term in the denominator is now nonpositive and is being subtracted. The first term of the denominator is always nonpositive. Hence, if
