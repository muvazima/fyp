                  This paper proposes a novel unambiguous correlation function for composite binary offset carrier (CBOC) signal tracking based on partial correlations. In the proposed scheme, first, we partition sub-carriers of the CBOC signal into partial sub-carriers, and subsequently, we obtain partial correlations by correlating the partial sub-carriers with the received CBOC signal. Finally, a novel unambiguous correlation function with no side-peak is constructed by combining the partial correlations in a specially designed way. Unlike the conventional schemes, the proposed scheme does not require any auxiliary signal and from numerical results, it is found to offer a better tracking performance than those of the conventional schemes in terms of the tracking error standard deviation (TESD) and multipath error envelope (MEE).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Because of increasing demands for more precise positioning services, various global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) have been developed [1]. Especially, in order to operate a GNSS independent from the global positioning system (GPS), European Space Agency has developed a GNSS referred to as Galileo. Although the original binary offset carrier (BOC) signal was considered as the modulation signal for Galileo, the CBOC signal was finally adopted in Galileo E1 band in 2006, since it provides an improved signal tracking performance compared with the original BOC signal and enables Galileo signals to share the frequency band with GPS signals [2]. The CBOC signal is a weighted sum of two BOC signals, BOC(x, 1) and BOC(y, 1) and is denoted by CBOC(x, y, γ), where BOC( ·, ·) represents a BOC signal generated by multiplying a pseudorandom noise (PRN) code and a sine-phased sub-carrier signal, γ is a power split ratio between BOC(x, 1) and BOC(y, 1), and ‘x’ or ‘y’ is the ratio of the chip period

                      of the PRN code to the period of the sub-carrier. Specifically, the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal is used in Galileo [2].

The main drawback of the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal is that its autocorrelation has multiple side-peaks around the main-peak, causing an ambiguity problem (i.e., the signal synchronization is completed on one of the side peaks). Thus, so far, various unambiguous schemes have been proposed for the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal acquisition (coarse synchronization) [3–11] and tracking (fine synchronization) [12–24], of which the latter is dealt with in this paper. Authors [12–17] proposed unambiguous tracking methods for the BOC signal, and so, they are not appropriate for the CBOC signal. In [18,19], side-peak cancellation schemes were presented; however, their tracking performances are worse than that of the CBOC autocorrelation. Although improved unambiguous tracking methods using various auxiliary signals were proposed in [20–22], the improvement in tracking performance over the conventional autocorrelation is not significant, and also, the auxiliary signals increase the system complexity. Ren et al. [23] and Shen et al. [24] proposed tracking structures that do not use the autocorrelation, and thus, are free from the side-peaks; however, they have much worse tracking performances than that of the autocorrelation-based tracking.

In this paper, a novel unambiguous correlation function with a sharper main-peak is proposed to provide a better performance than those of the conventional schemes in CBOC signal tracking. Specifically, we partition the sub-carrier into partial sub-carriers, and subsequently, correlate the partial sub-carriers with the received CBOC signal, yielding partial correlations. Then, the partial correlations are combined in a specially designed way to construct an unambiguous correlation function. The proposed unambiguous correlation function is demonstrated to provide a better tracking performance than those of the conventional schemes without requiring any auxiliary signal. Although a partial correlation-based method was used in [19] also, the corresponding divide and recombination method is for BOC signals, and thus, is not appropriate for CBOC signals composed of a weighted sum of two different BOC signals, as we shall see in Sections 3 and 4.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal model. In Section 3, we propose a novel unambiguous correlation function with no side-peak. Section 4 compares the tracking performances of the proposed and conventional schemes, and finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.

The sub-carrier of the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal is shown in the left-hand side of Fig. 1

Although the unambiguous correlation function N
                        0(τ) has no side-peak, N
                        0(τ) uses only a part (i.e., P
                        1(τ) and P

                        , and thus, the height of the main-peak is much smaller than that of the CBOC(6,1,1/11) autocorrelation, which may lead to a poor tracking performance. Correlating P

                        2(τ). The main-peak height of the proposed unambiguous correlation function is approximately 1.312, which is larger than that of the CBOC(6,1,1/11) autocorrelation, and the main-peak half-width equals to Tc
                        /24, which is much narrower than those of the conventional schemes including the CBOC autocorrelation. The whole process for generating the proposed unambiguous correlation function is depicted in Fig. 3
                        .


                        Fig. 4 shows the correlation functions of the proposed and conventional schemes for the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal where the autocorrelation is included as a reference. From the figure, we can confirm that the proposed unambiguous correlation function does not contain any side-peak, and moreover, has the sharpest main-peak. Thus, we can anticipate that the proposed unambiguous correlation function would outperform the conventional unambiguous correlation functions in tracking performance.

For CBOC signal tracking, the proposed correlation function is finally applied to the delay lock loop (DLL), yielding the discriminator output

                         shows the discriminator outputs of the conventional and proposed correlation functions for CBOC(6,1,1/11) (note that [23,24] are not correlation-based schemes, and so, do not have their correlation functions). From this figure, it is observed that the slope of the proposed unambiguous correlation function is much steeper than those of the conventional ones in the tracking range around 
                           
                              τ

                        , and thus again, it is expected that the proposed unambiguous correlation function would exhibit a better tracking performance over the conventional ones.

In this section, we develop an extension of the proposed scheme based on the observation that the width of an unambiguous correlation function depends on the duration of partitioned sub-carriers. Thus, to generate a narrower correlation function, we evenly partition the sub-carrier psc

                        Fig. 9 shows the correlation functions of the proposed scheme (referred as unambiguous CBOC correlation function (UCCF)) and the extended proposed scheme (referred as high-accuracy unambiguous CBOC correlation function (H-UCCF)) for CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal. From the figure, we can confirm that the H-UCCF (13) has a sharper main-peak than the UCCF (7). Thus, we can anticipate that the H-UCCF would outperform the UCCF.

It should be mentioned that the proposed schemes are applicable to the time-multiplexed BOC(6,1,1/11) (TMBOC(6,1,1/11)) signal composed of two different BOC signals like the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal. Yet, since the proposed schemes have been originally proposed for the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal without considering the characteristics of the TMBOC(6,1,1/11) signal, a better unambiguous tracking technique may exist for the TMBOC(6,1,1/11) signal. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are based on not a theoretical analysis but an observation, and thus, they may not be the best solution in resolving the ambiguity problem of the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal either, although they have been developed according to the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal characteristics. Thus, it would be an interesting task to develop an unambiguous technique based on a theoretical analysis and compare it with the conventional schemes, which we would like to reserve for another paper in the future.

                        . From the figure, we can see that the UCCF and H-UCCF provide a better TESD performance than the conventional correlation functions over the CNR range 20–40dBHz of practical interest. Specifically, the UCCF and H-UCCF give a performance improvement of more than 2dBHz and 8dBHz, respectively, over all of the conventional correlation functions in the CNR range of practical interest. This is due to the fact that the UCCF and H-UCCF have sharper main-peaks than the conventional correlation functions. In addition, as expected, it is observed that the H-UCCF performs better than the UCCF: The former provides a performance improvement of more than 5dBHz over the latter.

Specifically, the UCCF gives a performance improvement of more than 2dBHz and 3dBHz for CBOC(6,1,1/11) and CBOC(4,1,1/11), respectively, which implies that the proposed scheme should be useful for various families of CBOC signals that might be adopted in the future.

                         and the amplitude ratios of the second path to the first path are 0.1 and 0.25, where we can observe that the UCCF and H-UCCF provide a better MEE performance than [18–22] over the range (0 ∼ 1.5Tc
                        ) of the multipath delay of practical interest, whereas the UCCF and H-UCCF generally perform worse than [23,24] although they exhibit a better MEE performance than [23,24] over the range (0 ∼ 0.02Tc
                        ) of the multipath delay.

These observations become more pronounced in Fig. 13
                         showing the areas of the MEEs (A-MEEs) [25] of the UCCF, H-UCCF, and conventional correlation functions, where we can see that the UCCF and H-UCCF have smaller A-MEEs than [18–22] by a factor of 1.2–20.0, whereas they have larger A-MEEs than [23,24] by a factor of 20.8–88.4. It should be noted that [23,24] were developed with a focus on improving the MEE performance, and thus, provide a better MEE performance than the UCCF and H-UCCF, while they have an even much worse TESD performance than the UCCF and H-UCCF as shown in Fig. 10.

Since the proposed scheme employs multiple partial correlations, it involves an increase in complexity compared with the autocorrelation function. Specifically, the proposed correlation function requires

                        fortunately, the number of correlators can be reduced to one by using a moving sampler as depicted in Fig. 14
                        , where the CBOC sub-carrier correlation is sampled every Ts
                        /q seconds, and then, T/Tc
                         samples are collected and summed in each of the 12q branches, yielding the 12q partial correlations. However, due to the absolute value operations involved in the proposed scheme, the increase in complexity is not completely resolved, and thus, the authors would like to reserve the issue for future works.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have proposed a novel unambiguous CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal tracking scheme. We have first obtained partial sub-carriers composing the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal, and then, have obtained partial correlations by correlating the partial sub-carriers with the received CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal. Exploiting various combinations of the partial correlations, we have removed the side-peaks of the CBOC autocorrelation and have obtained an unambiguous correlation function with a higher and narrower main-peak than those of the conventional schemes. In numerical results, we have compared the tracking performances of the proposed and conventional tracking schemes in terms of TESD and MEE. From the TESD simulations, it is confirmed that the UCCF and H-UCCF provide a better TESD performance than the conventional correlation functions. Specifically, the UCCF and H-UCCF gave a performance improvement of more than 2dBHz and 8dBHz, respectively, over all of the conventional correlation functions in the CNR range of practical interest. From the MEE simulations, it is confirmed that the proposed correlation function can provide a better tracking performance in multipath environments by comparing MEEs as a function of the multipath delay and A-MEEs. Furthermore, we have confirmed that the proposed scheme can be operated with a reduced complexity based on the moving sampler and is applicable to both CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal and CBOC(4,1,1/11) signal.
