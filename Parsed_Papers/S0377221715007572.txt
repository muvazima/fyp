                  Emissions of greenhouse gases are not as free as they used to be. Under stringent regulations, manufacturers increasingly find that their emissions have a steep monetary, environmental and social price. In manufacturing industry, remanufacturing has an important role to play with its inherent economic, environmental and social opportunities which warrant regulatory action. In this paper, we characterize the optimal emissions taxation policy in order for remanufacturing to deliver those benefits. In particular, using a leader-follower Stackelberg game model, we investigate the impact of emissions taxes on the optimal production and pricing decisions of a manufacturer who could remanufacture its own product. We characterize whether/under what conditions the manufacturer’s decision to remanufacture under emissions regulation reduces its environmental impact (as measured by total greenhouse emissions), whilst increasing its profits (a win-win situation). On the policy side, we delineate how emissions taxes can be instituted to realize the inherent economic, environmental and social benefits of remanufacturing (the triple win of remanufacturing). Two critical components of this analysis are the issue of demand cannibalization from the remanufactured product and the low-emission advantage of remanufacturing. We further investigate the impact of remanufacturing- and society-related factors on the balance among firm-level profits, environmental impact and social welfare, where the collection rate of end-of-use products and the cost to the environment turn out to be decisive in deriving the triple win benefits from remanufacturing. Last, we extend our analyses to an emissions trading setting where emissions are regulated using tradeable permits, and investigate the economic implications of remanufacturing under emissions trading vis-á-vis emissions taxation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Business corporations are at the center of public discourse on sustainability. They devour non-renewable resources and produce disproportionate amounts of negative externalities; hence degrade the environment. They also undertake a host of discrete initiatives to conserve and recycle water, reduce raw material/resource use, decrease energy consumption and control pollution; hence offer solutions to environmental degradation. Among numerous activities to strengthen their commitment to social and environmental sustainability, the abatement of emissions plays an important role for businesses. With mounting pressures from stakeholders and under more stringent regulations/legislations, emissions abatement has become an indispensable piece of manufacturers’ production operations which involve production planning and investment in pollution abatement equipment/systems.

There are a number of market-based mechanisms designed and instituted to curb corporate emissions. These include taxes on emissions, tradable emission allowances and deposit-refund schemes for harmful products. The long-term regulatory trend is toward making those who pollute pay for the damage they cause (Esty & Winston, 2006). The push for companies to “internalize” environmental costs, as economists would argue for, by imposing a charge on emissions would create a financial “incentive” for companies to minimize their emissions costs and be more effective in emissions abatement than subsidies and emissions trading schedules.

                      To comply with these regulatory schemes, firms experience additional challenges to adjust their existing production planning strategies so as to cut their emissions whilst avoiding potential negative economic consequences. Remanufacturing, recognized by various governments, can play an important role in realizing these aims

                      and has already made major inroads into corporate agendas (Atasu, Sarvary, & Wassenhove, 2008). In 2011, production of remanufactured goods in the U.S. totaled $43 billion and accounted for 2 percent of all sales of manufactured goods.

                      State governments continue to act on increasing the remanufacturing activity and maximizing the remanufacturing sector in the U.S. Remanufactured products are of particular interest, since remanufacturing process returns an end-of-life product to as-new condition with warranty to match, but consumes less materials, reduces the reliance on resources, uses less energy and generates fewer negative by-products/emissions. In the UK, remanufacturing is estimated to contribute to 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide reduction every year.

                      Governments have a direct stake in curbing emissions generated by consumer products and have the power to tax products/processes based on their external cost to the environment. The firms in the U.S. (the undisputed leader in the world in terms of producing and consuming remanufactured products) receive no subsidies or tax credits to remanufacture yet pay emissions tax, which makes remanufacturing a practical and/or profitable solution to some manufacturers.

When the right measures are set in place, remanufacturing in itself has potential to deliver extensive economic, environmental and social benefits (referred to as the triple win for remanufacturing). Production planning activities are inherently more complex for remanufacturing due to such factors as quality perception and supply constraints (Akcali & Cetinkaya, 2011). Adding to this complexity, manufacturers firmly believe that remanufacturing would cannibalize the market for their new products. As a low-priced counterpart, the purchase of a remanufactured version of a product has the potential to displace the sales of a new product and negatively affect profits, hindering the uptake of remanufacturing. For a manufacturer that is subject to legislation on its emissions, to offer a remanufactured product, it should not only contribute to reducing emissions, but be also profitable (since producing nothing is even more environmentally friendly). It is important to recognize that remanufacturing is not a one-size-fits-all approach and may not always be the best option, either economically or environmentally.

                      Then, our first main goal is to examine whether/when the decision to remanufacture reduces the total environmental impact of a firm under an emissions-charge legislation, whilst increasing its overall profits.

On the regulation side, the regulator should institute emissions taxes to induce manufacturers to offer remanufactured products, only if remanufacturing enhances the social welfare in the community. Even well-intentioned economic initiatives harnessed to decrease a product’s external cost to the environment and promote efficiency can have negative effects if not carefully structured and managed (Ottman, 2011). In the UK, for instance, the government risks missing out on remanufacturing triple win.

                      Then, our second main goal is to delineate how emissions taxes can be instituted to realize the social, economic and environmental benefits of remanufacturing. We also investigate the impact of certain features of a remanufactured product (which make production planning decisions more difficult with remanufacturing) such as relative emissions intensity, collection rate of end-of-use products, and collection and processing cost of used-products, and the society-related factors such as market’s perception of environmental hazard on balancing the economic, environmental and social benefits of remanufacturing under an emissions tax regulation scheme.

Our aforesaid goals translate into the following research questions: How effective is an emissions tax regulation for the choice of remanufacturing to deliver both economic and environmental benefits to the manufacturing firm? What are the impacts of remanufacturing-related factors on the economics of remanufacturing (i.e., production quantities and prices of new and remanufactured products) at different emissions tax prices? Under an emissions tax regulation, are the economic and/or environmental savings from remanufacturing linked to low-emission advantage of a remanufactured product or the degree of cannibalization? What is the optimal tax policy to uncover the triple win potential remanufacturing offers in economic, environmental and social terms? How should the regulator coordinate the different strands of the economy and society to encourage remanufacturing so that it can deliver economic, environmental and social benefits?

To answer those questions, we consider a leader-follower Stackelberg game between a profit-maximizing firm (the follower) and a welfare-maximizing regulator (the leader) in a market, where consumers are heterogeneous in their willingness-to-pay and value remanufactured products less than new products. Using a two-period model, we examine two distinct cases: (1) Remanufacturing case; and (2) No remanufacturing case. For the former, the manufacturing firm offers a product made up of so-called virgin materials (i.e., the new product) in period 1, and does introduce the remanufactured version of this product into the market in period 2. That is, in period 2, it starts offering a mixed product line in which new and remanufactured products coexist. For the latter, the firm does not invest in remanufacturing and offers just all-new products in both periods. To understand the economic and environmental impacts of remanufacturing, we compare the optimal profits (our measure for the economic performance) obtained under those two cases, and the resulting total emissions from productions (our metric for the environmental impact), respectively. To evaluate the social impact of remanufacturing, we compare the optimal welfare values obtained in those two cases, where our welfare function includes consumer willingness-to-pay for remanufactured and new products, amount of emissions generated in producing those products, and the total firm-level profits obtained from their sales. We also extend the analysis to a setting where emissions are regulated using tradeable permits, and investigate the economic and environmental impact of remanufacturing under emissions trading.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 includes a review of the related literature. Section 3 describes the model, and Section 4 studies the structural properties of the optimal profit and environmental impact functions under emissions tax regulation. Section 5 specifies our definition of social welfare, solves the welfare maximization problem and explores policy implications. Section 6 extends the analysis to an emissions trading setting. Section 7 summarizes our discussion and concludes the paper. Proofs are provided in the appendix (available as an online supplement at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2015.08.020).

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

There is an extensive stream of research on remanufacturing in the operations literature. We refer the reader to Akcali and Cetinkaya (2011) and Souza (2013) for comprehensive reviews of this literature. Here, we review the efforts relevant to production planning with remanufacturing option.

Prior research in that stream focuses mostly on the economic implications of remanufacturing. By examining the impact of different assumptions on cannibalization from remanufacturing, those studies attempt to address two central questions: (1) Should a firm offer a remanufactured version of its product and how should it price it?; and (2) When do economic benefits from remanufacturing outweigh losses from cannibalization? In Debo, Toktay, and Wassenhove (2005), the firm can affect the profitability of remanufacturing by choosing a production technology, which impacts marginal costs and product remanufacturability. Ferrer and Swaminathan (2006) propose two-period and multi-period production planning models where remanufactured and new products are perfect substitutes. Debo, Toktay, and Wassenhove (2006) introduce a life cycle perspective into the problem using a Bass-type diffusion model for the sales of new products, with remanufacturing being constrained by the amount of new products sold. Vorasayan and Ryan (2006) investigate the optimal prices of new and remanufactured products in a capacitated setting using a queuing network model. Ferguson and Toktay (2006) study the pricing and remanufacturing decisions, and derive conditions on costs under which remanufacturing is profitable. In Atasu et al. (2008), there is an additional green segment, wherein green consumers value the new and remanufactured products the same, whereas ordinary consumers value the remanufactured product lower. Using a newsvendor model, Kaya (2010) considers a manufacturer that needs to offer an incentive to consumers to collect the right amount of returns to be used in remanufacturing process. Recently, Subramanian, Ferguson, and Toktay (2013) analyze how a firm’s component commonality decision across a product line and its profits change, if end-product remanufacturing is included in the decision criteria.

Alongside economic opportunities, with processes that require significantly less materials/energy/water and that produce less emissions/waste, remanufacturing has environmental ramifications, which have been addressed recently by some papers in operations literature. The supposition in most of these papers is that remanufactured products have the potential to displace new product sales; hence, the more remanufactured product a manufacturer sells, the lower is its total environmental impact. However, many times remanufactured products expand market size due to their lower price, and the result is increased environmental impact. To provide additional insights, environmental impact of remanufacturing is analyzed systematically using more detailed approaches in a number of papers (and in this paper). In one of these studies, using datasets of transactions obtained from eBay, Quarisguasi-Frota-Neto and Bloemhof (2012) analyze under what conditions remanufactured computers and mobile phones reduce the total energy consumed over the life cycles of these products. In the design for environment (DfE) context (which includes the concept of remanufacturing), Raz, Druehl, and Blass (2013) focus on product and process design efforts that improve the per-unit environmental impact while decreasing unit costs (or increasing demand) using a newsvendor model. Based on a data-driven numerical simulation for product
                        +
                     service firms, Ovchinnikov, Blass, and Raz (2014) analyze cannibalization from multiple customer segments across a product line, and evaluate whether a remanufactured product decreases the firm’s environmental impact while increasing its profits.

Even though there is growing interest in decision models for remanufacturing, research that addresses strategic and operational issues in remanufacturing under an emissions regulation is scarce. In essence, none of the above-mentioned papers have explored the effects of emissions regulation, and hence neither parameterized emissions intensity nor studied the implications of emissions prices on production planning activities for remanufacturing, alongside the environmental and social consequences. The internalization of environmental costs through emissions regulations would make the interdependencies between the new and remanufactured products and associated production/pricing decisions more complex. In the operations literature on remanufacturing, as far as we know, emissions prices have been integrated into the remanufacturing decisions in only two papers. One is the work by Liu, Holmbom, Segerstedt, and Chen (2015), who investigate how emissions regulations affect remanufacturing decision-making for independent profit-maximizing remanufacturers. Assuming limited information on demand distribution, they solve a model including the remanufacturing cost, disposal cost, inventory holding cost, shortage cost and emissions cost with a max-min approach. The other study is by Chang, Xia, Zhu, Fan, and Zhao (2015), who establish two-period models for independent and substitutable demands, and analyze the optimal production quantity and pricing decisions of a profit-maximizing remanufacturer under a cap-and-trade mechanism.

Our model is consistent with the remanufacturing literature in that we focus on operational and market-related issues that arise as a result of the return flows of used products. Given the strong connection between operational decisions and emissions, there is an immense need in operations literature for model-based studies that extend quantitative cost-minimization or profit-maximization models to include emission concerns (Benjaafar, Li, & Daskin, 2013). Our paper is a step in this direction. We incorporate emissions concerns into production and pricing issues in remanufacturing, and examine the impact of emissions- and legislation-related factors on the operational decisions. Specifically, production costs in our model include not only direct costs but also emissions costs, determined by the emissions intensity of remanufactured and new products and emissions prices. Explicitly parameterizing emissions intensity and emissions price allows us to explore the economic, environmental and social case for remanufacturing, and to develop managerial insights for firms and insights for regulators who set the legislation for encouraging remanufacturing.

Our work contextually relates to the stream of research in the sustainable operations literature that considers technology choice/innovations and capacity investment under emissions regulation (see Subramanian, Gupta, and Talbot (2007), Krass, Nedorezov, and Ovchinnikov (2013), Wang, Ferguson, Hu, and Silva (2013) and references therein). Our paper differs from this stream in various ways. In those studies, there are a(n) (in)finite number of technologies for the firm to choose from and the firm selects a single technology. Besides, market demand is not affected by the technology choice in a deterministic setting, whereas price is treated as exogenous when demand is uncertain. Our model investigates whether remanufacturing must be added to manufacturing, rather than whether it must replace manufacturing. The firm optimizes the composition of its product line (with or without the remanufactured product), and the production quantities and prices of the product(s). On the demand side, we consider a utility model, which allows us to capture heterogeneity in consumers’ attitudes toward the type of product (new vs. remanufactured) and price. Furthermore, a critical component of our model is the issue of cannibalization, which is crucial from an environmental and social perspective, alongside an economic perspective. Lower emissions intensity (or energy consumption) is the core assumption in calculating the environmental gains of a clean technology choice. In remanufacturing, on the other hand, given the connection between the new product sales and the availability of remanufacturable cores, the decision to remanufacture (having a lower emissions intensity) can lead to more production; hence an increase in total emissions. On the regulation side, the regulator might want a firm to make investment in remanufacturing and bear the costs of reducing emissions, yet cannibalization can result in output reductions – an outcome the regulator might not desire as it involves social costs. Therefore, the environmental, economic and social gains of remanufacturing must be questioned based not only on the choice of remanufacturing but also on the degree of cannibalization.

In this section, we introduce our key assumptions and notations concerning the product life cycle, consumer preferences, the firm’s environmental impact and the cost structure, and identify the decision-making framework. We summarize the model’s parameters and decision variables in Table A.1 in the appendix.

The product life duration is exactly one period and a product bought in a period cannot be used in the subsequent period. Each period corresponds to a period of product use by consumers, after which the product needs to be remanufactured for further use. After one period of use, a fraction ρ of used products that have reached the end of their useful lives can be collected (or are returned by consumers). Collected end-of-use products can be remanufactured, re-marketed and provide consumers with a positive utility in the second period.

                           8
                           It is implicitly assumed that all returned products are remanufacturable (Savaskan, Bhattacharya, and Wassenhove (2004), Atasu, Toktay, and Wassenhove (2013)).
                         The measure ρ ∈ (0, 1] represents the collection rate and captures possible constraints on collection of end-of-use products. For example, the collection system of Kodak’s single-use cameras yields a collection rate of approximately 60 percent worldwide, which in part results from the leakages in collection of used products and used cameras damaged beyond recovery (Geyer, Wassenhove, & Atasu, 2007). Under these assumptions, it is sufficient to analyze a two-period model which is also adopted by other papers in literature (e.g., Groenevelt and Majumder (2001), Debo et al. (2005), and Ferrer and Swaminathan (2006)). In this two-period setting, only new products are sold in the first period, and the firm has the opportunity to offer both new and remanufactured products in the second period.

Consumers are heterogenous with respect to their willingness-to-pay Θ, assumed to be uniformly distributed in [0, 1]. Each consumer buys at most one unit in any period and market size is normalized to 1. Even though remanufactured products typically have the same or similar performance characteristics as new units, there is considerable evidence that consumers do not view them as perfect substitutes and perceive remanufactured products to be of lower quality than new products (Guide and Li (2010), Subramanian and Subramanyam (2012)). We model this by letting a consumer of type Θ ∈ [0, 1] have a willingness-to pay of Θ for a new product and ϕΘ for a remanufactured product, where ϕ ∈ (0, 1) is referred to as consumer value discount (or consumer’s relative willingness-to-pay) for the remanufactured product.

Let the first-period price and demand for the new product be denoted by p

                         denote the second period price and demand for the new and remanufactured products, respectively. In the first period, where the remanufactured product is not offered, consumers get utility (

                         > UR
                        . Otherwise, they purchase the remanufactured product if UR
                         > 0. In our analysis, we assume that remanufactured product is priced lower than the new product (i.e., pR
                         < pN
                        ), since remanufacturing brings lower prices to the consumers, typically on the order of 30 to 40 percent less than a similar new product.

                        . In other words, focusing on option (2) allows us to eliminate the uninteresting case where there is no consumer demand for the remanufactured product, and to factor in demand cannibalization from remanufacturing.

The production process emits undesirable pollutants (e.g., carbon dioxide) as a natural by-product. As actions are considered to reduce the pollutants, remanufacturing is recognized to reduce the need for materials and energy for manufacturing; hence cut emissions.

                         For new products, we designate the total emissions generated to manufacture a product as χ. For remanufactured products, we designate as αχ the emissions generated by remanufacturing a product, with α ∈ (0, 1). Compared to a new product, a remanufactured product cuts emissions by

                         percent, and the value of α depends on numerous factors, including the level of design recyclability for a given product and the product’s physical properties (e.g., volume or weight). We set 
                           
                              χ

                         for ease of exposition and assume that the total amount of emissions is linearly increasing in production output (Levi & Nault, 2004). We refer to α as the emissions intensity of a remanufactured (vis-á-vis new) product (Gong & Zhou, 2013). Our results in this paper can easily be extended for any χ > 0.

Environmental impact could be measured using numerous metrics, such as non-renewable resource/raw material use, water and energy consumption/use during the life cycle of a product, use and release of toxics to air/water/land, and greenhouse gas emissions. We use as our measure of environmental impact the total emissions (also called carbon footprint) – one of two common measures (with cumulative energy demand) used as a proxy for environmental footprint.

                         Environmental impact thus depends on quantities of products manufactured by the firm, as well as their respective emissions per unit. Specifically, in the case with remanufacturing, if the firm produces x units of the new product and y units of the remanufactured product, its environmental impact is given by

                        . In the case without remanufacturing, the firm’s environmental impact is EN

We denote the cost of producing a new product by c, and assume c < 1 to ensure positive demand at positive margin for new products. Let variable cost of the remanufactured product be denoted by cr
                        , and assume it is a convex increasing function of quantity of products collected/processed.

                           See, for example, Galbreth and Blackburn (2005), Ray, Boyaci, and Aras (2005), Ferguson and Toktay (2006), among others, for a discussion of real-life cases where either the variable collection cost convex increases in the collection quantity or the processing cost convex increases in the processing quantity, with neither cost being concave decreasing.
                         For our analysis, we model the total variable collection and processing cost of y units by cr
                        (y)≐hy
                        2 where h > 0 (Savaskan, Bhattacharya, & Wassenhove, 2004; Galbreth & Blackburn, 2005; Ferguson & Toktay, 2006). This implies collecting and processing more product returns requires additional effort. When the firm decides to introduce a remanufactured product, it also faces an up-front cost of setting up the collection system and the processing operation, denoted by f. In addition to direct costs of production, the regulated firm under an emission taxation incurs emissions costs. For each unit of emissions it generates, it is charged a constant tax price, denoted by t > 0. Therefore, if the total quantity manufactured is x for the new product and y for the remanufactured product, the firm generates a total of

We set up our model as a multi-stage Stackelberg game between a welfare-maximizing regulator and a profit-maximizing firm. The regulator is the Stackelberg leader; thus, we first solve for the optimal response of the firm (follower) to emissions taxes for the cases without and with remanufacturing. For the latter case, we solve the problem in two stages since second-period decisions depend on new product sales in period 1. We begin with the second stage where the optimal quantities of the new and remanufactured products are determined, and then solve for the firm’s optimal first-period production decisions. After characterizing the firm’s optimal response to emissions taxes, we solve the welfare-maximization problem of the regulator that strategically determines tax prices in anticipation of the firm’s optimal response to its emissions policy.

For the case with no remanufacturing, the product line includes only all-new products so that the manufacturer maximizes its profits by offering only new products in both periods. Because collected products have no impact on new products, the firm’s pricing decisions are independent and identical across two periods.

For the case with remanufacturing, the manufacturer starts offering a mixed product line in which new and remanufactured products coexist in period 2, and the problem becomes significantly more involved. The supply of used products that can be remanufactured in period 2 is constrained by the sales of new product in period 1, and in period 2 remanufactured and new products are priced simultaneously to maximize profits. In this context, we solve the firm’s two-period problem in two steps, starting with the second period.

Recall that qN
                               and qR
                               denote the production quantities of new and remanufactured products in period 2, respectively, and only a proportion ρ of used products from period 1 can be collected and remanufactured in period 2. When both products are offered, the inverse demand functions pN
                               and pR
                               are as given in Section 3.2. With these elements, the optimal second-period production quantities are those that maximize the profits from both products subject to an availability constraint:

                              Proposition 1 shows when the supply of remanufacturable returns is limited by the multiple ρ of new product sales, the firm would prefer to remanufacture more units were there any, but is constrained by the amount available. The firm’s response under this supply constraint is to price the remanufactured products so as to use all available returns. More notably, the new product’s price is equal to its second-period price with no remanufacturing case (i.e.,

Based on the firm’s optimal second-period decisions, we now solve for the firm’s optimal first-period decisions. We seek to determine the optimal production quantity

Since new product sales determine the availability of remanufacturable cores in period 2, it shows that under very high taxes, the increase in profits due to savings from emissions costs is greater than the decrease due to cannibalization unless emission saving per remanufactured product is small.

                              . These observations suggest that the firm’s strategy under an emissions tax would be to use only a part of the existing supply when the emissions price is not high, since the savings obtained by avoiding the cannibalization exceed the savings obtained from a decrease in total emissions costs. For high tax prices, on the other hand, the strategy should be to use all of the existing supply because remanufacturing would be more cost effective than incurring revenue loss due to cannibalization.

                               illustrates the firm’s production and pricing decisions in response to changes in emissions tax price.

                         the firm’s decision to remanufacture creates a positive environmental effect for t ∈ [0, tM
                        ). On the other hand, ΔE(t) > 0 for t ∈ (tM, tU
                        ), meaning that remanufacturing results in a negative environmental effect for tax prices beyond tM
                        . At tax price tM
                        , where ΔΠ(t) is maximized, the sign of ΔE(t) switches from negative to positive. In other words, at tax price where increase in profits from remanufacturing is maximized, the environmental effect of remanufacturing is negligible. Theorem 1 also reveals the tension between economic and environmental preferences. For instance, under an emission tax 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       t
                                       M
                                    
                                 
                                 +
                              
                              ≐
                              
                                 t
                                 M
                              
                              +
                              ξ
                           
                         (for a small value of ξ > 0), the firm’s profit increases after the remanufactured product is introduced but so does the total emissions. In such instances, the increase in profits comes from the increased total quantity of products manufactured/sold in period 2 (even though the remanufactured product cannibalizes the new product), thus emitting more pollutant and creating a negative environmental effect. On the contrary, because ΔE(t) < 0 for t ∈ [0, tM
                        ), the firm decreases its environmental footprint by deciding to remanufacture but it can also decrease its profits – emissions costs savings from remanufacturing may not outweigh losses from demand cannibalization. The bottom line is while low emissions tax prices would suffice for remanufacturing to achieve significant reductions in emissions, much higher prices are needed for the firm to obtain higher profits by introducing the remanufactured product.

The model suggests that two critical components of what constitutes a good balance between profits and environmental impact of remanufacturing are the issues of demand cannibalization and low-emission benefits. In this context, an emissions tax price can be an effective mechanism in order for remanufacturing to achieve the win-win situation in which the firm’s economic and environmental goals align – depending essentially on the behavior of ΔΠ(t) with respect to t. From Theorem 1, we observe that ΔΠ(t) is increasing for t ∈ [0, tM
                        ) and decreasing for t ∈ (tM, tU
                        ). If ΔΠ(t) < 0 at

                         leads to no changes in firm-level profits. In all cases where both tNR
                         and tRN
                         exist, ΔΠ(t) > 0 for t ∈ (tNR, tRN
                        ) and ΔΠ(t) < 0, otherwise. Therefore, direction of the economic impact of remanufacturing under taxation changes at t ∈ {tNR, tRN
                        }, necessitating it to identify under what conditions 0 < tNR

                        Proposition 3 states that two thresholds on f exist – i.e., fM
                         and fU
                         (with fM
                         < fU
                        ) – such that both tNR
                         and tRN
                         exist when f ∈ [fM, fU
                        ). This means moderate up-front costs incurred to set up the collection system and remanufacturing operation causes a non-monotonic response of the firm to introducing a remanufactured product under emissions taxation. For emissions prices beyond tRN
                        , emissions costs savings by remanufacturing only partially offset the decreases in overall profitability of the firm caused by relatively high demand cannibalization, total operating costs and fixed cost of remanufacturing. One caveat here is that charging lower prices on emissions to reverse this negative effect of taxation on remanufacturing may not be an effective approach. Specifically, for tax prices below tNR
                        , the firm would opt not to remanufacture because the decrease in emissions costs due to lower emissions rate of remanufacturing would not compensate for the fixed cost of remanufacturing and cost of cannibalization. Observe from Proposition 3 that the firm’s response to introducing a remanufactured product is conditionally non-monotonic in emissions prices. When the fixed cost of collection and processing is not a dominant factor in remanufacturing (i.e., f < fM
                        ), the non-monotonic effect disappears and higher tax prices negate the impact of demand cannibalization at a higher rate. As long as t > tNR
                        , cannibalization of the new product never decreases the overall profitability of the firm subject to emissions taxation. This suggests that after subsidizing the fixed cost of remanufacturing fully (or maybe even partially) whenever it is competitive on the operating-cost-only basis, emissions tax regulation can be used as an efficient mechanism to make cannibalization from introducing a remanufacturing product profitable for the firm overall.

                           From here onwards, we assume that the fixed cost f ∈ [fM, fU
                              ) to ensure that both tNR
                               and tRN
                               exist, since this is the interesting case from the point of view of our study.

                           Fig. 3
                            depicts ΔΠ(t) as a function of t based on the parameter values. As is seen, ΔΠ(t) is negative for 0 ≤ t < 0.457 and 0.656 < t < 0.675, where the firm would opt not to remanufacture and sell only new products in both periods. On the other hand, ΔΠ(t) is positive for 0.457 < t < 0.656, and hence the firm would find it profitable to remanufacture under regulation. Also displayed is that ΔΠ(t) shifts upwards as fixed cost f decreases, and only tNR
                            ∈ [0, tU
                           ) exists when f < fM
                           , leading the firm’s non-monotonic response to high emissions prices to disappear. For the environmental impact, ΔE(t) is a piecewise linear convex function of t. It decreases in t for t ∈ [0, 0.473), reaching its minimum at

                            and increases in t thereafter. Fig. 4
                            depicts ΔE(t), where we observe ΔE(t) is negative for 0 ≤ t < 0.557, and the decision to remanufacture would result in a positive environmental effect. In contrast, ΔE(t) is positive for 0.557 < t < 0.671, and introduction of a remanufactured product does not lead to a decrease in the firm’s total environmental impact; on the contrary, we observe a negative environmental effect. Combining these two figures, we see the firm improves its profits and decreases its environmental footprint by deciding to remanufacture under an emissions tax regulation only for t ∈ (tNR, tM
                           ) ≡ (0.457, 0.557).

Based on Theorem 1 and Proposition 3, we define three intervals – ΩP, ΩG
                            and ΩB
                            – over emissions price t ∈ [0, tU
                           ) with the boundaries of each interval determined as follows: (1) ΩP
                            ≡ (tNR, tRN
                           ) wherein the firm increases its profits with remanufacturing (i.e., ΔΠ(t) > 0); (2) ΩG
                            ≡ [0, tM
                           ) in which introduction of a remanufactured product decreases the firm’s total environmental impact (i.e., ΔE(t) < 0); and (3) ΩB
                            ≡ (tNR, tM
                           ) in which the firm’s decision to remanufacture provides both economic and environmental benefits (i.e, ΔΠ(t) > 0 and ΔE(t) < 0). Following the proof of Proposition 3, a number of comparative statistics results are derived and presented in Table 1
                           , which reveals interesting observations regarding the impact of remanufacturing-related parameters h, α and ρ on these intervals:

                              
                                 (a)
                                 
                                    Variable cost of remanufacturing. With a reduction in h, the interval ΩP
                                     expands, whereas the interval ΩG
                                     narrows: The range of emissions prices for which the firm would find it profitable to remanufacture increases. The amount collected and remanufactured by the firm could increase largely with higher tax prices, because the emissions cost savings from remanufacturing still exceed the detrimental effect of cannibalization. In contrast to ΩP
                                    , the upper bound of ΩG
                                     decreases, because total emissions from increased production would outweigh the emissions saving benefit from remanufacturing at very high taxes. Interestingly, a decrease in h acts in opposite directions on intervals ΩP
                                     and ΩG
                                    , yet the former dominates the latter and so the interval ΩB
                                     expands. This shows that at the lower end of the convex increasing cost curve, there will be a significant range of emissions tax prices for which remanufacturing can achieve the win-win situation.


                                    Emissions intensity. As the difference in emissions intensity between the new and remanufactured products grows, the interval ΩP
                                     expands: The firm will find it profitable to remanufacture for a larger range of tax prices. This is because, the low-emission advantage of the remanufactured product becomes substantial with lower α values, particularly at high tax prices. The upper bound of ΩG
                                    , however, decreases, since the improvement in α leads to more production overall, and hence an expected increase in total emissions. This negates the per-unit emissions reduction benefit of remanufacturing in total. Lower α has also a positive effect on ΩB
                                    : Introduction of a remanufactured product with a low α value will align the firm’s economic and environmental goals for a larger range of tax prices.


                                    Collection rate. As the accessibility of end-of-use products increases, the interval ΩP
                                     expands. This is quite intuitive because even when remanufacturing a used product reduces both production and emissions cost significantly, it makes little sense to invest in more remanufactured products if collection rates are low. More importantly, while the upper bound of ΩP
                                     increases slightly with lower h and α values and is rather insensitive to these two parameters, it is sensitive to collection rate and increases convex in ρ. This sensitivity causes the firm’s non-monotonic response to introducing a remanufactured product to disappear for high ρ values. The interval ΩG
                                     also expands with ρ. Therefore, together with the previous observation, there will be more win-win opportunities for the firm who opts to remanufacture under an emissions tax if it is able to increase its end-of-use product collection rate – even if it is already not low.

The preceding analysis suggests that by imposing a charge on emissions, cannibalization from introducing a remanufactured product could be made profitable for the firm overall – in cases where the economics of remanufacturing are marginal or negative. However, because emissions prices would directly affect the firm’s profit, consumer surplus and environmental impact of production and consumption, whether it is a desirable outcome for the regulator should be a subject of debate. Let i ∈ {R, N} denote the firm’s decision of whether to introduce a remanufactured product in period 2. We start with constructing the welfare function Wi
                     (t) for each case, and proceed to the regulator’s problem and investigate how emissions prices affect the economic, environmental and social assessment of remanufacturing.

Suppose the regulator selects a tax price t, and the firm’s response is to remanufacture in period 2 (i.e., 
                           
                              i

                        ). Our social welfare function consists of three components:

                                    A variety of methods have been developed to express emissions in monetary terms. See Davidson, Boon, and van Swigchem (2005) and references therein for an extensive literature on methods available.
                                  The ζ translates a unit of emissions into a monetary unit, and is assumed to be independent of the source of emissions (Cachon (2014)): The pollutant has the same environmental cost if emitted by a new product or a remanufactured product. The argument of ω(.) is the total amount of emissions from production:

For our purposes, we need to find a way of comparing the environmental impact with the economic surplus change, and the unit cost of emissions to the environment ζ is a critical parameter in our model set-up. One alternative approach is to interpret ζ as the ecocentrism parameter which measures the market’s perception of environmental hazard or the degree of the society’s consciousness over the emissions from a firm’s production process. By this approach, the higher the level of ecocentrism, the higher the value of ζ, and a more significant welfare loss due to environmental hazard is perceived by the society (Nelson, 2008).

                           We refer the reader to Atasu, Wassenhove, and Sarvary (2009) for a brief discussion of different approaches used in determining the economic value of this parameter. Estimating or quantifying this parameter is beyond the scope of our analysis, because our purpose is to generate insights using stylized models, but ζ can be quantified by looking at the willingness-to-pay of consumers for avoiding the harm to the environment.
                         For the remainder of our analysis, we assume that this kind of measure exists with the economic and environmental interpretation.

Define i
                     *(t) as the firm’s optimal response to emissions price t charged by the regulator (as characterized in Section 4.3). The problem to be solved by the regulator (Stackelberg leader) is to determine the tax price ts
                      that would maximize the total social welfare:

                     Corollary 1 states that a threshold 
                        
                           ζ
                           ¯
                        
                      on the cost to the environment ζ exists, below which the regulator does not charge taxes on emissions at the cost of higher environmental damage, and the firm chooses not to remanufacture in response. This result is driven by the concavity effect of ζ on total welfare. The sum of consumer surplus and firm’s profit, i.e., 
                        
                           C
                           S

                           )
                           ,
                        
                      is concave decreasing in t. When ζ is small enough, the effect of tax prices on total welfare is negative. This means from the regulator’s perspective that emissions prices can be an effective mechanism for inducing firms to remanufacture only when ζ is sufficiently high. In particular, when 
                        
                           ζ
                           >

                              ¯
                           
                           ,
                        
                      the weight of total environmental cost in welfare function is sufficiently high so that Wi
                     (t) (
                        
                           i
                           =
                           R
                           ,
                           N
                        
                     ) is concave in t with ∂Wi
                     (t)/∂t > 0 at 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           0
                        
                     . That is to say, to improve the total welfare, the regulator must enact taxes on emissions – unless environmental cost is so low. Another interpretation is that when the market’s perception of environmental hazard is low and so consumers are not willing to pay for avoiding the harm to the environment (for example, when consumer willingness-to-pay for a marginal increase in the air quality is low (Smith & Huang, 1995)), the regulator is not inclined to impose charges on emissions and the firm chooses not to introduce a remanufactured product in response. As consumer perception ζ increases, the attractiveness of remanufacturing increases. To sum, with either interpretation, the parameter ζ directly affects the socially optimal tax price and the firm’s decision to remanufacture, and consequently the optimal value of total welfare.

                     Corollary 2 presents an interesting result: If market’s perception of environmental hazard is considerably high, causing a significant welfare loss because of emissions, emissions are charged at very high prices to achieve substantial reductions. This in turn induces the firm not to remanufacture. The reason is that once ζ exceeds

                      the socially optimal tax price ts
                      is pushed into the upper bound of interval (tRN, tU
                     ). Thus, consumers’ willingness-to-pay a premium for a decrease in environmental impact do not always favor remanufacturing (which produces each unit of the product with fewer emissions). Indeed, what we observe is that remanufacturing would be more attractive with higher ζ as long as

                     ), the optimal response of the firm would always be not to remanufacture its used products. This does not mean, however, that remanufacturing would always be the socially optimal choice when 
                        
                           ζ
                           ∈

                      as discussed in detail below. Interestingly, notice also that even though the firm’s response would be not to remanufacture, consumers’ remarkably high perception of environmental hazard reduces the emissions substantially, resulting in the least total environmental impact. Because ts
                      is set at its upper bound when ζ is too high, we observe a positive environmental effect caused by the sharp decrease in total production.

Let us now investigate whether emissions tax regulation achieves its targets and objective. By Theorem 2, Wi
                     (t) is maximized at ti
                      (
                        
                           i
                           =
                           R
                           ,
                           N
                        
                     ), yet the regulator’s welfare problem in Eq. (15) may not be maximized at any of these prices. The firm’s anticipation of changes in emissions prices may result in unexpected outcomes. By Proposition 3, the firm chooses to remanufacture for t ∈ (tNR, tRN
                     ), and not to remanufacture for t ∈ [0, tNR
                     ) ∪ (tRN, tU
                     ). Then, the socially optimal tax price can be either

                     ) ∪ (tRN, tU
                     )), since we can have WR
                     (tNR
                     ) ≠ WN
                     (tNR

                     (tRN
                     ). This has policy implications for the regulator in that it should set ts
                      in accordance with cost to the environment ζ and tax levels {tNR, tRN
                     }. The following proposition characterizes the socially optimal tax prices (its proof follows directly from the preceding discussions and so is omitted).

In finding the socially optimal tax price, Proposition 4 shows tax levels tNR
                      and tRN
                      assume a large importance. Depending on the values of tR
                      and tN
                      relative to tNR
                      and tRN
                     , the socially optimal tax price ts
                      can be obtained by inspecting a finite set of points, meaning that the welfare maximization problem in Eq. (15) can be solved essentially by inspection. More importantly, the directional effects of the remanufacturing-related parameters h, α and ρ on tax levels {tNR, tRN
                     } and on intervals ΩP, ΩG
                      and ΩB
                      defined in Section 4.3.2, and the impact of cost to the environment ζ on prices {tR, tN
                     } can have significant implications on the socially optimal tax price ts
                     . The following example showcases these implications.

Using the parameter values in Section 4.3.1, we obtain

                        . This illustrates that higher levels of market’s perception of environmental hazard do not necessarily lead to the introduction of a remanufactured product. When the weight of ω(.) in the welfare function is high, the regulator prioritizes environmental cost over other welfare components and imposes very high prices on emissions to minimize environmental impact. Although such a charge reasonably deters the firm from introducing a remanufactured product, its total environmental impact decreases (as indicated by the non-green segment of the horizontal axis). This implies that under regulation, not introducing the remanufactured product can create a positive environmental effect.

                         remanufacturing is efficient in achieving the triple win situation for customers who pay less, the manufacturing firm who earns more and the environment which gains from lower emissions when compared with manufacturing.

We make a number of interesting observations based on Corollary 1, Corollary 2, Proposition 4 and the preceding numerical results. First, as cost to the environment ζ increases, the maximum welfare attainable under cases without and with remanufacturing decreases, whereas the tax prices {tR, tN
                        } at which these maximums are attained increase. Because the intervals ΩP, ΩG
                         and ΩB
                         are independent of ζ, this means that when regulator weighs the environmental hazard at a moderate level (i.e., 
                           
                              
                                 ζ
                                 ¯
                              
                              <
                              ζ
                              <
                              
                                 
                                    ζ
                                    ¯
                                 
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        ), the triple win potential of remanufacturing improves. This observation is certainly encouraging. It suggests that without resorting to very high emissions prices, the regulator can build remanufacturing into an economically, environmentally and socially robust practice. On the other hand, charging heavy taxes on emissions (i.e., t > tRN
                        ) to address high levels of social concern for pollution (i.e., when 
                           
                              ζ
                              >
                              
                                 
                                    ζ
                                    ¯
                                 
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        ) will have the unintended consequence of inhibiting investments in remanufacturing. Besides, the choice to remanufacture would lead to an increase in total emissions; hence the negative environmental effect.

Second, the emissions intensity α which reflects the emissions reduction benefit of a remanufactured product is a critical parameter in deriving potential triple win benefits from remanufacturing. As the emissions intensity of a remanufactured (vis-á-vis new) product decreases; (1) the interval ΩB
                         over tax prices wherein remanufacturing achieves the win-win situation expands, and (2) the gap between the thresholds 
                           
                              ζ
                              ¯
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 ζ
                                 ¯
                              
                              ¯
                           
                         on cost to the environment increases. Besides, although it has no effect on total welfare with no remanufacturing, the rate of increase in total welfare with remanufacturing with respect to emissions prices increases by decreasing values of α. Then, an improvement to the remanufactured product’s emissions intensity increases directly the range of tax prices for which a triple win situation is achieved by remanufacturing. Third, when cost to the environment ζ is above the characterized threshold, the firm would decide not to introduce a remanufactured product due to heavy taxes imposed on emissions to maximize social welfare. Interestingly, this ensures that the total environmental impact of the firm is minimized across all emissions tax prices in both remanufacturing and no remanufacturing cases. This implies that under emissions regulation, opting not to introduce a remanufactured product can create both bottom-line and environmental benefits as well. Last, the socially optimal tax price ts
                         turns out to be less than ζ, with the gap monotonically decreasing in ζ. This can be useful in practice because the regulator can benefit from the economic value of ζ before determining the emissions tax price – essentially when society does place a significantly high value on avoiding the harm to the environment (i.e., for high values of ζ).

Under emissions trading, the manufacturing firm receives initial emissions permits (or emissions allowances) from the regulator free of charge (grandfathering), entitling the firm to emit a certain amount of emissions.
                        19
                     
                     
                        19
                        In practice, permits are given by grandfathering or by auctioning. Despite the economic superiority of auctions over free distribution, the latter is implemented because it offers a greater degree of political control over the distributional effects of regulation (Subramanian et al. (2007)).
                      To comply with the regulation, the firm can buy or sell permits in an outside market. A system of tradeable permits combines properties of both taxes and subsidies: The purchase of permits is like an emissions tax, whereas the initial endowment of permits is a kind of subsidy (Levi & Nault, 2004). Thus, emissions trading may also be an effective mechanism to overcome the negative effect of cannibalization from remanufacturing, yet create additional challenges for the firm to adjust its production planning in compliance with the regulation. In this context, we compare the impact of emissions tax and emissions trading on remanufacturing in delivering economic and environmental benefits. The solution to the firm’s problem under emissions trading in cases with and without remanufacturing, and all proofs are provided in Appendix F.

                        ): If zk
                         > 0 (zk
                         < 0), then the firm buys (sells) zk
                         (|zk
                        |) units of permits. We note that the set-up for emissions trading model resembles that of the emissions tax model, except: (1) Tax price t is replaced by allowance price e; (2) An allowance balance constraint is considered in each period; and (3) A revenue term 
                           
                              −

                         is added to the firm’s profit function in each period. The solution reveals that the structural results for the optimal production and pricing decisions of the manufacturer under emissions taxation hold for those under emissions trading. Besides, we find that initial endowment of allowances C has no effect on the optimal production and pricing decisions under emissions trading. In this regard, we do not present these results but rather focus on the impact of allowance prices and relative emissions intensity of remanufacturing on the traded quantities of permits.

                        Corollary 3 shows that emissions trading can be effective in quelling the emissions. The allowance price increases the cost of buying a permit, yet vastly reduces the traded quantity of allowances. Recall that in cases where z
                        1, z
                        2 < 0, the amount of allowances used by the firm is less than the initial endowment C, and it sells leftover allowances in an outside market. This positive effect results in part from the decrease in overall production and in part from the lower emissions intensity of the remanufactured product. Corollary 3 indicates how those traded quantity of allowances change with relative emissions intensity α. Even though an increase in α leads to a decrease in first-period traded allowances, the total traded quantity of allowances over two periods increases with α. This increase results from second order effects. Combining this effect of α with that of e, we observe that improvements to α under higher allowance prices can lead to a success in emissions abatement. This can also represent a possible temporal trade-off in emissions abatement because allowance prices above a certain point (as observed in emissions tax setting) inhibit introduction of a remanufactured product that could have more dramatic emission reduction effects.

Even though we observe a non-monotonic effect of allowance price e on the profitability of introducing a remanufactured product under emissions trading (regardless of the initial allowances C), a remanufactured product under emissions trading creates more value than it does under emissions taxation. This holds true even when the allowance price e is greater than the emissions tax price t. This is because, the profit margin per unit of demand the firm serves is greater under emissions trading than it is under emissions taxation. The added costs from emissions trading incurred due to an increase in allowance price relative to emissions price cause the total production quantity under emissions trading to be less than the one under emissions taxation. However, such a decrease in total production under emissions trading leads to a reduction in total emissions (compared to emissions taxation) and creates additional value for the firm. The increase in allowance price increases not only the number of leftover allowances to sell but also the revenue from selling one unit of allowance in a period. This means that in spite of acting in opposite directions on the firm’s profits, the per unit demand profit margin effect dominates and makes remanufacturing more profitable under emissions trading than emissions taxation. The same results apply to the no remanufacturing scenario. Combining these two results, we observe the firm earns more profit under emissions trading than emissions taxation.

                         decreases monotonically in e for small number of allowances on hand at the beginning of each period, it increases monotonically in e when the starting allowance level is sufficiently high. This result is rather intuitive because a higher level of C does not affect the production and pricing decisions of the firm, but leads to less need for purchasing additional allowances during the period and/or to saving allowances so that the firm can sell the leftover allowances in this period to obtain more income by higher unit allowance prices. Therefore, we can conclude that the emissions trading regulation generates greater profit than the emissions taxation and the profit differential increases with the initial endowment of allowances received from the regulator.

Remanufacturing in itself has immense economic, environmental and social potential. With mounting pressures from stakeholders and more stringent regulations, it is imperative to understand how legislations on emissions affect the efficiency of remanufacturing in delivering its triple win potential. To that end, two essential questions related to remanufacturing are examined: (1) How effective is emissions regulation in making remanufacturing achieve the win-win situation where the manufacturer’s economic and environmental goals are congruent?; and (2) What is the effectual emissions taxation setting to realize the triple win benefits of remanufacturing? We also examine the impact of distinguishing features of a remanufactured (vis-á-vis new) product and the society-related factors on remanufacturing’s effectiveness in balancing profits with environmental and social impact. Last, we extend our analysis to an emissions trading setting and investigate its impact on recognizing the economic and environmental benefits of remanufacturing.

Our research points to a number of (potential) unintended consequences from remanufacturing under an emissions regulation. For the economic assessment, we find that even in cases where the economics of remanufacturing are marginal (or perhaps negative), imposing a charge on emissions can make it profitable for the manufacturer to introduce a remanufactured product into its product line. One caveat is that for tax prices above a certain level, emissions cost savings by remanufacturing may not offset the negative impact of cannibalization, which makes remanufacturing not a profitable option for the manufacturer. Heavy charges highly internalize environmental costs and drive investment in remanufactured product production, but this comes at the cost of a higher degree of cannibalization in the product line where new and remanufactured products coexist. To reverse such negative effect of regulation, the regulator may rather keep the emissions price at sufficiently low levels. However, this may not be an effective mechanism either, since the resulting decrease in emissions costs may not compensate for the fixed cost of remanufacturing and cost of cannibalization. These showcase that enacting taxes on emissions can indeed transform the potential for cannibalization from remanufacturing into a cash cow, but the regulation on emissions has to be designed or executed properly by the regulator.

For the environmental assessment, even a low base for emissions charges offers an effective approach to reducing total emissions by remanufacturing, yet may not be adequate to make remanufacturing deliver

                      benefits. While low emissions prices would suffice to achieve substantial reductions in emissions by remanufacturing, much higher charges are needed for remanufacturing to deliver economic benefits. This finding runs counter to the argument that a very low base would minimize the initial economic burden and spur clean-tech investment, while avoiding environmental harm (e.g., Esty and Charnovitz (2012)). Our counterargument results from the two critical components of remanufacturing; cannibalization and low-emission advantage of remanufacturing. We observe that at low/modest emissions charges, the potential cannibalization costs from remanufacturing would outweigh the added costs of emissions. On the contrary, at higher emissions charges, low-emission advantage of the remanufactured product would be amply conspicuous to avoid the negative economic consequences of cannibalization. Our findings also show a negative environmental effect of remanufacturing at relatively high emissions prices so that the profit increases but so does the total emissions of the remanufacturing firm. This is as a result of the manufacturer’s sales growth: In spite of the excessive cannibalization of new products, the total production of the manufacturer increases; thus emitting more emissions.

For the social assessment, it is important for the regulator to find an economic measure to estimate the cost to the environment. We find that the higher the cost to the environment (or the public willingness-to-pay for avoiding the harm to the environment), remanufacturing is more likely to deliver its triple win benefits. One caveat is that if consumer willingness-to-pay for a decrease in environmental impact goes beyond a certain level and the regulator in response attempts to address it in its policy by charging considerably high prices on emissions, two unintended consequences are observed; the manufacturer does not opt for introducing the remanufactured product, and the choice to remanufacture would increase the firm’s environmental impact. Governments have a direct stake in curbing emissions generated by consumer products and have the power to tax products/processes based on their external cost to the environment. However, our analysis shows that – as also supported by the arguments put forward by experts/researchers in sustainability innovation and corporate regulatory compliance – even well-intentioned regulations on emissions to decrease a product’s external cost to the environment and promote maximum efficiency can have adverse effects on business economics and environment if not structured and coordinated prudently (e.g., Esty and Winston (2006)). In order to build remanufacturing into a socially, economically and environmentally robust practice, governments and industry need to work together on relevant legislation to remove perversive initiatives and help businesses change their business models to incorporate remanufacturing. Besides, governments should work towards raising public awareness of the environmental harm caused by greenhouse gas emissions, and health benefits and cost savings associated with the use of remanufactured products. To sum up, collaboration between Government, industry and consumers is crucial to properly understand the practice of, and the market for, remanufacturing and to capture the full range of benefits it offers.

Based on aforementioned results, we examine the impact of remanufacturing- and society-related factors on the optimal policy environment to encourage remanufacturing so as to deliver economic, environmental and social benefits. For starters, we find that by deciding to remanufacture, the firm is more likely to improve its profits and decrease its environmental impact, when its variable collection and processing cost can be kept low. This has two implications: (1) Subsidization of the variable costs of remanufacturing may be a good policy option for the regulator to facilitate transitions to remanufacturing in cases where it would not be chosen otherwise; and (2) On the firm’s side, simplifying the process for returning used-products and handling returns can help realize win-win potential of remanufacturing – as in the cases of General Motors and Sears.

                      Second, as the difference in emissions intensity between the new and remanufactured products grows, remanufacturing will be more efficient in achieving the win-win situation. Besides, we find that the marginal contribution from lower relative emission intensity values to lower tax prices is decreasing, which implies that manufacturers with remanufacturing operations generating few emissions should focus on other levers to decrease the amount of charges to be imposed on them. Third, the non-monotonic response of a manufacturer to introducing a remanufactured product disappears at high collection rates, in which case there will be more win-win opportunities for the firm after introducing the remanufactured product. Besides, we show that manufacturers with high collection rates can still benefit from investing more in increasing their collection rate, which can be accomplished by implementing take-back programs to increase end-of-use product returns or building a more efficient collection system (e.g., Green World Alliance program by Xerox). Fourth, we observe that the socially optimal tax rate is always less than the cost to the environment ζ and the gap decreases in ζ. Ottman (2011) underlines that not all government officials have a background in business, which can result in misguided policies that unnecessarily hurt industry. Then, our observation on ζ can be useful in practice because regulators can benefit from the economic value of the cost to the environment before determining the emissions tax prices to be charged on manufacturers.

Our current model can potentially be extended in a number of ways. First, our analysis focuses on a market where the manufacturing firm holds a monopoly for new and remanufactured products. This is a reasonable assumption for a manufacturer that can invest in a proprietary remanufacturing technology and control the supply of used products (e.g., Common Threads Recycling Program by Patagonia, Michelin Retread Technology and Pneu Laurent), which would consequently restrict the formation of a market for used remanufacturable products. However, there are also situations where remanufacturing is not appealing to a manufacturer, but attractive for independent remanufacturers (e.g., in industries that have an abundant return flow of recoverable cores). In such a case, remanufacturers who do not produce the original product intercept some of the cores and capture sales from the original manufacturer; thus creating a competitive environment. This should affect everything from economic to social performance in the market. Second, considering a secondary (green) market segment, which consists of consumers who do not discount the value of remanufactured products, can affect remanufacturing decisions of the firm and so how the regulator institutes emissions taxes. In the presence of a segmented market, consumers in green segment will be the types where cannibalization is a real issue, since they will only buy remanufactured products when these products are offered at lower prices than the new products. Third, producers often have limited production capacities, and our structural results may no longer be true under a finite production capacity and may require further analysis.
