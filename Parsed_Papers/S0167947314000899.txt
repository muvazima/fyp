                  A mixture of skew-
                        t
                      factor analyzers is introduced as well as a family of mixture models based thereon. The particular formulation of the skew-
                        t
                      distribution used arises as a special case of the generalized hyperbolic distribution. Like their Gaussian and 
                        t
                     -distribution analogues, mixtures of skew-
                        t
                      factor analyzers are very well-suited for model-based clustering of high-dimensional data. The alternating expectation–conditional maximization algorithm is used for model parameter estimation and the Bayesian information criterion is used for model selection. The models are applied to both real and simulated data, giving superior clustering results when compared to a well-established family of Gaussian mixture models.

Model-based clustering employs finite mixture models to estimate the group memberships of a given set of unlabeled observations. A finite mixture model has density of the form

Several alternative formulations of the multivariate skew-
                        t
                      distribution have appeared in the literature (e.g.,  Sahu et al., 2003; Branco and Dey, 2001; Jones and Faddy, 2003; Ma and Genton, 2004). The formulation of the distribution arising from the generalized hyperbolic distribution is chosen for this work because of its particularly attractive form, i.e., because its form is particularly conducive to the development of skew-
                        t
                      factor analyzers (cf. Section  3.2). Furthermore, this form of the multivariate skew-
                        t
                      distribution has computational advantages (cf. Section  3.3) and it has not previously been used for model-based clustering.

In this paper, we use this formulation of the skew-
                        t
                      distribution to introduce a skew-
                        t
                      analogue of the mixture of factor analyzers model, as well as a family of parsimonious models based thereon. The remainder of this paper is laid out as follows. In Section  2, we go through some important background material. Then we introduce our methodology (cf. Section  3), and illustrate our approach on real and simulated data (Section  4). The paper concludes with a discussion and suggestions for future work (Section  5).

The factor analysis model (Spearman, 1904) assumes that a 
                           p
                        -dimensional vector of observed variables can be modeled by a 
                           q
                        -dimensional vector of latent factors, where 
                           q
                           ≪
                           p
                        , making it useful in the analysis of high-dimensional data. We can write the factor analysis model as

The expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) is commonly used for parameter estimation in model-based clustering. This iterative algorithm facilitates maximum likelihood estimation for incomplete data, making it well-suited for clustering problems. In brief, the expectation (E-) step of the algorithm consists of computing the expected value of the complete-data log-likelihood, and the maximization (M-) step maximizes this expected value with respect to the model parameters. The EM algorithm iterates between these two steps until some convergence criterion is met. Extensive details on the EM algorithm and several variants thereof are given by  McLachlan and Krishnan (2008).

The expectation–conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm (Meng and Rubin, 1993) is a variant of the EM algorithm that replaces the M-step by multiple conditional-maximization (CM) steps and is useful when the complete-data log-likelihood is relatively complicated. The alternating expectation–conditional maximization (AECM) algorithm (Meng and van Dyk, 1997) is a further extension that allows the complete-data to change between stages. An AECM algorithm is used for parameter estimation for members of the PGMM family because there are two sources of unobserved data: the component membership labels

Note that the form of the skew-
                           t
                         distribution used in Section  3.2 has a computational simplicity not present in other versions of the skew-
                           t
                         distribution that have been used for model-based clustering (cf.  Lee and McLachlan, 2013). The elegant parameter estimation for our skew-
                           t
                         distribution arises because of the properties of the GIG distribution (Section  3.1). Note that, in the same way described by  McNicholas et al. (2010), the Woodbury identity (Woodbury, 1950) can be used to avoid inverting any non-diagonal 
                           p
                           ×
                           p
                         matrices. This latter trick is particularly useful with dealing with high-dimensional data.

The Bayesian information criterion (BIC;  Schwarz, 1978) is used to select the best PMSTFA model in terms of the number of mixture components, the number of latent factors, and the structure of the component scale matrices (cf.  Table 1). The BIC is defined as

                         is the number of observations. Support for the use of the BIC in mixture model selection is given by  Campbell et al. (1997) and  Dasgupta and Raftery (1998), while  Lopes and West (2004) provide support for its use in selecting the number of latent factors in a factor analysis model.

After a preprint of the present paper appeared on arXiv.org  (Murray et al., 2013a), other work on clustering using mixtures of skewed factor analyzers appeared and we mention this work here for completeness.  Lin et al. (2013) develop a mixture of skew-normal factor analyzers model.  Franczak et al. (2013) introduce a mixture of shifted asymmetric Laplace factor analyzers as well as an analogue of the PGMM family based thereon.  Murray et al. (2013b) use a mixture of ‘unrestricted’ skew-
                           t
                         factor analyzers model, and  Azzalini et al. (2014) detail why the word “unrestricted” should not be used in this context.  Tortora et al. (2013) develop a mixture of generalized hyperbolic factor analyzers model, and  Murray et al. (2014) introduce a mixture of common skew-
                           t
                         factor analyzers.

Although all of our illustrations are carried out as bona fide cluster analyses, i.e., no knowledge of labels is assumed, the true labels are known and can be used to assess the classification performance of our PMSTFA models. The adjusted Rand index (ARI;  Hubert and Arabie, 1985) is used to assess classification performance herein. The ARI indicates the pair-wise agreement between the true and predicted group memberships and in doing so, accounts for the fact that random classification would classify some observations correctly by chance. An ARI value of 1 indicates perfect classification, a value of 0 would be expected under random classification, and a negative ARI value indicates classification that is worse than one would expect under random classification.

Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the ability of our AECM algorithm to recover the true underlying parameters for our mixture of skew-

                         factor analyzers model. We consider low- and high-dimensional data for

                         components, resulting in four distinct simulation experiments. For each of the four experiments, we generate 100 data sets from a mixture of multivariate skew-

                         distributions. In the first experiment, we consider four-dimensional data, i.e.,

                           ⊗
                         to denote the Kronecker product. Where the estimated parameter values are too large to report, we give the norm of the bias of the model parameters. The results for each of the four simulation experiments (Tables 2–5) illustrate that our AECM algorithm is effective at parameter recovery for our mixture of skew-
                           t
                         factor analyzers for low- and high-dimensional data, in the presence and absence of skewness, and for lower and higher values of degrees of freedom. Although the purpose of this study was not to demonstrate clustering ability, it is noteworthy that each experiment consistently returned perfect clustering results.

The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) data contains measurements on 102 male and 100 female athletes. We consider body fat percentage (Bfat) and body mass index (bmi), taking gender to be unknown. The PMSTFA models were fit to the AIS data for 
                           G
                           =

                           ,
                           …

                           5
                         with the number of latent factors fixed at 
                           q
                           =
                           1
                        . The model with the highest BIC (
                           −
                           2224.33
                        ) was the 
                           G
                           =
                           2
                         component CCC model (
                           
                              ARI
                           
                           =
                           0.811
                        ). The classification results for this model are given in Table 6
                        .

The PGMM models were also fit to the AIS data. The model with the highest value of the BIC (
                           −
                           2234.55
                        ) was the 
                           G
                           =
                           3
                         component UUC model (
                           
                              ARI
                           
                           =
                           0.685
                        ). Comparing the true and predicted classifications (Table 6), we see that merging components still results in inferior classification performance when compared to the results from the best PMSTFA model (Table 6). The scatter plots in Fig. 1
                         reinforce this point; here, we can see that the best PGMM model has effectively fitted a noise component (i.e., the green component) to pick up points that do not neatly fit into one of the other components. While Gaussian mixtures can sometimes sensibly use multiple components to model a single asymmetric cluster, a different situation has emerged here. The PGMM solution on our AIS example illustrates that the imposition of a Gaussian component density is ipso facto a stringent constraint that can lead to classification results that are not sensible in any practical sense.

Note that this real data example was chosen to illustrate our PMSFTA models outperforming their Gaussian analogues in a fashion that cannot be overcome by merging Gaussian components. Our chosen model, using 
                           q
                           =
                           1
                         latent factor, has the same number of misclassifications obtained by  Lee and McLachlan (2012) using mixtures of skew-
                           t
                         distributions. As reported by  Vrbik and McNicholas (2012), this number may decrease if deterministic annealing (Zhou and Lange, 2010) is used.

The PMSTFA models were applied to data containing information on cellular localization sites of 1484 yeast proteins. The data contain several variables, including the McGeoch’s method for signal sequence recognition (mcg), the score of the ALOM membrane spanning region prediction program (alm), and the score of discriminant analysis of amino acid content of vacuolar and extracellular proteins (vac). The data are available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository and a detailed description of the data is given by  Nakai and Kanehisa (1991, 1992). For this analysis, we considered two localization sites, CYT and ME3, and clustered the data based on the three aforementioned variables.

The PMSTFA models were applied for 
                           G
                           =

                           1
                         latent factor. The best model in terms of BIC (4226.78) was the 
                           G
                           =
                           2
                         component CCC model (
                           ARI
                           =
                           0.85
                        ). The PGMM models were also fit to the data. The model with the highest BIC (4213.12) was the 
                           G
                           =
                           3
                         component UUC model (
                           ARI
                           =
                           0.60
                        ). Cross-tabulations of the true and estimated classifications for both the PMSTFA and PGMM models are given in Table 7
                        . Note that for the yeast data analysis, as for the AIS data analysis, the best possible merging of Gaussian components still fails to outperform our PMSTFA models (cf.  Table 7 and Fig. 2
                        ).

To illustrate the ability of the PMSTFA family to model high-dimensional data, we applied the models to the well-known leukemia data introduced by  Golub et al. (1999). These data contain gene expression values for 7129 genes from 47 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) tissue samples and 25 acute myeloid lymphoblastic leukemia (AML) tissue samples. This data set was previously analyzed by  McLachlan et al. (2002) and  McNicholas and Murphy (2010b). The reduced data set used by  McNicholas and Murphy (2010b) is available in the pgmm package (McNicholas et al., 2011) for 
                           
                              R
                           
                          (R Core Team, 2013). We further reduced this data set by eliminating genes if the difference between the maximum and minimum log-scaled expression values across all samples was less than a value of 2.5. A total of 433 genes remained after this step and model-based clustering was carried out based on these genes.

In analogy with McNicholas and Murphy (2010b), we applied the PMSTFA models for 
                           G
                           =
                           2
                         components and 
                           q
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           6
                         latent factors. Our models were initialized from five 
                           k
                        -means starts. The best model in terms of BIC was the UCU model (
                           BIC
                           =
                           −
                           81090.44
                        ) with 
                           q
                           =
                           3
                         latent factors (
                           ARI
                           =
                           0.94
                        , Table 8
                        ).

The best model reported by  McNicholas and Murphy (2010b) had an associated ARI value of 0.738. Notably, they showed their result was superior to that of 
                           k
                        -means clustering, 
                           k
                        -medoids clustering via partitioning around medoids (cf.  Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990, Chapter 2), MCLUST (cf.  Fraley and Raftery, 1999), and hierarchical clustering. Consequently, our best PMSTFA model outperforms a variety of popular clustering methods for these leukemia data.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have introduced a mixture of skew-
                        t
                      factor analyzers model as well as a family of mixture models based thereon, i.e., the PMSTFA family. This is the first use of a mixture of skewed factor analyzers for clustering within the literature. Members of the PMSTFA family were developed using a form of the skew-
                        t
                      distribution that had not previously been used for model-based clustering. This form of the skew-
                        t
                      distribution arises as a special case of the generalized hyperbolic distribution and offers a natural representation for skew-
                        t
                      factor analyzers. Furthermore, borrowing attractive features of the GIG distribution, the form of the skew-
                        t
                      distribution we use lends itself to elegant parameter estimation via an AECM algorithm.

We illustrated our PMSTFA models on real and simulated data, including both low- and high-dimensional examples. The real data examples illustrate our PMSTFA family outperforming their Gaussian analogues, i.e., the PGMM family, in ways that cannot be mitigated by merging Gaussian components. As illustrated by their remarkable performance on the famous leukemia data set of  Golub et al. (1999), our PMSTFA models are well-suited to high-dimensional applications. Their suitability for such analyses arises by dint of the fact that the number of scale parameters is linear in data dimensionality for all eight models.

Although used for clustering herein, our PMSTFA models can also be used for model-based classification (see  McNicholas, 2010, for the PGMM analogue) or discriminant analysis (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1996). Developing a mixture of skew-
                        t
                      distributions approach to the analysis of longitudinal data, after the fashion of  McNicholas and Murphy (2010a) and  McNicholas and Subedi (2012), can be achieved using the formulation of the skew-
                        t
                      distribution used herein and is a subject of ongoing work. Detailed comparisons of our PMSTFA family to other skewed mixture approaches (cf. Section  3.5) will be a subject of future work. Finally, a skew-
                        t
                      factor analysis model can be obtained as a special case of our mixture of skew-
                        t
                      factor analyzers model, i.e., with 
                        G
                        =
                        1
                     , and comparing it to the skew-normal factor analysis model of  Montanari and Viroli (2010) will also be a focus of future endeavor.
