                  In this paper we address the issue of vendor managed inventory (VMI) by considering a two-echelon single vendor/multiple buyer supply chain network. We try to find the optimal sales quantity by maximizing profit, given as a nonlinear and non-convex objective function. For such complicated combinatorial optimization problems, exact algorithms and optimization commercial software such as LINGO are inefficient, especially on practical-size problems. In this paper we develop a hybrid genetic/simulated annealing algorithm to deal with this nonlinear problem. Our results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms previous methodologies and achieves more robust solutions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Vendor managed inventory (VMI) has been studied by many researchers because of its impact on the cost efficiency of supply chain networks. Under a VMI system, the vendor determines the timing and quantity of replenishment and has access to the retailer’s inventory and demand data (Darwish & Odah, 2010). A well-designed VMI system can decrease inventory levels and enhance supply chain integration, thereby reducing costs (Achabal, McIntyre, Smith, & Kalyanam, 2000; Angulo, Nachtmann, & Waller, 2004; Çetinkaya & Lee, 2000; Schenck & McInerney, 1998). These benefits have been realized by many successful retailers and suppliers, including Wal-Mart and Procter and Gamble (Yao, Evers, & Dresner, 2007). Due to the growing interest in enhancing supply chain integration, we consider the integrated VMI system model developed by Nachiappan and Jawahar (2007).

In order to establish the optimal parameters of a VMI system, a complicated combinatorial optimization problem with a nonlinear non-convex objective function must be solved. Finding the optimal solution to such a problem may be infeasible using traditional algorithms, particularly for larger problem sizes, so robust new methodologies for solving such problems are required. Costa and Oliveira (2001) examined metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA), simulated annealing algorithms (SAA), and evolution strategies (ES), and concluded that these metaheuristic algorithms are well-suited to solving such problems.

In this paper we consider two supply chain models that use VMI: a single vendor/single buyer model, and a single vendor/multiple buyer model. We try to find the sales quantity, sales price, and contract price between the vendor and the buyer for each model. A hybrid genetic/simulated annealing algorithm is developed to determine the optimal parameters for each VMI model, and our results are compared with those obtained by Nachiappan and Jawahar (2007) using a genetic algorithm on the same model and the same data.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a comprehensive literature review. The model is presented in Section 3, and the proposed hybrid algorithm is explained in Section 4. The results of a complete computational analysis are presented in Section 5, and a sensitivity analysis is provided in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 presents our conclusions and identifies future research directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Our two-echelon single vendor/multiple buyer supply chain model under VMI focuses on efficient methodologies to solve this nonlinear problem. There is substantial research on model development and formulation (Çetinkaya & Lee, 2000; Jaruphongsa, Çetinkaya, & Lee, 2004; Shah & Goh, 2006; Zhang, Liang, Yu, & Yu, 2007), but the primary objective of such NP-hard problems is achieving better optimal solutions. Consequently, we see growing interest in exploiting metaheuristic algorithms, especially genetic algorithms. These algorithms perform very well on large-scale problems like VMI. The capability of achieving near-optimal solutions is the most important part of the applicability of a theoretical model, so developing more robust algorithms in order to address integrated VMI systems is essential.

Many approaches to solving VMI models, both by exact and approximate algorithms, are inefficient when they are applied to real-world problems; they cannot find optimal or near-optimal solutions in a reasonable time. For instance, the excellent work of Archetti, Bertazzi, Laporte, and Speranza (2007) presents a mixed-integer linear programming model. They implement a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the model optimally, and they compare the optimal solution of the problem to two problems obtained by implementing various methods of relaxation. Because their model is linear, they could exploit the CPLEX solver to solve the problem to optimality. Their approach works particularly well on small problem sizes.


                     Bertazzi, Paletta, and Speranza (2005) attempt to solve complex VMI problems. They propose a heuristic algorithm, and they decompose the problem into two sub-problems (production and distribution), which are then solved individually. Siajadi, Ibrahim, and Lochert (2006) consider a two-echelon single vendor/multiple buyer problem. They propose an analytical solution approach, and their work indicates that more efficient solution approaches are required.


                     Cárdenas-Barrón, Treviño-Garza, and Wee (2012) propose a heuristic algorithm to solve a nonlinear integer programming (NLIP) vendor management inventory system with multiple products and multiple constraints. Their algorithm outperforms a traditional GA in terms of the total cost, the number of evaluations of the total cost function, and the computational time required. Sadeghi, Mousavi, Niaki, and Sadeghi (2013) solve a multi-vendor, multi-retailer, single-warehouse (MV–MR–SW) problem using a hybrid metaheuristic-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, and compare the performance of their algorithm with the traditional GA.

In Table 1
                      we summarize the various heuristic and metaheuristic methods that have been applied to solve VMI models. In the following section we present our hybrid algorithm for solving VMI models, which is intended to address some of the shortcomings of previous approaches.

                     The objective is maximization of total profit. The vendor costs are due to production and distribution, orders, and stock maintenance.

The production cost is derived from the amount spent for producing/acquiring a single unit, 
                        
                           δ

Eqs. (4) and (5) are constraints on the buyer sales quantity and on the vendor capacity, respectively. Eq. (6) constrains the solution to be non-negative. The solution to the above problem gives the optimal sales quantity

Usually, solving a nonlinear non-concave optimization problem is not an easy task, so in this paper we use a hybrid GA–SA methodology to solve such a problem. Our hybrid GA–SA methodology will be compared to several existing methodologies for solving these types of problems in a later section. The chromosome representation used in this paper is shown in Fig. 2
                     . The length of the strings is equal to the number of buyers involved in the problem.

Recent studies (Chen, Govindan, & Yang, 2013; Sadeghi et al., 2013; Sue-Ann, Ponnambalam, & Jawahar, 2012) have demonstrated that hybrid metaheuristics work better than individual metaheuristics for solving nonlinear models. This paper utilizes a hybrid algorithm to solve the two-echelon single-vendor/multiple-buyer VMI model. Usually, hybridization refers to the combination of two search algorithms to solve a given problem (Chen et al., 2013). There are several ways to use hybrid metaheuristics, one of which is combining the traditional GA with any of the local search heuristics. This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm based on GA and SA which presents several advantages as follows. GA has strong global search ability, but limited premature and weak local search ability. Conversely, SA has strong local search ability with no premature issues, but weak global search ability (Chen et al., 2013; Li, Guo, Wang, & Fu, 2013). In order to best utilize the advantages and to eliminate the disadvantages of both methods, this paper proposes a hybrid GA–SA method. The structure of the proposed hybrid GA–SA is shown in Fig. 3
                        .

In the proposed method, SA is used as a local search algorithm to prevent the algorithm from being trapped in local optima. The input for the SA comes from the output of the GA mutation process. The output from the SA is used in the elitist selection process. The algorithm runs until a termination condition (i.e. on the maximum number of iterations) is met.

It is evident from the literature that the parameters used in GA and SA have a clear effect on both solution quality and solution time (Yang, Xu, & Gao, 2009). The GA and SA parameters used were based on a pilot study. The SA parameters were set as follows: the initial temperature To
                         was set to 100, the temperature cooling coefficient (α) was set to 0.9, and after each iteration is carried out for each value of T, the new temperature (T
                        new) was obtained by multiplying the initial temperature by the cooling coefficient. The algorithm iterates until the temperature falls below the freezing temperature, where the freezing temperature was set to 1. The GA parameters for this study were determined using a 1-vendor 1-buyer problem. Based on this analysis, the GA parameters were fixed as follows: population size was set to twice the number of buyers, the crossover probability p_cross was set to 0.8, the mutation probability p_mut was set to 0.05, and the number of iterations was set to 300.

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology. The hybrid GA–SA algorithm was coded using the C++ programming language and the computational experiments were run on a 2.5gigahertz Intel® Core™ i5 computer equipped with 8gigabytes of RAM. We solve the model using the LINGO software package. We compare the performance of our algorithm to that of the proposed genetic algorithm of Nachiappan and Jawahar (2007) on the same problem and on the same data. In order to compare the performance of our proposed algorithm, two problem cases are introduced (Case 1: single vendor/single buyer; Case 2: single vendor/three buyers).
                        Case 1
                        Single vendor/single buyer


                        For this case we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare to the results available in the literature. The parameters that describe the problem are presented in Table 2
                           , and the results are summarized in Table 3
                           .

In Table 3, our results are compared with the exact methods of Dong and Xu (2002), and it is observed that our results are in line with their findings.

In order to measure the sensitivity of the hybrid algorithm parameters, we test the Case 1 problem with different values for parameters such as the crossover probability, the mutation probability, and the number of iterations. From the literature it is evident that different parameter values are used. To find the best parameter values for the GA, we conducted three experiments.

The first experiment considers a fixed crossover probability (80%), a fixed mutation probability (10%), and a varying number of iterations. The best solution obtained by varying the number of iterations is shown in Fig. 4
                     , which shows that when the number of iterations increases, the algorithm yields better solutions.

The second experiment considers a fixed mutation probability (10%), a fixed number of iterations (300), and varying crossover probabilities (50–90%). The best solution obtained by varying the crossover probability values is shown in Fig. 5
                     , which shows that when the crossover probability increases, the total profit also increases.

The third experiment considers a fixed crossover probability (80%), a fixed number of iterations (300), and varying mutation probabilities (2–25%). The best solution obtained by varying the mutation probability values is shown in Fig. 6
                     , which shows that when the mutation probability increases, the total profit generally decreases.

From Figs. 4–6, we can infer that the best performance on the Case 1 problem is obtained when the number of iterations is set to 300, the crossover probability is set to 80%, and the mutation probability is set to 5%. We used these parameter values in the Case 2 study and in the sensitivity analysis.
                        Case 2
                        Single vendor/three buyers


                        The case from Nachiappan and Jawahar (2007) is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Tables 4 and 5
                           
                            give the input data for the study. Table 4 gives the data for three buyers, while Table 5 gives the data for the single vendor.


                     Table 6
                      summarizes the results of the computational analysis for LINGO, GA (corrected results of Nachiappan and Jawahar (2007)), and our proposed hybrid algorithm.

Before analyzing the results of Table 6, we should point out that the results of LINGO and GA in (Nachiappan & Jawahar, 2007) are corrected here (highlighted cells). In that paper, the results for j
                     =2 are yjopt
                     
                     =657 and P(yjopt
                     )=15.7. Even if we accept these results, the objective function would be 9851.65 (wrongly calculated as 5982.1 in (Nachiappan & Jawahar, 2007)).

In this section a complete sensitivity analysis is performed on the following parameters: the upper and lower sales quantity limits, the (negative) slope of the cost-demand curves, the holding costs, and the order costs. Included here are the data for five buyers (Table 7
                     ) and for one vendor (Table 8
                     ). We consider the sensitivity to parameter values that are 20% higher and 20% lower than normal, so three levels will be considered: Normal, 0.8*Normal, and 1.2*Normal.

We first consider the effects of changes in the sales quantity limits. Before presenting the results of this analysis, it should be mentioned that the corrected results of Nachiappan and Jawahar (2007) relating to the effect of changes in the lower sales quantity limits (yjmin
                        ) and the upper sales quantity limits (yjmax
                        ) at the three levels on the optimal sales quantity (yjopt
                        ) and the optimal channel profit (Pcopt
                        ) are presented in Tables 9 and 10
                        
                        , respectively (the corrected results are highlighted).

The results of the sensitivity analysis for the proposed hybrid algorithm are given in Tables 11 and 12
                        
                        . Table 11 shows the effect of changes in the lower sales quantity limits (yjmin
                        ) at the three levels on the optimal channel profit (Pcopt
                        ), while Table 12 shows the effect of changes in the upper sales quantity limits (yjmax
                        ) at the three levels on the optimal channel profit (Pcopt
                        ).

We consider the effects of changes in the (negative) slope of the cost-demand curves. Before presenting the results of this analysis, it should be mentioned that the corrected results of Nachiappan and Jawahar (2007) relating to the effect of changes in the (negative) slope of the cost-demand curves (bj
                        ) at the three levels on the optimal sales quantity (yjopt
                        ) and the optimal channel profit (Pcopt
                        ) are presented in Table 13
                         (the corrected results are highlighted).

The results of the sensitivity analysis for the proposed hybrid algorithm are given in Table 14
                        , which shows the effect of changes in the (negative) slope of the cost-demand curves (bj
                        ) at the three levels on the optimal channel profit (Pcopt
                        ).

The cost of inventory is an important factor in real situations and it accounts for most of the holding cost. We consider the effects of changes in the holding costs. Before presenting the results of this analysis, it should be mentioned that the corrected results of Nachiappan and Jawahar (2007) relating to the effect of changes in the holding costs at the three levels on the optimal sales quantity (yjopt
                        ) and the optimal channel profit (Pcopt
                        ) are presented in Table 15
                         (the corrected results are highlighted).

The results of the sensitivity analysis for the proposed hybrid algorithm are given in Table 16
                        , which shows the effect of changes in the holding costs at the three levels on the optimal channel profit (Pcopt
                        ).

Setup costs include costs related to purchasing (such as invoice processing costs and receipt processing costs). We consider the effects of changes in the setup costs. Before presenting the results of this analysis, it should be mentioned that the corrected results of Nachiappan and Jawahar (2007) relating to the effect of changes in the setup costs at the three levels on the optimal sales quantity (yjopt
                        ) and the optimal channel profit (Pcopt
                        ) are presented in Table 17
                         (the corrected results are highlighted).

The results of the sensitivity analysis for the proposed hybrid algorithm are given in Table 18
                        , which shows the effect of changes in the setup costs at the three levels on the optimal channel profit (Pcopt
                        ).

In this paper we developed a hybrid genetic/simulated annealing algorithm to solve the nonlinear, non-convex optimization problem associated with VMI models. For the two-echelon single vendor/multiple buyer supply chain network considered in this paper, we demonstrated that our hybrid algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, and also performed a complete sensitivity analysis on our algorithm.

Among the promising research directions that future researchers may wish the explore are the following: the extension of this problem to three echelons, the elevation of the problem from a single vendor to multiple vendors, and the utilization of other metaheuristics. Other possible extensions could be to combine the inventory problem studied in this paper with a facility location problem and a vehicle routing problem, resulting in different optimization problems, and solving these problems using different solution methodologies. Diabat, Richard, and Codrington (2013), Diabat, Battaïa, and Nazzal (2014), and Le, Diabat, Richard, and Yih (2013) present two such integrated optimization problems.
