                  The long perceived notion that G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) function in monomeric form has recently been changed by the description of a number of GPCRs that are found in oligomeric states. The mechanism of GPCR oligomerization, and its effect on receptor function, is not well understood. In the present study, coarse grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) approach was adopted for studying the self-assembly process of the human GPCR, β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), for which several experimental evidences of the dimerization process and its effect on cellular functions are available. Since the crystal structure of β2-AR lacks the third intracellular loop, initially it was modelled and simulated using restrained MD in order to get a stable starting conformation. This structure was then converted to CG representation and 16 copies of it, inserted into a hydrated lipid bilayer, were simulated for 10μs using the MARTINI force field. At the end of 10μs, oligomers of β2-AR were found to be formed through the self-assembly mechanism which were further validated through various analyses of the receptors. The lipid bilayer analysis also helped to quantify this assembly mechanism. In order to identify the domains which are responsible for this oligomerization, a reverse transformation of the CG system back to all-atom structure and simulated annealing run were carried out at the end of 10μs CGMD run. Analysis of the all-atom dimers thus obtained, revealed that TM1/TM1, H8/H8, TM1/TM5 and TM6/TM6 regions formed most of the dimerization surfaces, which is in accordance with some of the experimental observations and recent simulation results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of integral membrane proteins mostly involved in signal transduction pathways. Being present on the cell surfaces, these receptors transmit signals in response to various stimuli like light, odorants, ions, hormones, nucleotides, small peptides etc. bringing about various physiological changes through their interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins (Watson and Arkinstall, 1994; Flower, 1999). Around 5% of the entire human genome encodes for approximately 950 GPCR proteins (Collins, 2004; Takeda et al., 2002), whose physiological importance can be understood from the fact that malfunctioning of these receptors lead to various diseases like asthma, hypertension, congestive heart-failure, schizophrenia, Parkinson's and glaucoma (Wilson and Bergsma, 2000). As a result of this, GPCRs have become hot targets for therapeutic drugs over the years, resulting in almost 45% of current day drugs which target and modulate various GPCR structures (Drews, 2000).

Despite having immense importance, the exact mechanisms of binding of these receptors to their ligands, activation mechanism and their interactions with G proteins are not very clearly understood due to the lack of sufficient structural information. The crystal structure of rhodopsin (Palczewski et al., 2000; Ballesteros and Palczewski, 2001) was the first mammalian GPCR to be reported and almost a decade later other structures came up including that of human β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) in both active and inactive forms (Rasmussen et al., 2007, 2011a,b; Rosenbaum et al., 2011), A2A adenosine receptor (Jaakola et al., 2008), CXCR4 receptor (Wu et al., 2010), metarhodopsin II (Choe et al., 2011), κ-opioid receptor (Wu et al., 2012) and μ-opioid receptor (Manglik et al., 2012).

Among the different classes of GPCRs, class A GPCRs are some of the most well studied molecules. After rhodopsin, the adrenergic receptors are the most widely studied and most well understood molecules in this class (Strosberg, 1993, 1995). Among the nine subtypes of adrenergic receptors, β2-AR, stimulated by adrenaline and noradrenaline, has become the epicentre of present GPCR research due to the recent elucidation of its active crystal structure (PDB ID: 3SN6) (Rasmussen et al., 2011b) and pharmacological importance for being associated with asthma, obesity and type-2 diabetes. Despite the available structural information, the exact mechanisms by which these transmembrane proteins function in the lipid bilayer have eluded researchers for decades. The notion that all GPCRs function as independent monomeric units has long been challenged by various biochemical and biophysical studies (like fluorescence or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, FRET and BRET, respectively) which suggest many GPCR molecules function either as homodimers or heterodimers (Bouvier, 2001; George et al., 2002; Issafras et al., 2002; Overton and Blumer, 2002; Terrillon et al., 2003; Floyd et al., 2003), the minimal oligomeric assemblies in the membrane environment and that these processes occur constitutively and are not modulated by ligand binding (Issafras et al., 2002; Terrillon et al., 2003; Floyd et al., 2003; Overton and Blumer, 2000; Ayoub et al., 2002; Jensen et al., 2002; Babcock et al., 2003; Canals et al., 2003; Dinger et al., 2003; Guo et al., 2003; Stanasila et al., 2003; Trettel et al., 2003). Various functions ranging from ontogeny to regulation of their pharmacological and signalling properties have been attributed to the dimerization of GPCRs (Terrillon and Bouvier, 2004; Gurevich and Gurevich, 2008) The notion that GPCRs form dimers, is supported by various structural studies including radiation inactivation of α- and β-AR (Venter and Fraser, 1983), hydrodynamic properties of cardiac muscarinic receptors (Peterson et al., 1986), photoaffinity labelling of muscarinic receptors (Avissar et al., 1983) and cross-linking of glucagon receptors (Herberg et al., 1985). Using atomic force microscopy, Palczewski and co-workers have shown that rhodopsin and opsin form constitutive dimers in dark-adapted native retinal membranes involving transmembrane (TM) segments TM4 and TM5 (Fotiadis et al., 2003; Liang et al., 2003). Javitch and co-workers have shown through chemical cross-linking experiments that similar TM4–TM5 interfaces are involved in dopamine D2 receptor (Guo et al., 2003) and δ-opioid receptor (Johnston et al., 2011) dimers. However, the recent crystal structure of κ-opioid receptor (Wu et al., 2012), in the form of dimers, shows that TM1 and the eighth helix (H8) form the interfacial surface. Similar observations can also be made from the μ-opioid receptor (Manglik et al., 2012) crystal structure, which shows the presence of TM5/TM6 as well as TM1/H8 interfaces on the dimerization surface. Analogous studies by Angers and co-workers (Angers et al., 2000) have demonstrated the constitutive homodimerization of another human GPCR, β2-AR, at the surface of living mammalian cells. The fact that β2-AR forms homodimers has become well accepted through a series of experimental evidences. Co-expression studies of truncated β2-AR containing TM1–TM5 and TM6–TM7 have been shown to form functional receptors, while expression of truncation alone yielded no signalling (Kobilka et al., 1988). Bouvier and co-workers (Hebert et al., 1996) have shown through differential epitope tagging that β2-AR form SDS resistant homodimers and TM6 of the receptor represent part of an interface for receptor dimerization which even leads to the receptor activation. A FRET study performed by Fung and co-workers involving β2-AR in model bilayer showed that the molecule undergoes spontaneous oligomerization with TM1/H8 forming the preferential dimerization surface along with TM6/TM6 interfacial surfaces also being present (Fung et al., 2009). Apart from experimental studies, a couple of recent computational studies by Periole and co-workers (Periole et al., 2012) and by Johnston and co-workers (Johnston et al., 2012) have shown that TM1/H8 forms energetically most preferential dimerization surface in both rhodopsin as well as β1/β2-AR dimers respectively, apart from other TM surfaces also being present on the dimerization surface.

The present communication aims at studying the mechanism of self-assembly of β2-AR using multi-scale modelling technique complemented by very long simulation time. The approach utilizes coarse grained (CG) simulation in order to achieve micro-second (μs) level MD simulation which helped to unravel the self-aggregating property of β2-AR. Simplified CG models can be used to overcome the limitations posed by huge and complex all-atom systems, enabling the study of biomolecular processes occurring in the scale of tens of microseconds. Several membrane protein assemblies have been studied recently using the CGMD technique (Periole et al., 2012; Johnston et al., 2012; Psachoulia et al., 2010; Periole et al., 2007; Schmidt et al., 2008; Reynwar and Deserno, 2008; de Meyer et al., 2008; Sengupta and Marrink, 2010; Morozova et al., 2011; West et al., 2009). The study reported here started off with rebuilding of the missing residues of the starting crystal structure of β2-AR, which was then converted into a CG model and was embedded in a 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) bilayer. The CG monomeric unit thus formed was replicated in the x–y plane to produce a system consisting of 16 monomers of β2-AR immersed in the DSPC bilayer. The entire system was then simulated for 10μs using the MARTINI CG force field parameters (Monticelli et al., 2008; Marrink et al., 2007; de Jong et al., 2012). The long simulation performed helped to understand the self-assembly mechanism of β2-AR monomers occurring constitutively in the lipid environment. The structures obtained at the end of the 10μs of the CGMD run was converted back to all-atom (AA) representation and refined using simulated annealing (SA) runs in order to identify the dimerization interfaces of the β2-AR monomers. The calculations in terms of solvation free energy of dimer formation also helped to understand the importance of helical rearrangements achieved through simulations as compared to the direct dimeric contacts obtained through homology modelling of β2-AR dimers. The overall study helped to understand qualitatively the time dependent evolution of the membrane protein assemblies and identify the helical interfaces among them, complementing the already available experimental evidences of the homodimer formation property of human β2-AR protein.

@&#METHODS@&#

The crystal structure of β2-AR (PDB ID: 2RH1) was taken for the present study. However, 2RH1 lacks the third intracellular loop (ICL3) (residues 234–259), which was replaced by a T4 lysozyme molecule (residues 2–164), in order to get crystals (Rasmussen et al., 2007). So initially, this residue segment comprising of T4 lysozyme, was replaced with the original β2-AR residues of 234–259. The ICL3 was constructed using the Protein Loop Search functionality of the Biopolymer module of the SYBYL7.2 software package (http://www.tripos.com) and inserted between TM5 and TM6. The programme employs a knowledge-based search method in order to find loop fragments from its loops’ database. Out of the generated candidate loops returned by the search, the final ICL3 region was selected based on the quality of fit to the anchor regions (defined by residues 233 and 260) and sequence homology. The missing atoms of Asp1 were also built using SYBYL7.2. The β2-AR structure thus obtained was then subjected to all-atom explicit restrained MD simulation in a pre-equilibrated bilayer of 288 molecules of POPC (1-palmitoyl-2oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine) solvated with SPC water. Restrain of 1000kJ/mol was imposed on the entire molecule other than the ICL3 and its adjacent residues (total residues from 232 to 261) during the simulation. The system was first energy minimized using 20,000 steps of steepest descent algorithm. Then two sets of equilibrations under NVT and NPT ensemble conditions were carried out for 1ns each prior to the production run under which was carried out under isothermal-isobaric ensemble using periodic boundary conditions. The equilibration and production simulation parameters were kept identical as previously described in earlier work (Ghosh et al., 2012) and the simulation was carried out using the ffG43a2 force field with GROMACS4.0.7 at 310K. In summary, V-rescale thermostat was used under NVT conditions, while under NPT ensemble and during production run Nosé-Hoover (which is widely used in membrane NPT simulations) temperature and Parrinello-Rahman pressure couplers were used with τ
                        T
                        =0.1ps and τ
                        P
                        =2ps. A semi-isotropic pressure coupling scheme was used with the reference pressure set at 1bar. A time-step of 2fs was used with periodic boundary conditions along with the LINCS constraint algorithm to maintain the geometry of the molecules. Van der Waal's interactions and Coulomb interactions were cut off at 12Å, while long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method. The ICL3 was allowed to fall into a stable conformation by carrying out this restrained MD simulation for 10ns.

The β2-AR structure obtained at the end of 10ns restrained MD simulation was taken as the all-atom template to construct the CG model. The CG model was constructed according to the MARTINI mapping conventions, which uses a 4:1 mapping scheme i.e. on average ∼4 heavy atoms with their associated hydrogen atoms are mapped into a single CG bead. The secondary structure information required for the CG topology construction was obtained using the DSSP secondary structure prediction programme (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). In order to prevent structural deformation during the simulation, proper dihedrals between four neighbouring backbone beads were restrained using harmonic potential. The β2-AR CG model thus obtained was inserted into an equilibrated CG DSPC bilayer obtained from http://md.chem.rug.nl/cgmartini/index.php/home. DSPC, a (C18:0)2PC lipid (all-atom representation), was chosen because of its moderate bilayer thickness, since it was shown by Periole and co-workers (Periole et al., 2007) that thinner bilayers like (C12:0)2PC enhance protein–protein association due to greater hydrophobic mismatch. The protein was inserted into the lipid bilayer using the InflateGro programme (Kandt et al., 2007). The entire lipid bilayer was inflated and then slowly compressed around the protein until an area per lipid value of 70Å2 was reached, which is just above the experimental value of 66Å2 for pure DSPC. Each compression step was followed by a round of steepest descent energy minimization to relax the lipid molecules, keeping the protein restrained. This monomeric CG unit was then replicated in the X–Y directions using the in-built GROMACS utility “enconf” to obtain an assembly consisting of 16 monomers of β2-AR in the bilayer at a protein to lipid ratio of 1:100, a value that has been used in previous studies (Periole et al., 2007, 2012). The average distance between the monomers was kept approximately at 60Å. The entire assembly was then solvated with CG water molecules and neutralized with 64 Cl− counter-ions which resulted in a system size of 57,296 CG beads (16 β2-AR monomers+1664 DSPC molecules+64 Clˉ ions+22,352 water molecules). The system was first energy minimized using 20,000 steps of steepest descent algorithm followed by 100ps position-restraining simulation by restraining the protein molecules with 1000kJ/mol harmonic constraint in order to relieve the close contacts with DSPC and water beads under NVT ensemble conditions, with a V-rescale thermostat (Bussi et al., 2007) at 323K using a coupling constant of τ
                        T
                        =1ps. This was followed by another 1ns equilibration run under NPT ensemble conditions, before the final production run. Under the NPT equilibration, the pressure was maintained at 1bar using the Berendsen barostat with a coupling constant of τ
                        P
                        =1ps and a semi-isotropic pressure coupling scheme allowing the bilayer to deform along the x–y plane independently of the z-axis. The CGMD simulation was performed with GROMACS version 4.0.7 (Hess et al., 2008) using the MARTINI force field parameters (ver. 2.0) (Monticelli et al., 2008). The MARTINI CG model has already been validated in previously reported studies (Periole et al., 2012; Johnston et al., 2012; Sengupta and Marrink, 2010; de Jong et al., 2012). Under the MARTINI force field conventions, a Lennard–Jones (LJ) 12,6-potential is used to describe the interactions between particles that are not directly connected by bonds. This LJ interaction strength between beads, ɛ
                        LJ, can adopt nine discrete values ranging from 5.6kJ/mol to 2.0kJ/mol, while the Coulombic interactions between (non-bonded) explicit charges, such as zwitterionic phosphocholine head groups or charged amino acid side-chains, are treated by a Coulomb potential that is screened with a relative dielectric constant of ɛ
                        r
                        =15. The electrostatic/Coulombic interactions were shifted to zero between 0Å and 12Å and the Lenard–Jones interactions between 9Å and 12Å. The non-bonded neighbour list was updated every 10 steps. The simulation was performed under isothermal-isobaric ensemble along with periodic boundary conditions. The Berendsen thermostat (Berendsen et al., 1984) was used to separately couple the protein, lipid and water (plus ions) at 323K with a coupling constant τ
                        T
                        =1ps, while the pressure was coupled with the Berendsen barostat at 1bar using a coupling constant τ
                        P
                        =1ps and a compressibility of 1×10−5
                        bar−1 under the semi-isotropic pressure coupling scheme. A total CGMD simulation of 10μs was performed with a time-step of 30fs which resulted in numerically stable integration. The simulations were performed in duplicate, the two sets differing only in their initial assigned velocities. All simulations were performed on the National PARAM Supercomputing Facility (NPSF) and Bioinformatics Resources and Applications Facility (BRAF) at C-DAC, Pune. The results were analyzed using the in-built analysis package of GROMACS, GridmatMD programme (Allen et al., 2009), XMGRACE (XMGRACE, 2013) and in-house-developed scripts. The trajectories were visualized using VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996) and all the images were rendered using PyMol (DeLano, 2003).

At and the end of 10μs CGMD run, the entire assembly was converted back from the CG to atomic representation using a modified version (ver. 3.3) of GROMACS code (available at http://md.chem.rug.nl/cgmartini/index.php/tutorial/reverse-transformation) (Rzepiela et al., 2010), which has been successfully used in previous studies (Schäfer et al., 2011; Nielsen et al., 2010; Balgavy et al., 2001). Using this algorithm, the initial all-atom (AA) structure, from a CG structure during CG to AA conversion, is generated by randomly placing atoms within a particular radius (∼2.57Å which corresponds to the van der Waals radius of a MARTINI CG bead) of the corresponding CG beads. Roughly a 4:1 (four atoms for one CG bead) mapping scheme is used under the MARTINI force field conventions for this AA to CG representations.

The atomistic structure thus obtained was subjected to several steps of simulated annealing (SA) runs using the modified version of GROMACS code, in order to restore back the proper bond distances and bond angles between the atoms. SA MD run employs a restraining potential to keep the centre of mass of groups of atoms close to their reference CG beads, in order to generate low energy structures (Rzepiela et al., 2010). In a SA run, the system is allowed to quickly cross energy barriers and settle at a low energy minima by starting off with a relatively high temperature (1300K in this case) and gradually decreasing the temperature to a desired value (323K in this case). The restrained SA run was carried under NVT ensemble without pressure coupling.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

β2-AR, encoded by the ADRB2 gene, is a 413 amino acid long protein. The crystal structure of β2-AR, 2RH1, which was taken as the starting structure for this study consists 314 residues (devoid of the C-terminus tail of 29 residues). The 26 residues long ICL3 (residues 234–259) is also absent in 2RH1, which has been replaced by T4 lysozyme molecule. Initially this ICL3 (along with its adjacent residues) was built using SYBYL and the resulting model was subjected to 10ns restrained explicit MD simulation allowing only the ICL3 region to adopt a stable conformation. The structure was chosen after 10ns, as the ICL3 reached a stable RMSD value of around 3Å (data not shown) from 5ns onwards. Since heavy restrains were imposed on rest of the protein structure, the 7TM regions or other loop regions did not change any conformation during this run.

The all-atom β2-AR structure thus obtained was converted to CG representation according to the MARTINI force filed convention. Fig. 1
                         shows the schematic representation of the conversion procedure from AA to CG representation in order to obtain a single monomeric CG unit. The single monomeric CG unit comprising of β2-AR inserted in a DSPC bilayer thus obtained, was replicated to form a system comprising of 16 units of β2-AR. The entire system comprising of 57,296 CG beads was simulated using the MARTINI force field for 10μs. The aggregation phenomenon among GPCRs is reported to be a spontaneous event taking place in the lipid bilayers (Issafras et al., 2002; Terrillon et al., 2003; Floyd et al., 2003; Overton and Blumer, 2000; Ayoub et al., 2002; Jensen et al., 2002; Babcock et al., 2003; Canals et al., 2003; Dinger et al., 2003; Guo et al., 2003; Stanasila et al., 2003; Trettel et al., 2003). The 10μs CGMD simulation helped to understand the mechanism by which β2-AR forms dimers and higher oligomers in the bilayer. The equispaced β2-AR monomers in the DSPC bilayer in the initial conformation started moving randomly in the bilayer under the influence of no external forces. Visualization of the trajectory revealed that the monomers started to associate with each other from 500ns onwards and led to oligomeric formations by 2μs. This initial phase of the simulation saw the β2-AR monomers rearranging themselves in the bilayer in order to associate and form dimers by searching for proper dimerization surfaces. From 3μs onwards, these dimeric units started associating with each other and three distinct clusters of β2-AR oligomers were observed till ∼8μs, which rearranged among themselves and finally formed an elongated chain like cluster of β2-AR oligomers. This can be clearly observed from the trajectory snap-shots in Fig. 2
                         saved every 2.5 μs This association and dissociation of the protein dimers is consistent with earlier observation on rhodopsin (Periole et al., 2007, 2012). The spontaneous association and dissociation of the monomeric units helped to observe the mechanism of β2-AR oligomerization in the cellular environment in the absence of any ligand. The data shown in supporting Fig. S1 show that the system was in thermodynamic equilibrium during the production run in either of the two simulations which differed only in their initial assigned velocities. The CGMD simulation was further analyzed for a number of parameters which helped to better understand and quantify the self-assembly mechanism and are discussed in the following sections.

The thickness of the DSPC bilayer was calculated at an interval of every 2.5μs in line with the visual observations. Fig. 3
                         which shows the varying thickness of the DSPC bilayer confirms the visual observation of β2-AR oligomerization event. The figure which plots the value of the bilayer thickness (measured as the distance between the PO4 atoms of the lipid chains in the two bilayers over a 20×20 grid) shows the presence of the protein monomers as red spots. The aggregation of the receptor monomers displacing the intervening lipid molecules is clearly seen from this thickness plot. The figure in a way also confirms the chemical validation of the simulated system by showing that the bilayer did not enter a gel phase during the simulation period by reflecting the average thickness of the bilayer over time. The average thickness of a pure DSPC bilayer is ∼44Å (Lu et al., 1995), and it is evident from the figure that this average distance was maintained during the CGMD simulation.

The 16 monomers of β2-AR underwent association and dissociation with each other during the simulation period. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) plot (Fig. 4A), calculated for the 7TM regions of all 16 monomers, depicts that the individual monomers undergo conformational changes in terms of 7TM rearrangements during the simulation, in order to couple with each other along the proper dimerization surfaces which is discussed in detail in the following sections. The fairly stable RMSD values of the individual monomers are an indication of the fact that all the monomers retained their 7TM helical structure throughout the simulation. The fluctuations in the RMSD values occur mainly when the monomers associate or dissociate with each other spontaneously which brings about a subtle change in their quaternary packing. The RMSD values of around 5Å, for all the monomers also indicate the convergence of the 10μs trajectory. Only monomer M14 shows some major fluctuations around 3μs and 5μs. In order to assess convergence of the 10μs CGMD run, block averaged RMSD was also computed. The entire 10μs trajectory was divided into contiguous blocks of 1μs each and all the frames of each block were then randomized. Then the average RMSD of each block with respect to the average structure of that block was computed and plotted in Fig. 4B. The standard deviation for the RMSD values of each block was also plotted in the same figure. It can be clearly seen from the plot that the averaged block RMSD as well as the standard deviation values stabilized from 6μs onwards, indicating the convergence of the trajectory.

The protein–protein association from the initially dispersed monomers was also probed by monitoring the buried accessible surface area (ASA). This value is a measure of the average surface area of the monomers involved in protein–protein contacts and hence not accessible to water and membrane phospholipids. The average buried ASA over the 16 protein monomers was calculated using the double cube lattice algorithm (Eisenhaber et al., 1995) with a probe radius of 2.6Å. Fig. 5
                         shows this averaged value plotted over the simulation time. The graph clearly depicts how protein–protein contacts progressively exclude intervening phospholipid molecules as the monomers associate to form dimers and higher oligomers. The sudden decrease in the buried ASA at around 2.5μs and 5μs may be due to the fact that certain monomers dissociate from some oligomeric units and again rearrange to form some other clusters. This clearly shows that β2-AR self-assembles in the lipid bilayer independent of any external factors.

The lateral diffusion of individual monomers in the DSPC bilayer was calculated using the g_msd function available with GROMACS. The lateral diffusion coefficient of individual monomer in the DSPC bilayer was calculated using the Einstein relation,

                         shows the mean square displacement (MSD) of individual monomers over the 10μs simulation period. From the figure it is clearly seen that some of the monomers (like M10, M11 and M15) had a large displacement from their starting positions, while other monomers (like M5, M6, M9, M12, M14, etc.) had moved very little during the simulation period. The retarded movement of some of the monomers (M6, M9 and M12) is a clear indication of the fact that they have formed dimers after about 1μs and remained in that assembly for quite a long time. The initial increase and then decrease in the MSD values for some of the monomers reflects that initially they have moved randomly without forming any dimers but later their movements were hampered as they formed dimers and higher oligomers.

The radial distribution function (RDF) for individual monomer was calculated using the following equation,

                        where B is the density of all the monomers around the centre of mass (COM) of monomer A at a distance r. Fig. 7
                         shows the distribution of different monomers in terms of density around the COM of each monomer. It can be seen that for all the monomers, the maximum density reaches at around 35Å from the centre of mass of the particular dimer, which is in agreement with the experimental value of 30Å to 40Å between the centres of two GPCR dimers (Fotiadis et al., 2003; Liang et al., 2003). The density around some of the monomers is more as compared to the others. This reflects the growing formation of oligomer clusters around some of the monomers during the length of the simulation.

Earlier experimental studies have shown that β2-AR forms contact-dimers (Fung et al., 2009), with different TM surfaces being present on the dimerization interface. Hebert and co-workers have shown that TM6 (residues 270–292) forms the dimerization surface and is critical for the activation of the receptor (Hebert et al., 1996). A particular motif on TM6, “

                        ” has been reported to be directly involved in formation of the contact dimers (Hebert et al., 1996). However, recent studies by Fung et al. (2009), Periole et al. (2012), and Johnston et al. (2012) have shown that TM1/H8 forms the most preferential dimerization surface, along with TM6/TM6 interfaces. The entire 10μs CGMD trajectory was analyzed for all possible dimerization surfaces that can be formed between the 16 β2-AR monomers. It was found that 6 distinct dimeric units (M1–M13, M2–M14, M3–M6, M5–M11, M9–M12 and M15–M16) were formed which remained together from roughly 2μs onwards. They have moved as dimeric pairs in the lipid bilayer to further associate with each other forming elongated higher assemblies. Upon closer analysis of the dimerization surfaces of these 6 dimeric units, it was observed that the β2-AR monomers have associated to form contact-dimers through subtle rearrangements of the TM helices. The distances between the COM of all possible TM pair combinations of these 6 dimeric units were calculated and it was found that TM1/TM1, H8/H8, TM1/TM5 and TM6/TM6 have formed the dimerization surface in all the 6 dimeric units. Fig. 8
                         shows the distances between the COM of TM1/TM1, H8/H8, TM1/TM5 and TM6/TM6 pairs for one of the β2-AR dimeric units, M1–M13. These distances for the rest of the 5 dimeric pairs (M2–M14, M3–M6, M5–M11, M9–M12 and M15–M16) are shown in supplementary Figs. S2–S6, respectively. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 8 that the TM1/TM1 COM distance was minimum, below 10Å, followed by the H8/H8 COM distance, and these values remained stable throughout the simulation from around 2μs onwards. The COM of the monomers remained separated by a distance of ∼35Å. A similar trend was observed in almost all the other 5 dimeric units (shown in supplementary Figs. S2–S6). Notably, the TM1/H8 structural arrangement in each of the monomers forming the dimers was observed in all the 6 dimeric units, a trend which is similar to recently reported simulation studies (Periole et al., 2012; Johnston et al., 2012), which have shown that TM1/H8 forms the energetically most favoured dimerization interfaces. Similar trends have also been reported in experimental observations of crystal structures of metarhodopsin II (Choe et al., 2011), κ-opioid (Wu et al., 2012) and μ-opioid (Manglik et al., 2012) receptors and cross-link based β2-AR dimers (Fung et al., 2009). Visualization of the AA dimeric units after the SA run revealed that the TM1/TM1 interfaces were formed towards the extracellular end of the receptor, while H8/H8 interfaces were located towards the intracellular end. This can be clearly seen from Fig. 9
                         which shows the M1–M13 dimer at the end of the SA run. A surface representation of the same dimeric unit is shown is supplementary Fig. S7, which shows the overlapping TM surfaces of the monomers. The distance between the COM of TM1 and TM5 interfaces was just above 10Å and was followed by TM6/TM6 interface for which the distance was around 20Å (Fig. 8). TM6/TM6 interfaces were found to be associated through lateral contacts towards the extracellular end of the bilayer, because of which the COM distance was relatively higher. It was seen that the “

                        ” motif on TM6 of both the β2-AR monomers (towards the intracellular end), although not in direct contact, were close to one another and might be participating in dimer formation.

The populations of the dimeric structures with regard to each of these four dimerization surfaces were also calculated progressively upto a distance of 20Å, which are shown in Table 1
                        . It can be clearly seen from the table that TM1/TM1 forms the most favourable contacts (with highest dimeric population contacts at 10Å) followed by the H8/H8 surface. These are followed by the TM1/TM5 and TM6/TM6 dimeric populations which have the highest contacts between 10 and 20Å. In other words almost 32% of the total population had β2-AR dimers with TM1/TM1 forming the dimerization surface (with the other three surfaces being present or absent). Similarly, H8/H8 formed almost 29%, TM1/TM5 formed almost 31% and TM6/TM6 formed almost 12% of the total population in each instance.

In order to understand the binding affinities of the β2-AR monomers to form dimers, the free energy of formation of each of the 6 dimeric pairs was calculated using the protein interfaces, surfaces and assemblies web server, PDBePISA (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). The solvation free energy gains (ΔG
                        int) upon dimer formation for all the said pairs are summarized in Table 2

Apart from the 6 dimeric units obtained from the SA run after 10μs CGMD simulation, ΔG
                        int was also calculated for the dimeric crystal structure of metarhodopsin II (PDB ID: 3PXO). Apart from this, a homology model of the β2-AR dimer was also constructed with 3PXO as a template, to see whether the modelled dimeric interfaces are similar to those obtained from the CGMD simulation. 3PXO was chosen as the template because of two reasons; firstly because it represents rhodopsin in a dimeric form and secondly because β2-AR is phylogenetically more related to rhodopsin in the GPCR class A family sharing a sequence identity of 22.4%, than any other GPCR molecules whose crystal data are available. The protocol for homology modelling using MODELLER (version 9.6) (Šali and Blundell, 1993) was kept similar to the one mentioned in an earlier published work (Ghosh et al., 2012). A total of 100 models were generated which were ranked using MODELLER's built-in DOPE and GA341 scoring functions. The stereochemical properties of the final selected modelled β2-AR dimer were also validated using the PROCHECK package (Laskowski et al., 1993). Table 2 shows the ΔG
                        int values for the 6 dimers from the CGMD run as well as 3PXO crystal structure and the modelled β2-AR dimer. It can be clearly seen from the table that M1–M13 has the minimum solvation free energy gain (−37.6kcal/mol) upon dimer formation, which indicates the maximum protein affinity between the interacting monomers. However, the modelled β2-AR dimer had the maximum solvation free energy gain of −12.0kcal/mol, which shows that β2-AR requires subtle rearrangement of the TM helices in order to form proper oligomeric assemblies, which was achieved through the long CGMD simulation. Upon inspection it was also revealed that dimerization interfaces of the simulated β2-AR dimers are similar to that of the modelled dimer, with TM1 and H8 forming the major contact interfaces. A superimposed image of the simulated β2-AR dimer, M1–M13 obtained after SA run with the modelled β2-AR dimer is shown in supplementary Fig. S8. It can be seen that both the dimeric assemblies form the major dimerization interfaces on the extracellular side with TM1 and on the intracellular side with H8, an orientation similar to that of the metarhodopsin II crystal dimer.

The acyl-chain orientations of the DSPC bilayer were measured using the g_order tool available with the GROMACS package. g_order calculates the average orientations of the long acyl-chains using the equation:

                         shows the average deuterium order parameters of the two acyl-chains (sn-1 and sn-2) of the DSPC molecules which coincides with each other confirming their homogeneity and hence their structural integrity during the 10μs simulation. This again confirms the physico-chemical quality of the simulated system.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In vivo study of membrane proteins is an arduous task. Understanding the functional behaviour of these molecules under cellular conditions remains hindered many a times, owing to their complexity. The notion that GPCRs function as dimers could not be proved for a long time because of the lack of experimental evidences. But recent studies have proved beyond doubt that these membrane receptors indeed function as oligomeric units, both homo as well as heteromers (Bouvier, 2001; George et al., 2002; Issafras et al., 2002; Overton and Blumer, 2002; Terrillon et al., 2003; Floyd et al., 2003). The present study helps to qualitatively understand the self-assembly mechanism of one of the most well understood human GPCR molecules, β2-AR, for which experimental evidences of self-assembly are available (Angers et al., 2000; Kobilka et al., 1988; Hebert et al., 1996). The CG representation using MARTINI force field, helped to achieve a very long simulation time of 10 μs, for an explicit system consisting of 16 monomers of β2-AR, DSPC lipid molecules, water and ions. The analyses carried out in terms of buried protein ASA, monomer mean square displacement, radial distribution functions, lipid bilayer thickness analysis and order parameter helped to represent and understand the self-assembly mechanism of β2-AR in the lipid bilayer. The increasing trend of the averaged value of buried ASA of all the protein monomers is a clear indication of the oligomerization event taking place spontaneously in the lipid bilayer. The fluctuations in the values reflect the association and dissociation of the protein monomers during the process. Visualization of the trajectory also clearly showed the monomers assembling in the DSPC bilayer to form dimers (6 distinct dimeric units were formed and maintained throughout the simulation), which associated to form higher oligomeric clusters. Towards the end of the simulation, 8μs onwards, a growing string-like cluster was observed which is also reflected by the bilayer thickness plot of Fig. 3. The observations reported in the current study with respect to the interfacial TM helices forming the dimerization interfaces are in agreement with some of the previously reported experimental as well as simulation studies of different GPCRs (Choe et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012; Manglik et al., 2012; Periole et al., 2007, 2012; Johnston et al., 2012). The observation that TM1/TM1 and H8/H8 form the most stable dimerization interface, constituting a major proportion of the dimer population, is in line with experimental observations of crystal structures of metarhodopsin II (Choe et al., 2011), κ-opioid (Wu et al., 2012) and μ-opioid (Manglik et al., 2012) receptors and cross-link based β2-AR dimers (Fung et al., 2009), as well as simulation studies performed on rhodopsin (Periole et al., 2012) and β2-AR/y1-AR dimers (Johnston et al., 2012). TM1/TM5 and TM6/TM6 interfaces were also found to form the dimerization interface. The successful application of the reverse transformation technique helped to reconstruct the AA structure at the end of 10s CGMD simulation and visualize the relative orientations the TM1/TM1, H8/H8, TM1/TM5 and TM6/TM6 helices forming the dimers. The AA structure analysis also revealed the orientation of the helices in the bilayer and also the relative position of the “

                     ” motif on TM6. Further, calculations of the solvation free energy gains upon dimer formation revealed that the β2-AR dimeric pairs obtained through the simulation run were energetically similar to that of available dimer crystal structure of metarhodopsin II as well as a modelled β2-AR dimer with metarhodopsin II as a template.

The present study is an effort to qualitatively understand the process of β2-AR self-assembly. The application of CG method helped to achieve a long simulation time, often difficult to attain through AA simulations, which showed that β2-AR indeed self-assembles constitutively in the cellular lipid environment with interfacial TM helices similar to other GPCR dimers. However, like any other reduced representation schemes, MARTINI CG models also suffer from a few inherent limitations which have been discussed in details by Marrink and co-workers (Periole et al., 2012; Marrink and Tieleman, 2013; Ingólfsson et al., 2013) and hence any result should be interpreted with utmost care. The elongated oligomeric β2-AR cluster formations towards the end of the CGMD simulation could have arisen due to the limitations and simplicity of the modelled CG membrane, as the reduced representation of the MARTINI force field overlooks polar interactions like hydrogen bond and salt bridges, and also uses restraints to preserve protein secondary structural elements which might limit internal protein dynamics and hence affect cluster size. As a result of this, the reverse transformation to all-atom representation at the end of the CGMD run failed to properly establish inter-monomer polar interactions and might require long all-atom refinement simulation to do so.

Considering the advantages and limitations generally associated with CG models, the findings reported here may help researchers to design better experimental studies involving oligomeric units of the β2-AR protein, in order to further understand the functioning of this GPCR, and other GPCR molecules in general. This may also lead to varied approaches to targeting this molecule, already known to have immense pharmacological importance.
