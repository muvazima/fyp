                  This study proposes a robust topology optimisation method for the design of bi-modulus structures under uncertain multiple loading conditions (MLC). The objective of the design optimisation is to minimise the standard deviation of the weighted structural compliance. The gradient-based method is applied to perform a sensitivity analysis for the identification of optimal design variables. A material replacement method is used to overcome difficulty in the sensitivity analysis due to the stress-dependent behaviour of the original bi-modulus material. In the material replacement operation, two new isotropic materials are identified to replace the original bi-modulus material according to its two moduli. To reduce the side effects of the material replacement operation on the final design, the local stiffness is modified in terms of the stress state. Typical numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to the final design, including the load uncertainty on the optimal bi-modulus layout, as well as other factors, such as loading direction and the ratio between the two moduli of the bi-modulus material. The comparison between layouts of isotropic and bi-modulus materials also shows that the final bi-modulus material distribution is sensitive to loading directions in practical designs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Topology optimisation is a powerful computational tool for the conceptual design stage of structural optimisation. Optimising the topology of a structure is highly challenging because it is required to automatically determine an optimal material layout in the design domain. Topology optimisation has undergone considerable development over the past two decades with a variety of applications  [1]. Topology optimisation can essentially be regarded as a numerical procedure to iteratively re-distribute a given amount of material to optimise a prescribed objective function under specific constraints in a reference domain subject to supports and loads. Thus far the typical topological optimisation methods include the ground structure-based method  [2], the homogenisation-based method  [3], the SIMP method (solid isotropic material with penalisation)  [4,5], the ESO (evolutionary structural optimisation) method  [6–8], and the level set method, which has emerged recently  [9–11].

There are a number of uncertainties in the design of structures, including the operating environment, which can be modelled using various methods  [12] such as the reliability-based optimisation (RBO)  [13,14] and the robust design optimisation (RDO) methods  [15–17]. In engineering, variations as a result of uncertainties can lead to significant performance changes for the structural system. Thus, there is increasing demand to quantitatively consider the impact of uncertainties in the optimisation to ensure safety and to avoid the breakage and collapse of structural systems under extreme working conditions.

In topology optimisation, uncertain variations of structural parameters, material properties and external loads will have considerable effects on optimised structural performance. The uncertain parameters are primarily taken into account in the optimisation to establish robust and reliability-based topological designs. There have been a large number of researchers who have focused their study on reliability-based topology optimisation problems. For instance, Kharmanda and Olhoff  [18] studied a reliability-based topology optimisation (RBTO) method to seek the optimal structural layout by satisfying probabilistic constraints, which considered the topology optimisation of continuum structures with stochastic distribution of the material elastic modulus, geometrical thickness and externally applied loads  [19]. Probabilistic reliability constraints were also considered in the topology optimisation of micro mechanical systems (e.g.,  [20–22]). Jung and Cho  [23] proposed a reliability-based method for the topology optimisation of geometrically nonlinear structures. Luo et al.  [24] proposed a non-probabilistic reliability topology optimisation method using ellipsoid convex models. Guest and Igusa  [25] proposed a structural topology optimisation method that considered uncertainty loads (both in the magnitude and location) and small uncertainty in the nodal location. Silva et al.  [26] investigated the reliability topology optimisation of structures under component and system reliabilities. Nguyen et al.  [27] presented a single-loop System Reliability-based Topology Optimisation method, accounting for the statistical dependence of multiple limit-states.

Robustness has also recently been considered in topology optimisation problems. Kang and Luo  [28] provided a geometrically nonlinear structural topology optimisation with non-probabilistic reliability. Chen et al.  [29] investigated a level-set based robust topological shape optimisation method considering random field uncertainties in loading and material properties. Kogiso et al.  [30] discussed a robust topology optimisation method for compliant mechanisms under uncertain external loading. Seepersad et al.  [31] proposed a robust topology optimisation method for evaluating the impact of dimensional tolerances and topological imperfections. The imperfections deviate from the intended prismatic cellular structure and customised elastic material properties with local Taylor-series approximations. In addition to the reliability and robust topology optimisation, Luo et al.  [32] proposed an uncertain topology optimisation method for multi-stiffness structures using a fuzzy set theory to account for the uncertainty of the system.

It can be observed that most current topology optimisation problems, especially topology designs under uncertain conditions, are based on isotropic material models, which are applicable in most cases for a wide range of practical designs. However, there exists a large family of structures with bi-modulus materials that are popular in many engineering designs, e.g., concrete, plastic, synthetic rubber, cast iron, etc. Such materials exhibit different behaviours along the same direction, i.e., the tension modulus is different from the compression module. For the design of bi-modulus structures, most conventional topology optimisation methods may not be computationally effective because the mechanical behaviour of bi-modulus materials is stress-dependent. Briefly, the principal directions of a bi-modulus material align with the local stress state; this means that they align with the principal directions of the stress tensor. For common orthotropic material, the material principal directions are fixed and the difference between the moduli occurs between different directions. Due to the nonlinearity of mechanical properties of bi-modulus structures  [33–35], iterative re-analysis of structures is required for accurately evaluating the stress field of bi-modulus structures, which will lead to several repetitions of numerical analysis to find the accurate displacement solutions before updating the design variables at every loop.

There are only a very limited number of research studies concerned with topology optimisation of structures with bi-modulus materials  [36–41] or bi-strength materials  [42–45], and most of the previous investigations have not considered uncertainty in their designs  [7,8,36–45]. Although RDO has been widely studied in a border range of design applications  [16], it has not been applied to topology optimisation of bi-modulus structures due to the difficulty of sensitivity analysis for updating design variables via gradient-based approaches. Meanwhile, in a practical design, a structure is primarily subjected to multiple loading cases (MLC)  [32,46–48]. Hence, this study aims to present a new robust topology optimisation method for the design of bi-modulus structures under multiple uncertain loading cases and to investigate the effects of load directions on material layout.

It is noted that there are two categories of methods of structure topology optimisation: the first is the stiffness design that aims to minimise the structural mean compliance subject to an overall volume constraint (e.g.,  [1,3,4,9–11,41]), and the second is the strength design that aims to minimise the weight of the structure subject to local stress constraints (e.g.,  [42–45,49,50]). These are two methodologies for topology optimisation of structures from two different aspects of structural stiffness and strength design philosophies. However, this research mainly focuses on topology optimisation problems in the context of structural stiffness design.

Generally, the characters of most random uncertainties can be represented using appropriate probability models. In the probability model frame, uncertainty is expressed in terms of random variables or a random field that conforms to a specified distribution, such as a normal or Gaussian distribution. At the same time, the target function will be expressed as a random variable or random field. In this study, probability analysis is adopted to estimate the distribution of the target function.

Therefore, in the present study, a random FEM method is adopted to calculate the parameters of the target function.

                           Table 1
                            shows equivalent elasticity models of a bi-modulus unit volume under plane stress/strain states. As a material under pure compression or pure tension, the bi-modulus material exhibits isotropic behaviour. Under complicated stress states, however, the elasticity of the bi-modulus material is orthotropic (strictly, transversely isotropic) and the principal material directions align with the principal stress directions. Structural re-analysis is required due to the material’s bi-modulus behaviour. The accurate deformation of continua with bi-modulus material can be obtained using structural re-analysis  [33,34]. In re-analysis, both the elastic matrix and the principal directions of the material are required to change.

Double loops are generally part of structural topology optimisations. The inner loop is for structural analysis and the outer loop is for the update of design variables, increasing the duration of time required for numerical computation. We can observe in Table 1 that the material exhibits isotropic behaviour under pure tension or pure compression. As isotropic material is not stress-dependent; replacing the original bi-modulus material with an isotropic material can avoid the inner loop in the optimisation. However, the local stiffness should be adjusted, as the local stress state is complex. The adjustment scheme is described in Section  2.4.

As mentioned, topological design problems of structures can be formulated from two different aspects: the stiffness design and the strength design. This study focuses on stiffness design to minimise the structural mean compliance under a global volume constraint. Hence, in the context of structural stiffness design, the topology optimisation problem can be established as follows under deterministic multiple loading cases:  [1]

If the magnitudes of loads or material parameters are uncertain, the stiffness design of the structure becomes complex. According to the principle of robust design optimisation  [53], i.e., to select reasonable design variables in reducing the sensitivity of objective function to the uncertainties, in robust stiffness design, the objective function is not to find a structure with minimum expected compliance (using RBO) but to identify a structure whose compliance varies with uncertain loads as little as possible within the feasible space.

In the present study, the uncertainties are assumed to be the external load applied on the structure only, and we present a RDO method to solve the continuum topology optimisation under MLC. This means that, in the conceptual design phase, the uncertainty of loads is considered to give the optimal material layout to idealise the structure’s reliability and stability. In this study, for the sake of simplicity, only an overall volume constraint is considered in the RDO formulation.

Under uncertain loads, the volume-constrained robust stiffness design of a continuum with bi-modulus material under weighted MLC is defined as follows:

In numerical simulation, the material in each element exhibits isotropic behaviour even under complicated stress states after the material replacement operation has been completed. The SED of each element is calculated for each iteration to select the modulus of the material and to consider the bi-modulus behaviour of the original material.

Here, we define the average tension SED and compression SED of an element (e.g., the 
                           m
                        -th element) as follows:

                         However, the SED in Eq. (9) is the total SED of the element with replacement (isotropic) material. If the stress state is simple, the values of SED either with bi-modulus material or isotropic replacement material should be equal. As the element under a complex stress state, the local SED of an element with the original bi-modulus material should be different from the value given according to Eq. (9). We can therefore define the effective SED of an element, which is a modification of the SED in Eq. (9), for a complex stress state as follows:

                         If the stress state is simple, namely, under a pure tension or a pure compression state, the effective value of SED in Eq. (10) will be equal to that of SED in Eq. (9).

Eqs. (9) and (10) may lead to different values of SED with respect to the tension or compression stress. To consider the difference in local stiffness caused by material replacement, the amount of local material should be adjusted before updating the design variable of an element. Using the current total SED and the effective SED, the modification factor of the local (

Eqs. (9) and (10) present the effects of tension stress(es) and compression stress(es) on local stiffness. Intuitively, to approximate the original bi-modulus behaviour of an element, the local material behaviour of the element should be determined by whichever value is greater between TSED and CSED. The modulus of local material should be

The first order Taylor series expansion of structural compliance at mean values of uncertain loads (normalised) is calculated as follows:

                           λ
                         in Eq. (30). It should be noted that the above equation involves a square root that is always positive. More details regarding the above equation can be found in the report by Sigmund  [55]. Several methods can be used to eliminate the numerical instabilities in the SIMP-based topology optimisation problems, such as sensitivity and density filtering schemes  [55,56]. In this study, the standard sensitivity filter is included to avoid chequerboard patterns in the topological design  [55].

                         gives the optimal topologies of the structure in Fig. 1 under MLC. Fig. 2(a) is the deterministic design by SIMP  [55]. The other two plots, Fig. 2(b) and (c), show the robust designs. The results are the same as those given by Luo et al.  [17]. Therefore, the proposed method is valid to complete a robust design of isotropic material.

The design domain of the structure, with two vertical sides fixed, is shown in Fig. 3

                        Fig. 4
                         shows the deterministic design of the structure under two loading cases. Based on Fig. 4(a) and (b), it can be seen that the two results are the same, indicating that the isotropic material layout is not sensitive to the loading directions. However, Fig. 4(c) and (d) show different material layouts, as the material in the design domain is bi-modulus. All four figures have one symmetric plane, which may be the major difference that distinguishes them from the robust designs discussed in the following section.

Therefore, the material under compression (in the second loading case) is much greater than that in the final structure, as shown in Fig. 7(b)–(d). The differences between Fig. 7(a) and (b) and between Fig. 7(c) and (d) are clear. There is no symmetry between these topological plots.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The effects of uncertainty are naturally a consideration for practical engineering design, especially for structures under uncertain multiple loading conditions. Based on material replacement operation, a sensitivity analysis for the topology optimisation of bi-modulus structures is implemented in this study. Numerical examples are given to discuss the effects of various parameters on the final material distributions. These parameters include force directions, weighting schemes of loads, standard deviations and the difference between two moduli of a bi-modulus material. From the numerical results, we can assert the following conclusions:

(1) Under either deterministic loads or uncertain loads, the final layout of bi-modulus material is sensitive to force directions (i.e., 
                        
                           F
                        
                      v.s. 
                        −
                        
                           F
                        
                     ), which is compared to isotropic material layouts, which are not sensitive to force directions; (2) The values of the standard deviations of uncertain forces rather than the forces themselves influence the final material distributions; (3) The effects of the two moduli of a bi-modulus material on the final optimal design are clear. In the final structure, the amount of material that absorbs greater strain energy will be implemented as much as possible.
