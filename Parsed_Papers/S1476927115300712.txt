                  Steroid hormones are involved on cell growth, development and differentiation. Such effects are often mediated by steroid receptors. One paradigmatic example of this coupling is the estrogen signaling pathway. Its dysregulation is involved in most tumors of the mammary gland. It is thus an important pharmacological target in breast cancer. This pathway, however, crosstalks with several other molecular pathways, a fact that may have consequences for the effectiveness of hormone modulating drug therapies, such as tamoxifen. For this work, we performed a systematic analysis of the major routes involved in crosstalk phenomena with the estrogen pathway – based on gene expression experiments (819 samples) and pathway analysis (493 samples) – for biopsy-captured tissue and contrasted in two independent datasets with in vivo and in vitro pharmacological stimulation. Our results confirm the presence of a number of crosstalk events across the estrogen signaling pathway with others that are dysregulated in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. These may be involved in proliferation, invasiveness and apoptosis-evasion in patients. The results presented may open the way to new designs of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies for breast cancer treatment.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Breast cancer is a complex disease (Polyak, 2011) with a very heterogeneous nature; several attempts at classifying the disease have been developed, at the clinical (Viale, 2012), histopathological (Malhotra et al., 2010), and molecular level (Sørlie et al., 2001). Said differences give way to different therapeutical approaches to deal with different prognosis.

Mammary epithelial cells can be stimulated by estrogen, acting as a survival and proliferation signal (Levin, 2005). Canonically, estrogen binds to nuclear receptors, acting as a transcription factor. Estrogen receptors are also found on the membrane, which can activate second messenger proteins to relay the estrogen signal and exert physiological changes. These second messenger proteins can also directly affect estrogen receptors, modifying their affinity for ligands and for DNA and therefore changing their transcription factor activity. These interactions constitute the Estrogen Signaling Pathway (ESP), a pharmacological target for cancer therapy.

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Its mechanism of action consists in the competitive inhibition of estrogen, inhibiting its various actions at the signaling and transcriptional level.

Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy significantly reduces the risk of recurrence and death from breast cancer in all age groups (Wood et al., 2003; Group et al., 1998). Benefits related to tamoxifen adjuvant therapy include an increase in overall survival and distant disease-free survival, reduction of breast cancer-specific mortality, decreased risk of recurrence, and decreased risk of contralateral breast cancer (Cardoso et al., 2014).

For these reasons, tamoxifen is the election drug in current clinical practice (Burstein et al., 2014; CENETEC, 2009). When compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy, SERMs are well tolerated and are associated with mostly minor toxicities. Despite the relative safety and significant antineoplastic and chemopreventive activities of antiestrogens, most initially responsive breast tumors acquire resistance (Clarke et al., 2003; Viedma-Rodrí guez et al., 2014).

Breast cancer mortality is a major public health concern, particularly in developing countries. This is partially a result that most cancer cases in low- and middle-income countries are detected at later stages than in high-income countries. For this reason, surgical treatment is generally delayed in these countries, increasing the dependence on pharmacological treatment (Unger-Salda na and Infante-Casta neda, 2009).

In this regard, let us recall that cancer is a pathway-based disease (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000), and as such, pathway analysis is a powerful tool to understand the complex relationships and interactions that are involved in the pathology. Pathways are useful representations of these interactions, derived from our current knowledge of cellular function. As representations of the molecular biology of the cell, it comes as no surprise that many of these pathways share many molecules, being able to crosstalk (see Definition 1 and Fig. 1
                     ) with each other (Gilbert, 2000).

These interactions are non-trivial, as many of the processes involved with a physiological (or pathological) function can be working in such a way that an alteration in one pathway leads to an alteration in many others. A systems biology approach is thus needed in order to properly contextualize such subtle interactions in a global, integrative manner. By understanding the mechanisms underlying the biological processes, a comprehensive analysis might lead to insights into the molecular phenomenology that further the pathological phenotypes (Hernández-Lemus, 2014).

In this article, we explore deregulation of pathways crosstalking with the ESP, as a probable source of resistance to anti-estrogen therapy.

We propose a pipeline designed to study deregulation of pathways that crosstalk with a pathway of biological interest. For this work, we centered on the Estrogen Signaling Pathway, as it is, as mentioned before, a pharmacological target in the treatment of breast cancer.

We identified the pathways within the KEGG database (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Kanehisa et al., 2014) that crosstalk with said the ESP, and the molecules through which said crosstalk occurs.

We studied the enrichment of said pathways in a highly curated dataset consisting in more than 800 microarray samples of breast cancer tumors, from different molecular subtypes.

Given the definition of crosstalk we present, we assume that a pathway's enrichment status may directly be affected by the enrichment status of other pathway, only if this second pathway presents crosstalk (that is, shares at least a molecule) with the first one. We also assume that the deregulation of any one pathway in crosstalk with another pathway may (or may not), be involved in the deregulation of the second.

To further explore some of the enriched pathways in relation to tamoxifen resistance, we applied the same methodology to data obtained from experiments in MCF-7 cell lines with resistance to tamoxifen, as well as data from patients treated with tamoxifen in the adjuvant context.

Finally, we discuss some implications that the deregulation of certain pathways that crosstalk with the ESP (such as apoptosis and immune response pathways may have in the pharmacological treatment of breast cancer.

Our work proposes an analysis pipeline described in Fig. 2
                        . This pipeline takes data from current biological knowledge (pathway databases) and experimental expression data of different phenotypes. Pathways that crosstalk with a pathway of biological interest are identified, and Pathway enrichment profiles are generated for each of the phenotypes studied. This information is then used to generate biological hypothesis to be tested.

In our work, we take pathways from the KEGG database and identify those that crosstalk with our pathway of biological interest, the Estrogen Signaling Pathway. Expression data of breast cancer samples classified into molecular subtypes is used. Enrichment profiles of the identified pathways are obtained for each molecular subtype.

A dataset of 819 expression microarrays from untreated, primary breast cancer biopsy samples was compiled and curated from data obtained from GEO. We used microarray data from GSE 4922 (Ivshina et al., 2006), 1456 (Pawitan et al., 2005),7390 (Desmedt et al., 2007), 1561 (Farmer et al., 2005), 2603 (Minn et al., 2005), 2990 (Sotiriou et al., 2006), and 3494 (Miller et al., 2005). All of these sets were analyzed on the Affymetrix HGU133A platform. The expression levels of this dataset had been previously preprocessed and normalized by our group. Statistical procedures specific to deal with batch effects and other sources of non-biological variability were implemented (Baca-López et al., 2012). None of the patients had received previous pharmacological treatment.

Data from 61 expression microarrays from normal breast epithelium tissue obtained from reduction mammoplasties of healthy women (GSE 9574 (Tripathi et al., 2008) and 6883 (Liu et al., 2007)), as well as data from healthy breast tissue obtained from breast cancer patients (GSE 15852 (Ni et al., 2010)). None of these samples were taken from patients of our case group, and no pharmacological treatment had been administered.

For the assessment of deregulated pathway in resistant phenotypes, we explored two different datasets: The first one contains in vitro data from microarray expression studies on tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cell lines (Oyama et al., 2011), used to evaluate changes in pathway expression after estrogen and tamoxifen administration. The second contains microarray expression data from in vivo tamoxifen-treated women with known estrogen receptor status as collected from GSE2990 (Sotiriou et al., 2006).

Several algorithms have been developed for single-sample assignation of breast cancer subtypes (Kittaneh et al., 2013). We classified our breast cancer microarray samples into the molecular subtypes of Luminal A, Luminal B, basal and Her2+, as these are classifications that are associated to concrete physiological differences (Perou et al., 2000).

To achieve a maximum consistence in our classification, we decided to use a two-algorithm approach. For this, we used the algorithms CITBCMST (Guedj et al., 2012), and PAM50 (Parker et al., 2009) in tandem. These algorithms employ a nearest centroid method of subtype assignation, based on the expression profiles of a molecular signature (Tibshirani et al., 2002).

Our methodology consisted of the following steps: first, we ran the CITBCMST algorithm on our control group, in order to identify the maximum distance from the healthy samples to the centroids defined by the algorithm's training set; this empirical distance was chosen as a cutoff measure to reduce ambiguity in classification; tumor samples that exceeded this distance to the nearest centroid were discarded from further study. Second, we ran the CITBCMST algorithm on our sample set. After that, we ran PAM50 on the same set. We kept those samples where both classifiers matched. We decided to group all Her2+ samples in one group, regardless of estrogen receptor status, as defined by the PAM50 predictor. Since CITBCMST splits Her2+ samples in two different subgroups (molecular apocrine, and a third luminal subgroup), we accepted any of these two as a match to a Her2+ assignation in PAM50 (Fig. 3
                        ).

Our main objective in this study was to explore the ESP and its connections to other pathways. With this in mind, we developed a systematic approach to identify crosstalks events between pathways. This is so, since such pathways may be involved in the development of pharmacological resistance to tamoxifen and other hormone modulators. From Definition 1, a crosstalk event is any occurrence of the same molecule in two different pathways; this allows us to explore interactions through different mechanisms of signal transduction as annotated in biochemical pathway databases (see Fig. 1).

We focused on pathways obtained from the KEGG Database as obtained from the Broad Institute Molecular Signature Database (Subramanian et al., 2005). We did not exclude disease related pathways. As a quantitative measure of the relative degree of crosstalk, we used the Jaccard coefficient (J
                        
                           AB
                        ), defined as A
                        ⋂
                        B/A
                        ⋃
                        B. We calculated J
                        
                           AB
                         for each pair {A, B} of pathways in the KEGG database. Higher values of J
                        
                           AB
                         indicate higher similarity between pathways, and as such, a higher number of crosstalk events, up to a value of 1, which would indicate sameness. The use of the Jaccard index has been previously used (Jia et al., 2011; Donato et al., 2013) as a well-defined quantitative measure of pathway crosstalk.

A number of pathways were identified to present crosstalk events with the ESP and were selected for further gene expression analysis. As pathways can be seen as collections of molecules, a gene-set enrichment strategy was performed. We selected Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE), an algorithm for the study of gene-set enrichment based on a parametric gene randomization procedure upon the distribution of individual sample gene expression levels. This algorithm has shown to be quite sensitive for unpaired sample statistics (Luo et al., 2009). Comparisons were made between each of the breast cancer molecular subtype subsets of microarray data and the set of normal, healthy control microarray data.

The algorithm was used considering unpaired samples, with a cut-off of False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected p-value <0.1. As mentioned earlier, this study uses unpaired samples, due to sample availability constraints in the datasets included. Changes in pathway gene expression were tested in a single direction, identifying both upregulated and downregulated pathways.

In order to identify the genes that are deregulated and therefore contribute to the enrichment of pathways described before, a differential expression analysis was performed. Each molecular subtype group is compared against the control group using the limma algorithm (Smyth, 2005). For each gene comparison, logfold change, FDR-corrected p-value and B-statistic were computed.

Genes were considered differentially expressed if they had a logfold change >1, and a B-statistic >5, with corrected p-values <1×10−7.

The goal of our work is to generate hypothesis relating the deregulation of pathways to pharmacological resistance, in particular in relation to the effect of tamoxifen on the estrogen receptor pathway. We searched data across the GEO database looking for pathway enrichment, profiles consistent with the ones encountered in our main dataset, in phenotypes associated with resistance. Raw expression data was independently processed and normalized according to the previously cited methodology (Baca-López et al., 2012). Pathway enrichment analysis for these experimental datasets was also performed by means of the GAGE algorithm as previously described.

We analyzed the effects of estrogen stimulation and its blocking by tamoxifen in pathway expression. To identify possible crosstalk compensation in a resistant phenotype, we searched for differences in enrichment in the previously identified pathways that crosstalk with the ESP, between tamoxifen-resistant and tamoxifen-sensitive cells. We used data from GSE21618 (Oyama et al., 2011). In this dataset, a tamoxifen-resistant clone of MCF-7 cells was selected, and compared to the wild-type, sensitive cell line.

We selected data from both cell types at their baseline levels, after 24h of estrogen administration, or 24h of estrogen+tamoxifen administration. We performed a similar pathway enrichment analysis, including the following contrasts (see Fig. 4
                           ).

We searched for pathway expression differences marked by difference in estrogen receptor levels. Using data from GSE2990, we selected a subset of data of microarrays from tamoxifen-treated patients, with characterized estrogen receptor levels (as determined in Sotiriou et al., 2006). We performed pathway enrichment analysis of the previously identified pathways that crosstalk with the ESP, between patients with positive and negative estrogen receptor status. Pathways enriched in this comparison in our original dataset were chosen to validate a common profile of enrichment between histologically classified samples and molecularly profiled samples.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In what follows, we will present the results of the molecular classification of our primary dataset, the ESP crosstalk analysis, and the enrichment analysis on both the discovery datasets and the datasets used for further exploration of differences in the estrogen receptor status.

By using our joint classificatory we were able to properly identify a molecular subtype for 493 samples from our primary dataset. This strategy was developed to minimize the risk of improperly assigning a molecular subtype to the samples thus enhancing the homogeneity in each of our groups. Such approach was not designed for the clinical context, as the successive filters it applies discard several samples. Our method enhances the homogeneity inside each group, while preserving the heterogeneity of different cancer phenomena by maximizing the heterogeneity between the groups. We were able to use our classified samples to study the pathway enrichment profiles of different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. In Fig. 5
                         we can see a PCA visualization depicting the results of the computational classification procedure.

We found 71 pathways from the KEGG database that crosstalk by sharing at least one molecule with the ESP (see Supplementary Material 1 for the adjacency matrix). In all of these pathways we find crosstalk with at least one other pathway (Fig. 6
                        A). Fig. 6B shows the frequency distribution of molecules involved in such crosstalk events and Fig. 6C zooms into the top 25 molecules (see Supplementary Material 2). Fig. 7
                         displays a network from pathways that crosstalk with the ESP. Such network is not star-like – as one may think from the way it was built – but instead is almost a fully connected graph. Pathways are ranked by their betweenness centrality index (Newman, 2010); ESP being the most connected by construction (as all the pathways we selected crosstalk with it). We weighted the connections by the Jaccard index calculated for each pair of pathways. This way, we see that a number pathways share many molecules with each other, making their Jaccard index high, while others share only a few molecules. In this fashion, we found that many of the pathways with a high Jaccard index happen to share whole subsets of genes.

Interestingly enough, removal of the ESP does not break down the network into several components. In fact, we found that this is a highly connected network, and the removal of several pathways does not alter the high connectivity of the network. An exercise of removing successive pathways from the network showed that the clustering coefficient (a measure of a graph's connectivity) of the network was not affected by it (data not shown). This phenomenon is easily explained, as several molecules are shared by most of the pathways (as seen on Fig. 6C).

We explored the molecules involved in these crosstalking events, with the following results: 3217 molecules were found to be involved in crosstalk events between ESP and other KEGG pathways. From those, we found that 1817 molecules are shared only by ESP and other pathway, while 1400 molecules are shared by ESP and two or more pathways. The top 25 most frequent molecules are involved in 66% of all analysed crosstalk events.

Crosstalk events occur mostly through certain favoured subsets of genes, many of them pathways on their own. For instance, the signaling pathways with highest betweenness centrality are MAPK and Calcium signaling pathways (as seen on Fig. 6); These pathways were shown to be central pathways for signaling transduction. Other crosstalk-centric analysis (Donato et al., 2013) have identified functional submodules in pathways, which may further explain the nature of the subsets of genes we identified in our work. Indeed, a large corpus of literature points to the importance of these signaling mechanisms in malignancies (Dhillon et al., 2007; Kim and Choi, 2010; Azimi et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2013; Swami, 2010) and their potential for pharmacological modulation.

We can see that through these crosstalk events, the network becomes robust to the removal of a given pathway signal, as stimulation by other pathways may be able to overcome the lack of said certain signaling, albeit at a different intensity. This pathway compensation might explain some of the previously identified resistances to pharmacological (Knowlden et al., 2005) treatment based on signaling blocking (such as hormonal modulation through tamoxifen or similar agents).

Now that we have considered the main crosstalk events related to the ESP, let us direct our attention to the role that particularly active pathways may have in shaping cancer phenotypes.

All pathways that crosstalk with the ESP are enriched in at least one of the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. More so, most of these pathways are enriched in all subtypes. This is not at all surprising, as they are all subtypes of cancer, and as such, many processes may be shared between them.

Special attention was given to those pathways whose enrichment behavior was considerably different across subtypes (see Fig. 8
                         and Supplementary Material 3, which contains enrichment data for all KEGG Pathways regardless of their ESP-crosstalk status).We found that the luminal B subtype showed the most differences, being the one that had more uniquely enriched pathways: FC-Epsilon-RI signaling, chemokine signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, and NOD like receptor signaling pathways were downregulated in the luminal B subtype, while showing no change in the other subtypes.

On the other hand, pathways such as axon guidance, dorso-ventral axis formation, glioma, gap junction and T-cell receptor signaling, while enriched in other subtypes, showed no enrichment in the luminal B subtype. Also, the Natural Killer cell mediated citotoxicity pathway, while upregulated in the basal and Her2+ subtypes, showed no enrichment in the luminal A subtype, and what is more interesting, showed a downregulation in the luminal B subtype.

The WNT signaling pathway was enriched only in luminal A and basal subtypes. Luminal B and basal subtypes shared two pathways: upregulated progesterone mediated oocyte maturation and downregulated phosphatidylinositol signaling.

These results show that there are differences in patterns of pathway enrichment that are associated not only to each of the subtypes, but perhaps to the underlying biological processes that differentiate between subtypes.

We found 6584 genes deregulated in the Luminal A subtype, 6973 in the Luminal B subtype, 6772 in the Basal subtype and 6568 in the Her2+ subtype. 3729 of these genes were upregulated in the Luminal A subtype, 3906 in the luminal B subtype, 3822 in the Basal subtype and 3685 in the Her2+ subtype. 2855 genes were downregulated in the Luminal A subtype, 3067 in the luminal B subtype, 2950 in the Basal subtype and 2883 in the Her2+ subtype.

Distribution of Logfold changes, FDR-corrected p-values and B-statistic is shown in supplementary tables (Supplementary Material 6). Fig. 9
                         shows a Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes in different subtypes. We see that 63.7% of identified dysregulated genes are dysregulated in all breast cancer subtypes, while only 13.41 of these genes are dysregulated in only one molecular subtype (3.44% in Luminal A, 2.69% in Luminal B, 5.37% in Basal, and 1.91% in Her2+).

In what follows, we will present the results regarding the pathway enrichment of a subset of samples with differences in phenotypes associated with resistance to tamoxifen exposed to this drug.

Pathway analysis (Fig. 10
                           ) showed no difference in pathway enrichment between the baseline expression of tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 cells and tamoxifen-treated, estrogen-stimulated cells (as expected); therefore, tamoxifen is able to antagonize the effect of estrogen at the pathway level. However, in those cells that developed resistance, we found that tamoxifen-treated, estrogen-stimulated cells had no difference to estrogen-stimulated cells; in this case, tamoxifen was not able to revert the effects of estrogen stimulation.

The MCF-7 cell line is a model for estrogen-sensitive, luminal-like breast cancer. These experiments allowed us to assess the enrichment profiles in a model where tamoxifen resistance was achieved. It is important to note that these cell line does not represent the whole molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer; furthermore, in vitro experiments do not fully replicate the gamut of signals that affect the tumor in an in vivo setting. With these limitations in mind, the observed enrichment of crosstalking pathways we propose that crosstalk effects may lead to enrichment of the ESP in situations without direct estrogen stimulation, playing a partial role in tamoxifen resistance (Supplementary Material 4, which contains enrichment data for all KEGG Pathways regardless of their ESP-crosstalk status).

For this in vivo experiment, we performed pathway enrichment analysis on the tamoxifen-treated, estrogen-receptor characterized set of breast cancer samples. Estrogen receptor-positive tumors are in general initially sensitive to tamoxifen, while estrogen receptor-negative tumors are generally insensitive to tamoxifen. Our results showed the same general behavior as that found in the comparison between luminal and basal subtyped tumors. These results generally validate a difference in pathway expression between tumors that differ in estrogen receptor status. Table 1
                            presents the results of such analysis. p-values refer to GAGE statistical significance levels of the pathway enrichment in the estrogen receptor positive vs estrogen receptor negative contrast. Significance was considered at a False Discovery Rate (FDR)-corrected p-value <0.1 (Luo et al., 2009) (see also Supplementary Material 5, which contains enrichment data for all KEGG Pathways regardless of their ESP-crosstalk status).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Steroid hormones such as estrogen are known for their active roles in cancer-related biochemical pathways, a fact that makes them important pharmacological targets. We have shown that the pathways that interact with estrogen signaling are not isolated, but in fact, form a robust, heavily connected network of processes that are able to lead to both physiological and pathological effects. We find that the ESP is enriched in all molecular subtypes, even in those that do not show upregulated estrogen receptors. We propose that this is due to the fact that other molecules in the pathway are upregulated, as they are involved in other crosstalking pathways. Furthermore, we identified several of these crosstalking pathways that are enriched in the diseased phenotypes. It is important to notice that the deregulated ESP and its deregulated crosstalking pathways are not the only deregulated pathways in the diseased phenotype. As we have mentioned before, cancer involves the deregulation of many different processes, featuring multiple sources of pathway deregulation. In this context, let us recall our initial assumptions regarding ESP deregulation: ESP deregulation may (or may not) affect deregulation of pathways that crosstalk with ESP, and ESP deregulation is affected only by those pathways that crosstalk with the ESP. We will briefly discuss some of these, and the evidence supporting their involvement in anti-estrogen resistance.

Our findings show that the ESP is enriched in all of subtypes, not just the ones that are typically associated with estrogen-receptor positivity. Through our study of pathways that crosstalk with the ESP, we were able to show that ESP enrichment might be explained due to the action these other pathways, acting upon signaling mechanisms shared between several processes. Our analysis shows that these pathways contain molecules dysregulated that lead to the disease phenotype. We found that many crosstalk events in these pathways are through central effector pathways that are the ones able to control processes that lead to the expression of the so called hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Some of these effector pathways have been identified as functional modules by (Donato et al., 2013).

We find that across all molecular subtypes, membrane receptor proteins are downregulated. A representation of the pathway with deregulated molecules for the Luminal A subtype is seen in Fig. 11
                         (representations for the other subtypes are included in Supplementary Material 7). Luminal subtypes show an enrichment on the estrogen receptor, while the basal and Her2+ enriched subtypes do not share this behavior. We see also a conserved across subtypes increase in expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). MMPs are increasingly recognized as having an important role in the promotion of migration and invasiveness in neoplastic diseases (Espinal-Enríquez et al., 2015).

We observe certain differences – at the gene level – between subtypes: protein kinases A and C were overexpressed in the Her2+ group, they were not in the basal group. Meanwhile, the luminal A group showed overexpression in FOS, JUN, and heatshock protein 70, and was the only subgroup that showed no modification in SOS, GNAQ. The luminal B group was the only one showing overexpression of Ras. It is worth mentioning, that we also found similarities between the basal and the Her2+ subgroups, such as overexpression of PKA and IP3R, subexpression of heatshock proteins, SOS and GNAQ. Together these findings may indicate that these are the molecules responsible for molecular subtype pathway modulation.

Even in the absence of a direct stimulation of the pathway by overexpression of the estrogen receptor, the overall activation of the pathway is achieved. This is done by the activation of other signaling pathways (e.g. MAPK, PI3K/Akt), which may partially lead to the same physiological phenotype as direct overstimulation with estrogen, and as such, overcome the blocking of said signal (i.e. by pharmacological action with tamoxifen). The graphical representations of the pathways show that there are punctual differences in the downstream pathway, where the expression of certain genes is modified. These differences in expression might lie at the heart of the issue regarding differences between molecular subtypes, and therefore be of utter importance to explain phenotypical differences between subgroups regarding the effect of estrogen (and its blocking) on their physiology.

It is important to notice that estrogen signaling refers to the effect of the estrogen receptor acting upon other molecules to bring about effects at the cellular level, but the effects of the estrogen receptor are also, and most importantly, generated through it action as a transcription factor, which are largely independent of the crosstalk with downstream effectors. The effects of estrogen as a transcription factor are mostly due to the levels of both the receptor and its ligands, both endogenous and exogenous. Notwithstanding this, ligand-independent activation of the estrogen receptor is possible through the action of crosstalking pathways (VanHook, 2010; Carascossa et al., 2010) and as such, a probable source of pharmacological variability and resistance.

We observed enrichment in the apoptosis pathway in all of the molecular subtypes. This was expected, as alterations in apoptosis are a hallmark of cancer. The distribution of over and subexpressed molecules was different, however, between all of the molecular subtypes. differences and commonalities were found between the different subtypes. A representation of the pathway with deregulated molecules for the Luminal A subtype is seen in Fig. 12
                         (representations for the other subtypes are included in Supplementary Material 7).

The Her2+ subtype showed an enrichment of the adaptor molecules of the extrinsic pathway (76% of the annotated adaptor molecules), with antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 subexpressed, and prosurvival gene Bcl-XL overexpressed (see Supplementary Material 7). FLIP protein, who interferes with caspase-8 activation, is subexpressed, while death ligand TRAIL is overexpressed. Only caspase-3 is overexpressed in this molecular subtype. Subexpression of calcineurin in the Ca2+ branch of the pathway is also observed. Interestingly, only in this subtype is P53 not overexpressed.

The basal subtype again showed enrichment of adaptor molecules of the extrinsic pathway, albeit a lower number of these (54% of the annotated adaptor molecules). Again, we see the same pattern of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL enrichment. In this subtype, we observe an overexpression of FLIP, with no modification of TRAIL. Caspase-3 is overexpressed, but so are Inhibition of Apoptosis Proteins (see Supplementary Material 7).

Luminal A subtype shows no change in expression of adaptor molecules, while showing overexpression of TRAIL and subexpression of FLIP. We also observe a subexpression of the Fas receptor. We see overexpression of both IAPs and Bcl-XL, along with IKK, which might lead to further antiapoptotic processes. Interestingly, Bcl-2 is subexpressed in this subtype. Also interesting is the fact that Caspase-3 is not overexpressed, but Caspase-6 is (see Fig. 12).

Luminal B subtype shows an adaptor molecule profile similar to the basal subtype. We only see overexpression of Bcl-XL. Unlike the other subtypes, luminal B shows overexpression of Bad, a proapoptotic protein, and overexpression of both Caspase-3 and Caspase-6.

Pathway annotation shows that the crosstalk between apoptosis and the ESP involves other signaling pathways. The apoptotic pathway and the estrogen signaling pathway crosstalk through molecules that belong to the Calcium signaling pathway. Intracellular calcium concentration fluxes are used as sensors that trigger cell death. Our data show that said pathway is downregulated in all molecular subtypes.


                        PI3K/Akt signaling is also involved in the crosstalk between the apoptosis pathway and the ESP. Bad, IAP, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL molecules seem to be dysregulated by effect of said signaling. A Bcl-2 pathway has been proposed and explored (Clarke et al., 2012). This Bcl-2 pathway connects the autophagy and apoptosis processes, and is involved in signal transduction, such as the unfolded protein response signal. The importance of this Bcl-2 pathway regarding apoptosis and the action of antiestrogens is discussed, as pharmacological Bcl-2 inhibition leads to antiestrogen re-sensitization, leading to tamoxifen-induced autophagy-related necrosis, as opposed to the apoptosis mechanism found before resistance. A schematic representation of these processes is depicted in Fig. 13
                        .

We observed pathways involved with inflammatory processes enriched across the different molecular subtypes. We found upregulation in the Fc Gamma R mediated phagocytosis pathway and the leukocyte trans-endothelial migration pathway, along with downregulation of the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. We find that at the pathway level, pathways show a similar behavior. On the other hand, our findings show differences in the gene expression profiles of these pathways across the different subtypes, as seen on Supplementary Material 7.

The luminal B molecular subtype samples showed marked differences in the enrichment profile of two immunity related pathways: the chemokine signaling pathway, which was downregulated only in the luminal B samples, and the T-cell receptor signaling pathway, that was upregulated in all the subtypes except the luminal B subtypes. Similarly, the Natural Killer cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway showed differences in the enrichment profile, as it was upregulated in the non-luminal molecular profiles, while downregulated in the luminal B subtype and showing no difference in the luminal A subtype, a fact that may also be implied in pharmacological resistance differences between subtypes.

We also found some of these inflammatory-related pathways in both of the tamoxifen-treated datasets. We found Fc Gamma R mediated phagocytosis, chemokine signaling, cytokine–cytokine receptor, Cell signaling and Leukocyte trans-endothelial migration pathways to be enriched in the ER negative subgroup vs the ER positive group in the tamoxifen-treated samples. We again found these pathways – except the T-cell signaling pathway – enriched in our estrogen-treated, tamoxifen-sensitive cell lines against our estrogen-treated, tamoxifen-resistant cell lines also contributing to the mechanisms of resistance found in these cells.

Tamoxifen action as an immunomodulator has been previously shown (Behjati and Frank, 2009). Our findings point to differences in the immune response pathways both between tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant groups, and between molecular subtypes. From our results, a possible feedback loop between these immune pathways and the ESP might be proposed.

Data from recent work (Cook et al., 2014) seems to support this idea. In said work, endocrine therapy for breast cancer is said to induce autophagic flux. This autophagic flux is proposed to be involved in the development of therapeutic resistance.

Furthermore, estrogenic action upon immune cells, such as macrophages and monocytes, leads to modifications in immune processes. These data supports the importance of the crosstalk phenomena between ESP and immune system processes. More so, the evidence presented related to the importance of autophagy for the phenotype is further proof of the role of the pathway interactions towards the resistance phenomenon.

Based on current knowledge and supported by the results of our work, we suggest further study regarding the crosstalk of immune processes and estrogen signaling. Molecular biology experiments can be directed by this results in order to test the influence of immunity-related pathways in antiestrogen resistance and vice versa. This may lead to a better understanding in interactions between hormonal therapy and the immune effect, as well as its pharmacological effect.

Our methodology aimed to infer the contribution of certain physiological processes – described by pathways – to the different disease phenotypes. However, some observations are to be made for the proper interpretation of our results, particularly regarding pathway enrichment.

Enrichment algorithms are not immediately able to identify whether a molecule contributes to the advancement of a pathway, or is in fact negatively regulating it. We consider that proper annotation of the molecules in pathways, with emphasis in the role of each molecule, is mandatory to generate predictive models. It is important to consider that pathways – as we know them today – have been constructed from the knowledge of the physiological pathways biochemistry. But at the end of the day, pathways are models used by experts to explain biological processes. As such, figuring where one pathway starts and another one ends may not be as clear cut as we would like; therefore, a correlation between disease pathways enriched, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, is more likely explained by the sharing of common signaling mechanisms. Efforts to systematically remove bias in enrichment analysis have been made, such as the work of Donato et al. (Donato et al., 2013). In said work, the authors have developed tools that identify shared functional submodules in pathways, and consider the contribution of each molecule in the pathway to the overall enrichment.

Furthermore, systematic approaches to pathway databases may miss processes that have not been codified in a pathway. For instance, the Bcl-2 pathway that links endoplasmic reticulum stress with autophagy has been described (Clarke et al., 2012), and the information contained in it might help to explain dysregulations that lead to our observed phenotypes.

Enrichment algorithms are also dependant on the nature of the control group. Our experiments used a highly heterogeneous group, containing samples of different experimental processes, in an attempt to reduce this source of misleading discoveries.

Gene-signature associated to phenotypes have been developed (Chibon, 2013) and are the basis for several analysis strategies (gene-sets) (Wang et al., 2013; Subramanian et al., 2005); however, these signatures are mostly based on correlation (Drier et al., 2013), but not generally linked by strong biological causalities. Commercial efforts such as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA®, QIAGEN Redwood City www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) integrate these type of curations, but their closed intellectual property nature makes their results hard to replicate and use in systematic analyses. Proper curation of these pathways, and the appropriate corrections to the enrichment methodology are mandatory in order to introduce the necessary corrections to a general, open analysis framework.

By means a systematic analysis of the ESP and its crosstalking pathways, we identified several ways in which external signaling is able to lead into processes that are involved with malignancy.

Such approach is able to properly identify the complex interactions between physiological pathways, in order to integrate the different, simultaneous processes that are occurring at the cellular level of disease. The development of such type of integrative methodologies is currently a hotly sought research area, and several attempts at producing models that properly unveil the effect of pathway crosstalk in both the pathology and pharmacology of cancer are being made (Azad et al., 2015).

The level of description presented here is mostly pathway-wise qualitative, but it becomes apparent that there is a continuous, quantitative effect on the phenotype from every pathway involved. Developing a quantitative model that takes into account the contribution of every pathway will lead to a better understanding of the pathological phenomena.

So far we have gone from a gene-centric to a pathway-centric approach in the study of complex diseases. The next logical step is to integrate pathways, giving rise to a functional-pathway-centric paradigm (Hernández-Lemus, 2014). Efforts to integrate the current available knowledge of cancer molecular biology with bioinformatic tools will be fundamental to generate new hypothesis in the continued search for better alternatives to improve human health.
