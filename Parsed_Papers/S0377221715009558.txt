@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  Hospitals in Germany have been required to have an internal quality management system (QMS) since 2000. Although formal certification of such systems is voluntary, the number of certifications has increased steadily. The most common standards in Germany are ISO 9001, which is also widely used internationally, and KTQ (Kooperation für Transparenz und Qualität im Gesundheitswesen), which was developed specifically for the German health care sector. While a large body of literature has investigated the impact of QMS certification on performance in many industries, there is only scarce evidence on the causal link between QMS certification and technical efficiency. In the present study, we seek to elucidate this relationship using administrative data from all German hospitals from 2000 through 2010 combined with information on certification. Our analysis has three steps: First, we calculated efficiency scores for each hospital using a bootstrapped data envelopment analysis. Second, we used genetic matching to ensure that any differences observed could be attributed to certification and were not due to differences in sample characteristics between the intervention and control groups. Third, we employed a difference-in-difference specification within a truncated regression to examine whether certification had an impact on hospital efficiency. To shed light on a potential time lag between certification and efficiency gains, we used various periods for comparison. Our results indicate that hospital efficiency was negatively related to ISO 9001 certification and positively related to KTQ certification. Moreover, coefficients were always larger in the period between first certification and recertification.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A quality management system (QMS) consists of a set of fixed business procedures and rules, which shall ensure that a product, process or service meets a set of standards (Tzelepis, Tsekouras, Skuras, & Dimara, 2006). Since quality is difficult to measure and to observe, in particular from outside the organization, quality standards ought to be certified. For that purpose, national and international, comprehensive and industry-specific QMS standards have been established. The most prominent QMS certification is the ISO 9000 series, which has been established in 1987. At the end of 2006, over 870,000 certifications had been granted in 140 countries worldwide (Heras-Saizarbitoria, Casadesús, & Marimón, 2011), demonstrating its persistence.

While research generally agrees on the reasons for which a firm strives for certification (Prajogo, 2011), understanding the effects of these standards on performance has always been a topic of great controversy (Benner & Veloso, 2008; Dick, Heras, & Casadesús, 2008; Terziovski, Power, & Sohal, 2003; Terziovski, Samson, & Dow, 1997). Several researchers have invested in the consolidation of prior findings (Chatzoglou, Chatzoudes, & Kipraios, 2015; Corbett, Montes-Sancho, & Kirsch, 2005; Dick et al., 2008; Sampaio, Saraiva, & Guimarães Rodrigues, 2009; Sampaio, Saraiva, & Monteiro, 2012), yet without conclusive insights. Several of these reviews categorize prior studies by the nature of its data. Most studies on the certification-performance link are based on cross-sectional data. From a methodological point of view, a longitudinal study design is necessary to draw causal conclusions. Therefore, researchers advocate a before-and-after comparison of intervention and matched control groups (Corbett et al., 2005; Levine & Toffel, 2010; Lo, Pagell, Fan, Wiengarten, & Yeung, 2014; Sharma, 2005; Yeung, Lo, & Cheng, 2011). This methodological approach helps to disentangle the changes in performance as a result of certification from changes in performance over time, but has been scarcely applied to analyze the effects of certification.

The inconsistency of prior findings might also be partially explained by the quite distant relationship between certification and financial performance, the latter being most frequently used as dependent variable. Providing empirical evidence that the choice of performance measure significantly affects the results, Naveh and Marcus (2005) showed that implementing the ISO 9000 standard led to improved operating performance, but did not directly lead to improved business performance. Lima, Resende, and Hasenclever (2000) questioned the use of accounting indicators and called for studies analyzing the productive efficiency of certified and non-certified firms. Levine and Toffel (2010) pointed out that they found no prior research that examined how the ISO 9001 quality standard affects product or process quality or employees. Hence, analyzing the link between QMS certification and efficiency remains a research gap.

Additionally, in comparison to manufacturing industries, research is scarce in the service industry, and very few studies have been undertaken in the hospital industry. The paucity of studies in the hospital industry stands in contrast to its high relevance for a nation's economy, and the increasing number of certifications issued within this sector. In particular, hospitals account for the greatest share of health expenditure in most EU Member States (European Commission eurostat, 2015), and strategies to increase efficiency and reduce costs in the hospital sector have become central to efforts at health system reform in many countries. At the same time, stakeholders continue to expect high-quality treatment and increased transparency. To this end, policymakers in a number of European countries have encouraged or even required the use of QMS in hospitals, leading to the adaptation of standards from other industries, such as the ISO 9000 series, or to the development of national QMS systems specifically for the health care sector (Shaw, Bruneau, Kutryba, Jongh, & Sunol, 2010). Hospitals in Germany have been required to have an internal QMS since 2000, but are free to choose which internal system they wish to implement. Formal certification of the QMS through costly third-party audits is not legally required. Although the certification of such systems is voluntary, the number of certifications has increased each year. The most common types of certification in the German hospital sector are ISO 9001 and KTQ (Kooperation für Transparenz und Qualität im Gesundheitswesen; “Cooperation for Transparency and Quality in the Health System”), which was developed for the German health care sector.

The purpose of the present study is to examine the relationship between QMS certification and technical efficiency, estimated via data envelopment analysis (DEA). It thereby differentiates between an international, comprehensive QMS standard (ISO 9001:2000) and a national, industry-specific standard (KTQ). It uses the hospital industry as a research setting and draws on panel data from the years 2000 through 2010, allowing certified organizations to be contrasted with non-certified organizations using a difference-in-difference approach. Data analysis comprises a sample of 374 certified and 374 matched non-certified hospitals in Germany applying the genetic matching method. The results are subsequently discussed alongside implications for practice and research.


                     Section 2 of this study provides an overview on ISO 9001 and KTQ certification and reviews the relevant literature on the impact of certification on performance. Section 3 presents the data and the estimation strategy we used to explore this relationship. Section 4 presents and discusses the results of our analysis, and Section 5 gives a summary and suggests topics for future research.

As a process-oriented, international standard originally developed for the manufacturing industry, ISO 9001 belongs to the ISO 9000 series of standards and is used to assess QMS in whole hospitals or, more frequently, in parts of them, such as hospital departments (Shaw, Kutryba, Braithwaite, Bedlicki, & Warunek, 2010). In Germany, the number of whole hospitals certified according to ISO 9001 increased from 26 in 2000 to 211 in 2010. ISO 9001 provides QMS standards based on eight principles: customer focus, leadership, involvement of people, process approach, system approach to management, continual improvement, factual approach to decision making, and mutually beneficial supplier relationships. To obtain ISO 9001 certification, a QMS must not only be established, implemented, maintained, and continually improved. It must also be documented, including documented statements of a quality policy and quality objectives; a quality manual; documented procedures required by the ISO 9001 standard; documents needed by the hospital to ensure the effective planning, operation, and control of its processes; and records required by the ISO 9001 standard (International Organization for Standardization, 2008). Internal audits are also required at regular intervals to check for evidence of conformity and the effectiveness of the QMS. Implementation of the standard is reviewed by official external auditors, and a certificate can be awarded if there is no major nonconformity. The certification is valid for a maximum of three years, after which time recertification is necessary. As the standard is continually being revised by standing technical committees and advisory groups, there exist several versions: ISO 9000:1987, ISO 9000:1994, ISO 9001:2000, ISO 9001:2008, and ISO 9001:2015 forthcoming. Between the ISO 9000:1994 version and the ISO 9001:2000, significant changes with respect to its focus on process optimization have occurred. Additionally, the 2000 version required a higher involvement of upper executives, the measurement of the effectiveness of tasks and activities, expectations of continual process improvement and a tracking of customer satisfaction (Tamayo-Torres, Gutierrez-Gutierrez, & Ruiz-Moreno, 2014; Tzelepis et al., 2006). Finally, it also aims at better meeting service sector organizations' needs (Terziovski et al., 2003).

Available only at the whole hospital level, KTQ certification is based on a range of standards and assessment procedures that are carried out by franchised organizations (Shaw et al., 2010). The number of KTQ-certified hospitals has increased from nine in 2002, when it was introduced, to 462 in 2010, making this the most common form of standards-based assessment in Germany. KTQ certification is based on a catalogue containing the categories patient-centeredness, employee-centeredness, safety in the organization, information and communication, leadership, and quality management (Kooperation für Transparenz und Qualität im Gesundheitswesen, 2015). To obtain KTQ certification, a hospital must produce a comprehensive report assessing the quality of its patient-care processes according to the criteria in the catalogue. Although required, a QMS is therefore only part of the KTQ standard. Subsequently, a team of external auditors evaluates this self-assessment and can award certification if at least 55 percent of the points in each category are achieved (Kooperation für Transparenz und Qualität im Gesundheitswesen, 2015). The auditors evaluate the QMS, as well, but by spot checks. Like ISO 9001 certification, KTQ certification is valid for three years, after which time recertification is necessary.

Both ISO 9001 and KTQ aim at implementing QMS standards and comprise several dimensions. They differ with respect to the emphasis, which is predominantly targeted at process standardization for ISO 9001, while KTQ has a somewhat broader approach and also includes structure- und outcome-related aspects. Furthermore, ISO 9001's requirements must be met without exception, are partially difficult to be translated to the hospital context, and a high documentary workload is associated with certification. KTQ seems a little bit more lean, directly adapted to the hospital context, and leaves some discretionary space by not demanding to fulfill all points.

While the majority of certification research has relied on cross-sectional data, calls for a longitudinal study design have been increasing (Dick et al., 2008; Sampaio et al., 2012). Among the studies with a longitudinal design, most studies analyze the impact of QMS certification on financial performance, based on indicators such as return on assets (ROA), return on sales (ROS), sales growth, earnings per share, and stock prices. Some of the most rigorous studies are present below.

Using an event study method with 27 certified Spanish stock firms and the complete market as control group for the 1993–1999 period, Nicolau and Sellers (2002) only find a positive stock price effect on the day of certification itself. Applying an event study method as well, Corbett et al. (2005) compare changes in ROA, ROS, and the cost of goods sold between 554 certified and 554 matched non-certified manufacturing firms for the 1987–1997 period. They find that ISO adoption is followed by significant modest abnormal improvements in financial performance, though the effect depends on the specification of the control group. Benner and Veloso (2008) use a sample of 75 automotive supplier companies in the U.S. with data for the years 1988 to 1997 and apply a longitudinal panel data design with firm fixed effects and year controls. They observe that performance benefits of ISO adoption are moderated by timing and firm-specific technological coherence. Dick et al. (2008) compare sales revenues and ROA of 400 ISO 9001 certified companies and 400 non-certified companies matched by industrial sector in the 1994–1998 period applying an attribution testing method. They detect that there is some evidence to indicate that QMS certification has some causal influence on business performance, while there is also evidence for the existence of reverse causality, i.e., a self-selection of better performing firms to certification. Yeung et al. (2011) use a sample of 185 certified and 185 matched non-certified U.S. manufacturing firms within the 1994–2006 period and analyze differences in the changes in CEO compensation and ROA with the event study method approach. They found a significantly positive net effect of certification on CEO compensation, and a significantly negative net effect of certification on ROA.

The longitudinal studies which have analyzed productivity changes after certification are heterogeneous with regard to the productivity measures used, the data analysis methods, and the findings. Naveh and Marcus (2005) analyzed, among others, the impact if certification on perceived operating performance improvement (incl. defect rates, cost of quality, productivity, on-time delivery, and customer satisfaction) using a sample of 313 US firms and 309 matched control firms between 1990 and 2000. Using hierarchical linear models (HLM) and validating results via the event study method, they partially observe significantly positive effects of certification on operating performance. Martínez-Costa, Martínez-Lorente, and Choi (2008) measured productivity as income per employee and conducted t-tests for differences of ISO 9000 and non-ISO 9000 companies in a new variable created as the difference between the 2-year average productivity after and before ISO 9000 implementation. They found that certification had no significant impact on productivity. Levine and Toffel (2010) analyzed the effect of ISO 9000 certification on inputs (i.e., employment) and outputs (i.e., sales) separately. In the sales model, they estimated regressions with and without employment as an independent variable. For data analysis, they used a difference-in-difference approach in which they compared changes in the dependent variables for certified hospitals in comparison to changes in the dependent variables for a matched group of non-certified hospitals. Matching was performed based on propensity scores, which allows taking into account a variety of observable factors. They found that the significantly positive effect of certification on sales became insignificant when employment was introduced as explanatory variable, indicating that certification is not related to an increase in labor productivity. Lo et al. (2014) analyzed the effect of OHSAS 18000 certification, which is an international occupational health and safety management system specification, on the ratio of operating income to number of employees as indicator of labor productivity. Following the event study method, they applied paired-sample t-tests (Wilcoxon sign-rank and significance tests). They found a positive effect of OHSAS 18000 certification on labor productivity. Using a more holistic productivity measurement, Tzelepis et al. (2006) analyzed the relationship between technical efficiency and ISO 9000 certification using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and found that adopting ISO 9001 reduced managerial inefficiency. However, they collapsed the panel structure of their data set to a cross-sectional structure, limiting possible causal conclusions about the relationship. Hence, results on the impact of certification on productivity are inconclusive, and research analyzing the causal link between certification and efficiency with a longitudinal design is scarce.

Further, to our knowledge, there exists only one quantitative study that tackles the research gap related to the hospital industry. Makai, Klazinga, Wagner, Boncz, and Gulacsi (2009) assess the impact of QMS certification (ISO 9000 and Hungarian Hospital Care Standards, HHCS, certification) on patient safety with data collected from 102 Hungarian hospitals in 2005. In a cross-sectional analysis using linear regressions, they find no significant relationship between ISO or HHCS certification and the number of patient safety activities.

Although these studies have generated valuable initial insights into the effects of certification, the generalizability of their findings remains limited. The majority of studies relies on data of the 90s and assesses the benefits of ISO 9000:1994 certification. Empirical evidence suggests that the ISO 9000:1994 and the ISO 9001:2000 version differ in their impact on internal processes (e.g., Total quality management (TQM) implementation, Martínez-Costa, Choi, Martínez, & Martínez-Lorente, 2009) and on external reactions (e.g., stock prices, McGuire & Dilts, 2008). While some studies compared changes in performance of certified firms to changes of performance of none-certified firms, only few studies ensured that baseline characteristics were balanced across the corporatized and non-corporatized firms. Those studies which applied matching strategies only matched on individual characteristics, such as industry, firm size, and pre-certification ROA. The only exception to that is Levine and Toffel (2010), who used propensity score matching. Only one study (Tzelepis et al., 2006) estimated efficiency as a combination of multiple inputs and outputs using SFA, and there is no longitudinal study using DEA for efficiency estimation. In general, DEA is the most frequently used approach to measuring efficiency in health care (Hollingsworth, 2008). Within the hospital industry, there is no study assessing the impact of ISO certification on performance with a longitudinal study design and quantitative data. Further research in this field is therefore needed to confirm these preliminary findings.

Our study has a number of strengths compared to previous investigations of certification. First, it is, to our knowledge, the only study so far to examine the effects of certification on hospitals' technical efficiency, and to assess the impact of two different types of QMS certification (ISO and KTQ) with a longitudinal study design. Second, we used the novel genetic matching method, which is superior to existing methods, to generate a control group for the certified hospitals. Third, we apply the difference-in-difference method, which allows estimating the net effect of certification while controlling for a variety of time-variant and time-invariant factors. This method has only been applied by Levine and Toffel (2010) yet, but not in combination with genetic matching. Our sample is extracted of all German hospitals, comprising 273 hospitals with KTQ certification, 101 hospitals with ISO certification, and 456 non-certified hospitals for the 2000–2010 period.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

The data used in this study were drawn from two sources. The first of these consisted of the hospital reports submitted annually to the Research Data Centre of the Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Federal Statistical Office of Germany, [Destatis], 2013). This extensive dataset covers all hospitals (n = 2390) in Germany from the years 2000 through 2010 and contains hospital-level information on cost and hospital infrastructure, as well as patient-level information on age, gender, main diagnosis and length of stay. The second source was the structured quality reports that hospitals in Germany have had to publish online every two years since 2006. We manually extracted the following details on QMS certification from the structured quality reports from 2010: whether a hospital was certified; type of certification; certification coverage (partly versus fully certified hospitals); year in which certification was first obtained; and duration of certification. In cases where information was not available from the structured quality report, we obtained it directly from hospital web sites. The most commonly used types of certification for whole hospitals (i.e., as opposed to hospital departments) were ISO 9001 (abbreviated henceforth as “ISO”) and the KTQ standard. QMS information was available only for existing hospitals and could not be collected for hospitals that had closed. The two datasets were merged by the Research Data Centre of the Federal Statistical Office of Germany and were provided for statistical analysis through remote access. To ensure the comparability of the hospitals included in the analysis, the following hospitals were excluded: hospitals with ISO certification only at the level of individual departments; hospitals with other QMS certifications; ISO or KTQ certified hospitals without at least two pre-certification and one post-certification period; hospitals providing mainly psychiatric care; university and military hospitals; day and night clinics; and hospitals with fewer than 50 beds or more than 2000 beds. Furthermore, we conducted systematic plausibility checks to identify hospitals with input data error. The unbalanced sample ultimately used in the analysis contained 830 acute care hospitals, including 273 hospitals that had obtained their first KTQ certification, 101 hospitals that had obtained their first ISO certification, and 456 hospitals that had no certification between 2002 and 2009.

The methodological approach in this study has been similarly applied in other settings earlier (Lindlbauer, Winter, & Schreyögg, 2015; Tiemann & Schreyögg, 2012). It consists of three steps: (1) calculating efficiency scores for all hospitals in the sample, (2) finding an appropriate control group consisting of non-certified hospitals, and (3) comparing changes in efficiency between certified and non-certified hospitals using a difference-in-difference approach. Table 1
                         provides a comprehensive outline of the statistical analysis and each of these steps is explicitly described in order below.

DEA is a nonparametric frontier method that uses linear programming to evaluate the relative technical efficiency of a decision-making unit, such as an individual hospital, based on observational data. When selecting inputs and outputs, we followed the example of other studies that have developed DEA frameworks for measuring hospital efficiency (Dyson et al., 2001; Tiemann & Schreyögg, 2012). For our purposes, we chose seven inputs and one output, which are described in the following.

The relevant inputs comprise material and labor. The first input variable, (Supplies), represents the amount spent on supplies each year, including operational expenses but excluding payroll, capital, and depreciation expenses. It is used as a proxy for material resources. To account for labor input, we used five variables separated according to labor type and counted as full-time equivalents: number of physicians (Physician), nurses (Nurse), other clinical staff (Clinical), administrative staff (Admin), and other nonclinical staff members (Nonclinical). The last input is the number of beds (Beds), which can be seen, at least over the medium term, as an exogenous factor that is not under the direct control of hospital management but rather to planning authorities in Germany (Steinmann, Dittrich, Karmann, & Zweifel, 2004). We therefore included it as a non-discretionary input to the model.

As the output of hospital services, we used the number of treated inpatient cases weighted by mean predicted resource intensity (Weighted cases). Weighting ensures the comparability of hospitals with different patient heterogeneity (i.e., case-mix), as proposed by Lindlbauer and Schreyögg (2014). Using output variables without weights can be problematic in efficiency analysis because hospitals with a more complex case-mix are likely to obtain lower efficiency scores (Tiemann & Schreyögg, 2012). The prediction of resource intensity was based on length of stay modeled as a function of the main diagnoses, a dummy for surgery, patient age, gender, and year dummies of treatment, and followed the approach described in Lindlbauer and Schreyögg (2014). Weights greater than one indicate an above-average predicted resource intensity, and vice versa. The sum of the input cases multiplied with their respective weights generated the output of each hospital.


                        Table 2
                         reports descriptive statistics for the inputs and output used for DEA stratified according to hospitals without certification and hospitals with KTQ or ISO certification for the years 2000, 2005 and 2010 of the unbalanced panel.

DEA identifies observations with the highest input-to-output ratios, which then determine the efficiency frontier, whereas other observations – lying below the frontier – are relatively less efficient. In the early DEA paper by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978), efficiency was measured assuming constant returns to scale (CRS), whereas Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (1984) (BCC) extended this to accommodate a more flexible model with variable returns to scale (VRS). VRS, and hence the BCC model, are recommended when it is impossible to assume that all observed units are operating at an optimal scale. Because organizations in the health care sector often operate at an inefficient scale due to factors such as imperfect competition and constraints on finance, we adopt the VRS assumption and opt for the BCC model. The BCC approach requires choosing whether to assume an input or an output orientation. Traditionally, studies evaluating hospital efficiency suppose a minimization of inputs for a given level of outputs (input orientation) rather than a maximization of outputs for a given level of inputs (output orientation). The input orientation is justified based on the assumption that hospitals take public demand for healthcare as given, and have to manage their inputs so as to meet these demands (Rego, Nunes, & Costa, 2010), and was applied in this study. Furthermore, Banker and Morey (1986) modified the BCC model to account for non-discretionary inputs, which are factors that affect production but may be outside of the assessed hospital's influence, such as – in our case – hospital beds. Accordingly, we estimated the following objective function (Banker & Morey, 1986; Syrjänen, 2004):

After estimating our DEA model, we applied the bootstrapping procedure developed by Simar and Wilson (2007) to obtain the bias-corrected efficiency scores. The bias-corrected scores were derived from 1000 bootstrap iterations, allowing us to improve the statistical efficiency in the second-stage truncated regression. For the sake of brevity, the term “bias-corrected efficiency” is abbreviated as “efficiency” below. Due to legal restrictions or other changes between years affecting hospital efficiency, we estimated the DEA model per year. The analysis was performed in R 2.14.2 (R Development Core Team, 2015) using the FEAR package (Wilson, 2008).

The absence of selection bias, i.e., meeting the assumption that the intervention is quasi randomly or exogenously assigned, is a fundamental concern in health care studies with observational data (Jones, 2007). The random sampling assumption implies that certified hospitals (i.e., the intervention group) and non-certified hospitals (control group) do not differ with respect to baseline characteristics, such as size or pre-certification performance. A baseline imbalance may result in the over- or underestimation of the difference-in-difference effect attributed to entry into a health system. For instance, if the probability of being certified was higher for larger hospitals and if larger hospitals have greater performance gains from certification than smaller hospitals, the results of the difference-in-difference approach will overestimate the effect of certification if no baseline balance is created. To address the problem of baseline imbalance between the intervention and control groups, different matching methods are available. Besides matching on single variables, the best-known methods are propensity score matching (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) and multivariate matching based on Mahalanobis distance (Rubin, 1980). A relatively novel generalization of both methods, genetic matching, was proposed by Diamond and Sekhon (2013) and Sekhon and Grieve (2012). In this approach, the propensity score (Pscore) is included in the model as one of the covariates, and the Mahalanobis distance metric d between the X covariates for two units i and j is generalized by including an additional weight parameter, as follows:

                         is the transpose of the matrix X. Genetic matching is a multivariate matching method that uses an evolutionary search algorithm to iteratively check and maximize covariate balance across matched intervention and control units by minimizing the largest observed covariate discrepancy at every step. A major advantage of this method is that not only the variables' means in the intervention and the control group are aligned, but that both groups have the same joint distribution of observed covariates after matching.

The method is nonparametric and does not depend on knowing or estimating the propensity score, but the method is improved when a propensity score is incorporated (Sekhon, 2011). Thus, we first perform a bootstrapped logistic regression by using defined covariates to derive propensity scores, i.e., the probability that each hospital will be certified during the observation period. To do so, the intervention period – in our case, the period during which a QMS based on ISO or KTQ is implemented – must be specified. According to Corbett et al. (2005), implementing a QMS can take anywhere from six to 18 months. We thus defined our intervention period as the year in which the certification was obtained (t) and the year immediately preceding certification (
                           
                              t
                              −
                              1
                           
                        ). The period two years before certification (
                           
                              t
                              −
                              2
                           
                        ) was then used to determine the control group by applying genetic matching. We differentiate between KTQ and ISO certification and perform two separate regressions.

The covariates used to predict the propensity scores represent hospital and environmental characteristics, which may affect the likelihood of certification during the period observed. The first covariate is hospital efficiency (Efficiency), which was obtained from the DEA model. As the number of beds (Beds) in German hospitals has the nature of being exogenous, it is also included in the model. We additionally included the proportion of all hospital beds that had been leased (Leased beds) as another covariate, because hospitals in Germany are allowed to lease hospital beds to self-employed private-practice physicians, and the cases referred to these physicians are counted as hospital output (i.e., inpatient cases), whereas the corresponding resource use in terms of physicians is not considered on the input side (Tiemann & Schreyögg, 2012). Further, we controlled for ownership (dummy variables Private for-profit, Private nonprofit and reference category Public); competition, using the Herfindahl–Hirschman index at the county level as a measure for market concentration (Market concentration); and technological, medical or governmental changes (dummy variables for the year of observation). Subsequently, we calculated the predicted probabilities and linear predictors of intervention assignment for each observation.

In a next step, we aimed to achieve balance among potential confounding variables. We therefore used the same covariates as in the propensity score model and, moreover, the linear predictor from the logistic regression (as the propensity score is bounded between zero and one, Sekhon (2011) recommends using the linear predictor rather than the predicted probability to avoid compression of propensity scores near zero and one), as potential confounding variables for genetic matching. We applied one-to-one matching with replacement – i.e., each hospital in the control group could be drawn more than once, and the total distance between matched pairs was also minimized. The appropriateness of the matching was first assessed with a paired t-test comparing differences in means between control and intervention group. For discrete variables, however, tests of the difference in means are of limited informatory value. Matching can decrease the mean discrepancies but may also worsen the balance of other moments of a distribution, such as maximum, skew or kurtosis. Therefore, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test, which assesses the difference between the empirical distribution functions, is more appropriate for assessing matching quality of continuous variables (Sekhon & Grieve, 2012). The KS test provides the D-statistic for two samples (i.e., control and intervention group), which is defined as the supremum of the absolute value of the difference between the empirical distribution functions F

                        for n (control group) and accordingly n′ (intervention group) independently and identically distributed observations of covariate X. Bootstrapping with 1,000 iterations was applied to examine the significance of deviations between the distribution functions.

Logistic regression, genetic matching and the assessment of balance in the matched samples were performed in R 3.0.1 (R Development Core Team, 2013) using the Matching package (Sekhon, 2011).

In the third step of our analysis, the effect of certification on hospital efficiency was estimated. Certification can be interpreted as an event that alters the course of an organization and potentially its performance, too. The difference-in-difference approach was used to identify changes in efficiency of certified hospitals relative to changes in efficiency of non-certified hospitals, while controlling for time-variant variables. A basic assumption of this approach is that all other temporal factors affecting hospital efficiency had the same impact on hospitals in the intervention group as they did on hospitals in the control group. We thus assume that all hospitals were affected in the same way by any changes over time that we did not control for. To address the problem of serial correlation in our difference-in-difference panel analysis, we applied individual regressions for each of the six comparison periods (Bertrand, Duflo, & Mullainathan, 2004). This allowed us to investigate the impact of certification not only for one fixed post-period, but as a progressing effect over time. Following Simar and Wilson (2007), we applied a truncated regression model to take into account that efficiency is truncated at 1, i.e., cannot take larger values than 1. The difference-in-difference model was as follows:

The coefficient of interest, β
                        3, is the interaction between Inti
                         and TimeT
                        . It identifies changes in efficiency in the intervention group relative to changes in efficiency in the control group. Regressions are estimated separately for KTQ and ISO certification.


                     Table 3 shows the baseline statistics in measured covariates before and after matching. Overall, the quality of the matching is very high, as all significant differences in the means of the indicator variables and the distributions of the continuous variables were eliminated. The contrast between hospitals with KTQ and ISO can be seen in the mean values of the variables. For instance, a typical KTQ certified hospital had 304 beds, whereas a typical ISO certified hospital had 251 beds. This emphasizes the need to investigate the effects of both types of certification independently of one another. Mean efficiencies prior to certification are comparable for KTQ and ISO certified hospitals (72.5 percent and 72.4 percent, respectively), but significantly differ from the mean efficiency of non-certified hospitals (73.6 percent). This underlines the relevance of the matching and difference-in-difference approach to allow any causal conclusions.

The logistic regressions conducted to obtain the propensity scores (described in Section 3.4) also reveal which variables significantly affect the likelihoods of being KTQ or ISO certified. The results of these regressions are shown in Table 4
                     , separately for KTQ and ISO. As can be seen, the estimates from the KTQ and ISO models alternate in sign and significance: whereas the likelihood to be KTQ certified significantly increased with hospital size and decreased with higher baseline efficiency, the likelihood to be ISO certified significantly depended on lower market concentration and being a public hospital.


                     Table 5
                      contains the estimators for each difference-in-difference regression for the interaction term IntiTimeT
                     , which represents the effect of certification on efficiency. Regarding KTQ certification, the estimators were always positive, which means that KTQ certification has a positive net effect on efficiency compared to the matching period 
                        
                           t
                           −
                           2
                        
                      and to the control group of comparable non-certified hospitals. The positive effect of certification was significant in the year of certification and in the two years between the first and second certification, and increased over this time period. Afterwards, the effect was still positive, although it was not significant anymore, while the coefficient was lower in the year of recertification and increased again one year later.

The estimators in the ISO models were always negative, which means that KTQ certification has a negative net effect on efficiency compared to the matching period 
                        
                           t
                           −
                           2
                        
                      and to the control group of comparable non-certified hospitals. The coefficients in the ISO models were significantly negative in the year before the first certification and in the year of certification. The coefficients for the following two years were still negative, though insignificant. In the year of recertification and in the subsequent year, the estimator showed largely significant negative effects. Thus, ISO certification consistently showed negative effects on efficiency.

To examine whether our assumption of beds as fixed input might be too strong, we performed a sensitivity analysis, removing beds as a fixed input, re-estimating the DEA, and performing the same procedure as before based on the new efficiency scores. Moreover, the decision to seek QMS certification may have resulted from privatization, which could also be interpreted as an intervention that might have had an impact on efficiency (Tiemann & Schreyögg, 2012). We therefore added a dummy variable for ownership change to the models and re-calculated the difference-in-difference regressions. In a further sensitivity analysis, we first eliminated hospitals with ownership change from the dataset and then proceeded as before. All of our sensitivity analyses confirmed the directions and significances of our original model.

The significant effects of certification in both the KTQ and ISO models indicate that different certifications result in differences in efficiency changes relative to non-certified hospitals. There are several potential explanations for the differences in the effects of the two types of certifications. To start with, these may be explained by the more comprehensive requirements and presumably higher workloads linked to the implementation of ISO. Although the self-assessment needed for KTQ certification requires a comprehensive and time-consuming report to be submitted shortly before the external assessment, ISO entails continuous documentation of process results and thus a continuous use of resources. Even though the effects of ISO certification were negative and not significant in the period between the two certifications, it is remarkable that the estimators here were – as in the KTQ models – higher than in the other periods. It is conceivable that the process of certification ties up resources, which are subsequently released between certification and recertification. It may also be possible that obtaining certification increases employee motivation, leading to greater technical efficiency.

Considering that the KTQ system allows nonconformities when awarding certification, it is also conceivable that ISO is more effective in facilitating the implementation of routines that increase process quality or the quality of care in general. There is increasing evidence in health care, especially hospital care, of a trade-off between the quality of care and costs (as a proxy for efficiency). Greater increases in the quality of care resulting from a certain type of QMS certification might therefore hinder increases in efficiency (Carey & Burgess Jr., 1999; Stargardt, Schreyögg, & Kondofersky, 2014). Another possible explanation may be differences in the marketing effect. Weston (1995) found that ISO 9000 certification led to competitive marketing advantages in only 35 percent of the questioned manufacturing firms. This finding may also apply to the hospital market, as patients likely associate the ISO standard with industry. Another explanation could be that hospitals may not have achieved the expected marketing benefits because they had not adequately marketed their certification (Stevenson & Barnes, 2002). On the contrary, KTQ certification, having been developed for the health care sector, may be easier to commercialize and therefore have a positive marketing effect on patients, for example by attracting cases that fit well into a hospital's existing, technically efficient processes.

Our study has several limitations worth mentioning. To start with, as we were unable to obtain information about certification from hospitals that had closed, our regression results may be subject to survivorship bias. For instance, if hospital closures tended to be the result of poor efficiency, and certified hospitals with poor efficiency were dropped from the sample as they closed, we may have overestimated the effects of certification. Second, the effects of certification could have been underestimated due to our having classified hospitals as certified only when this had been confirmed by third-party audit. Hospitals can base their QMS on a standard such as ISO or KTQ without certification and had been included in the control group, even though their QMS might have been as effective as that in certified hospitals. Finally, we were unable to control for changes in the quality of care resulting from certification, although the principle aim of introducing a QMS is to improve the quality of care. Hence our results only give hint to the advantageousness of certification with respect to efficiency and do not allow any conclusions about quality of care aspects.

Despite its limitations, the study also makes some valuable contributions. To start with, it adds to existing insights on the antecedents and effects of certification by drawing on a large and rich data set, including data from approximately 750 hospitals over a ten-year period and a broad range of inputs and outputs, as well as environmental and organizational characteristics. Moreover, the research setting, namely the hospital industry, is amenable to quantitative longitudinal analysis of the effects of two different types of QMS certification. The methodological approach is comprehensive and builds on recent developments in relevant methodology. Finally, the sensitivity analyses underscore the validity and robustness of the findings. Together, these represent an improvement over previous certification studies and an extension of the evidence base on hospital certification in particular.

As a result, the study provides some valuable insights for practice and future research. To start with, our results indicate that from an efficiency point of view, the KTQ certification seems more preferable than the ISO certification. Hospital managers hence can take into account the varying effects of KTQ and ISO certification on efficiency when deciding upon which QMS certification to aim for. Additionally, our results suggest that KTQ QMS might bind fewer resources for installation and maintenance. Thus, also hospital managers who do not intend to have their QMS externally certified could draw on these results if they intend to base their QMS on standards such as ISO or KTQ without undergoing certification. However, they should also bear in mind that there might exist a tradeoff between quality and efficiency, and that this study does not provide any evidence for which QMS standard is more appropriate in achieving high quality. As the negative effect of ISO certification on efficiency may be due to the high documentation requirements for ISO certification, the technical committees and advisory groups could attempt further reducing red tape and minimizing documentation loads. However, as long as no sound empirical evidence on the impact of certification standards on quality is provided, changes should be made carefully and conservatively, because lowering requirements might affect quality outcomes.

Regarding future research, studies should examine the impact of QMS certification on financial performance and, more importantly, the quality of care. In particular in settings where quality is difficult to observe and assess – which is frequently the case in service industries – a higher quality does not directly translate into improvements in financial performance. With respect to efficiency outcomes, it might even be oppositely related. Hence, it is of utmost importance to provide sound empirical evidence on the certification-quality link. Additionally, as our study shows that the effects of certification on efficiency differ with different types of QMS certification, further comparing comprehensive and industry-specific standards within one country or comparing national standards across countries would be illuminating.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In the present study, we investigated the effect of QMS certification on the technical efficiency of hospitals in Germany. The study analyzed the most common standards in Germany, ISO 9001 and KTQ. Our findings indicate that the national standard KTQ has significant positive effects on efficiency in the year of certification and in the following two years. The international ISO 9001 standard, however, which was originally developed for industry, has a significant negative impact on efficiency in the year before and in the year of certification, as well as in the year of recertification and the year after that. Although our results suggest preferring the national KTQ standard in order to increase technical efficiency, it is important to keep in mind that technical efficiency is only one aim associated with the introduction of QMS. Further research is needed to quantify the impact of QMS certification on financial performance and, more importantly, the quality of care.
