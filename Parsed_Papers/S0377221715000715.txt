                  This paper investigates the constraints handling technique (CHT) in algorithms of the constrained multi-criteria optimization problem (CMOP). The CHT is an important research topic in constrained multi-criteria optimization (MO). In this paper, two simple and practicable CHTs are proposed, where one is a nonequivalent relaxation approach which is much suitable for the constrained multi-criteria discrete optimization problem (MDOP), and the other is an equivalent relaxation approach for the general CMOP. By using these CHTs, a CMOP (i.e., the primal problem) can be transformed into an unconstrained multi-criteria optimization problem (MOP) (i.e., the relaxation problem). Based on the first CHT, it is theoretically proven that the efficient set of the primal CMOP is a subset of the strictly efficient set

                      of the relaxation problem and can be extracted from

                      by simply checking the dominance relation between the solutions in

                     . Follows from these theoretical results, a three-phase based idea is given to effectively utilize the existing algorithms for the unconstrained MDOP to solve the constrained MDOP. In the second CHT, the primal CMOP is equivalently transformed into an unconstrained MOP by a special relaxation approach. Based on such a CHT, it is proven that the primal problem and its relaxation problem have the same efficient set and, therefore, general CMOPs can be solved by utilizing any of the existing algorithms for the unconstrained MOPs. The implementing idea, say two-phase based idea, of the second CHT is illustrated by implanting a known MOEA. Finally, the two-phase based idea is applied to some of the early MOEAs and the application performances are comprehensively tested with some benchmarks of the CMOP.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A multi-criteria optimization (MO) problem (MOP) has a rather different perspective compared with one having a single objective. To rank solutions of MOPs, some comparing criteria such as the dominance relation and the strict dominance relation between solutions are defined. The set of solutions which are not dominated by any solution in the solution space is referred to the Pareto optimal set (POS) or efficient set (ES). Similarly, a set containing solutions which are not strictly dominated by any solution in the solution space is referred to the strict Pareto optimal set (SPOS) or strictly efficient set (SES). Generally, in a single objective optimization context, there is only one global optimum objective value, but in a MOP there is a set of solutions, i.e., the ES or SES, which are considered to be equally important; all of them constitute the global optimum solutions.

The MOPs are usually classified into two categories, say constrained MOP (CMOP) and unconstrained MOP (UCMOP), depending on whether the MOP has constraints or not. The constraints handling technique (CHT) in the solution algorithms of CMOPs is one of the major research topics and, consequently, lots of approaches with respect to the CHT are developed. According to the characteristics of different constraints handling approaches, Coello Coello, Veldhuizen, and Lamont (2002) grouped them into five types. Some of them will be reviewed in Section 2. This paper will focus on proposing some new CHTs.

We know that the original Lagrangean relaxation approach is a constraints handling technique for the single objective constrained optimization problems and has been extended into CMOPs. In this paper, we propose two relaxation based CHTs in sense of equivalent and nonequivalent, respectively, where equivalent implies that the primal CMOP and its relaxation problem have the same optimal solutions, i.e., the same efficient set. The essential of these two CHTs is to convert a CMOP (the primal problem) into an UCMOP (relaxation problem) by simply appending one or more special objectives associated with the constraints to the objective vector of the CMOP and simultaneously removing its constraints.

The first of the proposed CHTs provides a nonequivalent relaxation approach and, based on this CHT, it is proven that the efficient set of the primal CMOP is a subset of the strictly efficient set 
                        
                           E
                           ¯
                        
                      of the corresponding relaxation problem and can be extracted from 
                        
                           E
                           ¯
                        
                      by simply checking the dominance relation between the solutions in 
                        
                           E
                           ¯
                        
                     . From these theoretical results, a three-phase based idea is given to utilize any of the known algorithms for the unconstrained MOP to solve the MOPs. Because we must find the strictly efficient set of the relaxation problem, a defect coming with such a three-phase based CHT is that the size of search space will be increased. In addition, the relaxation approach in this CHT gives rise to that the linear properties of the primal CMOP might be changed. So this CHT is further improved such that the linear properties of the primal CMOP can be maintained. Note that, in an algorithm for a combinatorial optimization problem (COP), it is usually very difficult to deal with the nonlinear constraints or objectives. Therefore, maintaining such linear properties in the relaxed problem is very important for the related algorithm when handle COPs’ constraints.

The second of the proposed CHTs provides an equivalent relaxation approach by simply redefining all of the objectives of the CMOP and appending only one specially defined objective to the objective vector of the primal CMOP. By such a way, the primal CMOP is thus transformed into an unconstrained MOP. Based on such a CHT, it is proven that the primal problem and relaxation problem have the same efficient set and a two-phase based CHT is proposed for the general CMOP. Though both of the three-phase based and two-phase based CHTs can be applied to any CMOP, the former is very convenient for the constrained multi-criteria discrete optimization problem (MDOP) while the latter is very suitable for the general CMOP.

Over the past decades, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been applied to various fields and a number of multi-criteria optimization evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were proposed. A full review of recent and early approaches with respect to MOEAs can be found in Zhou, Qu, Li, Zhao, and Suganthan (2011) and Deb (2001), respectively. The main reason for the popularity of EAs for solving MOPs is their population-based nature and ability to find multiple optima simultaneously (Coello Coello et al., 2002). Some early important EAs are the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) of Zitzler and Thiele (1998); 1999), Pareto archived evolution strategy (PAES) of Knowles and Corne (1999), nondominated sortinggenetic algorithm(GA) (NSGA) of Srinivas and Deb (1995) and indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) of Zitzler and Kunzli (2004). Thereafter, the SPEA, PAES and NSGA were improved by Zitzler, Laumanns, and Thiele (2001), Knowles and Corne (2000) and Deb, Pratap, Agarwal, and Meyarivan (2002), respectively, and the improved versions are identified as SPEA-II, PAES-II and NSGA-II, respectively. The SPEA-II, PAES-II and NSGA-II are three prominent MOEAs used when comparing a newly designed MOEA (Coello Coello et al., 2002). Furthermore, a later MOEA with good performance is the archive based simulated annealing (SA), say AMOSA, of Bandyopadhyay, Saha, Maulik, and Deb (2008). By extending the idea of flexible integration of preference information of Fonseca and Fleming (1998b) and Knowles (2002), Zitzler and Kunzli (2004) proposed a general IBEA for the general unconstrained MOP. The main idea of IBEA is to formalize preferences in terms of continuous generalizations of the dominance relation, which leads to a simple algorithmic concept. Thereby, IBEA not only allows adaptation to arbitrary preference information and optimization scenarios, but also does not need any diversity preservation techniques, in contrast to Fonseca and Fleming (1998b). In comparison to Knowles (2002), IBEA is more general, since the population size can be arbitrary, and faster, because it only compares pairs of individuals and not entire approximation sets. These MOEAs will be employed in testing the proposed two-phase based CHT in this paper.

From the view point of application, the proposed CHTs have high adaptability or flexibility and their applications are extremely simple and convenient. In order to apply them to solve a CMOP, we only need to define a new UCMOP by utilizing the proposed CHTs and then solve the new problem with any of the existing solution algorithms of the UCMOP. In other words, if exists an algorithm for the UCMOP, then this algorithm can also be applied to solve the CMOP by combing it with the proposed CHTs. In this paper, the main idea of the proposed two-phase based CHT is illustrated by combining it with the AMOSA and NSGA-II, respectively.

This paper is organized as follows. Firstly, some of the research literatures with respect to CMOP are surveyed in Section 2 and notations regarding multi-criteria optimization are introduced in Section 3. Secondly, the nonequivalent and equivalent relaxation approaches are proposed and some theoretical results are proven in Sections  4.1 and 4.2, respectively. Additionally, a handling technique for the strict constraints is introduced in Section 4.3. Based on the theoretical results in Sections  4.1 and 4.2, a three-phase based idea for the CHT of the constrained MDOPs and a two-phase based idea for the CHT of the CMOPs are introduced in Section 4.4, and the two-phase based idea is illustrated by utilizing a known MOEA, i.e., NSGA-II. Finally, some metrics to assess the performances of MOEAs are given in Section 5 and the proposed two-phase based idea and its application effect are tested in Section 6 via some known CMOP test examples.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Many constraint handling methods have been proposed to solve constrained scalar objective optimization problems (SOPs) (e.g., Michalewicz and Schoenauer, 1996). According to the characteristics of different constraint handling methods, Coello Coello (2002) grouped them into five categories: (1) penalty functions; (2) special representations and operators; (3) repair algorithms; (4) separate objective and constraints; and (5) hybrid methods. Although not all constraint handling approaches developed for scalar objective optimization are suitable for CMOPs, some of them have been successfully extended into the constrained multiobjective areas (Coello Coello et al., 2002). This section will introduce some of the constraint handling approaches used for constrained multi-criteria optimization in last decade. Because the evolutionary strategy based approach is the most possible and effective solution approach for generic MOPs at present, the existing CHTs for CMOPs are that of some special handling approaches together with the evolutionary operations of EAs. Some of the evolutionary strategy based CHTs will be reviewed in the remainder of this section.

The penalty function approach is known as the most popular and oldest constraint handling method. It was firstly introduced by Courant (1943) and then extended to CMOPs by many researchers (e.g., Das, Natarajan, Stevens, and Koduru, 2008; Woldesenbet, Yen, and Tessema, 2009). Its basic idea is to transform a CMOP into an unconstrained one by introducing a penalty term into the primal fitness function to penalize constraint violations (Cai and Wang, 2006). There have been several schemes to impose suitable penalties when solve CMOPs, including the death penalty, static penalty, dynamic penalty, and adaptive penalty (Coello Coello, 2002). Woldesenbet et al. (2009) introduced a very promising self-adaptive penalty function for the constrained multi-criteria evolutionary optimization. This method tracks the percentage of the feasible solutions in the current population to determine the amount of penalty to be added. A small percentage of feasible individuals results in a larger penalty while a larger percentage generates a small penalty factor. This technique is able to balance information extraction from feasible and infeasible solutions (Zhou et al., 2011).

The immune strategy has also been commonly used to handle constraints. Zhang (2007) proposed a constrained nonlinear multi-criteria optimization immune algorithm based on the humoral immune response principle and ideas of T-cell regulation. This algorithm adopts and modifies a uniform designing scheme to provide an alternative feasible solutions set for dealing with constraints and infeasible solutions created during the evolutionary process.

In last decade, emphasis has been increasingly placed on hybrid methods. Qu and Suganthan (2011) introduced an ensemble of constraint handling methods to tackle the difficulty of selecting different constraint handling methods. Liu, Fernandez, Gao, and Gielen (2009) integrated fuzzy membership functions into the selection based constraint handling strategy and constructed a new constraint handling method. Geng, Song, Wu, and Liu (2009) proposed a constraint-handling strategy based on infeasible individual stochastic binary modification. This method randomly modifies infeasible individuals into feasible solutions according to a predefined modification rate during evolutionary optimization.

In recent years, attentions have also been focused on the co-evolutionary algorithms (COEAs) based on multiobjective concepts. The main idea of these algorithms is to treat constraints as one or more objectives and the constraints are handled by aggregating sum of objectives (e.g., Deb, 2000; He and Wang, 2007; Knowles and Corne, 2000) or considering the constraint violation into the ranking of solutions (e.g., Mezura-Montes and Coello Coello, 2005). Based on multiobjective concepts, Cai and Wang (2006) classified the approaches into two categories:

                        
                           •
                           Methods based on biasing feasible over infeasible solutions and

Methods based on multi-criteria optimization techniques.

                     Deb (2001) introduced a constrain dominance concept to handle CMOPs. A solution x is said to constrain dominate a solution y if (1) x is feasible, while y is infeasible; (2) both are infeasible and x has less constraint violation than y; or (3) both are feasible and x dominates y 
                     (Deb, 2001). The solutions are ranked using the non-constrain dominated method while the superior ones are selected to evolve. This method is also known as superiority of the feasible (Coello Coello et al., 2002). Such a constrain dominance concept was adopted in Deb et al. (2002). The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) was firstly proposed by Srinivas and Deb (1995) and an improved version, say NSGA-II, was given by Deb et al. (2002). In NSGA-II, the solutions are sorted according to the dominance relation, the crowding distance and the violation value of the constraints. Some of other important constraints handling approaches are those of Coello Coello and Montes (2002); Deb and Agrawal (1995); Fonseca and Fleming (1998a); Ray, Tai, and Chy (2001). Experiments of Deb, Pratap, and Meyarivan (2001) show that the performance of Ray et al. (2001) is inferior a lot to the NSGA. In the NSGA of Deb and Agrawal (1995), the constraint handling approach for single objective is implemented by using the binary tournament selection, where two solutions are picked from the population and the better solution is chosen. Such a constraint handling approach has also been extended to the constrained multi-criteria optimization (CMO) by Deb et al. (2002). The recent version of the NSGA is the reference points based nondominated sorting approach (NSGA-III) (Deb and Jain, 2014; Jain and Deb, 2014).

A multi-criteria optimization (MO) problem (MOP) can be defined as determining a set of decision variables within a feasible region to optimize a vector of objective functions which usually conflict with each other. In the context to minimize the objective vector, such a problem usually takes the following form

The constraints in Eq. (1c) is usually called as the strict constraints.

The optimal solution of a MOP is usually defined in sense of dominance relation between solutions. Most of the important notations such as dominance relation, efficient solution, efficient set and so on associated with MOP were firstly proposed by Pareto (1897). In the context of MOP (1), these notations are introduced in Definiations 3.1–3.3, respectively.

                        Definition 3.1
                        
                           Pareto 1897
                        


                        Given two solutions x and y of the MOP (1). x is said to dominate 
                           y, say x≺y or z(x)≺z(y), if fi
                           (x) ≤ fi
                           (y) for all i and fj
                           (x) < fj
                           (y) for some j; x is said to strictly dominate 
                           y, say x≺≺y or z(x)≺≺z(y), if fi
                           (x) < fi
                           (y) for all i; x is said to weakly dominate 
                           y, say x⪯y or z(x)⪯z(y), if fi
                           (x) ≤ fi
                           (y) for all i; x is said to incomparable with y, say x≗y, if neither x⪯y nor y⪯x.

Note that x≗y implies that x and y are mutually nondominated. In the following, the multi-criteria optimization is assumed to find the optimal solutions in sense of dominance relation.

                        Definition 3.2
                        
                           Pareto 1897
                        


                        An element x* ∈ X is an efficient solution or a Pareto optimal solution if there does not exist any x′ ∈ X such that x′≺x*. The set of all efficient solutions 
                              E
                            is called as the efficient set (ES) or the Pareto optimal set (POS). Similarly, an element x* ∈ X is a strictly efficient solution or a strict Pareto optimal solution if there does not exist any x′ ∈ X such that x′≺≺x*. The set of all strictly efficient solutions 
                              
                                 E
                                 ¯
                              
                            is called as the strictly efficient set (SES) or the strict Pareto optimal set (SPOS).

Clearly, solutions in the Pareto optimal set are those of which no objective can be improved without detracting from at least one of other objectives. In general, a multi-criteria optimization algorithm usually admits a set of solutions which are not dominated by any solution encountered by it.

                        Definition 3.3
                        
                           Pareto 1897
                        


                        If x* is Pareto optimal, then z* = z(x*) is called as a nondominated point or an efficient point. The set of all nondominated points 
                              N
                            is referred to the nondominated frontier (NF) or the Pareto frontier (PF).

For notations convenience, we introduce some terms with respect to multi-criteria optimization as follows.

In this section, we will elaborate the ideas of the proposed relaxation approaches and their application to handle constraints of CMOPs. Sections  4.1 and 4.2 mainly focus on the inequality constraints handling approaches. In Section 4.1, a nonequivalent relaxation approach is firstly proposed and some theoretical results associated with the relation between the POSs of the relaxation problem and primal problem are obtained. Section 4.2 investigates another approach and the related theoretical results in sense of equivalent relaxation, where equivalent means that the primal CMOP and its relaxation problem have the same efficient set. In addition, a CHT for the strict constraints h(x) = 0 is introduced in Section 4.3. By using these approaches and the theoretical results in Sections  4.1 and 4.2, frameworks of the two-phase based and three-phase based CHTs are given in Section 4.4, respectively.

In this section, we will give out some nonequivalent CHTs and the related theoretical results. By such CHTs, a primal CMOP is transformed into a relaxation form and the efficient set of the former is included in the strictly efficient set of the latter.

From now on, we assume that the undefined notations in this section are the same as those of CMOP (1). Firstly, we define a new CMOP as follows:

We prove this theorem with the reduction to absurdity. Provided that this theorem does not hold, i.e., there exists a solution

                              . In other words, by taking x as a solution of CMOP (2), there exists an

                               such that x′ strictly dominates x, i.e., z
                              1(x′)≺≺z
                              1(x). Because of

                               we have g(x) ≤ 0 and, consequently, g(x) ≤ 0. It follows from z
                              1(x′)≺≺z
                              1(x) and g(x) ≤ 0 that, on the one hand, g(x′) ≤ 0, i.e., g(x′) ≤ 0, and x′ is a feasible solution of CMOP (1) and, on the other hand, by taking x′ as a solution of CMOP (1), we have z(x′)≺≺z(x), i.e., x′≺x. This is in contradiction with the assumption

                              . Therefore, for any solution

                              . The theorem is thus proven.□

The reason why the strict dominance relation is considered in Theorem4.1 is to ensure

                              . Note that there may be solutions x

                              2 in the efficient set 
                                 E
                               of CMOP (1) such that z(x

                              2) and g(x

                               and, consequently, Theorem4.1 does not hold.

Actually, the CMOP (2) can be viewed as a relaxation of CMOP (1). Theorem4.1 indicates that the efficient set 
                           E
                         of CMOP (1) is a subset of the strictly efficient set 
                           
                              E
                              ¯
                           
                         of CMOP (2). In other words, its underlying application is to extract the efficient set of CMOP (1) from 
                           
                              E
                              ¯
                           
                        . The following corollary tell us how to implement such an extracting operation.

Theorem 4.1 and Corollary4.1 provide an important approach to convert the CMOP (1) into the simple relaxation MOP (2) by simply appending an objective function g(x) to the objective vector of CMOP (1) and removing the constraints g(x) ≤ 0 from CMOP (1). Though the latter is not equivalent to the former, however, the efficient set of the former can be extracted from the strictly efficient set of the latter by simply checking the feasibility and dominance relation of solutions in the latter. Therefore, by using Theorem4.1 and Corollary4.1, if there exists an algorithm for unconstrained MOP, then we can accordingly obtain an algorithm for CMOP.

As was stated previously, the emphasis of this section is to provide a CHT for the discrete optimization problems (DOPs) such that the existing algorithms with respect to the unconstrained DOPs can be utilized for finding the efficient set of the constrained DOPs. From now on, we turn our attention to this aspect. Though we have theoretically proven that the efficient set 
                           E
                         of the CMOP (1) is a subset of the strictly efficient set 
                           
                              E
                              ¯
                           
                         of the relaxed MOP  (2), however, the greatest issue of the previously proposed CHT is the increased search space size of the corresponding relaxation problem and 
                           E
                         is thus only a very small part of 
                           
                              E
                              ¯
                           
                        . Additionally, in the practical application, we can only find a finite solutions in 
                           
                              E
                              ¯
                           
                        . Therefore, from the practical point of view, it is difficult to obtain an acceptable nondominated set of the generic CMOP (1) through the relaxed MOP (2) unless the cardinality of the obtained 
                           
                              E
                              ¯
                           
                         is very larger. In other word, previously introduced approach is not very suitable for the generic CMOP. We know that for most of the DOPs there are only a few solutions in its efficient set and some of its algorithms are the exact or the approximate which can obtain a very approximate efficient set. Therefore, the influence of this issue on the constrained DOP is usually comparatively small.

When apply the previously given relaxation approach to the constrained DOP, to decrease the difficulty of solving the corresponding relaxation problem, it is important to maintain its linear properties while relaxes it into the relaxation problem. In the following, we will propose an approach which can fulfill such a purpose. Another relaxation of CMOP (1) is only to relax the k selected constraints gj

                        }, k ≤ q and the corresponding relaxation is the following CMOP

From practical point of view, the CHT implemented by the relaxation problem in Eq. (3) is very important for the constrained DOP. The most important advantage of the CHT in Eq. (3) is that the linear properties of the objectives and constraints of the primal CMOP (1) are fully maintained in the relaxation problem in (3). It is known to us that, for the DOP, there are only a few of solutions being included in its efficient set and some of the DOPs only have one or two constraints (e.g., the resources constrained SPP). Therefore, for the DOPs, if there exists an algorithm for the linear unconstrained DOPs, then we can obtain a corresponding algorithm for the linear constrained DOPs, for example, the multi-criteria constrained shortest path problem (CSPP) which usually has one or two linear resource constraints and the values of resource cost functions are not permitted to exceed the given limitations.

We know that, for the multi-criteria shortest path problem (MSPP), there exist some exact algorithms (e.g., the label correcting algorithm (LCA) (Skriver and Andersen, 2000)) or efficient approximate algorithms (e.g., the fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) Tsaggouris and Zaroliagis, 2009). By using the CHT in Eq. (3), it is viable to obtain solutions of a multi-criteria CSPPthrough solving the relaxed unconstrained MSPP with the LCA or FPTAS. Follows from the approach in Section 4.4, we can easily design the corresponding algorithms for the multi-criteria CSPP by using these existing algorithms for MSPP. However, for the DOPs having an eligible solution based algorithm, their constraints can be handled by a more efficient approach in Section 4.2, where the eligible solution based algorithm implies that in each of iterations an eligible solution is found. As was known to us that the EAs have been applied in the solution algorithms of MSPP, for example, the SA (Liu, Mu, Luo, and Li, 2012) and GA (Liu and Mu, 2012). All of these EAs are also that of the eligible solution based. So the CHT in Section 4.2 can be straightforward combined with the EAs for MSPPs.

In this section, we will propose a CHT to handle the inequality constraints g(x) ≤ 0. With such a CHT, the CMOP (1) can be equivalently transformed into a MOP, in which the inequality constraints g(x) ≤ 0 are eliminated, by simply redefining all of the objective functions.

                        1≺x
                        2 indicates that x
                        1 is much closer to the POS than x
                        2. In addition, z

                        (x), 0) if x is a feasible solution of CMOP (1). Firstly, we give a lemma as follows.

For the CMOP (1) and (5), we can prove that they are equivalent to each other, i.e., they have the same efficient set. Therefore, we have the following theorem.

                               and the theorem is thus proven.□

The CHT in Eqs. (4)–(6) is very simple to be implemented for all CMOPs, particularly, for those with continuous objective and constraint functions. The greatest advantage of MOP (5) is that, in its solving process, some infeasible solutions of CMOP (1) might be found by a solution algorithm of MOP (5), however, by the optimization function of the solution algorithm, these infeasible solutions can quickly converge to the feasible solutions of CMOP (1). To the greatest extent, such an advantage can ensure that the search space of an algorithm of MOP (5) is just enlarged than the solution space of the CMOP (1).

Most of the early CHTs focus on eliminating the infeasible solutions in the next iteration of the related algorithms. However, some of the infeasible solutions are sometimes helpful for the convergence of algorithms so long as we can provide a mechanism to ensure that the infeasible solution can be quickly converged to the feasible one, particularly, for the optimization problem with non-convex or disconnected solution space. For instance, the non-convex solution space in Fig. 1
                        , where x
                        1 and x
                        2 are two efficient solutions and x
                        0 is an infeasible solution. It is clear that, to converge from x
                        1 to x
                        2, the efficient way should be that of taking the infeasible solution x
                        0 as a gateway. The proposed CHT is an approach based on this idea.

                           Remark 4.2
                           We know that in the iterating process of some algorithms, the handled solutions may be illegal, for example, the LCA (Skriver and Andersen, 2000) for MSPP. For the predetermined origin and destination nodes, each of the labeled nodes in the iterating process of LCA corresponds to a path from the original node to itself rather than a full path from the original node to the terminal node. Similar phenomenon also exists in the algorithms of other path problems. Such a characteristic of the algorithm gives rise to the single objective constrained shortest path problems (SPPs) (CSPPs) being that of NP-hard (Garey and Johnson, 1979) even though there exists an algorithm with computational complexity O(nln n) for the unconstrained single objective SPP. Though Deb (2001) has successfully handled the constraints of the CMOP by defining the condition dominance relation, however, in contrast with the approach of Deb (2001), the CHTs in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 are more flexible and there is no any requirement about the implanted algorithms and the related problems. The previously mentioned single objective CSPPs can be solved through utilizing the proposed CHTs by which a single objective CSPP  can be transformed into a bi-objective unconstrained SPP and, consequently, it can be solved by the LCA. So the proposed CHTs are independent of both of the problem and the related algorithm. On the contrary, it is difficult to handle the foregoing phenomenon by the approach of Deb (2001) and such an approach is relatively suitable for the CHT in MOEAs.

In this section, discussions will focus on the handling techniques for the strict constraints h(x) = 0 in CMOP (1). Note that, in most of the practical considerations, the constraints h(x) = 0 are usually represented in a relatively simple form, for example, each element of constraint vector h(x) is a linear function. Generally, it is easy to handle the constraints in this case and a reducing dimensions approach is introduced in this section. By using such an approach, the strict constraints h(x) = 0 can be relaxed or converted into some inequality constraints and then handle by using the proposed CHTs in previous sections. Primary idea of this approach is to reduce the dimensions of the primal problem by solving the following linear equations

For the nonlinear strict constraints h(x) = 0, one of the handling techniques is the approach of Cai and Wang (2006) which give a tolerance parameter δ > 0 for the equality constraints and convert the equality constraints h(x) = 0 into |hj
                        (x)| ≤ δ, j = 1, 2, …, s. The corresponding model can be defined as following CMOP

                        . Follows from Theorem4.1 and Corollary4.1, the efficient set of CMOP (8) can be extracted from the strictly efficient set of the unconstrained MOP  (9). By such a way, we can obtain the efficient set of CMOP (8) through the unconstrained MOP (9) and then take it as the approximate efficient set of CMOP (1).

By using the general handling approach for the strict constraints h(x) = 0 in CMOP (8), the proposed CHT in Section 4.2 can also be applied to the relaxed form (8) of CMOP (1) and obtain the approximation of the true efficient set of CMOP (1). Additionally, the g(x) in the definition of f
                        
                           p + 1(x) in Eq. (6) can also be defined by the partial of gj
                        (x) and taking the remainders as the constraints. This provides a more flexible approach to handle the constraints of CMOP.

In Section 4.4, by using the theorems in Sections  4.1–4.3, we will give out the implementing idea of the proposed CHTs in these sections.

In this section, we introduce two ideas, i.e., two-phase based CHT and three-phase based CHT, with respect to the application of the CHTs in Sections  4.1 and 4.2, where the latter is much suitable for the constrained discrete optimization problem (DOP) and the former is that for general CMOP. The ideas of the former are illustrated by combing the proposed CHT in Section 4.2 with NSGA-II, and simple framework of the two-phase based NSGA-II is given in this section.

As was stated by Coello Coello (2002), the existing CHTs are usually classified into five types. The essential of these approaches is to prevent the related algorithms from searching in the neighborhood of an encountered infeasible solution as far as possible except the repair approach (Coello Coello, 2002). Such a purpose is well fulfilled by the CHT in Section 4.2. As was indicated in Section 4.2, an infeasible solution of CMOP (1) is dominated by all of the feasible solutions of the relaxed MOP (5). So the objectives vector of MOP(5) can ensure that local search is performed within the neighborhood of the feasible solution of CMOP (1) as far as possible when such a CHT is applied to MOEAs.

The theorems and corollaries in Section 4.1 give us some ideas to develop the solution algorithm for CMOP (1), particularly, as was analyzed in Section 4.1, for the constrained DOP. This idea includes three successive phases and, consequently, the related approach is called as three-phase based CHT. The first phase is the convert phase in which, upon whether the CMOP (1) includes the strict constraints h(x) = 0 or not, a MOP (2) or an unconstrained MOP (9) is defined by simple appending a new objective function to the objectives vector of CMOP (1) and removing its constraints. The second phase, say solve phase, is to obtain the strict efficient set

                         of MOP (2) or (9) by using any known algorithm for the unconstrained MOP and the last one is the construct phase to obtain the efficient set 
                           E
                         of CMOP (1) from 
                           
                              E

                         through the given approach in Corollary4.1. The advantage of the three-phase based CHT is that the efficient set of the CMOP (1) can be obtained through solving an unconstrained MOP. As the foregoing comments in Section 4.1, the above approach is not much suitable for the generic CMOPs, however, it has great advantage for the constrained DOP.

The CHT in Section 4.2 can be efficiently combined with any known algorithm for the unconstrained MOP. The essential is composed of two phases, i.e., first two phases of the previously defined phases, where the first phase is to define the relaxation problem in Eq. (5) and, in the second phase, the efficient set is obtained. The ideas of the two-phase based CHT are illustrated by combing the CHT in Section 4.2 with NSGA-II and, correspondingly, two-phase based NSGA-II is obtained.

Nowadays, various EAs have been the primary and efficient approaches to solve the MOP and lots of MOEAs are designed every year. We have tested six MOEAs proposed in recent years, an undeniable fact is that the performances of these MOEAs are usually worse than some early MOEAs such as NSGA-II, PAES-II and SPEA even if the authors declared their MOEAs have a better performance than these early MOEAs.

Among the MOEAs the NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002) is still one of the most efficient though its primal version (Srinivas and Deb, 1995) has been criticized for its O(pn
                        3) computational complexity and non-elitism (Deb et al., 2002), where p is the number of objectives and n is the population size. The NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002), in which the computational complexity of nondominated sorting is equal to O(pn
                        2), is an improved version of Srinivas and Deb (1995). Furthermore, NSGA-II is also one of the MOEAs to solve CMOP.

In NSGA-II, the solutions are sorted according to the dominance relation, the crowding distance through which the diversity of solutions over the obtained nondominated set is considered, and the violation value of the constraints by which the constraints of CMOP are handled. The nondominated sorting in NSGA-II serves as both of the roles to update the current nondominated set and reproduce the population. The essential ideas of the nondominated sorting approach in NSGA-II are described as follows (Deb et al., 2002): For a given set X of solutions, the nondominated set

In this section, we consider the more generic approximation (8) of CMOP (1) and its relaxation (9). The main framework of the two-phase based NSGA-II for the CMOP (8) is summarized as Algorithm 1
                        . For other MOEAs such as PAES, PAES-II, SPEA and SPEA-II, they can be extended into solving the CMOP with the same idea as Algorithm 1.

The computational comparisons demand some metrics to evaluate the performances of a newly proposed MOEA as well as the compared MOEAs. Generally, the performances of the MOEAs can be fully evaluated by the convergence (i.e., the approximate degree), which can be interpreted as the distance between the obtained Pareto frontier (PF) and true PF, and the diversity, which can be further divided into the spread range of the obtained PF and the distribution status of the obtained nondominated points over the Pareto frontier, of the obtained PF. Here, we firstly introduce some existing metrics such as distance metric, spacing metric and set coverage metric. These metrics can partially reflect the approximate degree, the spread range and the convergence ability of the MOEAs.

Generally, above metrics can be employed to evaluate the approximate degree of the obtained POS to the true POS in sense of distance. However, the diversity or the spread range is also an important index to evaluate the performance of the MOEAs (Deb et al., 2002). Let

                      is the minimum Euclidean distance between zi
                      and the points in A. It is universally accepted that the IGD metric can provide a combined information about the convergence and diversity of the obtained solutions. Clearly, if the IGD metric is very small, then the obtained solutions have a good convergence and diversity. However, in case of a large IGD metric, we cannot determine the causes resulting in a bad IGD metric, because any one of the worse convergence and diversity is a potential reason of a large IGD metric. So the best way to comprehensively assess the performance of a MOEA by using IGD metric is to combined it with other metrics, for instance, the distance metric.

Here we propose a simple metric which can be employed to evaluate the spread range of the MOEAs. For a nondominated set A of MOP, assume that

                      the quality of 
                        A
                      should be the better. Such a distribution characteristic was partially considered in the adopted clustering approach of AMOSA (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008) and the adopted nondominated sorting approach of NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002), respectively. To evaluate the distribution status, we introduce a simple metric, say ɛ-metric, and it is defined as follows.

Because the main purpose of this paper is to provide a viable CHT for the CMOP and the ideas of its application rather than to develop a new algorithm, the mission of computational discussions in this section is to verify the application performance of the proposed CHT on some prominent existing MOEAs. The application of the proposed CHT to these MOEAs can be simply implemented by adopting the ideas in Section 4.4. In Section 6.1, we simply introduce some MOEAs, to which the proposed CHT will be applied, and constrained test problems which will be used to test the application of the proposed CHT. The simulated results and comments are reported in Section 6.2.

In order to test the performance of the proposed CHT, we choose some early MOEAs to which the proposed CHT will be applied. As was indicated by Coello Coello et al. (2002), the SPEA-II, PAES-II and NSGA-II are three prominent MOEAs used when comparing a newly designed MOEA. Among these MOEAs, the NSGA-II has a predominant average stability and performance on unconstrained MOP over others. In addition, it is also a MOEA having the ability to solve the CMOP. So both of the original NSGA-II and the two-phase based NSGA-II (TNSGA-II) are included in the experiments. The most recent improved version of the NSGA-II is the reference points based nondominated sorting approach (NSGA-III) (Deb and Jain, 2014; Jain and Deb, 2014). The improved aspect of the NSGA-III is mainly focused on enhancing the diversity of the obtained solutions by replacing the crowding distance in NSGA-II with the reference points based fitness. The testing MOEA suite in next section also includes the NSGA-III and two-phase based NSGA-III (TNSGA-III).

The SPEA-II of Zitzler et al. (2001) is an improved version of the SPEA of Zitzler and Thiele (1998); 1999). However, numerical test shows that, in the SPEA-II, there is no much performance of SPEA being improved besides its higher computational complexity in solution reproducing. In addition, the SPEA and SPEA-II do not have the constraints handling ability. So we just include the two-phase based SPEA (TSPEA) in the forthcoming numerical experiments. There is no obvious difference between performances of PAES (Knowles and Corne, 1999) and its improved version PAES-II (Knowles and Corne, 2000). We have tested the PAES and PAES-II with most of the unstrained MOP benchmarks, the fact is that the performance of PAES on some of these examples is better than that of PAES-II whereas the performance of PAES-II on some of others is better than that of PAES. Therefore, both of the two-phase based PAES (TPAES) and PAES-II (TPAES-II) are included in the compared algorithms set. Because the AMOSA has a better performance on the unconstrained MOPs, the two-phase based AMOSA (TAMOSA) is also included in the compared algorithms set. Furthermore, the proposed CHT in this paper is also extended to IBEA(TIBEA) in the forthcoming experiments. By this way, there are overall 9 MOEAs (NSGA-II, TNSGA-II, NSGA-III, TNSGA-III, TPAES, TPAES-II, TSPEA, TIBEA and TAMOSA) being included in the following experiments.

In contrast to the MOP, it is difficult to define a constrained test problem (CTP) and there is only a few good CTPs (Deb, 2001). There are 4 CTPs, identified as CONSTR, SRN, TNK and OSY, respectively, having been widely included in the computational testing of a newly designed CHT. The Pareto frontier of TNK is disconnected and that of the OSY is a polygonal line. All of these examples have two objectives. To coincide with the CMOP (1), these problems are represented as those in Table 1
                         and, to adopt the proposed CHT, all of these examples are transformed into the unconstrained MOP with 3 objectives by the approaches in Eqs. (4)–(6).

The TNK in Table 1 was firstly defined by Tanaka (1995). Coello Coello et al. (2002) extended the definition of Tanaka (1995) into a parameterized and generic form which include two important parameters a and b. By assigning the parameters a, b with various values or by taking the absolute value on the last term of the first constraint, Coello Coello et al. (2002) derived five new CTPs which are much difficult to be solved. These new CTPs are identified as TNK1–TNK5, respectively. The generic form of TNK is defined as

                        1 ∈ [0, 1]; the bounds of other variables depend on the chosen function g(x). In following experiments, x
                        2 ∈ [0, 1] for CTP2–CTP5 and x
                        2 ∈ [0, 10] for CTP6–CTP8. The parameters θ, a, b, c, d and e of CTP2–CTP8 are defined as: CTP2: θ = −0.2π, a = 0.2, b = 10, c = 1, d = 6 and e = 1; CTP3: θ = −0.2π, a = 0.1, b = 10, c = 1, d = 0.5 and e = 1; CTP4: θ = −0.2π, a = 0.75, b = 10, c = 1, d = 0.5 and e = 1; CTP5: θ = −0.2π, a = 0.1, b = 10, c = 2, d = 0.5 and e = 1; CTP6: θ = 0.1π, a = 40, b = 0.5, c = 1, d = 2 and e = −2; CTP7: θ = −0.05π, a = 40, b = 5, c = 1, d = 6 and e = 0; CTP8: θ = −0.05π, a = 40, b = 2, c = 1, d = 6 and e = 0. The corresponding objective spaces and their boundaries of CTP2–CTP7 are shown in Figs. 2
                         and 3
                        .

The corresponding objective spaces and their boundaries of TNK1–TNK5 (see Coello Coello et al., 2002) are similar as that of CTP2–CTP7, however, the latter are much difficult to be solved. So the TNK1–TNK5 are not included in the following experiments and the numerical experiments are therefore performed on overall 12 CTPs, i.e., CONSTR, SRN, TNK, OSY and CTP1–CTP8.

According to the idea in Deb et al. (2002), all of these experimental MOEAs are run for a maximum of given size of function evaluations. To do so, we give an example to illustrate the coordinating strategy of the parameter configurations of the adopted MOEAs in the forthcoming experiments. Assume that the population size of NSGA-II and the number of inner loops of AMOSA equal to 100, respectively. If the size of function evaluations is 25, 000, the evolution generation of NSGA-II should not be less than 2500, and the initial temperature T

                        min  and cooling rate α of AMOSA should satisfy

                         In our computer program, the obtained codes of PAES, these MOEAs are revised such that they can coincide with our data structure of solutions and so on.

The experiments are performed on HP Compaq Elite 8300 SFF (Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-3770 central processing unit 3.40 gigahertz, 3.403 gigahertz 4 gigabyte memory). The performances of the algorithms are assessed with distance metric, set coverage metric and IGD metric, respectively. In calculating IGD metric, we must predetermine a set of points uniformly distributed over the PF. In the following experiments, these points are replaced with the reference points generated in the NSGA-III. Each of these problems is executed 30 runs and the reported results are the average metrics obtained in 30 runs.

In this section, we will test the application performance of the proposed two-phase based CHT on some MOEAs such as NSGA-II, NSGA-III, PAES, PAES-II, SPEA, IBEA and AMOSA. Because both of the NSGA-II and NSGA-III are MOEAs for CMOPs, the included benchmarks are also solved with the original NSGA-II and NSGA-III, and their performances are accordingly taken as a comparison object of other algorithms.

According to the simulated results in Table 2, the performances of NSGA-II and TNSGA-II are very closer and, however, the TNSGA-II is better than NSGA-II. Almost all of the corresponding metrics of TNSGA-II in Tables 2 and 3 are better than that of NSGA-II, where the mutually dominated rates between

                        . By using the box plots in Fig. 6, both of the average results and stability of TNSGA-II are much better than that of TPAES and TSPEA. Additionally, the simulated results show that the performance of TNSGA-II is also better than TIBEA. It is worth mentioning that the NSGA-II and NSGA-III have the ability of constraints handling. Therefore, the comparative discussions in the following context are mainly focused on comparing the performances of NSGA-II and TNSGA-II with that of TPAES, TPAES-II, TSPEA, TIBEA and TAMOSA.

For each of these algorithms, its performances on CONSTR are the best. However, the points in the obtained nondominated frontier by TPAES, TPAES-II and TAMOSA are not uniformly distributed, for instance, the nondominated points in Fig. 5
                        
                         obtained by TAMOSA, and most of the obtained nondominated points are crowded around the right-bottom part of the true Pareto frontier. This phenomenon is not come from the proposed CHT. Actually, the testing results of these algorithms on unconstrained MOPs show that such a phenomenon is also occurred in the obtained nondominated points set of some benchmarks, for instance, the test problem SCH2.

In contrast with CONSTR, for each of these algorithms the obtained average metrics with respect to OSY are the worst, where one with the worst performance is the TIBEA. The difficulty of OSY was independently indicated by Deb et al. (2001) and Coello Coello et al. (2002). Its difficulty mainly comes from that its Pareto optimal region is a concatenation of five regions. In other words, its Pareto optimal region consists of five ridges of a polyhedron. The entire Pareto optimal region demands an MOEA population to maintain sub-populations at different intersections of constraint boundaries, it is therefore a difficult MOP to solve. Furthermore, its Pareto frontier is a polygonal line composed of five line or curve segments and this results in a large efficient solutions region of OSY. The difficulty to solve OSY is correspondingly increased.

According to the distance metrics, IGD metrics and set coverage metrics of SRN and TNK, performances of NSGA-II and TNSGA-II are inferior to TPAES, TPAES-II and TSPEA, where the worst are the TIBEA and TAMOSA. For TIBEA and TAMOSA, the distance metric and set coverage metric of the former are better than the latter whereas the IGD metric of the latter is better than the former and, by combing the IGD metric with the distance metric, the diversity of the former is worse than that of the latter. It follows from the simulated results of early scholars and the results in Tables 2 and 3 that, among the benchmarks for CMOP, the SRN is such a test problem that all existing algorithms for CMOP have a good and stable performance, where the NSGA-III is that of the worst performance. The Pareto frontier of TNK is composed of three connected parts. For all of the algorithms, they have a lower ability to find enough nondominated points in the neighborhood of some points with very larger or lower gradient in the second part, for instance, the Pareto frontiers in Fig. 7
                         obtained by NSGA-II and TSPEA. Actually, this result is in correlation with the adopted algorithms and is a common phenomenon existing in the continuous optimization algorithms. In my personal opinion and analysis, the main reason may be the precision of the adopted data type of variables in computer program. Generally, in a segment with very larger or lower gradient, because of the calculation errors, it is very easy that some nondominated points in such a segment are dominated by other points in the same segment. In the case of single precision data type, this phenomenon is even more prominent. This phenomenon is also appeared in the results of CONSTR, for example, the results in Fig. 5 of CONSTR obtained by TAMOSA. It is usually difficult to find enough nondominated points in vicinity to the right-bottom corner in Fig. 5.

The Pareto frontier of CTP1 is the connected and composed of two straight lines and a sub-frontier of the unconstrained Pareto frontier. In addition, the boundary of the objective space is convex. Generally, for an algorithm, its performance on the MOPs with convex objective space boundary is better than that with non-convex objective space boundary (e.g., Figs. 8
                         and 9
                        ). The average metrics of CTP1 obtained by NSGA-II and TNSGA-II are worse than that obtained by the remains. The CTP1 is of the less difficulty in CTP suite. For the CTP2–CTP8, their objective space boundaries are non-convex, where the objective space boundaries of CTP6–CTP8 are of disconnected (see Figs. 2 and 3).

The CTP2 has a non-convex objective space boundary. Its Pareto frontier is disconnected and distributes over the non-convex objective space boundary (see Fig. 2a). For CTP2, all of the algorithms involved in the test have a good performance and can find a diverse nondominated points set. The MOEAs with the best and worst performance are the TSPEA and NSGA-III, respectively. The downloaded code of NSGA-III is a revised version which patches a bug in the MOEA of Deb and Jain (2014). Actually, there is still a bug in the NSGA-III which results in that the implementing code cannot execute when the evolution generation is large enough. In the NSGA-III of Deb and Jain (2014), no approach is provided for handling such a case that

With the eliminated run-time errors by such a simple handling approach, the most essential improvement of the NSGA-III is thus outlived its purpose which is focused on improving the diversity of the obtained solutions. The bad diversity of the obtained solutions results in a bad IGD metric. Therefore, in the simulated results in this paper, the corresponding IGDmetrics of the NSGA-III and TNSGA-III is almost the worst.

Problems CTP3 and CTP4 degenerate to those with only one solution in each disconnected Pareto optimal region (see Fig. 2b and c). This results in that there are explicit 13 solutions in the efficient set of CTP3 and CTP4. These problems are very difficult to solve, particularly, the CTP4 is of the most difficult among all test problems of CMOP. The worst simulated results of CTP3 and CTP4 obtained by TNSGA-II, TPAES, TIBEA and TSPEA are shown in Fig. 9a and b, respectively.

The Pareto frontier of CTP5 is composed of 15 connected regions, where one has infinite nondominated points and each of the remains 14 regions has only one nondominated point (see Fig. 3). By using the simulated results in Table 2, the performance of TSPEA is of the best whereas that of TPAES, TPAES-II and TAMOSA are much poorer. Fig. 10
                         shows the worst case among 30 runs by TNSGA-II, TSPEA, TIBEA and TSPEA. It follows from Tables 2 and 3 and Fig. 10 that the obtained nondominated points by TSPEA are much near to the true Pareto frontier. The TIBEA also has a good performance on CTP5 in sense of

                              )
                           
                         although the

                         is relatively poor.

In contrast with CTP1–CTP5, each of problems CTP6, CTP7 and CTP8 has a disconnected objective space, where the objective spaces of CTP6 and CTP7 are shown in Fig. 3b and c, respectively, and that of CTP8 is similar as CTP7 except the size of the disconnected regions in objective space is less than that of CTP7. Additionally, each of them has some local Pareto optimal frontiers and CTP6 has a connected true Pareto frontier. For the CTP6, Deb et al. (2001) indicated that, because all of its objective space boundaries are paralleled to its true Pareto frontier, the NSGA-II can finally find a nondominated points set very near to the true Pareto frontier. Such a converging ability is not only possessed by NSGA-II, but also by all of the algorithms included in the test of this paper. The simulated results of CTP6 in Tables 2 and 3 show that all of the related algorithms perform well on CTP6 and the TIBEA has a good performance. Furthermore, all of these algorithms are able to find a better diversity of solutions. For all of the compared algorithms, their overall performances on CTP6 are the same as that of CTP2.

In contrast with CTP6, each of CTP7 and CTP8 not only has a disconnected objective space, but also a disconnected true Pareto frontier. Their true Pareto frontiers are composed of five and three connected sub-frontiers of unconstrained true Pareto frontier, respectively. Deb et al. (2001) indicated that the NSGA-II has a difficulty to solve CTP7 and CTP8 and cannot find solutions closer to the true Pareto frontier. However, the simulated results in this paper show that not only the NSGA-II, but also the TNSGA-II, TPAES, TPAES-II, TSPEA, TIBEA and TAMOSA perform very well on CTP7. Except TPAES-II and TAMOSA the others also have very better performance on CTP8. In each of 30 runs, TPAES-II and TAMOSA just find a local Pareto frontier shown in Fig. 11
                        . This results in the bad metrics of CTP8 obtained by TPAES-II and TAMOSA. In addition, most of the obtained solutions over 30 runs have a worse spread. Two solutions obtained by NSGA-II and TNSGA-II are shown in Fig. 12
                        . It follows from Fig. 12 that NSGA-II cannot efficiently find solutions near to the right-bottom part of the true Paretofrontier.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, two CHTs for CMOP are proposed, where one is much suitable for the constrained multi-criteria discrete optimization problem and another is primarily used in the general CMOP. Based on the proposed CHTs, a two-phase based idea for the general CMOP is given.

The great advantages of the proposed CHTs are their algorithmic independence, i.e., by using the proposed CHTs, a CMOP can be transformed into an unconstrained MOP which can be solved by any algorithms for the unconstrained MOP. In numerical experiment, the two-phase based idea is applied to seven prominent MOEAs, i.e., NSGA-II, NSGA-III, PAES, PAES-II, SPEA, TIBEA and AMOSA, respectively, where NSGA-II and NSGA-III are MOEAs being able to solve CMOP. Simulated results show that the performances of two-phase based NSGA-II on all the test examples are better than that of NSGA-II. Furthermore, for some of the test examples the performance of the two-phase based PAES, PAES-II, SPEA, TIBEA and AMOSA are superior to that of NSGA-II and two-phase based NSGA-II and, for most of the test examples, the performances of NSGA-II and two-phase based NSGA-II are not the best. The simulated results show that, on the one hand, the NSGA-II is inferior to two-phase based NSGA-II and, on the other hand, the two-phase based idea can be effectively applied to NSGA-II, PAES, PAES-II, SPEA, TIBEA and AMOSA. So the proposed two-phase based idea is a valid CHT for the CMOPs.

No more attention is focused on algorithmic perspectives in this paper. We know that every algorithm for MOPs has its inherent particularity. Though the proposed CHT can be straightforwardly extended to any existing algorithm for MOPs, a further research topic is to combine the proposed CHT with the known algorithms for MOPs and develop some much efficient algorithms for CMOPs.

Further potential applications of the proposed CHTs are existed in real life. As was stated previously, the shortest path problem (SPP) has been widely applied in practice and the constrained SPP was also comprehensive investigated. We know that, for the multi-criteria SPP, various solution approaches such as the label setting algorithm (LSA), label correcting algorithm (LCA) and the fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) have been proposed. Therefore, extending the proposed CHTs into the various constrained SPPs to develop the corresponding LSA, LCA and FPTAS will be another important research topic.
