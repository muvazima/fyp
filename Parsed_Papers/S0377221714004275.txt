                  This article studies the influence of risk on farms’ technical efficiency levels. The analysis extends the order-m efficiency scores approach proposed by Daraio and Simar (2005) to the state-contingent framework. The empirical application focuses on cross section data of Catalan specialized crop farms from the year 2011. Results suggest that accounting for production risks increases the technical performance. A 10% increase in output risk will result in a 2.5% increase in average firm technical performance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A fundamental challenge to modeling production is the design of an appropriate conceptualization of the stochastic environment in which production decisions take place. As noted in the Chavas, Chambers, & Pope, 2010 literature review of the production economics literature over the past century, production uncertainty modeling started with Day (1965) and Fuller (1965) through the use of experimental data on corn yield response to fertilizer application. This literature then evolved to the introduction of stochastic production functions that have allowed for production uncertainty mainly through additive and multiplicative structures. Recognition of the drawbacks of multiplicative and additive specifications, led Just and Pope (1978) to introduce a mean–variance model that characterizes inputs as risk increasing, neutral or decreasing, by evaluating changes in output variability as a response to input changes. Other papers based on the mean–variance or on higher order approaches, the latter allowing to study the impact of input changes on higher order moments, include Yassour, Zilberman, and Rausser (1981), Antle (1983), or Nelson and Preckel (1991).

More recently, Kumbhakar (2002) and Wang (2002) have allowed for production uncertainty in efficiency measurement. Inadequate characterization of the stochastic environment may lead to uncertainty being incorrectly attributed to efficiency and productivity differences (Chambers & Quiggin, 2000; O’Donnell et al., 2010). Skevas, Oude Lansink, and Stefanou (2012) investigate the impacts of risk on efficiency using Simar and Wilson (2007) proposal based on truncated regression and bootstrapping techniques. Risk is captured by considering the effect of climatic conditions on farmers’ production environment. Results provide evidence of a dramatic increase in DEA efficiency ratings as a result of considering production uncertainty along with the dynamic impacts of pesticides on production.

In a different line of research, Chambers and Quiggin (1998) and Chambers and Quiggin (2000) propose to characterize production under uncertainty by differentiating outputs depending on the state of nature in which they are realized. This characterization leads to a stochastic technology based on a state-contingent input correspondence. The state-contingent framework is based on the Arrow–Debreu–Savage conceptualization of uncertainty in terms of a state space that allows for output substitution across states of nature. Standard stochastic production functions require non-substitutability between state-contingent outputs (Chambers & Quiggin, 2000, 2002, 2006). This restriction implies that producers can only respond to changes in the production environment by changing input use, but not reallocating state-contingent outputs. The state-contingent framework has been shown to yield more precise efficiency measures relative to approaches that impose this restriction (Chambers & Quiggin, 2006; O’Donnell et al., 2010). Serra, Chambers, and Oude Lansink (2014) have recently derived combined technical and environmental efficiency measures for a sample of Catalan farms. Their analysis recognizes the stochastic conditions under which production takes place by means of the state-contingent framework. Chambers, Hailu, and Quiggin (2011) approximate the stochastic technology by a state space partitioned by defining event-specific production relationships. Event-specific representations are applied to a DEA framework by using realized values of the random inputs to partition the data. Under this partition, efficiency estimates increase dramatically, thus confirming that ignoring the stochastic nature of production will lead to biased efficiency estimates.

There is ample evidence that economic agents are not neutral to risk (Antle, 1989; Bar-Shira, Just, & Zilberman, 1997; Chavas & Holt, 1990; Hennessy, 1998; Just & Pope, 2002; Saha, 1997; Serra, Zilberman, & Gil, 2008; Serra, Zilberman, Goodwin, & Featherstone, 2006). To the extent that economic decisions are influenced by risk preferences, risk implicit in the state-contingent output distribution should have an impact on the efficiency with which economic agents operate (Battese, Rambaldi, & Wan, 1997). We measure this impact through Daraio and Simar’s (2005) nonparametric frontier model, that allows for the influence of external factors on firm efficiency ratings.

In frontier analysis, nonparametric efficiency measures are based upon the assumption that all observed units belong to the attainable production set. As a result, super-efficient outliers can have an influential impact on these envelopment estimators. Robustness can be increased through a trimming process that results in the frontier not enveloping all data points. Daraio and Simar (2005) provide a probabilistic formulation of a robust nonparametric order-m efficiency model, being m the trimming parameter, that allows for the influence of environmental variables that cannot be controlled by the producer, but that shape the outcome of production. Daraio and Simar (2005) proposal allows determining whether the environmental variable promotes or reduces efficiency. However, it does not adequately capture the stochastic conditions under which production takes place. The state-contingent framework proposed by Chambers and Quiggin (2000) can be implemented using standard tools of efficiency analysis when ex-ante outputs are known. As a result, we extend Daraio and Simar’s (2005) framework to examine efficiency and productivity in truly state-contingent terms. The extended model is not only robust to outliers, but also to incorrect interpretations of uncertainty effects as efficiency effects.

Our empirical application focuses on cross-section data of arable farms in Catalonia, Spain. We conduct a novel production survey to elicit information from farmers on their ex-ante state-contingent outputs and overall production practices. Eliciting information on ex-ante state-contingent outputs is a highly complex process that can be subject to subjectivity regarding beliefs on the crop yield distribution and that might generate biased responses. Some respondents may provide answers in a rush or exaggerate their responses, hence the importance to use techniques that are robust to the presence of outliers.

Within the state-contingent framework, uncertainty is represented by a set of states of nature Ω from which nature makes a draw. Random variables in the production process can be measured as maps from the set of states Ω to the reals. Assume a single random output firm. The random output can be represented as a vector

                      from within the technology set, thus making a decision about nonstochastic inputs and stochastic outputs. After this selection has been made, nature makes a choice from s

                     Ω. For agricultural technologies, s

                     Ω is usually related to weather conditions. It is important to note that ex-post realizations of random outputs are chosen by nature, and not by the producer (Chambers et al., 2011). Our article hypothesizes that the risk that firms face in the process from selecting the ex-ante output to obtaining ex-post realized production can have an impact on technical efficiency ratings, and we capture this risk through the environmental variable. Thus, in our particular application, z
                     =
                     z(s).

Efficiency scores with which producers operate are usually approximated through the radial distance from each production unit to the production frontier. Along these lines, the Farrell–Debreu output-oriented efficiency score for a firm operating with

                      the proportionate increase in outputs that can be achieved using the same technology and input combination. Since it is unknown, an estimator of the production frontier is required. Commonly used nonparametric estimators such as the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) initiated by Farrell (1957), or the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) proposed by Deprins, Simar, and Tulkens (1984) are based on the envelopment approach, which assumes that all observed units belong to the attainable set. Nonparametric approaches do not impose restrictive parametric structures to characterize the frontier. They however rely on various assumptions on the technology. While DEA and FDH share the postulate of free disposability, scale restrictions are imposed by DEA but not by FDH, being the latter a desirable FDH property. Convexity of the technology is a postulate of DEA, but is not imposed in FDH. Desirability of the convexity property is an open question that depends on the objective of the research (Lovell & Vanden Eeckaut, 1993).

While DEA and FDH have their own strengths and weaknesses, some scholarly papers have argued that FDH provides a better data fit than DEA (Tulkens, 1993; Vanden Eeckout, Tulkens, & Jamar, 1993). DEA techniques usually outperform FDH methods when the interest of the analysis is on the structure of the production technology. In contrast, FDH usually outperforms DEA in technical efficiency measurement, because it constructs a technology that envelops the data more closely than DEA. More specifically, FDH does not include all the points on the lines connecting the vertices of the DEA frontier. Rather, it only considers DEA vertices and the free disposal hull points interior to the vertices. This implies that while DEA mechanisms compare each firm with a hypothetical efficient frontier, FDH methods define the reference point among operating firms, which increases the credibility of the method. Also, on computational grounds, FDH involves an algorithm that yields a solution that is both very simple and efficient (Lovell & Vanden Eeckaut, 1993). Our analysis stems from the FDH technology set estimator which can be expressed as

FDH efficiency estimates are very sensitive to the presence of outliers (i.e., atypical observations substantially different from the rest of the data). By definition, nonparametric estimates of the production frontier are extreme values of the dimensional space of inputs and outputs. This implies that the presence of super-efficient outliers may significantly affect the shape of the FDH frontier and efficiency computations. Cazals et al. (2002) and Daraio and Simar (2005) propose a generalized version of the FDH nonparametric approach, the order-m frontier, that is more robust to extreme observations. The method uses, as a benchmark to evaluate a firm’s performance, the expected value of the best practice among m peers randomly drawn from the population of firms that use input levels up to x. For a given input level x in the interior of the support of X, consider m i.i.d. random variables

                     Since the reference against which efficiency of a production unit is measured is the average of the best among m peers, the frontier is less extreme than the FDH. Noteworthy is the fact that the order-m efficiency score is not bounded by 1. Efficiency values greater than 1 indicate that the firm is more efficient than the average of randomly drawn m peers.

The model presented above can be extended to allow for exogenous factors that are not under the control of the firm, but that influence its performance levels. Under this setting, any random event is conditioned to Z

                      and Z. More specifically, a local linear regression method is adopted to model dependence between these two variables. Details on the nonparametric linear regression methodology can be found in Fan and Gijbels (1996).
                        2
                        While the nonparametric estimator used in this article can indeed be extended to higher order settings, these extensions are not very useful in practice due to the curse of dimensionality (Fan, 2000; Stone, 1980).

                      Such nonparametric approach allows for non-monotonic impacts of exogenous variables on efficiency levels, i.e., it allows the impacts of these variables to change depending on the level of Z.

                           Wang (2002) accounts for non-monotonic effects in the stochastic frontier approach. His approach more easily allows for incorporating multiple explanatory variables than the Daraio and Simar approach designed for the nonparametric context.

A survey of 190 farms in Catalonia specialized in the production of arable crops was conducted in 2011, prior to the growing season.
                        4
                        The survey took place from September to November 2011.
                     
                     
                        4
                      Farms were considered as specialized in arable crops if their arable crop income (cereals, oilseeds and protein crops) represented at least 80% of their global income. Data obtained from the survey included farm’s planned input use (land, crop-specific inputs, farming overheads, paid and unpaid labor, and capital). Eight input variables were defined and used in the analysis: pesticide use expressed in total liters of active ingredients (x
                     1); organic and chemical fertilizers, expressed in kilos of nitrogen (x
                     2), total land planted to arable crops (measured in hectares, x
                     3), expenses in seeds (x
                     4), energy (x
                     5) and contract work in euros (x
                     6), total quantity of paid and unpaid labor (in hours, x
                     7), as well as the capital used in the production process (expressed as the replacement value in euros, x
                     8).

Data on the ex-ante cereal, oilseed and protein crop (COP) production were also collected. The elicitation process was designed as a trade-off between complexity and accuracy of responses. While providing survey respondents with detailed information on different crop-growing scenarios may increase response accuracy, the amount of information that one should provide would make the survey too long and time-consuming, as well as too expensive. For example, by indicating the number of frost days during the growing season, one would not be projecting a detailed enough scenario, as frost days are not equally damaging during the plant growth cycle. Technicians from Unió de Pagesos, the largest farmer association in Catalonia and the group in charge of conducting the survey, recommended obtaining point estimates under bad, normal and ideal growing conditions without projecting specific scenarios.

As argued by Unió de Pagesos, yields under normal growing conditions are usually a reference to producers, who typically provide, as a response, an average yield over a sufficiently long period of time (10years approximately). Once these yields are identified, it is relatively easy for farmers to provide yield data under bad and ideal conditions. Three output variables were thus created: output under bad, normal and ideal growing conditions (y
                     1,
                     y
                     2,
                     y
                     3) and they were measured in euros, using the expected price under normal market conditions. As noted above, while the producer picks the vector (x,
                     y
                     1,
                     y
                     2,
                     y
                     3) from within the technology set, nature has the role to choose the output that is being realized ex-post. Output risk is approximated by the standard deviation of the ex-ante output (i.e., output under the different crop growing conditions) expressed on a per hectare basis. It is important to note that our data collection method provides an estimate of the farmers’ perception of the production function, and not of the actual state-contingent production function as this is not observed. A subjective estimate of the magnitude of output standard deviation is known by producers at planting time. Table 1
                      presents summary statistics for the variables of interest.

The difficulties associated to measuring ex-ante outputs are relevant. Our survey obtains these based on subjective notions that create potential for identification biases. For example, one farmer’s normal state may be another’s bad state. Difficulties inherent in obtaining accurate estimates of state-contingent yields are comparable to the hypothetical-bias problem in contingent-valuation analyses. This leads to differences in values drawn up under a hypothetical and a real setting (List & Shogren, 1998). In order to reduce this bias, calibration techniques have been proposed. Some of these techniques involve warning survey respondents about the quality of the responses. This is the case of the “cheap-talk” technique that has been shown to reduce unknowledgeable respondents’ bias (Cummings & Taylor, 1999; List, 2001), but to be less successful with experienced respondents (List, 2001; Lusk, 2003). Our respondents had 29years of experience in cultivating arable crops, and thus they can be considered as experienced. The fact that interviewers were technicians from Unió de Pagesos who know the farm well is expected to have reduced farmers’ incentives to provide biased responses.

                        Furthermore, a script informing farmers on the relevance of providing accurate responses was included in the survey.

                      order-m technical efficiency are found in Table 2
                     . The average unconditional and conditional technical efficiency scores take values of 0.84 and 0.98, respectively. This suggests, first, that producers in the sample generate 16% and 2% less output than technically feasible in the unconditional and conditional setting. Second, these results show that consideration of production risk yields higher technical efficiency scores, i.e. that risk has a positive effect on technical performance. Hence, the more risky the production environment, the higher the motivation to produce efficiently. By improving technical performance in response to a more risky production environment, farmers build up larger buffers in good states of nature and are better prepared for the bad states of nature. Hence, by improving the performance, farmers compensate for the higher risks. These results are compatible with Chambers et al. (2011) and Skevas et al. (2012) who find that higher risk levels lead to better technical performance.

                     , the efficiency ratio, over z presented in Fig. 1
                     . The marginal impact of risk on the efficiency ratio is not constant: Fig. 2
                      shows that for risk levels up to 200euros per hectare, the marginal impact of production risk on technical efficiency is positive but declining. Hence, below risk levels of 200euros per hectare an additional euro of risk increases technical efficiency, although the marginal improvement becomes smaller. However, for risk levels above 200euro per hectare, the marginal impact on performance sharply increases with risk before levelling off at the risk level of almost 500euro per hectare. This result suggests that, the higher the production risk perceived by farmers, the higher their effort to improve their technical efficiency. However, at very high risk levels, i.e. risk levels beyond 500euros per hectare, farmers do not put effort into further improving their technical efficiency. This result may imply that farmers have reached the limit of technical efficiency improvement, or concluded that further efforts into improving efficiency are not economically feasible.

                     . The average elasticity takes the value of 0.25, which implies that a 10% increase in output risk will result in a 2.5% increase in firm technical performance. As can be appreciated, there is an increase in elasticity as output risk increases, which suggests that the bigger the production risk, the greater the impact on efficiency changes. While average elasticity is 0.25, risk levels on the order of 500euros involve elasticities around to 0.9.

Conditional efficiency estimates depend on the choice of the bandwidth through the likelihood cross validation criteria as described in the methodological section. Table 3
                      presents a sensitivity analysis to the choice of the bandwidth along the lines of Daraio and Simar (2005). Conditional order-m efficiency scores are computed for h′=
                     h
                     *1.2 and h′=
                     h
                     *0.8, where h is the bandwidth determined by the data-driven method. Mean values are presented in the table. Results are remarkably stable to the bandwidth choice. While not presented in the paper, but available upon request, the shapes of Figs. 1 and 2 do not change with the bandwidth selection. Table 3 further shows sensitivity of efficiency scores to changes to the value of m (i.e., the number of random units or peers considered in the definition of the technology set). Results are robust to the change in the size of the peer group.

This article studies the influence of risk on farmers’ technical efficiency. We use nonparametric order-m efficiency scores allowing for the influence of environmental variables as proposed by Daraio and Simar (2005). While we recognize that other variables may affect efficiency ratings, the curse of dimensionality of nonparametric estimators recommends against increasing the model size. The Daraio and Simar (2005) framework is extended to examine efficiency in a state-contingent production technology. The use of the state-contingent framework to account for the stochastic conditions under which production takes place entails an improvement compared to conventional approaches. Previous research has shown that the use of the state-contingent approach leads to enhanced efficiency estimates. Results suggest that the risk perception by economic agents increases the efficiency with which they operate. More specifically, an increase in output risk on the order of 10% will result in a 2.5% increase in firm technical performance. Nonparametric regression analysis of the influence of risk on efficiency ratings indicates that, while relatively low efficiency levels motivate slow increases in efficiency, high risk levels accelerate improvements in farm performance. A direction for future extensions of this work lies in comparing our results with robust efficiency measures derived using bootstrapping techniques along the lines of Simar and Wilson (2000).
