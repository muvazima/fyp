                  The lifetime of subjects in reliability and survival analysis in the presence of several causes of failure (i.e., competing risks) has attracted attention in the literature. Most studies have simplified the computations by assuming that the causes are independent, though this does not hold. Dependent competing risks under progressively hybrid censoring condition using a Marshall–Olkin bivariate Weibull distribution is investigated. Maximum likelihood and approximated maximum likelihood estimators are developed for estimating the unknown parameters. Asymptotic distributions of the maximum likelihood estimators are used to construct approximate confidence intervals using the observed Fisher information matrix. Based on a simulation and real applications, it is illustrated that when a parametric distributional assumption is nearly true, a close approximation could be achieved by deliberately censoring the number of subjects and the study duration using Type-II progressively hybrid censoring, which might help to save time and money in research studies.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In experiments on lifetime and reliability, it is possible to consider various competing causes of failure for subjects. This problem is known as the competing risks model, which have been studied by several researchers (see for example Kalbfleish and Prentice, 1980; Lawless, 1982). Previous studies have mostly considered the causes of failure to be independent, even when the interpretation of the causes implies dependency. For example, in a study of colon cancer for which the causes of failure were cancer recurrence or death, it was obvious that such causes were dependent (see  Lin et al., 1999). Once independence between risks has been established, it is natural to consider a univariate distribution for the lifetimes; in competing risks models with dependent risks, however, it is more logical to consider a bivariate or multivariate distribution for the lifetimes. Lawless (1982) considered a bivariate competing risks model with lifetime random variables

                      and 
                        Y
                      and obtained the likelihood function as follows:

Due to the fundamental role played by the exponential distribution, many of its generalizations to bivariate (multivariate) models have been considered: e.g.,  Gumbel (1960), Freund (1961), Henrich and Jensen (1995), Marshall and Olkin (1967) and Block and Basu (1974). The Marshall–Olkin bivariate exponential (MOBE) distribution has particularly attracted attention (see  Kundu and Dey, 2009). The MOBE distribution has an exponential marginal distribution, and this is one of its major limitations: if the bivariate data does not have unimodal marginal probability density functions or if the hazard functions are not constant, it does not seem to be appropriate to fit the data. Hence, Marshall and Olkin (1967) introduced the bivariate Weibull (MOBW) distribution. It is a bivariate distribution whose flexibility arises from its shape parameter. The shape parameter allows the MOBW distribution to fit bivariate data better than the MOBE distribution. Moreover, the MOBW distribution includes the Weibull marginal distribution, leading it also to perform well when bivariate data does not have constant hazard functions or unimodal marginal distribution. The MOBW distribution consists of singular and absolute continuous parts. Due to the existence of the singular part, the pair of random variables may have equal values with positive probability. So, in a competing risks model in which the lifetime of a subject follows an MOBW distribution with a positive probability, failure for a subject may be attributable to two risks. Furthermore, an MOBW distribution has a correlation control parameter, that may be used in the case of dependent competing risks. For example, it can be used in survival analysis to model the failure time of paired organs, such as eyes, lungs, and kidneys. Such paired organs may fail one at a time or simultaneously; moreover, there are unavoidable relationships between the components of the paired organs. Also it can be used in reliability theory to model the time to failure of paired components, such as aircraft engines.

Censoring is common when testing lifetimes. Researchers have explored the censoring of data for various reasons, such as time limitation and withdrawal from treatment, among others, leading to the introduction of various types of censoring. Two well-known types of censoring are Type-I and Type-II censoring. In Type-I censoring, the termination time of the experiment is predetermined, but the number of observed failures is a random variable. In contrast with Type-I censoring, the Type-II censoring scheme pre-specifies the number of observations, whereas the termination time of the experiment is random.

Hybrid censoring can be produced by combining Type-I and Type-II censoring. Epstein (1954) first introduced hybrid censoring; it has recently become more popular, and extensive work has been performed on many variations of this type of censoring, for example, the work of Fairbanks et al. (1982), Bartholomew (1963), Barlow et al. (1968) and Chen and Bhattacharya (1988). Two types of hybrid censoring have been introduced: the Type-I hybrid (Type-I HCS) and the Type-II hybrid (Type-II HCS) censoring schemes. The Type-I HCS and Type-II HCS can be explained as follows: Suppose that, in total 
                        n
                      subjects are included in a survival experiment, with the ordered lifetimes of these subjects denoted by 
                        
                           
                              y

                        ,
                        …
                        ,

                     , respectively. In Type-I HCS, the experiment is followed until a predetermined amount of time, 
                        T
                     , has been reached or until a preselected number,

                     , out of 
                        n
                      subjects have failed. The termination time of the experiment will be

                      (see  Balakrishnan and Kundu, 2013). The main disadvantage of the Type-I HCS is that there may be few failures occurring up to the predetermined time 
                        T
                     . In the Type-II HCS, the termination time of experiment is 
                        
                           
                              T
                           
                           
                              ∗
                           
                        
                        =
                        max
                        
                           {
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 m
                              
                           
                           ,
                           T
                           }
                        
                     ; hence, at least 
                        m
                      failures would be observed up to the termination time, and more efficient inferences can be drawn (see  Childs et al., 2003).

One of the drawbacks of the conventional Type-I, Type-II and hybrid censoring schemes is that they do not allow for the removal of subjects at points other than the terminal point of the experiment, however, when subjects are highly reliable, such action might be necessary. To address this problem, Kundu and Joarder (2006) proposed the progressive hybrid censoring scheme (PHCS) and later Childs et al. (2008) introduced the Type-II PHCS. It can be described as follows: Consider a fixed constant progressive vector

In some survival studies, lifetime distributions may have heavy tails; in these cases a majority of subjects often experience failure in a much shorter period of time than the whole study duration. For example, a study might see more than 80% of failures happening in the first half of its duration, with the remaining failures occurring at long time intervals (see Fig. 1
                     ). In such a case, the cost of observing the survival failures of subjects in the last half of the study period would be very expensive.

In cases for which the cost of measurements is very high, scientists may be interested in choosing a minimum number of subjects. In large cohort studies for which the observation of failure time for subjects has a very high cost over a very long study duration, this has led to the emergence of prevalence versus incidence studies. However, prevalence studies have their own technical and theoretical difficulties because of length-biased sampling. On the other hand, cutting the study off at the predetermined time (i.e., Type-I censoring) may capture a small number of observed failures, or in the case of observing only 
                        m
                        <
                        n
                      failure instances (i.e., Type-II censoring), the inferences about survival time would be limited to the smallest survival time which might contribute to bias in the inference.

To address this problem, one can propose using the Type-II PHCS, which reduces the time (see Fig. 2
                     ) and cost of the study and may lead to collecting diverse measurements on the lifetime of the subjects. Through simulation and realistic application, this paper tries to illustrate how approximately similar results can be achieved by deliberately censoring the number of subjects and study times using Type-II PHCS in the case of dependent competing risks, when the lifetimes follow an MOBW distribution. Upon providing likelihood functions, the MLE’s of the shape parameter are obtained by solving an equation, using an iterative method. The other scale parameters have explicit forms based on this shape parameter. The exact distributions of the MLE’s are complicated, so by using the asymptotic distributions of the MLE’s, we succeed in constructing confidence intervals.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section  2, we describe MOBW distribution and its properties; the data description is also provided in the section. The MLE’s and AMLE’s of the parameters under dependent competing risks and Type-II PHCS are presented in Section  3. The observed Fisher information matrix and some asymptotic inferences are provided in Section  4. In Section  5, the data analysis and simulation are described. Finally, we present two applications of this approach in Section  6.

                     . For the MOBW distribution, we consider the case that at least one subject fails by one or both risks. Then, by using (3) and (4) and the definition of a Type-II PHCS, the likelihood function based on the observed dataset in case I can be expressed as follows:

In this section, the observed Fisher information matrix of the MLEs is computed. Then, using the inverse of the information matrix, the confidence intervals and test statistics can be constructed for unknown parameters based on the asymptotic property of MLEs. The observed Fisher information matrix is denoted by

All of the simulations were performed in R program using 5000 replications. The results of the schemes are reported in Table 1
                      through (6). Average bias, average MSE and CI based on MLEs and AMLEs are reported in each table. We can examine the effects of the schemes based on two different points of view. First, we divide these schemes into two sets:

Summarizing from all of the tables, it can be observed that an increase in 
                        T
                      implies decreases in the average biases and the average MSEs, consequently creating CIs of shorter lengths. These results are completely understandable because larger 
                        T
                      implies an increase in the number of observations. Additionally, if all of the cases have positive biases, then we have overestimation in all situations. Another remarkable issue, is that all of the average biases and MSEs based on AMLEs provide reasonable approximations. Moreover, all of the average CIs based on the MLEs or AMLEs contain the true values of the parameters

For illustrative purposes, two examples are used to describe how the MOBW distribution can be applied to make inferences about lifetime under two dependent competing risks, and how a Type-II progressively hybrid censored sample can yield approximately near results as the whole sample.

The modified data comes from the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) conducted by the National Eye Institute to estimate the effect of laser treatment in delaying the onset of blindness in patients with diabetic retinopathy. At the beginning of the study, for each patient, one eye was randomly selected for laser treatment and the other eye was given no treatment. For each patient the minimum time to blindness (

                        . In the onset of retinopathy, the effect of laser on delaying the time to blindness of the patients suffering from diabetes is not evident, so treatment or lack of treatment can be regarded as the causes of blindness; hence a case of competing risks data. Obviously time to blindness of two eyes are dependent and some ties occurred (for 10 out of 71 patients with index

The original data are divided by 365 and computed in terms of year. To evaluate the effect of a Type-II PHCS, the estimations based on the complete data are first computed, and as mentioned earlier, this is a special case of the Type-II PHCS, with

                           Y
                         that show the minimum time to blindness, based on the complete data (solid line), a Type-II PHCS sample (dotted line) and the Kaplan–Meier (KM) estimator, for schemes 1 and 2 and 
                           T

                           2.5
                        . As can be observed in these plots, the estimation of survival functions under the Type-II PHCS display very good concordance between the estimated survival functions and the Kaplan–Meier estimations using complete data. The best agreement occurs for 
                           T

                         and scheme 1. This agreement indicates that despite heavily censoring (by more than 50%) of the study’s duration or number of subjects, the estimated survival function nevertheless closely approximates the Kaplan–Meier estimation based on the complete data.

The dataset consists of 506 patients with prostatic cancer, originally reported by Byar and Green (1980) and reproduced in Andrews and Herzberg (1985). In this application, the dataset is restricted to 181 patients with only three causes of death; prostatic cancer (125 patients), cerebrovascular (29 patients) and other causes (27 patients). Two group of causes as (1) Prostatic cancer or other causes and (2) Cerebrovascular or other causes, are considered as two interest risks. Obviously in this case, the risks are dependent because when the cause of death is other causes, both the two risks occur simultaneously; hence the MOBW distribution is a plausible candidate. This kind of grouping the causes, enable researchers to compare the risk of death under all causes except cerebrovascular with all causes except prostatic cancer. Here, the dataset
