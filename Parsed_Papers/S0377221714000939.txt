                  The aim of synthetic biology is to confer novel functions to cells by rationally interconnecting basic genetic parts into circuits. A key barrier in the design of synthetic genetic circuits is that only a qualitative description of the performance and interactions of the basic genetic parts is available in databases such as the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Modeling approaches capable of harnessing this qualitative knowledge are thus timely. Here, we introduce an optimization-based framework, which makes use of the available qualitative information about basic biological parts to automatically identify the circuit elements and structures enabling a desired response to the presence/absence of input signals. Promoters and ribosome binding sites are categorized as high, medium or low efficiency and protein expressions in the circuit are described using piecewise linear differential equations. The desired function of the circuit is also mathematically described as the maximization/minimization of a constrained objective function. We employed this framework for the design of a toggle switch, a genetic decoder and a genetic half adder unit. The identified designs are consistent with previously constructed circuit configurations and in some cases point to completely new architectures. The identified non-intuitive circuit structures highlight the importance of accounting for ribosome binding site efficiencies and relative protein abundance levels in circuit design. Our results reaffirm the usefulness of the qualitative information for the coarse-grained genetic circuit design and simulation in the absence of detailed quantitative information.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Synthetic biology aims to combine engineering principles and molecular biology to design and construct biological systems with novel functions that cannot be found in nature. This is achieved by interconnecting basic biological parts into more complex modules and systems bringing about the desired functionality (i.e., synthetic genetic circuits) and subsequently transferring them into the cells. The pioneering efforts in this direction were the design and experimental construction of two fundamental synthetic genetic circuits namely the toggle switch (Gardner, Cantor, & Collins, 2000) and the repressilator (Elowitz & Leibler, 2000). The genetic toggle switch is a synthetic bistable gene-regulatory network (Gardner et al., 2000), whereas the repressilator is an oscillating network that periodically induces the synthesis of a fluorescent protein (Elowitz & Leibler, 2000). Several other researchers used these foundations to construct similar toggle switches in Escherichia coli (Atkinson, Savageau, Myers, & Ninfa, 2003) and mammalian cells (Kramer, Fischer, & Fussenegger, 2004), synchronized relaxation oscillators (McMillen, Kopell, Hasty, & Collins, 2002), a synthetic gene-metabolic oscillator (Fung et al., 2005), a synthetic genetic edge detection program (Tabor et al., 2009) and many others (Kim & Winfree, 2011; Levskaya et al., 2005; Moon, Lou, Tamsir, Stanton, & Voigt, 2012; Purcell, Savery, Grierson, & di Bernardo, 2010; Stanton et al., 2013). There have been also other efforts for constructing synthetic cell–cell communication circuits (Basu, Gerchman, Collins, Arnold, & Weiss, 2005; Brenner, Karig, Weiss, & Arnold, 2007; Choi, Ha, Park, & Kim, 2011; Song, Payne, Tan, & You, 2011).

Synthetic genetic circuits were shown to have potential applications in many different areas ranging from metabolic engineering and biofuel production to drug discovery, medicine and bio-sensing (Anderson, Clarke, Arkin, & Voigt, 2006; Chen & Weiss, 2005; Dellomonaco, Fava, & Gonzalez, 2010; Medema, Breitling, Bovenberg, & Takano, 2011; Neumann & Neumann-Staubitz, 2010; Shen & Liao, 2011; Xie, Wroblewska, Prochazka, Weiss, & Benenson, 2011). For example, Chen and Weiss (2005) designed a synthetic cell–cell communication system in yeast that can eliminate the need for monitoring of the fermentation processes and the control of gene expression through addition of expensive inducers (Andrianantoandro, Basu, Karig, & Weiss, 2006). Applications of synthetic biology in metabolic engineering is concerned with designing novel and synthetic genetic and metabolic circuits redirecting carbon flow toward the product of interest such as biofuels. For example, Shen and Liao (2011) constructed a synthetic iterative pathway in E. coli for 2-ketoacid elongation. In a more recent study Zhang, Carothers, and Keasling (2012) developed a dynamic sensor-regulator system for biodiesel production in E. coli. Potential applications of synthetic biology in medicine were also demonstrated by engineering the interaction between bacteria and mammalian cells to enable E. coli to invade specific cancer-derived cells (Anderson et al., 2006). In another study, Xie et al. (2011) engineered a synthetic genetic circuit capable of triggering the cell death upon the detection of the cancerous gene expression patterns while leaving the non-cancerous cells unharmed. The ever-increasing applications of synthetic genetic circuits spurred the construction of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (http://partsregistry.org/) in an effort toward the compilation and standardization of the building blocks of these circuits. This registry is a collection of various basic genetic components (i.e., biobricks) such as promoters (regulatory regions), protein coding regions and ribosome binding sites (RBSs), as well as composite parts such as logic gates. The development of this database has enabled the design and construction of new integrated genetic circuits through the assembly of standardized interchangeable biological parts in analogy to the use of parts in electrical circuits.

In line with these rapid developments in the standardization, experimental construction and applications of synthetic genetic circuits, development of new computational and modeling procedures to assist the design process and verify the behavior of the genetic circuits prior to their experimental implementation is an absolute necessity. A number of previous studies aimed to address this need (Chandran, Bergmann, & Sauro, 2009; Chandran, Bergmann, & Sauro, 2010; Chandran & Sauro, 2012; Marchisio & Stelling, 2008, 2011; Weeding, Houle, & Kaznessis, 2010). For example, Marchisio and Stelling (2008) proposed a framework to simulate the behavior of synthetic genetic circuits with ‘composable’ parts using ordinary differential equations, where different parts can be inter-connected through exchange of common signal carriers such as polymerases per second (PoPS) and ribosomes per second (RiPS). In a subsequent study, the same researchers combined this approach with the so-called Karnaugh map for the design of electrical circuits to automate the design of digital biological circuits (Marchisio & Stelling, 2011). Weeding et al. (2010) also introduced a software tool called SynBioSS designer for the quantitative simulation of biological circuits, which takes as input the list of components in a given circuit (e.g., biobricks from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts) and automatically generates a kinetic model of biological interactions involved. In addition, following the successful application of operations research and optimization-based techniques in medicine and biology, and in particular, for the analysis of natural gene regulatory networks (Cordone & Lulli, 2013; Dasika, Gupta, & Maranas, 2004, 2005; Gerhard-Wilhelm, Kropat, Akteke-Öztürk, & Görgülü, 2009; Kergosien, Tournamille, Laurence, & Billaut, 2011; Liu, Chen, & Chen, 2013; Mazier, Billaut, & Tournamille, 2010; Palafox, Noman, & Iba, 2013; Yang, Maguire, Yarmush, & Androulakis, 2008), a few efforts have been made toward using these techniques for the optimal design of synthetic genetic circuits. For example, Dasika and Maranas (2008) introduced OptCircuit, a mixed-integer nonlinear dynamic optimization framework that relies on the availability of kinetic parameters describing the function and interaction of circuit components to identify the required circuit elements and the structure that fulfill a pre-specified task. A customized outer-approximation method was used in this study to bracket the optimal solution of this dynamic optimization problem (Dasika & Maranas, 2008). In a more recent study Huynh, Kececioglu, Koppe, and Tagkopoulos (2012) used a linear approximation of the nonlinear terms around a desired steady-state to solve the mixed-integer dynamic optimization problem of the circuit design more efficiently.

Despite these efforts, a key roadblock in the comprehensive utilization of the basic parts available in databases such as the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and elsewhere is that, in contrast to electronic circuits, biological components largely lack quantitative information characterizing their function and interactions. Instead, only a qualitative description of basic parameters of the biobricks and the interactions among them is usually available. This is due to not only the imprecise understanding of their function but more fundamentally due to the context-specific nature of their action. For example, only a qualitative description (low/medium/high) of promoter strength or efficiency of RBS and only descriptive information about the interaction between regulatory proteins and promoters, or ligands and regulatory proteins is available in this registry. Given this qualitative description of the basic part characteristics, a key question is how to systematically assemble these components into complex circuits with desired responses to various external stimuli. Computational approaches to tackle this question are still nonexistent. To fill this gap, here we introduce an optimization-based framework combined with a piecewise-linear differential equation (De Jong et al., 2004; Glass, 1975; Glass & Kauffman, 1973) description of protein expression for identifying the circuit elements and structure(s) to meet a user-specified functionality. We applied this framework to a variety of applications including the design of a toggle switch, a 2–4 bit genetic decoder (a circuit that detects the presence/absence of two external biological signals) and a 1-bit genetic half adder unit. Some of the identified circuits are consistent with previously constructed circuits, whereas some are novel non-intuitive structures.

DNA is a large biological molecule with a double helix structure carrying inherited information, whereas genes are functional segments of the DNA coding for proteins. Proteins are large chains of amino acids considered as the most fundamental functional units in a cell performing a wide range of biological functions such as catalyzing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, gene expression regulation, transferring molecules to and from the cell and many more. Gene expression is the process of synthesizing a functional protein by decoding the genetic information in the respective gene and is composed of two fundamental processes, namely, transcription and translation. Transcription uses a specific gene on DNA as a template to produce a single-stranded molecule, called messenger RNA (mRNA). This is followed by translation, which involves the conversion of genetic instructions encoded by mRNA into amino acids and chaining amino acids together in a specific order (using a biological machine called ribosome) to synthesize the protein (Gene→mRNA→protein). Ribosome binding site (RBS) is a sequence on mRNA that binds to ribosome when initiating protein translation.

Cells respond to any environmental stimulus, such as the presence of a specific compound in the growth medium through regulating the gene expression events. Gene expression regulation can occur at transcription, translation or post-translation levels (Palsson, 2006). However, in this study we only focus on transcriptional regulation, which is the primary regulatory mechanism used by cells. Transcriptional regulation is performed by a class of regulatory proteins called transcription factors (TFs), which can activate or repress transcription of the respective genes. TFs regulate transcription through interacting with (e.g., binding to) promoters, a region of DNA located next to the genes. In addition, the activity of these regulatory proteins can be modulated (i.e., disabled or activated) through interaction with (e.g., binding to) ligands – small molecules in the growth medium that can diffuse into the cell and serve as a biological signal. The impact of transcriptional regulation can be to switch on or off, or to increase (up-regulate), or decrease (down-regulate) the transcription of a particular gene, and as a result, altered levels of mRNA inside the cell. This will in turn leads to the altered abundance of proteins and their activity thereby leading to a new state, or a new behavior of the cell in response to the stimuli.

Thousands of genes and their products (proteins) in the cell, form a complex and large network of interactions, referred to as ‘gene regulatory networks’ (Palsson, 2006), in which the product of a gene can positively or negatively affect the transcription of other genes. Reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks is concerned with uncovering the existing regulatory processes and interactions in a given microorganism, whereas their forward engineering, which is the focus of synthetic biology, aims to rationally assemble various biological parts (e.g., promoters, protein coding regions, RBSs, terminators, etc.) into regulatory circuits in order to confer cells novel functionalities that cannot be found in nature. Synthetic biology has opened up many new avenues, where the operations research techniques can play a pivotal role, an example of which is the focus of this study.

@&#METHODS@&#

The basic constitutive components of a genetic circuit (biobricks) are promoters (or regulatory regions), ribosome binding sites (RBSs) and protein coding regions. Qualitative information about the efficacy of each of these biobricks and interactions among them is available in databases such as the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (see Table 1
                         for a summary). Promoter strength and RBS efficiency determine the level of transcription and translation, respectively, and thus have direct impact on the synthesized protein levels. Other data available in this registry include the ON/OFF state of promoters in their normal state (i.e., in the absence of any active regulatory proteins), the interaction of regulatory proteins and promoters, and finally the interaction of ligands and regulatory proteins. All possible gene expression outcomes considering the three latter parameters are summarized in Fig. 1
                        . This figure serves as the main basis for developing our design equations. Next, we define a set of parameters to mathematically capture the impact of each type of the biobrick and the interactions among them on the protein expression in a circuit. To this end, the following sets are defined:
                           
                              
                                 P
                                 =Set of promoters,


                                 J
                                 =Set of protein coding regions,


                                 R
                                 =Set of RBSs,


                                 L
                                 =Set of ligands,

                                 =Set of time points.

Based on the available qualitative information about the biobricks as summarized in Table 1, promoters are categorized as high, medium and low strength and similarly RBSs as high, medium and low efficiency. In accordance, the following parameters are defined to describe the function and efficacy of promoters and RBSs:

                           A simplifying assumption, here, is that the effect of an active repressor protein on a promoter p is to completely stop transcription from that promoter irrespective of the strength of promoter or the presence of an inducer ligand, i.e., we do not consider possible leakiness of promoters (see Fig. 1c, j, g and n). Also, the effect of an active activator protein on a promoter p whose normal state is ON is to increase transcription from that promoter (see Fig. 1i and m).

There can be two different outcomes for the effect of ligands on regulatory proteins. In the first case, a regulatory protein can perform its biological function (transcriptional activation or repression) without a need for a ligand (see Fig. 1b–d and i–k). Some ligands can, however, disable the regulatory protein in this case (see Fig. 1d and k). For the second case, the regulatory protein requires the presence of a ligand to be activated (e.g., by binding to it) so as to perform its regulatory role as a transcriptional activator or repressor (see Fig. 1e–g and l–n). All these cases for the interaction of a ligand l and a regulatory protein j are accounted for in the definition of parameter

                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                              
                            as given in Fig. 2
                           . Note that when a ligand is denoted as present, its concentration in the extracellular environment is assumed to be high enough to affect the function of the regulatory protein. A regulatory protein is defined as active if (i) the protein is in a form (either bonded to an inducing ligand or alone in the absence of any inhibiting ligands) such that it is capable of performing its biological function, (ii) its concentration is above a threshold necessary to exert its regulatory effect. The combinatorial effect of ligands and regulatory proteins on transcription from a promoter under control is thus condensed into the definition of ‘active’ regulatory proteins.

A class of piecewise linear differential equations, which was originally proposed by Glass (1975) and Glass and Kauffman (1973) to provide a coarse-grained description of gene regulatory networks (De Jong et al., 2004) is adapted here to describe interactions in synthetic gene circuits using the qualitative information about the biobricks. This model combines logic rules for the regulation of genes and synthesis of their products with (linear) free decay (Chaves, Sontag, & Albert, 2006). For each node one continuous and one discrete (Boolean) variable are defined. The continuous variable, Cjt
                        , is a proxy for concentration of the product (protein) of gene j at time t and the binary variable, Yjt
                        , represents whether an activation (or switching) threshold, θ, is reached at time t:

                        where Ts
                         is the time required to reach steady-state. This class of piecewise linear differential equations was previously used to model and study gene regulatory networks (De Jong et al., 2004; Farcot & Gouze, 2010; Gebert, Radde, & Weber, 2007; Machina & Ponosov, 2011a, 2011b) as well as to study the evolution of complex dynamics in electronic models of synthetic genetic circuits (Mason, Linsay, Collins, & Glass, 2004). We modified Eqs. (2) and (3) to describe the relative protein abundance levels in the presence of a ligand l consistent with the qualitative information about the basic biological parts. All relevant variables appearing in the piecewise linear differential equations are flagged using subscript l to denote the effect of ligand l and/or indices p and r to account for the effect of promoters and RBSs, respectively.

The steady-state relative abundance level of protein j produced from different promoters and RBSs in a circuit in the presence of a ligand l, Cjl
                        , is defined as follows by modifying Eq. (2):

                         is a modified form of Gj
                         (see Eq. (2)), denoting the production level of protein j from promoter p and RBS r in the presence of a ligand l (the superscript ‘ss’ representing steady state is dropped for the simplicity of notations). It is important to note that Cjl
                         in this equation is not the exact protein concentration but is a proxy entry that reflects its relative abundance.

The key assumption in defining Gjprl
                         is that the total protein expression level accruing from a particular promoter p and RBS r is determined by the additive effect of promoter strength and RBS efficiency (i.e., Sp
                        
                        +
                        ηr
                        ). The relative protein abundance levels thus assume non-negative integer values indicative of their relative abundance and are interpreted as follows based on Fig. 3

                        A high relative protein abundance level (which corresponds to a value of five) is assumed to be the activation threshold (θ) for all regulatory proteins to be capable of performing their regulatory function. It should be noted that these definitions are arbitrary and one may interpret the relative protein abundance levels differently or define a different activation threshold, however, this does not affect the generality of our procedure. The activation threshold θ, is modeled by redefining binary variable Yjt

                        These equations can be readily adjusted for the cases where the presence of more than one protein is required to control transcription from a specific promoter (see Supplementary material for details). Therefore, definition of the protein generation term, Gjprl
                         in Eq. (6), captures all gene expression outcomes summarized in Fig. 1 in line with the available qualitative information about the circuit components.

                        Equivalently, if one is interested in a qualitative (and not exact) interpretation of the dynamic behavior of a circuit, this can be easily done by extending Eq. (3) in the same manner and adding a subscript t representing the value of variables at a specific time instant to all variables defined above.

Using an optimization-based approach to design synthetic genetic circuits requires the selection of an objective function whose maximization (or minimization) captures the desired circuit behavior in the presence or absence of biological signals (i.e., ligands). This is accomplished through the maximization of the sum of the relative abundance levels of a set of desired proteins (usually reporters, which are fluorescent proteins with a specific color) only in the presence of certain ligands:

                         is the steady-state relative abundance level of the desired proteins in the presence of a ligand ld
                        . In most cases the desired circuit response also requires simultaneously negating the level of some undesired (reporter) proteins. This can be also enforced through adding appropriate constraints to the optimization problem. As an example if a circuit should produce only green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the presence of ligand l
                        1 and only yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in presence of ligand l
                        2, this can be modeled as follows:

                        Eq. (12) indicates that the relative abundance levels of all undesired (reporter) proteins in the presence of a desired ligand should be zero (Jund
                         is the set of all undesired proteins). Constraint (13) is combination of equations (6) and (9) and describes the basic design equation. Constraints (15) and (16) impose an upper limit on the number of times a promoter can be used and the number of times a protein can be expressed in a circuit, respectively. Similarly, Eq. (17) imposes the desired complexity of the circuit by restricting the total number of promoter-RBS-protein triplets in the circuit to be no more than a pre-specified value,

This bilinear term can be linearized using the available standard techniques (e.g., see equation S.1 in Supplementary material), thereby converting the optimization problem to an integer linear program (ILP). All optimization problems in this study were solved using the GAMS/IBM ILOG CPLEX (version 9.1) solver.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

We employed the proposed computational framework for the design of a number of circuits including a toggle switch, a genetic decoder (a circuit that detects the absence/presence of multiple ligands), and a genetic half adder (a circuit that adds two one-digit genetic binary variables). Available promoters and regulatory protein coding regions in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts were regarded as possible candidates for the design of these circuits, whereas only three typical (low, medium and high efficiency) RBSs are considered as our design framework deals only with the efficiency of RBSs. The list of all components appeared in the identified circuit structures along with their characteristics and interaction information extracted from the registry is given in Tables 2–4
                     
                     
                     .

In the first case study, we address the design of a genetic toggle switch, which produces green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the presence of IPTG (isopropylthiogalactoside) but not in the presence of aTc (anhydortetracyclin). The identified network configurations with different complexities are shown in Fig. 4
                        . The simplest identified circuit (Fig. 4a) contains only two promoter-RBS-protein triplets, where GFP is placed under the control of P
                        Lac and LacI is expressed from a (typical) strong constitutive promoter Pc
                        . When IPTG is present LacI is not able to repress transcription from P
                        Lac and GFP is thus freely expressed. On the other hand, when aTc is present, LacI can repress expression of GFP from P
                        Lac since aTc has no effect on the function of LacI (see Table 3). We note that even though this circuit is viable mathematical solution, it does not address the memory aspect of a toggle switch and we thus explored more complex circuit designs. By allowing for up to three promoter-RBS-protein triplets tetR is added to the circuit under the control of P
                        Lac while LacI is expressed from the repressible promoter P
                        Tet instead of a constitutive promoter (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, this circuit configuration is the same as that of the well-known toggle switch (Gardner et al., 2000), and also that obtained by OptCircuit using kinetic equations (Dasika & Maranas, 2008).

The effect of increasing the complexity of the circuit by allowing for as many as four and five promoter-RBS-protein triplets is also shown in Fig. 4c and d. As one can see in these figures, starting from the simplest circuit structure given in Fig. 4a the effect of increasing the complexity of the network is to add extra regulatory proteins and promoters under their control in a cascade structure. The behavior of the cascades in genetic circuits has been investigated before by Hooshangi, Thiberge, & Weiss, 2005, where it was reported that the switching behavior becomes sharper for longer cascades. Therefore, increasing the complexity of this circuit provides the opportunity to get closer to a step-like behavior, which is desirable in most switching applications.

We note that the majority of the RBSs that were chosen in the suggested circuit structures were high efficiency RBS (i.e., RBS3). This is expected as the activation threshold for regulatory proteins was chosen to be the high relative abundance of protein and since each protein was restricted to be produced under the control of only a single promoter.

Next, we investigate the capability of the proposed approach to design a more complex genetic circuit, which is equivalent to a 2–4 bit digital decoder. A digital decoder is a multiple-input and output logic device that converts input signals into coded outputs (see Table 5
                        a). The corresponding genetic decoder considered here should produce different types of reporter proteins in response to the presence/absence of two sugars glucose and l-arabinose (see Table 5b). A more detailed description of this circuit and a number of designs using a kinetic description of interactions (without considering RBSs) was suggested previously by Dasika and Maranas (2008), where all circuit structures were identified by starting from a seed circuit that produces YFP in the absence of glucose and presence of l-arabinose in a feed-forward structure (see Fig. 5
                        a).

Using the design framework presented in this study, we identified a number of circuit structures involving a minimum of 12 promoter-RBS-protein triplets. One such circuit design starting from the seed circuit is depicted in Fig. 5b. Interestingly, regardless of the type of RBSs used, this circuit has the same configuration as the one obtained using kinetic information (Dasika & Maranas, 2008). It should be noted that the design framework of Dasika and Maranas (2008) is based only on the protein-promoter interactions and does not incorporate the impact of RBSs. In addition, in contrast to (Dasika & Maranas, 2008), where circuit elements were successively added to the seed circuit in a ‘stepwise’ procedure to cope with the computational complexity of the associated non-convex optimization problem, here we identify all the required circuit components in a single step. This is mainly due to the absence of nonlinearities associated with kinetic models in our design framework (i.e., a linear integer program vs. a nonlinear and non-convex mixed-integer program). The proposed formalism was also able to suggest alternative designs without starting from the seed circuit as depicted in Fig. 5c. In both these suggested circuit structures (see Fig. 5b and c), CRP and AraC expressed from a typical strong constitutive promoter (Pc
                        ) act as the input sensors of the circuit that are affected directly by the presence or absence of glucose and l-arabinose, respectively. The effects of the presence or absence of these two signals are then propagated in other parts of the circuit through the interaction of CRP and AraC with P
                        BAD, P
                        Ara and P
                        Lac promoters so as the expression of a fluorescent protein in a specific condition is accompanied with the expression of appropriate repressor proteins to inhibit the production of the other three fluorescent proteins.

We note that the two suggested circuit structures given in Fig. 5b and c are consistent with a pure binary logic description of regulatory protein-promoter interactions. However, this is not always the case when more than the minimal number of the required components (i.e., 12 promoter-RBS-protein triplets) is used for the circuit design. For example, in the identified circuit shown in Fig. 5d (with 13 promoter-RBS-protein triplets) tetR is expressed from a strong constitutive promoter (Pc
                        ) and hence a binary logic interpretation of regulation would imply that GFP (which is under the control of P
                        tet) should never be expressed (see Table 2). Nonetheless this circuit structure was deemed functional as the imposed definition of an ‘active’ regulatory protein accounts for not only the presence/absence of that regulatory protein, but also for its relative abundance level, which is a function of both promoter strength and the efficiency of RBSs. Note that even though tetR is expressed from a strong constitutive promoter, Pc
                        , only a low efficiency RBS (i.e., RBS1) contributes to the expression of tetR from this promoter. In addition to Pc
                        , tetR is also expressed from P
                        Ara and P
                        Lac with a medium-level efficiency RBS (i.e., RBS2). When only glucose is present in the environment, tetR is not expressed from P
                        Ara and P
                        Lac (see Tables 2 and 3) and the relative abundance level of tetR (produced only from promoter Pc
                         with a low efficiency RBS) does not meet the specified activation threshold (i.e., 3+1<5) to repress P
                        tet and hence GFP can be freely expressed from P
                        tet. Alternatively, when both glucose and l-arabinose are present, even though the expression of tetR from P
                        Lac is inhibited, the combined relative abundance levels of tetR produced from Pc
                         and P
                        Ara promoters are sufficient to satisfy the activation threshold and repress expression of GFP from P
                        tet. A similar scenario occurs when neither glucose nor l-arabinose is present. These non-intuitive circuit interactions provide additional flexibility in the construction of genetic circuits by choosing different types of RBSs or promoters that might be interconnected more easily.

Here, we employ our proposed framework for the design of a genetic circuit, which is equivalent to a 1-bit half adder unit. Half adders are building blocks of full adders, which serve as the essential components of Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU), one of the fundamental building blocks of any CPU. A digital half adder takes two 1-digit binary inputs, adds them and generates a 2-bit output containing a binary sum and a carry out. The truth table for this circuit is given in Table 6
                        a. A digital half-adder can be implemented simply by using two AND and XOR gates as depicted in Fig. 6
                        a. The corresponding 1-bit genetic half adder postulated here accepts Glucose and l-arabinose as input signals such that the absence or presence of each of these two sugars can be interpreted as a 0 or 1 input, respectively. This genetic circuit should produce YFP (as the binary sum) when only one ligand is present and GFP (as carry out) when both of them are present. In addition, neither YFP nor GFP should be produced when both ligands are absent. The truth table of this genetic circuit is given in Table 6b.

We were able to identify designs of varying complexities for this genetic half adder. In particular, by allowing for up to eight promoter-RBS-protein triplets, we identified a circuit, which is able to satisfy the targeted behavior in response to input signals only with a specific set of non-zero initial concentrations for a number of regulatory proteins in the circuit (not a desirable design. See Supplementary material for details). We note that these undesirable non-intuitive circuit designs may indicate that no circuit structure with the specified level of complexity can satisfy the specified function for any initial protein concentrations. Hence, one can address this issue by re-designing the circuit and allowing for higher complexities. For the genetic half adder in this example, we were able to identify an alternative circuit structure with a global steady state behavior by increasing the circuit complexity and allowing for as many as nine promoter-RBS-protein triplets. The suggested design is depicted in Fig. 6b. Notably, the structure of this circuit is consistent with the binary logic for protein-promoter interactions and its response is independent of initial protein concentrations and is only a function of the input signals. Compared to the equivalent digital half adder, which is simply composed of two AND and XOR gates (Fig. 6a), the identified circuit in Fig. 6b is more complex. The main reason for this observation is that we did not consider any composite parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts in our simulations and furthermore there were no composite part available in this registry that can simulate the behavior of AND and XOR gates with Glucose and l-arabinose as inputs. Therefore, one has to combine the available basic parts in such a way that they simulate the behavior of these two logic gates. The logic diagram corresponding to the genetic circuit in Fig. 6b is demonstrated in Fig. 6c. We can see that P
                        Lac, P
                        BAD, P
                        Ara and Pλ
                         act as an XOR gate with Glucose and l-arabinose as inputs and YFP as the output, whereas P
                        Lac, P
                        tet, P
                        Ara and Pλ
                         mimic the behavior of an AND gate with Glucose and l-arabinose as inputs and GFP as the output.

Notably, design of a similar half adder circuit with light and a chemical signal as inputs has been reported before (Terzer et al., 2007), however in that study new parts were constructed experimentally to enforce the behavior of biological XOR and AND gates with desired inputs. Our design framework on the other hand is capable of choosing and assembling the available basic components from a given list into a structure that mimics the behavior of required logic gates to meet the desired functionality. This feature provides the opportunity for using the available well-characterized parts and as an alternative to the experimental construction of new logic devices for a desired circuit function.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we put forth an optimization-based framework for the coarse-grained design of synthetic genetic circuits using only a qualitative description of the basic parts characteristics and interactions thereof. Despite relying only on qualitative information, the identified designs were consistent with previously constructed genetic circuits and/or the ones obtained using kinetic information. In addition, avoiding the nonlinearities associated with kinetic models in our framework led to significant savings in computational resources as was demonstrated for the genetic decoder example. Even though the dynamic modeling of synthetic genetic circuits was not the focus of this study, the time-varying formulations suggested here enables one to simulate the relative temporal behaviors of a given circuit under any conditions without a need for kinetic and/or thermodynamic information. Although qualitative in nature, Boolean and piecewise linear models have been proven successful in gaining a rough insight into the dynamic behavior of biological systems (such as gene regulatory and signal transduction networks) when no detailed quantitative and/or kinetic information is available (Albert & Othmer, 2003; Chaves & Gouze, 2011; Chaves et al., 2006; De Jong et al., 2004; Farcot & Gouze, 2010; Faure, Naldi, Chaouiya, & Thieffry, 2006; Saadatpour, Albert, & Albert, 2010; Saadatpour, Albert, & Reluga, 2013; Saadatpour et al., 2011; Thakar, Saadatpour-Moghaddam, Harvill, & Albert, 2009).

In contrast to some of the previous computational design procedures for synthetic genetic circuits (Dasika & Maranas, 2008; Francois & Hakim, 2004; Rodrigo, Carrera, & Jaramillo, 2007), which consider only promoters and protein coding regions, here we also take into account the effect of ribosome binding sites and their efficiency on the final protein production levels. In addition, even though relying on a discrete model of protein production, we consider not only the presence or absence of regulatory proteins but also their relative abundance levels in the circuit. As demonstrated for design of the genetic decoder, accounting for the role of ribosome binding sites and the relative protein abundance levels in our design procedure led to identification of non-intuitive circuit structures, which are not fathomable using only a binary logic description for protein-promoter interactions.

It is important to note that the efficacy of the design framework proposed here is contingent upon the qualitative description of the basic biological parts. For example, here we ignored the promoter’s leakiness, which might affect the circuit function under experimental conditions. Furthermore, while the assumption that the protein expression level originated from a specific promoter and RBS is governed by the additive effect of promoter strength and RBS efficiency is not a non-realistic one, it might not be always true given the stochasticity and nonlinearity of underlying biological systems. We also assumed that when a ligand is denoted as present, its concentration is high enough to affect the regulatory proteins. This implies that our framework is not able to capture the deviations of model predictions from the actual behavior of the circuit in response to variations in the ligand concentrations under experimental conditions. In addition, we ignored in our design equations the translational regulation, which can be an important factor when constructing the circuit experimentally. Given these limitations, the alternative circuit structures suggested by this framework should be deemed as coarse-grained starting point designs, which may need further refinement through experimental tuning or by more detailed and quantitative modeling (Dasika & Maranas, 2008; Feng et al., 2004; Salis, Mirsky, & Voigt, 2009; Zhang, Dempsey, & Goutsias, 2009).

While some of the limitations stated above are rather intrinsic features of a discreet and qualitative modeling formalism and a result of very limited information used for the circuit design, some others can be readily addressed by straightforward adjustments to the suggested procedure to provide more accurate designs. For example, one can modify the design equations to incorporate the available composite parts (in addition to basic parts) from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and/or to account for the translational regulation. One can also define an activation threshold for ligands, similarly to that defined for regulatory proteins in order to account for their relative concentrations. Overall, the proposed approach establishes a starting framework for fully utilizing the qualitative information available in databases such as the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and identifying circuit designs that can be successively improved.

Despite the use of operations research and optimization based techniques for the analysis of gene expression data and reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks in the past decade (Defterli, Fugenschuh, & Weber, 2011; Gebert, Latsch, Pickl, Weber, & Wunschiers, 2006; Oktem, 2005; Radde, 2008, 2010; Radde, Bar, & Banaji, 2010; Ugur, Pickl, Weber, & Wunschiers, 2009; Weber, Defterli, Gok, & Kropat, 2011; Weber, Kropat, Akteke-Ozturk, & Gorgulu, 2009; Weber, Kropat, Tezel, & Belen, 2010; Weber, Tezel, Taylan, Soyler, & Cetin, 2008), their applicability for the forward engineering problem has not been well explored even tough both forward and reverse engineering problems follow the same biological principles for the control of gene expression. This study opens up new avenues for the novel applications of operations research techniques in the emerging field of synthetic biology. In addition to the applicability of the linear models as demonstrated in this study, nonlinearity, stochasticity and 0–1 decision making, which are intrinsic features of the synthetic gene circuit design, call for the ever-increasing contribution of the operations research, e.g., by developing efficient deterministic and/or stochastic global optimization approaches as well as customized decomposition algorithms to overcome the computational intractability of these problems.
