                  Salient features in 3D meshes such as small high-curvature details in the middle of largely flat regions are easily ignored by most mesh simplification methods. Nevertheless, these features can be perceived by human observers as perceptually important in CAD models. Recently, mesh saliency has been introduced to identify those visually interesting regions. In this paper, we apply view-based mesh saliency to a purely visual method for surface simplification from two approaches. In the first one, we propose a new simplification error metric that considers polygonal saliency. In the second approach, we use viewpoint saliency as a weighting factor of the quality of a viewpoint in the simplification algorithm. Our results show that saliency can improve the preservation of small but visually significant surfaces even in visual algorithms for surface simplification. However, this comes at a price, because logically some other low-saliency regions in the mesh are simplified further.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Research into automatic polygonal simplification has been very active over the last years. Literature on computer graphics is replete with good simplification methods (Cignoni et al., 1998; Garland, 1999; Luebke, 2001; Luebke et al., 2003). Recently, van Kaick and Pedrini (2006) carried out a study of the most relevant geometric error metrics. Probably, the most important topic of discussion in the field is to develop techniques that make surface simplification algorithms to be conducted by visual or perceptual criteria. Lindstrom and Turk (2000) were the first to tackle the problem of visual similarity by developing a purely image-based metric for their simplification method. The visual appearance is crucial when dealing with visualization and graphical manipulation. Although graphics hardware is constantly evolving, increasing the performance of new graphical devices. Simplification is still essential to reduce the number of elements in a mesh improving its quality and use. It is known that, in general, small high-curvature details in the middle of largely flat regions (see Fig. 1
                     (a)) are ignored by most mesh simplification methods, mainly because simplifying these details introduces very little error. However, these small surfaces are likely to be perceived as being visually important in CAD models. A flat region in the middle of densely repeated high-curvature bumps (see Fig. 1(b)) is also perceptually significant. In recent times, mesh saliency has been introduced to identify visually interesting regions that are different from their surrounding context in 3D meshes. The goal here is to maintain the most salient regions during the process of simplification.

Human eyes do not scan a scene in a raster-like fashion, but rather our eyes jump rapidly between features within the scene. Visual attention comprises two processes, a bottom-up process which is purely stimulus driven and makes our eyes attract to salient features in a scene, and the top-down process which focuses attention on one more objects that are relevant to accomplish a specific visual task (Laurent and Koch, 2000). Many researchers have performed several studies using eye-tracking in different areas of computer graphics. Chalmers et al. (2006) carried out some eye-tracking experiments for selective rendering and Myszkowski et al. (2001) for animation quality measures. Howlett et al. (2004) presented a survey which demonstrates that saliency can improve simplification for human viewers.


                     Watanabe and Belyaev (2001) proposed a method to identify regions in meshes where the main curvatures have locally maximal values along one of the principal directions (typically along ridges and ravines). This method was also applied to mesh simplification. Hisada et al. (2002) proposed a method to detect salient ridges and ravines by computing the skeleton and finding non-manifold points on the skeletal edges and associated surface points. Lee et al. (2005) proposed a multi-scale saliency for meshes based on the Gaussian-weighted center-surround evaluation of surface curvatures. The center-surround mechanism allows the regions in a mesh that are different from their local context to be identified with greater precision. Their approach was also incorporated into mesh simplification using QSlim, a purely geometric simplification algorithm (Garland and Heckbert, 1997, 1998), and into viewpoint selection. Kim and Varshney (2006) presented a visual-saliency-based operator to enhance selected regions of a volume. Gal and Cohen-Or (2006) introduced a method for partial matching of surfaces by using the abstraction of salient geometric features and a method to construct them. More recently, Feixas et al. (2009) have proposed a view-based mesh saliency based on an information channel between a set of viewpoints and the polygons in the mesh.

In this paper, we incorporate view-based mesh saliency (Feixas et al., 2009) into the viewpoint-driven simplification scheme introduced in Castelló et al. (2008a, 2008b). We present two methods. In the first one, we make use of polygonal saliency to propose a new simplification error metric. In the second method, we use viewpoint saliency to weight the viewpoints in the viewpoint-driven simplification algorithm (Castelló et al., 2008a, 2008b). As shown in our experiments, including view-based mesh saliency in the simplification method allows for a better preservation of small, but visually significant, salient regions. However, some other regions with low saliency are simplified more drastically. Consequently, there is no guarantee that the global simplification error can always be reduced, but saliency produces better simplifications according to perception.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review the related work on Information Theory and introduce the Jensen–Shannon divergence which is the basis for the definition of view-based mesh saliency. In Section 3 we apply both polygonal saliency and viewpoint saliency to the viewpoint-driven simplification approach. Section 4 shows the results of our experiments. Finally, in Section 5 we present our conclusions and future work.

In this section, we review the Jensen–Shannon divergence, some information-theoretic viewpoint quality measures and polygonal saliency and viewpoint saliency (Feixas et al., 2009).

Shannon entropy (Shannon, 1948) is the classical measure of information, where information is simply the outcome of a selection among a finite number of possibilities. Let X be a discrete random variable with alphabet 
                           X

                           O
                        , called a viewpoint information channel, can be defined between the random variable V, which represents a set of viewpoints 
                           V

                         of an object (see Fig. 2

                         VMI gives us the degree of dependence between viewpoint v and the set of polygons O, and it is interpreted as a measure of the quality of viewpoint v. The best viewpoint is defined as the one that has minimum viewpoint mutual information.

Unlike Lee et al. (2005), where mesh saliency is defined by using a purely geometric technique, Feixas et al. (2009) formulate mesh saliency based on JS-divergence. Here, mesh saliency is defined in terms of how the polygons ‘see’ the set of viewpoints. The saliency of a polygon is defined as the average dissimilarity between this polygon and its neighbors. Two polygons are ‘similar’ when the JS-divergence between them is small.

Given two random variables V, a set of viewpoints, and O, the set of polygons of an object, the polygonal saliency S of

Similarly to Lee et al. (2005), where mesh saliency was used to select the best views, Feixas et al. (2009) also propose a method to calculate the saliency of a viewpoint. The viewpoint saliency of v is defined as

                         where polygonal saliency is conveyed to the sphere of viewpoints, using the conditional probabilities of the reverse channel.

View-based saliency can be incorporated into mesh simplification by redefining the error metric in order to include polygonal saliency, or as a weighting factor of the importance of a viewpoint. In this section we discuss both methods. The first method is more general and can be applied to any simplification method (geometric or visual). The second method can only be applied in visual surface simplification algorithms that make use of viewpoints in order to analyze the visual information of the model.

Mesh saliency based on JS-divergence can be easily integrated into any mesh simplification scheme. In this paper, we apply mesh saliency based on JS-divergence to the viewpoint-driven simplification method (Castelló et al., 2008a, 2008b). Viewpoint-driven simplification is a visual decimation algorithm based on the general edge collapse operation (see Fig. 4
                        ). This removal operation, first proposed in Hoppe et al. (1993), consists of contracting to a single vertex the two vertices of an edge. The error committed at each edge collapse operation is measured by the variation in some viewpoint selection measure. This algorithm uses a sphere of equidistantly distributed viewpoints which are used to obtain information about the object from a particular viewpoint. The information is given by the chosen viewpoint selection measure such as viewpoint entropy (VE) (Vázquez et al., 2001), viewpoint Kullback–Leibler distance (VKL) (Sbert et al., 2005) or viewpoint mutual information (VMI). The goal of this simplification method is to preserve the visual appearance of the given model by minimizing the change in the shape.

View-based saliency is used to change the simplification error at level of decimation operation which can be very useful not only for visual simplification algorithms but also for those purely geometric. In order to consider salient regions we must change the default behavior of the simplification error metric. Specifically, it is necessary for salient regions to increase the original simplification error. The viewpoint-driven simplification algorithm measures the simplification error for the edge collapse operation, thus we must define view-based saliency in terms of edges before applying saliency to this simplification method. However, although view-based saliency is originally defined for polygons, it can be easily adjusted to any decimation operation such as vertex removal, face clustering and vertex pair contraction. Hence, the salient simplification error for edge collapse e is now given by

                         are the two polygons that share edge e. If an edge is a boundary edge, it only shares one polygon, and thus its saliency is considered to be the maximum value. In order to avoid mesh artifacts, the simplification algorithm only deals with 2-manifold edges and boundary edges. Nonetheless, calculation of the JS-divergence for more than two polygons can be performed without any problem, as can be inferred from (2).

With the current definition of the salient simplification error, even very small values of saliency may affect the final result. However, only high values of saliency are really important because they are perceived as interesting features. Accordingly, we define a threshold α such that we only consider the saliency values greater or equal to α. This α is the 30th percentile saliency. Lee et al. (2005) used the same value for α in their saliency. With an alpha close to zero, salient regions are retained worse. On the other hand, with a high alpha value, only a few regions with the highest saliency are preserved better:

We also analyze the effect of amplifying the saliency values on the simplification process in order to potentiate the saliency values even for small polygons. However, our experiments show that if we amplify saliency then salient regions are preserved better but nevertheless this has a significantly negative effect on other parts of the model, which turns out in a global increase of the visual error. Therefore, we conclude that amplifying saliency appears to be not useful. In order to measure the visual error, we used several image quality assessment metrics: RMSE, SSIM (Wang et al., 2004a), MS-SSIM (Wang et al., 2004b) and MS-SSIM* (Rouse and Hemami, 2008). RMSE stands for the root mean square error, a per-pixel-difference image metric. Based on the idea that the human visual system (HVS) is highly adapted to process structural information, SSIM (Structural SIMilarity) measures the change in luminance, contrast and structure in an image. We used the values suggested by the authors for the parameters

                        . Layered on SSIM, MS-SSIM (Multi-Scale Structural SIMilarity) calculates multiple SSIM values at multiple image scales evaluating the quality of the image at different viewing distances. We used for MS-SSIM an

                           ×
                           11
                         circular Gaussian sliding window and five scales. MS-SSIM* is an extension to the original MS-SSIM that does away with the stabilization constants and defines concrete values for the edge cases. We used for MS-SSIM* an

                           ×

                         linear window. We computed RMSE, SSIM, MS-SSIM and MS-SSIM* between a set of multiple

                           ×

                         images rendered in flat shading of the original and the simplified model captured from a sphere of camera positions (24 vertices of the small rhombicuboctahedron). Fig. 5
                         shows the simplification results for the Beethoven and Galo models using several values of α.

At the initialization stage, a saliency map is built from the saliency of all polygons. This map is computed only once and never modified during the simplification process. We have verified that if the saliency map is updated at each step of simplification, the global simplification error is reduced but salient regions are poorly preserved. This can be especially noticeable when the model is simplified to very coarse levels.

Viewpoint saliency can be used as a criterion to weight the importance of a viewpoint. This allows the regions with the lowest saliency to be simplified further in the mesh. For instance, in a bust model mesh, the back will be simplified more than the front, since there are a lot of salient regions in the face such as the eyes, the nose and the mouth.

In order to include viewpoint saliency in the viewpoint-driven simplification scheme we define a new simplification error deviation (

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this section, we present the results of our experiments with several CAD models simplified using image-driven simplification (IDS) (Lindstrom and Turk, 2000), viewpoint mutual information (VMI) (Castelló et al., 2008b) and VMI with view-based mesh saliency. Our test models range from very different complexity. The highest complexity model (Athene) belongs to the De Espona 3D Models Collection for 3DS Max (http://www.3dshort.com/). In addition, we compared our results with our own implementation of IDS. The IDS algorithm basically uses RMSE as an error metric to drive the simplification process. In our implementation of IDS we used RMSE with flat shading and 20 viewpoints and 
                        256
                        ×
                        256
                      resolution images according to the authors' own implementation. It's well known that RMSE has many limitations because it exhibits weak performance when dealing with perceptual signals such as images. An interesting discussion can be found in Wang and Bovik (2009). In order to contrast our results, we used both RMSE and a perceptual image quality assessment metric, MS-SSIM* (Rouse and Hemami, 2008). MS-SSIM* exhibits a better overall correlation with the signal-based and visual structure preserving representations' average recognition thresholds than the standard MS-SSIM (Wang et al., 2004b) cross-correlation component. A recent survey on different perceptual metrics can be found in Corsini et al. (2013). All models shown in this paper were simplified on a Mac Pro Intel Xeon 2.8 GHz with 4 GB of RAM and an NVIDIA 8800GT 512 MB graphics card running Windows 7. For both VMI alone and VMI with view-based mesh saliency, we also used 20 regularly distributed viewpoints and 
                        256
                        ×
                        256
                      resolution images in our test models.

We studied the effects of the saliency map on the quality of simplification. For this task, we vary both the number of viewpoints and image resolution in order to obtain the saliency maps. Figs. 6 and 7
                     
                      show our experiments. Some of these uniformly distributed viewpoint configurations were obtained directly from the Platonic solids and others by recursive discretization of the icosahedron (42 and 162). From our tests, we can conclude that 
                        512
                        ×
                        512
                      image resolution and 42 viewpoints is sufficient to obtain good results. Other more expensive configurations including more views and higher resolutions do not always improve clearly the visual appearance of the resulting approximations.


                     Table 1
                      shows the visual error measured with RMSE and MS-SSIM* and the simplification time for all the test models. As this table illustrates, the best results are obtained with VMI when polygonal saliency is applied. VMI achieves lower visual error than IDS in most of the test models. This is because VMI is able to preserve the silhouette of the models better than IDS. In VMI, the background itself is considered as another polygon that has a relevant influence in the measure. This can be quite noticeable in the Shark (see Fig. 8
                     ), Galo (see Fig. 9
                     ) and Buddha (see Fig. 10
                     ) models. However, in the Athene model, VMI did not improve the results of IDS mainly because IDS was capable of retaining the silhouette as good as VMI at that level of simplification. As depicted in this table, the overall visual error is lower when applying polygonal saliency and even sometimes can be clearly much lower for some models, for instance, Athene (see Figs. 11 and 12
                     
                     ). Nevertheless, not all models achieve the same degree of visual improvement, for example, the Shark and Galo models where polygonal saliency slightly improves the overall visual error in comparison with VMI alone. This table also shows the simplification time. Simplification times for both VMI and VMI with polygonal saliency are practically the same. The times for IDS have a similar value. Obviously, when using polygonal saliency first we must compute the saliency map. Nevertheless, this calculation hardly increases the total time. For instance, in the case of the Athene model, its total simplification time increases about 1% if polygonal saliency is applied.

Finally, we also study the effects of using viewpoint saliency (see Section 3.2) on VMI in Figs. 13 and 14
                     
                     . In this case, viewpoint saliency can enhance the results of VMI, especially in the most salient views, but it may happen that the overall visual error could not always be decreased. Nevertheless, the most salient views are in fact visually more interesting.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

We have included mesh saliency based on JS-divergence (Feixas et al., 2009) in a visual simplification algorithm (Castelló, 2008a, 2008b) from two different approaches. In the first one, we define a new simplification error metric which considers polygonal saliency. This allows us to improve the visual quality of the simplified models as our results show. In the second approach, viewpoint saliency is used as a weighting factor of the quality of a viewpoint in the simplification algorithm. This approach allows us to improve the visual quality of the most salient views which are visually the most relevant, but the least salient are drastically simplified. This can be more suitable for applications where models are viewed from a reduced set of views. We demonstrated that mesh saliency based on JS-divergence can be used to improve simplification even in purely visual simplification algorithms and compared our results with image-driven simplification (IDS), another perceptually-motivated simplification technique (Lindstrom and Turk, 2000). Unlike other previous approaches, this saliency is defined according to visual perception and its calculation is not a very expensive preprocess. In fact, any mesh simplification method can be adapted to include this saliency. View-based mesh saliency does not need to be adjusted to any scale because it is not computed from the combination of a particular range of different scales, which can be sometimes hard to establish, and give us only the necessary highly salient regions per model. Therefore, we do not need to smooth and blur the saliency map before starting the simplification process in order to help the simplification algorithm focus more on highly salient regions as Lee et al. (2005) did.

The current definition of mesh saliency based on JS-divergence only considers geometric information because it is calculated from the projected areas of polygons. Its generalization in order to include other appearance attributes such as color, texture and reflectance would be an important area for future research. Also, an interesting extension to this work would be to incorporate this saliency into a geometric simplification algorithm such as the quadric error metric approach (Garland and Heckbert, 1997, 1998).
