                  In this paper we study a continuous time stochastic inventory model for a commodity traded in the spot market and whose supply purchase is affected by price and demand uncertainty. A firm aims at meeting a random demand of the commodity at a random time by maximizing total expected profits. We model the firm’s optimal procurement problem as a singular stochastic control problem in which controls are nondecreasing processes and represent the cumulative investment made by the firm in the spot market (a so-called stochastic ‘monotone follower problem’). We assume a general exponential Lévy process for the commodity’s spot price, rather than the commonly used geometric Brownian motion, and general convex holding costs.
                  We obtain necessary and sufficient first order conditions for optimality and we provide the optimal procurement policy in terms of a base inventory process; that is, a minimal time-dependent desirable inventory level that the firm’s manager must reach at any time. In particular, in the case of linear holding costs and exponentially distributed demand, we are also able to obtain the explicit analytic form of the optimal policy and a probabilistic representation of the optimal revenue. The paper is completed by some computer drawings of the optimal inventory when spot prices are given by a geometric Brownian motion and by an exponential jump-diffusion process. In the first case we also make a numerical comparison between the value function and the revenue associated to the classical static “newsvendor” strategy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This paper contributes to the literature related to inventory management policies in the presence of price and demand uncertainty. Usually, the two main procurement mechanisms are the spot market, characterized by a negligible lead time, and long-term contracts, that offer the opportunity to procure the good for future use and with no payment prior to the delivery. In recent years the role of the spot market in procurement decisions has become prominent. That is also due to the raising of online spot markets such as memory chips, chemical, energy etc. (see Seifert, Thonemann, & Hausman, 2004). As a consequence the pertinent literature has experienced an increasing interest in mathematical models for the spot market and its role in procurement decisions (see Benkherouf, 2007; Guo, Kaminsky, Tomecek, & Yuen, 2011; Sato & Sawaki, 2010, among others). For example, in Xiao-li (2009) and Xinga, Wangb, and Liu (2012) the optimal procurement policies are obtained for a business-to-business (B2B) spot market. The optimal replenishment policy for an inventory model that minimizes the total expected discounted costs over an infinite planning horizon is studied in Benkherouf (2007) and Sato and Sawaki (2010) in the setting of impulsive control. In Benkherouf (2007) the demand is driven by a Brownian motion with drift, whereas in Sato and Sawaki (2010) the demand is assumed to be deterministic and the market price of the good follows a geometric Brownian motion.

A model falling in the class of singular stochastic control problems (that is, a problem in which the controls are the cumulative amounts of the purchased/sold commodity and they are possibly singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure as functions of time) may be found in Guo et al. (2011). There the authors study the inventory problem of a firm facing a random demand at the end of a random time interval. The firm may buy or sell the good in the spot market at any instant prior to the demand time. Trading the commodity in the spot market provides the immediate delivery of the good at a price modeled by a geometric Brownian motion. The firm aims at maximizing total net expected profits under linear holding and shortage costs. Holding costs are due to inventory storage, whereas shortage costs are incurred in when the demand exceeds the available stock. In fact, in such case the firm has a loss of revenue from not meeting the demand, and a loss of future business due to reputation lowering. On the other hand, there might be an excess of inventory at terminal time. That may be salvaged at a price possibly lower than the purchasing one through, for example, a discounted sale. It is shown that the spot market may be used to hedge against both supply costs and demand price uncertainty, although in the classical literature the firm usually enters the spot market when the demand exceeds the inventory level.

In this paper we essentially adopt the setting of Guo et al. (2011) but we take exponential Lévy prices and convex holding costs, and we assume that the commodity deteriorates over time at an exponential rate. However, we do not allow selling and we do not have inventory level’s constraints. Our control problem is a so-called ‘monotone follower problem’ since selling is not allowed and the control process represents the cumulative amount of commodity purchased by the firm. We model the commodity spot price P by an exponential Lévy process to take into account the fact that, empirically, the market is non Gaussian but it exhibits significant skewness and kurtosis. We thus drop the assumption of normally distributed increments, while keeping a convenient Markovian structure. Our setup also includes the case of jump processes (like the Poisson process) or that of jump-diffusion processes, and of course the Brownian case typically assumed in the literature. As in Guo et al. (2011), we take a random demand D fully described by a general absolutely continuous distribution function FD
                      with finite mean, a random demand time Θ exponentially distributed, and we assume D and Θ both independent of the price process. Such independence allows to rewrite the firm’s problem in terms of an equivalent concave, monotone follower problem with infinite time horizon (some classical references on monotone follower problem are El Karoui & Karatzas, 1991; Karatzas, 1981; 1983; Karatzas & Shreve, 1984).

We show existence and uniqueness of the optimal inventory policy by exploiting the concavity of our problem and by a suitable version of Komlós’ Theorem (cf. Kabanov, 1999). Hence we characterize it by a set of necessary and sufficient first order conditions similar to those in Bank (2005); Bank and Riedel (2001); Chiarolla, Ferrari, and Riedel (2013); Ferrari (2015); Riedel and Su (2011) and Steg (2012), among others. Such conditions may be thought of as an infinite-dimensional, stochastic generalization of the classical Kuhn–Tucker conditions. They represent a valid alternative to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) approach, especially in non Markovian settings.

We show that the optimal policy requires to keep the inventory above a base inventory level 
                        
                           
                              ℓ
                              t
                              *
                           
                           ,
                        
                      at each time t. The process ℓ* represents the maximal inventory level for which it is not profitable to delay the commodity’s purchase to any future time, and hence it is characterized in terms of a family of optimal stopping problems (see also Bank & Föllmer, 2002, for a relation with Gittins’ indices in continuous time). At times when the firm’s inventory level is strictly above 
                        
                           
                              ℓ
                              t
                              *
                           
                           ,
                        
                      it is optimal to wait as at those times the firm faces excess of inventory. On the other hand, when the inventory is below 
                        
                           
                              ℓ
                              t
                              *
                           
                           ,
                        
                      then the firm should instantaneously invest in order to reach the level 
                        
                           ℓ
                           t
                           *
                        
                     . Hence, as expected in monotone follower problems, the optimal inventory policy behaves as the solution of a Skorohod’s reflection problem at the (random) moving boundary ℓ*. Such a structure of the optimal policy is very natural from the point of view of inventory theory (see, e.g., Porteus, 1990) and it is well known in other contexts as well. See for example models with durable goods (cf., e.g., Bank & Riedel, 2003), irreversible investments (cf. Chiarolla & Haussmann, 2009; Riedel & Su, 2011) and consumption with memory (cf. Bank & Riedel, 2001). We point out that there is a specific condition on the parameters of our model under which the optimal procurement policy consists in not investing at all, whatever random demand D and convex holding costs function one picks (see Proposition 5.3 below).

An explicit form of the optimal investment policy is obtained in Section 6 in the particular case of linear holding costs and exponentially distributed demand. The base inventory level is determined there by solving a backward stochastic equation in the spirit of Bank and El Karoui (2004) and, as expected, it turns out to be price-dependent. Moreover in such setting we provide a probabilistic representation of the value function. In the case of spot prices given by a geometric Brownian motion or by an exponential jump-diffusion process we make computer drawings of the optimal inventory level. Finally, we numerically compare the revenue associated to a modified version of the classical “newsvendor” model, in which the commodity is purchased only once and at the initial time, with the value function of our model in the case of geometric Brownian motion prices. The results suggest that our optimal inventory strategy, dynamically acting over the entire given time interval, provides a higher revenue than that corresponding to the optimal static newsvendor one. Moreover, an increase in price volatility makes the difference among the two revenues increase. Therefore, although firms may prefer long term contracts when the commodity price is highly fluctuating, our results suggest that in order to increase the revenue the commodity must be dynamically procured in the spot market.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we set the firm’s optimal procurement problem, and in Section 3 we derive an equivalent concave singular stochastic control problem. In Section 4 we prove the existence of optimal procurement policies and in Section 5 we obtain a characterization of them. Finally, Section 6 contains some explicit examples and computer drawings.

Consider a firm choosing a dynamic procurement policy of a single commodity to meet a random demand D at a prescribed future random time Θ. Each unit of demand satisfied gives rise to a profit depending on the spot price at time Θ, PΘ
                     . At any time t ∈ [0, Θ) the firm can instantaneously increase its inventory but it cannot buy inventory at terminal time Θ to meet demand. In case the inventory at time Θ is lower than the demand, then the firm incurs in a shortage cost proportional to PΘ
                     . On the other hand, when the inventory at time Θ exceeds the demand, the excess of inventory is salvaged by selling it in the spot market at price αsPΘ
                     , for some 0 < αs
                      ≤ 1. The costs associated to a procurement policy are the ordering cost given by the purchase of the commodity in the spot market, and the holding cost of storaging the commodity up to time Θ.

                                 There is no loss of generality in considering structure (2.1) since commonly used price dynamics may be cast in form (2.1) by adjusting δ, through the Laplace transform of X. Such structure (2.1) usually arises in a financial market affected by a Markov uncertainty process X (see, e.g., Duffie, 1992, Ch. 6, for a discussion in a Brownian setting).

The uncertainty process X is much more general than the Brownian one, commonly assumed in the literature. Indeed we drop the assumption of normally distributed increments, while keeping a convenient Markovian structure. Our setup also covers the case of jump processes, like the Poisson process, or that of jump-diffusion processes (see Section 6), as well as the deterministic case obtained by setting

From a mathematical point of view, problem (2.13) falls into the class of singular stochastic control problems of monotone follower type (see the Introduction for some classical references), which allows controls possibly singular (as functions of time) with respect to the Lebesgue measure. If the performance criterion is concave (or convex) it is well known that the optimal control policy consists in keeping the state process at or above a certain threshold. In mathematical terms, the optimal control is the solution of a Skorohod reflection problem at a moving boundary (see, e.g., El Karoui & Karatzas, 1991; Karatzas, 1981; 1983; Karatzas & Shreve, 1984). Problem (2.13) may be rewritten in terms of a new functional for which is easy to check concavity. This is accomplished in the following section (see Proposition 3.9 below).

Since the ‘revenue multiplier’ G has a singular point (i.e. a point in which it is not differentiable), we prefer to switch to a more regular function. In fact, we rewrite the functional in (2.12) by borrowing some ideas and arguments from Guo et al. (2011).

As in Guo et al. (2011), Theorem 4, we obtain the decomposition of the optimal total expected discounted return V(y) in terms of the value function of a new optimization problem and the expected value of the demand 
                        
                           E
                           [
                           D
                           ]
                        
                     . To obtain such decomposition we need the following

                        Assumption 3.2

                                 +
                                 λ
                                 −
                                 δ
                                 >
                                 0
                                 .
                              
                           
                        

Notice that Assumption 3.2 is equivalent to require that

In its classical formulation Komlós’ Theorem (cf. Komlós, 1967) states that if a sequence of random variables 
                        
                           {

                      is bounded from above in expectation, then there exists a subsequence 
                        
                           {
                           
                              Z

                      which converges a.e. in the Cesàro sense to some random variable Z. Hence, if a maximizing (minimizing) sequence of admissible controls is Komlós compact, then due to concavity (convexity) the limit provided by Komlós’ Theorem turns out to be an optimal control policy. These arguments also work in our setting thanks to our assumptions. Moreover, if c is strictly convex, then

                      for the procurement problem without giving any information about its nature. In this section we provide a complete characterization of the optimal procurement policy through generalized stochastic first order conditions. Such approach does not need a priori smoothness of the value function, neither of the boundary between the investment and the no-investment regions, in order to determine the optimal policy. Therefore it allows to overcome the regularity issues dealt with in the HJB quasi-variational inequality approach arising from our two-dimensional setting with state process (Yt, Pt
                     ).

Characterizing the optimal controls by first order conditions appeared in Bertola (1998) for a profit maximizing firm with Cobb–Douglas operating profit function and uncertainty given by a geometric Brownian motion. Such concept was then developed in Bank and Riedel (2001) in the case of a static budget constraint, in Bank (2005) in the case of a stochastic dynamic finite-fuel constraint, in Steg (2012) in a capital accumulation game of sequential irreversible investment, and in Chiarolla et al. (2013) for an optimization problem involving N firms. In Riedel and Su (2011) a stochastic first order conditions approach was employed to obtain the optimal policy through the solution to a backward stochastic equation.

                           (ω, t, y) strictly decreasing but it is easily checked that it suffices concavity of Γ(ω, t, ·) to prove optimality of the first order conditions.□

The intuition of the first order conditions is that when the gradient is positive at some stopping time, a small extra investment is profitable.

                        The first order conditions (5.2) can be thought of as a stochastic infinite-dimensional generalization of the classical Kuhn–Tucker conditions. In real analysis, if one deals with an optimization problem of the form max

                     Theorem 4.1 guarantees the existence of an optimal investment policy for any y ≥ 0, and the first order conditions (5.2) completely characterize it. However, such conditions are not necessarily binding and hence they do not always explicitly determine the optimal policies. For that, we follow Riedel and Su (2011), Section 3, or Steg (2012), Proposition 3.3, and we obtain the optimal procurement policies in terms of a process

Since Theorem 4.1 provides the existence of an optimal procurement policy ν
                           * for any y ≥ 0, it suffices to apply Steg (2012), Proposition 3.3 (which may be easily adapted to our case with depreciation rate ε ≥ 0).□

The base inventory process ℓ* is the maximal inventory level for which it is not profitable to delay marginal purchase of the commodity to any future stopping time. Also, for any t ≥ 0,

In the context of stochastic irreversible capacity expansion problems, such backward equation has been obtained in Chiarolla and Ferrari (2014); Ferrari (2015); Riedel and Su (2011) (here the backward equation is actually an integral equation) under the Inada conditions on the corresponding Γ (cf. Inada, 1963), i.e.

                            holds. Such condition must be checked on a case by case basis but it is usually satisfied if β is sufficiently large.

Notice that, as discussed in Section 3 of Riedel and Su (2011), (5.7) shows clear similarities with the first order conditions (5.2). In fact, by considering the first order conditions for a firm that starts investing at time τ, we may take the supremum from time τ on in the inventory that tracks the base inventory ℓ* (cf. (5.6)) and then plug it into the supergradient (5.1). Then the first order conditions are binding for the firm and thus we obtain an equality as in (5.7).

In applications Proposition 5.5 turns out to be very useful as it provides a constructive method to find ℓ* and hence solve problem (3.8). In fact, (5.7) may be at least found numerically by backward induction on a discretized version of problem (5.7) (see Bank & Föllmer, 2002, Section 4). In the next section we explicitly solve the backward stochastic equation (5.7) in the case of an exponentially distributed demand (Lariviere & Porteus, 1999; Zhang, Nagarajan, & Sošić, 2010, cf.) for the use of the exponential distribution in inventory management literature) and linear holding costs (cf. Guo et al., 2011; Tarima & Kingsman, 2004; Zhang, 2010, among others).

Throughout this section Assumptions 2.3, 2.4, 3.2 and 3.4 still hold true. We also assume, as in Guo et al. (2011), linear holding costs, i.e. 
                        
                           c
                           (

                      for some c > 0, and zero deterioration rate, i.e. 
                        
                           
                              ɛ

                     . Moreover, we assume that D is exponentially distributed with parameter γ > 0; that is,

The result of Proposition 6.1 is remarkable in its own right. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, it is one of the rare examples of explicit solution to a backward stochastic equation like (5.7) involving the function Γy
                        (t, ·) (cf. (6.3)) not satisfying the classical Inada conditions.

Here we provide computer drawings of the optimal inventory level for spot prices driven by a geometric Brownian motion or by an exponential jump-diffusion process. In order to do that, we find the explicit form of κ (cf. (6.14)), needed to obtain the base inventory ℓ* (cf. (6.5) and (6.6)) and hence the optimal procurement strategy (6.8). Then we compare the optimal expected return of our model with that of a modified version of the classical newsvendor model.

                            (this is a well known result for a Brownian motion with drift). As shown in Fig. 1
                           , the commodity is purchased at times at which the current inventory becomes lower than the base inventory ℓ* of (6.6).

Since most spot prices exhibit significant skewness and kurtosis, they are not so well described by purely diffusive processes. Here we assume that the spot price evolves according to the jump-diffusion process

As it is shown in Fig. 2
                           , the optimal inventory is kept equal or higher than the base inventory 
                           (6.6), and purchases take place only when the current inventory becomes lower than the base inventory.

The newsvendor model is a classical model in the literature on inventory management (see, for example, Porteus, 1990). It studies the problem of controlling the inventory of a single item with stochastic demand over a single period, in the presence of overage and underage costs when the newsvendor orders too much or too little, respectively. The newsvendor aims to choose the size of a single order that maximizes the expected profit. As Guo et al. (2011) observe, the newsvendor model provides a solution for a firm’s manager who is not interested in repeatedly buying in the spot market, but who purchases the commodity only once at time zero (the so called ‘newsvendor procurement strategy’). Such strategy belongs to our set of admissible strategies (2.9). In the setting of this section (cf. beginning of Section 6), the firm’s total expected discounted return associated to the purchase of y units of commodity at time zero is given (cf. (2.6)) by

                           Assuming the geometric Brownian motion of (6.19) with 
                              
                                 μ

                            for the spot price, we use the probabilistic representation (6.15) to plot the difference between the value function V(0) (cf. (3.7) with 
                              
                                 y
                                 =
                                 0
                              
                           ) and the newsvendor value function L(y
                           *) as the volatility σ varies from 0.05 to 50 (see Fig. 3). Notice that when σ → 0 our value function V(0) tends to the newsvendor’s one L(y
                           *). On the other hand, when the volatility increases, the optimal revenue starts rapidly becoming larger than the newsvendor revenue. That means, the more the market gets riskier the more profitable the optimal dynamic procurement strategy becomes.

We have studied the optimal procurement problem of a firm aiming at meeting a random demand at a random time Θ. The firm buys inventory on a spot market and maximizes expected profits under exponential Lévy spot prices and general convex running holding costs. The problem is modeled as a monotone stochastic control problem in which the cumulative inventory up to time t is the control.

We prove existence of an optimal procurement policy and we characterize it through stochastic first order conditions. As expected in singular stochastic control, it is optimal for the firm to invest in the spot market just enough to keep, at any time, the inventory level above a certain lower bound. In fact, in the present case the lower bound is the base inventory process, which is random and time dependent.

In the case of linear holding costs and an exponentially distributed random demand, we obtain a closed form solution for the optimal procurement policy, which we use to provide computer drawings for two examples of exponential Lévy prices. In particular, for geometric Brownian motion prices Fig. 3 shows that, as the volatility increases, the optimal procurement strategy becomes more and more profitable than the static newsvendor’s one.

The results of this paper are based on a quite recent and powerful stochastic first order condition approach, known in the mathematical finance literature (see, e.g., Bank & Riedel, 2001; Riedel & Su, 2011), but still rarely employed in the operational research context. In this sense our paper contributes to the literature on continuous time inventory management policies. The new method of solution provides new insights into the optimal procurement under Lévy prices and general convex holding costs.

There are many directions in which it would be interesting to extend the present study as, for example, relaxing the independence assumption between prices and demand and introducing some form of correlation between them, or assuming diffusive dynamics also for the demand D (that would give raise to a daunting three-dimensional singular stochastic control problem in (Pt, Dt, Yt
                     )). It would be also interesting to allow the firm to buy and sell in the spot market, i.e. to allow bounded variation stochastic controls. Finally, one could introduce fixed inventory ordering costs. That would naturally lead to a challenging impulse control problem in which a strategy of S–s type (see Porteus, 1990) is expected to be optimal. More drastically, one could try to drop the Markovian setting. In such case, the stochastic first order conditions might still hold, but it would be almost impossible to find explicit solutions.
