                  Linguistic decision making systems represent situations that cannot be assessed with numerical information but it is possible to use linguistic variables. This paper introduces new linguistic aggregation operators in order to develop more efficient decision making systems. The linguistic probabilistic weighted average (LPWA) is presented. Its main advantage is that it considers subjective and objective information in the same formulation and considering the degree of importance that each concept has in the aggregation. A key feature of the LPWA operator is that it considers a wide range of linguistic aggregation operators including the linguistic weighted average, the linguistic probabilistic aggregation and the linguistic average. Further generalizations are presented by using quasi-arithmetic means and moving averages. An application in linguistic multi-criteria group decision making under subjective and objective risk is also presented in the context of the European Union law.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Decision making problems are very common in the literature (Figueira, Greco, & Ehrgott, 2005). Most of the decisions are taken from an intuitive point of view or only with some very basic information. However, in real life, the problems are often not so easy and it is necessary to analyse the information in more detail. Moreover, sometimes the available information is vague and imprecise and it cannot be assessed with the usual exact numbers. Therefore, a better approach could be the use of linguistic information. Linguistic information was introduced by Zadeh (1975) as a tool for representing imprecise expressions such as low, high and very high by using fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1965). Since then, other authors have studied alternative representations of the linguistic information, including the 2-tuple linguistic approach (Herrera & Martinez, 2000), the continuous linguistic framework (Xu, 2004a, 2004b), uncertain linguistic variables (Xu, 2004c), linguistic unbalanced information (Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Martínez, 2008), uncertain linguistic unbalanced information (Xu, 2009), linguistic cloud information (Wang, Peng, Zhang, & Chen, 2014), and hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (Liao, Xu, Zeng, & Merigó, 2015).

A further interesting issue when dealing with decision making problems is the necessity of aggregating the information. In the literature, there are a wide range of aggregation operators (Beliakov, Pradera, & Calvo, 2007; Grabisch, Marichal, Mesiar, & Pap, 2011). Some very well-known ones are the weighted average, the probabilistic aggregation and the ordered weighted average (Yager, 1988; Yager, Kacprzyk, & Beliakov, 2011). These operators have also been studied under linguistic information forming the linguistic weighted average, the linguistic probabilistic aggregation and the linguistic OWA (LOWA) operator (Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Verdegay, 1995). Since its introduction, many other authors have developed new linguistic aggregation operators. Merigó and Casanovas (2010) studied the use of distance measures with linguistic information and Zeng and Su (2012) generalized it by using induced generalized aggregation operators. Zhou, Wu, and Chen (2014) extended the linguistic distances with continuous aggregation operators. Merigó, Casanovas, and Martínez (2010) developed a new approach for linguistic decision making with Dempster–Shafer belief structure. Xu, Merigó, and Wang (2012) and Zhou and Chen (2012) analysed a new framework with power averages. Merigó & Gil-Lafuente (2012) studied the use of induced and generalized aggregation operators. Liu and Jin (2012) and Liu, Jin, Zhang, Su, and Wang (2011) developed new approaches by using interval numbers in the linguistic variables. Wei and Zhao (2012) studied the use of dependent aggregation operators and Yu, Xu, Liu, and Chen (2012) suggested a new approach with 2-dimension linguistic information.

Recently, Merigó (2012a) has suggested the probabilistic weighted averaging (PWA) operator. It is an aggregation operator that unifies the probability and the weighted average (WA) in the same formulation and considering the degree of importance that each concept has in the analysis. In decision making, it is very useful for representing subjective and objective information in the same representation. It is worth noting that this approach follows a methodology similar to other methods suggested for the unification of the probability and the OWA operator (Merigó, 2012b). Furthermore, note that several authors have already suggested some approaches for the integration of the probability and the weighted average with the OWA operator such as the immediate probabilities (Engemann, Filev, & Yager, 1996; Yager, Engemann, & Filev, 1995), the weighted OWA (WOWA) operator (Torra, 1997) and the hybrid average (Xu & Da, 2003).

The objective of this paper is to present a new approach for dealing with linguistic information and decision making problems. In so doing, introduce the linguistic probabilistic weighted average (LPWA). Its main advantage is that it unifies the probability and the weighted average considering the degree of importance that each concept has in the analysis. Additionally, in an uncertain environment where the information is uncertain, it can be assessed with linguistic variables. We study some of its main properties and particular cases including the linguistic average (LA), the linguistic weighted average (LWA), the linguistic probabilistic aggregation (LPA), the arithmetic – LWA (A-LWA) and the arithmetic LPA (A-LPA) operator.

Further generalizations are presented by using quasi-arithmetic means forming the quasi-arithmetic LPWA (Quasi-LPWA) operator. It generalizes a wide range of aggregation functions including quadratic and geometric aggregations and the LPWA operator. Another interesting extension suggested for the LPWA operator is the use of moving averages obtaining the linguistic probabilistic weighted moving average (LPWMA). Its main advantage is that it can assess dynamic information in an appropriate way such as in time series forecasting. Moreover, it is able to deal with imprecise environments that can be represented with linguistic information. A further extension of the LPWMA operator is introduced by using quasi/arithmetic means forming the Quasi/LPWMA operator.

The applicability of the LPWA operator and all its extensions is very broad. All of the studies that use the probability or the weighted average in a linguistic context can be revised and extended with this approach. The main reason for this is that the LPWA operator can always be reduced to the LPA or LWA operator. However, by using this approach it is possible to represent the information in a more complete way because in uncertain or imprecise problems it is very common to have some part of the information given in a subjective way and another part in an objective way. This paper focuses on a linguistic multi-person multi-criteria decision making problem under subjective and objective risk. By using multi-criteria and multi-person information it is possible to obtain more robust information because real world problems depend on several aspects. Usually, the knowledge given by one expert is less than that from several experts. This decision making process produces a new aggregation operator that is called the multi-person multi-criteria LPWA (MPMC-LPWA) operator.

An illustrative example regarding the use of this new decision system is also studied. The example presents a judicial decision making problem regarding the creation of a new regulation in the European Union (EU). EU law implies the establishment of a lot of decisions in tax law, business law and so on, because different political parties may have different interests and it is necessary to reach an agreement. Under uncertain and imprecise environments, it is not easy to form a single decision because the future may produce different events that may completely change the potential results and therefore, the decisions. Thus, this new approach tries to represent all these possible scenarios and select the alternative that seems to be in closest accordance to the interests of the decision maker.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews some basic concepts to be used throughout the paper. Section 3 introduces the LPWA operator.
Section 4 presents a generalization by using quasi-arithmetic means and Section 5 an extension with moving averages. Section 6 develops an application in linguistic multi-person multi-criteria decision making and Section 7 an illustrative example in judicial decision making. Section 8 ends the paper summarizing the main conclusions.

In this Section, we briefly describe the linguistic approach to be used throughout the paper, the weighted and the probabilistic aggregation operators and the linguistic aggregation operators.

Usually, people are used to working in a quantitative setting, where the information is expressed by means of numerical values. However, many aspects of the real world cannot be assessed in a quantitative form. Instead, it is possible to use a qualitative one, i.e., with vague or imprecise knowledge such as the use of linguistic assessments instead of numerical values. The linguistic approach represents qualitative aspects by means of linguistic variables (Zadeh, 1975).

We have to select the appropriate linguistic descriptors for the term set and their semantics. One possibility for generating the linguistic term set consists in directly supplying the term set by considering all terms distributed on a scale on which a total order is defined. For example, a set of eleven terms S could be given as follows:

Weighted aggregation functions are those functions that weight the aggregation process by using the weighted average. That is, aggregations that considers different degrees of importance for the available information. Some examples are the aggregation with the weighted average (Carlsson & Fuller, 2000; Grabisch et al., 2011), belief structures that use the weighted average (Merigó et al., 2010) and the weighted OWA (WOWA) operator (Torra, 1997). The weighted average can be defined as follows.

                               represents the ith argument variable.

Note that in the literature there are a lot of other extensions of weighted aggregation functions including those that use risk measures (Belles-Sampera, Merigó, Guillén, & Santolino, 2013) and uncertain information represented in the form of interval numbers, FNs or linguistic variables (Liu & Jin, 2012; Xu, 2009). Moreover, they have been implemented in a wide range of applications (Canós & Liern, 2008; Zarghami & Szidarovszky, 2009).

Probabilistic aggregation functions (or operators) are those functions that use probabilistic information in the aggregation process. Some examples are the aggregation with simple probabilities, the aggregation with belief structures (Merigó et al., 2010), the concept of immediate probabilities (Engemann et al., 1996; Yager et al., 1995) and the probabilistic OWA (POWA) operator (Merigó, 2012b).

The probabilistic weighted averaging (PWA) operator (Merigó, 2012a) is an aggregation operator that unifies the probability and the weighted average in the same formulation considering the degree of importance that each concept has in the aggregation. It is defined as follows.

                               is the weight that unifies probabilities and WAs in the same formulation.

As we can see, if β = 0, we get the simple probabilistic aggregation and if β = 1, the usual weighted average. One of the main advantages of this approach is that it is able to deal with subjective and objective information in the same formulation. Some further extensions of the PWA operator when dealing with uncertain information represented with interval numbers have been developed by Merigó et al. (2014).

The linguistic aggregation operators (Herrera et al., 1995; Xu, 2004b) are those types of aggregation operators that use linguistic information in the analysis. Some of the most usual ones are the linguistic average (LA), the linguistic weighted average (LWA) and the linguistic OWA (LOWA) operator. The LWA operator can be defined as follows.

Linguistic probabilistic and weighted aggregation operators are those functions that use probabilities and weighted averages in the same formulation and in an uncertain environment that can be assessed with linguistic information. A fundamental aggregation operator under this context is the linguistic PWA (LPWA) operator. It unifies the probability and the weighted average in the same formulation and considering the degree of importance that each concept has in the aggregation. Moreover, it is also able to deal with uncertain environments that can be represented by using linguistic variables. It can also be seen as an aggregation system that uses subjective, objective and linguistic information in the same formulation. It is defined as follows.

                            is the weight that unifies probabilities and WAs in the same formulation.

Note that it is also possible to formulate the LPWA operator separating the part that strictly affects the probabilistic information and the part that affects the LWAs. This representation is useful to see both models in the same formulation but it does not seem to be as a unique equation that unifies both models.

                            are the argument variables represented in the form of linguistic variables and δ ∈ [0, 1].

Observe that for simplicity, we use numerical values in the weights. The main reason is that with linguistic information in the weights, it is very difficult to have the sum of the weights equal to 1. How to deal with linguistic weights so as to be able to have them sum up to 1 is an open question for future research.

In the following, we are going to give a simple example on how to aggregate with the LPWA operator. We consider the aggregation with both definitions.

                           6). Assume the following probabilistic vector P = (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) and the following weighting vector V = (0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3). Note that the LWA has a degree of importance of 60% while the probabilistic vector P a degree of 40%. If we want to aggregate this information by using the LPWA operator, we get the following. The aggregation can be solved either with (6) or (7). With (6) we calculate the new weighting vector as:

If B is a vector corresponding to the ordered arguments sβi
                     , (we shall call this the ordered argument vector) and WT
                      is the transpose of the weighting vector, then, the LPWA operator can be expressed as:

The LPWA operator is monotonic, bounded and idempotent. It is monotonic because if sα
                        I
                      ≥ sεi
                     , for all i, then, LPWA (sα
                     
                     1,…, sαn
                     ) ≥ LPWA (sε
                     
                     1,…, sεn
                     ). It is bounded because the LPWA aggregation is delimitated by the minimum and the maximum. That is, Min{sαi
                     } ≤ LPWA (sα
                     
                     1, …, sαn
                     ) ≤ Max{sαi
                     }. It is idempotent because if sα
                        I
                      = sα
                     , for all i, then, LPWA (sα
                     
                     1, …, sαn
                     ) = sα
                     .

Another interesting issue to consider is the different families of LPWA operators that are found in the weighting vector W and the coefficient δ.

                        
                           •
                           If δ = 0, we get the LWA.

If δ = 1, we get the linguistic probabilistic aggregation (LPA).

                              , where k < n/2).

Note that other families of LPWA operators may be used following a similar methodology as it was developed for the OWA operator and its extensions (Merigó, 2012a; Yager, 1993).

A further interesting issue is to analyse the dispersion of the weighting vector. In doing so, it is possible to develop a generalization of the Shannon (1948) entropy as follows:

As we can see, if β = 1 or β = 0, this expression becomes the classical Shannon entropy of dispersion.

Following the research developed by other authors, it is possible to extend their approach to the PWA operator. Among others, it is worth noting the immediate probability and the hybrid average. Note that these methods were used for the OWA operator. However, it can also be implemented in this framework. For the immediate probabilities with linguistic information, the linguistic immediate weighted probability (LIWP) can be formed. It can be defined as follows:

By using the linguistic hybrid average (Xu, 2006; Xu & Da, 2003), the unification between the weighted average and the probability produces the linguistic hybrid weighted probabilistic average (LHWPA). It can be formulated in the following way:

A practical generalization of the LPWA operator can be developed by using generalized and quasi-arithmetic means (Fodor, Marichal, & Roubens, 1995; Merigó & Gil-Lafuente, 2013). Since the quasi-arithmetic mean includes the generalized mean as a particular case, let us look into it. In the LPWA operator, the use of the quasi-arithmetic mean forms the quasi-arithmetic LPWA (Quasi-LPWA) operator. Its main advantage is that it provides a robust formulation that includes a wide range of particular cases including quadratic and geometric aggregations. It can be defined as follows.

Both the Quasi-LPWA and the LGPWA accomplish properties similar to the LPWA operator including monotonicity, idempotency and the boundary condition. Moreover, they include a wide range of particular types. For example, by analyzing the parameter δ and the weighting vectors, the LPWA operator may become the following aggregation operators:

                        
                           •
                           If δ = 0, we get the Quasi-LWA.

If δ = 1, we get the Quasi-LPA.

The Quasi-A-LPA (A-LPA): pi = 1/n, for all j.

The Quasi-A-LWA: vi = 1/n, for all i.

The Quasi-LA: vi = 1/n, for all i, and pi = 1/n, for all j.

Note that many other families could be studied by using different functions in f and g, in the parameter δ and in the weighting vectors P and V. The main idea behind these particular types of operators is that the decision maker should use the specific case which better adapts to the needs of the problem considered.

Moving averages are aggregation operators that deal with dynamic information. This is especially useful when dealing with different periods of time as happens in time series forecasting (Merigó & Yager, 2013; Yager, 2008). Following the methodology explained by Merigó (2012a) regarding the use of the moving average in the PWA operator, it is possible to extend this approach to the LPWA framework forming the linguistic probabilistic weighted moving average (LPWMA). The main advantage of this approach is that it unifies the probability and the weighted average in a dynamic framework and in an uncertain environment where the information can be assessed with linguistic variables. In decision making, this approach allows for the construction of a new system that can be denominated as dynamic decision making under subjective and objective risk. Note that if the focus is in time series forecasting, this system becomes a multi-period decision making problem under subjective and objective risk. The LPWMA operator can be defined as follows:

                     where the sαi
                      are the argument variables represented in the form of linguistic variables, δ ∈ [0, 1], m and l are the total number of arguments considered from the whole sample, t and s indicate the movement done in the average from the initial analysis, f and g are strictly continuous monotonic functions.

The LPWMA operator can also be formulated separating the probability from the weighted average. With the Quasi-LPWMA operator it is required due to the functions f and g. In this framework, δ may change during the dynamic process because the degree of importance of each concept in the aggregation may change over time. Observe that for each period (sequence) the probabilities and the weights of the Quasi-LPWMA may also change in size and values. If their sizes are equal, it is assumed that both concepts are assessing the information in a similar way. If they are different, they are not exactly dealing with the same information and therefore the dynamic process is not the same. For example, under missing information in one of the concepts, the dynamic process has to be treated differently.

If δ = 1, the LPWMA becomes the linguistic probabilistic moving average (LPMA) and the Quasi-LPWMA, the Quasi-LPMA operator. If δ = 0, the linguistic weighted moving average (LWMA) and the Quasi-LWMA. Another interesting type of Quasi-LPWMA operator appears when f = aλ
                      and g = aχ
                     : the linguistic generalized probabilistic weighted moving average (LGPWMA). Note that many other particular cases of the Quasi-LPWMA operator could be studied following the methodology used in Table 1. Some other extensions could be developed by using other aggregation operators including mixture operators (Merigó, 2012a), utility measures (Gao, Li, & Liu, 2015) and Bonferroni means (Merigó, Casanovas, & Palacios-Marqués, 2014; Wei, Zhao, Lin, & Wang, 2013; Yager, 2009). Furthermore, with the LPWMA and the Quasi-LPWMA operator are also found in all the particular cases explained in Sections 3 and 4.

Decision making problems are very common in the literature (Zavadskas & Turskis, 2011; Zeng, 2013) because the real world is plenty of decisions, some of them being of extreme relevance that may condition the future of a country or even the World. A very remarkable example is the European Union (EU) as it is still in the construction process and many issues that involve decision and agreement processes have to be considered (Merigó, Lobato-Carral, & Carrilero-Castillo, 2012). Some important examples in the EU are found in EU law. The reason for this is that the creation of the EU (also the European Monetary Union (EMU) and deeper integrations) implies the establishment of new regulations that affect all the Member States. Since some of them may have different structures or opinions, sometimes it is not easy to find the optimal solution when several agreements are needed. Moreover, note that in extreme situations we may even find totally contradictory positions and thus it is not easy to obtain an optimal decision. At time in EU law this is very clear, especially when there are some countries that may prefer one type of regulation while some other may prefer another. In any case, it is clear that the main objective is to reach the most efficient decision that satisfies everyone as much as possible.

EU law (Chalmers & Davies, 2010) affects a wide range of fields including EU tax law, EU competition law, EU constitution law, EU common law, EU business and banking law and many other types of regulations. When making decisions in the formation of regulations, it can be referred to as a juridical decision making problem or a juridical decision support system. In this paper the focus is a juridical linguistic multi-person multi-criteria decision making approach by using the LPWA operator. Thus, this approach deals with subjective and objective information in the same problem forming a juridical decision making problem under subjective and objective risk. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows for the formation of robust decisions because it uses the opinion of several experts and criteria and in an uncertain environment that can be assessed with linguistic variables. These decisions are flexible because they can adapt into a wide range of scenarios according to the specific needs and complexities of the problem considered. Among others, it is worth noting situations with only objective probabilities (LPA) and those with only subjective probabilities (LWA). Looking to the real world, this approach represents this type of decisions by considering the opinion of the different experts (or governments of the countries). However, further analysis is needed in order to represent these opinions avoiding manipulation of the information in order to obtain more favorable results and other related variables.

Linguistic decision making methodologies are very common in the literature (Xu, 2012; Yang & Wang, 2013). The procedure to follow when dealing with juridical linguistic multi-person multi-criteria decision making under subjective and objective risk is summarized as follows.

Once each expert has aggregated his results according to each criterion, their opinions have to be aggregated in order to form the general collective results. For doing so, use the weighted average to aggregate the information of the decision makers E by using the weighting vector Z. The result is the linguistic collective payoff matrix (sgi
                              )

Calculate the aggregated results by using the LPWA operator explained in Eqs. (6) and (7). Consider different families of LPWA operators by using different expressions as it explained in Section 3.

Adoption of decisions according to the results found in the previous steps. Select the alternative/s that provides the best result/s. Establish a ranking of the alternatives from the most to the less preferred alternative in order to consider more than one option.

The aggregation process used in this decision making system can be summarized using the following aggregation operator that we call the multi-person multi-criteria – LPWA (MP-MC-LPWA) operator.

The MP-MC-LPWA operator has similar properties to those explained in Section 3 and includes a wide range of particular cases including the following:

                        
                           •
                           The multi-person multi-criteria - LPA (MP-MC-LPA) operator.

The multi-person multi-criteria - LWA (MP-MC-LWA) operator.

The multi-person multi-criteria - linguistic arithmetic mean (MP-MC-LAM).

The multi-person multi-criteria - arithmetic-LPA (MP-ALPA) operator.

The multi-person multi-criteria - arithmetic-LWA (MP-ALWA) operator.

More complex expressions could be considered by using different types of aggregation operators in the aggregation of the criterion and the experts opinion instead of using the LWA operator. For example, the LPWA or the Quasi-LPWA operator could be used, among others.

In this Section, let us present a simple numerical example of the new approach in a judicial linguistic multi-criteria multi-person decision making problem. The example is focused on a judicial problem regarding the creation of a new regulation in the EU. Note that the example is based on the use of the methodology explained in Section 6. However, in real world problems, many other issues may appear since different political parties may have different interests and the agreement should be focused on obtaining the most efficient decision. In the example, the idea is to deal with available given information, predict the different results that may occur and produce a decision that is in closest accordance with the interests of the decision maker.


                     Step 1. Assume that the EU government decides to establish a new regulation regarding a fundamental issue for the development of the economy. Initially, they consider five possible alternatives:

                        
                           •
                           A1 = very strong flexibility in the creation of a new regulation.

A2 = strong flexibility in the new regulation.

A3 = medium flexibility in the new regulation.

A4 = low flexibility (or strong restriction) in the new regulation.

A5 = very low flexibility (or very strong restriction) in the new regulation.

The European government uses a group of experts to assess the decision problem. After careful review of the information, the group of experts establishes that three criteria determine the strategy for the regulation:

                        
                           1.
                           Economic environment of the country (internal).

World economic situation for the next year (external).

Other variables (type of companies in the EU, etc.).

For the three criteria they consider five possible scenarios that may occur the next period and determines the potential benefits obtained with each strategy.

                        
                           •
                           
                              T
                              1: very good economic situation.


                              T
                              2: good economic situation.


                              T
                              3: regular economic situation.


                              T
                              4: bad economic situation.


                              T
                              5: very bad economic situation.


                     Step 2. The group of experts is divided in three sections, each offering their own opinion regarding the results found with each strategy. In this example, each section is considered as one expert (or person). Each expert provides their opinion regarding the potential benefits obtained with each judicial strategy depending on the criteria considered and the state of nature that occurs in the future. First, the experts analyze the potential benefits considering the first criteria. Their results are provided by using a linguistic term set: S = {s
                     1, s
                     2, s
                     3, s
                     4, s
                     5, s
                     6, s
                     7, s
                     8, s
                     9}. The results given by each expert for the first criteria are shown in Tables 1–3.
                  

In order to form a collective result for the first criteria, the previous information has to be aggregated. It is assumed that the experts have the following degrees of importance in the first criteria: E1 = (0.5, 0.25, 0.25). The collective results are shown in Table 5.
                  

Observe that the calculation of Table 5 comes from the data available in Tables 2–4
                     
                     
                      and is calculated as follows: for (A
                     1, T
                     1): 0.5 × s
                     3 + 0.25 × s
                     1 + 0.25 × s
                     1 = s
                     (0.
                     5 × 3 + 0.
                     25 × 1 + 0.
                     25 × 1 = 2
                     ) = s
                     2.

Next, the experts analyse the second criteria. In this case, they assume the following importance: E2 = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). The results given by each expert for the second criteria are given in Tables 6
                     –8
                     
                      and the collective results in Table 9.
                     
                  

The same methodology is developed for the third criteria. The degrees of importance of each expert for the third criteria are: E3 = (0.5, 0.25, 0.25). The results provided by each expert are shown in Tables 10
                     –12
                     
                      and the collective results in Table 13.
                     
                  


                     Step 3. Once the collective results for all the criteria are obtained, it is possible to aggregate these collective results in order to form the general expected result. It is assumed that the degree of importance of each criteria is: Y = (0.25, 0.25, 0.5). The results are shown in Table 14.
                     
                  


                     Step 4. In this problem, the experts assume the following weighting vectors regarding the probability or possibility that each state of nature will occur: P = (0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3) and V = (0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1). Note that the probabilities have a degree of importance of 30% while the LWA 70%.


                     Step 5. With this information, the expected results can be aggregated for each juridical strategy. In Table 15
                     , different results obtained are presented by using different types of LPWA operators including the linguistic average (LA), the LWA, the LPA, the LPWA, the arithmetic – LWA (A-LWA) and the arithmetic – LPA (A-LPA). Note that the selection of the aggregation operator used depends on the available information. If subjective and objective information is available, we should use the LPWA. If only subjective information is available, we should use the LWA or the A-LWA. On the other hand, if we only have objective information, we should select the LPA or the A-LPA. Note that in the A-LWA and in the A-LPA, the assumption is that the missing part can be treated as equiprobable. The LA is used when we want to believe that all the data is equiprobable.


                     Step 6. Finally, a ranking of the alternatives is established, a typical situation in order to consider more than one alternative. The results are shown in Table 16.
                     
                  

As we can see, depending on the aggregator operator used, the ordering of the strategies may be different. Note that the main advantage of using the LPWA operator is that it can consider a wide range of particular cases and select the one in closest accordance to the interests or beliefs of the decision maker. In this example, it seems that the optimal choice for the decision maker is A
                     5 although A
                     1 and A
                     2 are also possible alternatives to be selected if the probabilistic information becomes more influential than the weighted average.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A new linguistic multi-criteria group decision making method has been introduced. It deals with uncertain environments that can be assessed with linguistic information. We have used linguistic probabilistic and weighted aggregation operators, such as the LPWA operator, in the analysis. It is a new aggregation operator that unifies the probability and the weighted average considering the degree of importance that each concept has in the analysis and in an uncertain environment assessed with linguistic variables. We have studied several properties and particular cases including the LA, the LWA, the LPA, the arithmetic LPA and the arithmetic LWA operator.

Further generalizations of the LPWA operator have been developed, including the generalized LPWA (LGPWA) operator and the quasi-arithmetic LPWA (Quasi-LPWA) operator. Their main advantage is that they include a wide range of particular cases including the LPWA operator and many others such as quadratic and harmonic aggregations. Additionally, these new aggregation operators have also been extended by using moving averages, forming the linguistic probabilistic weighted moving average (LPWMA) and the generalized LPWMA (GLPWMA) operator.

The applicability of the LPWA operator and its generalizations was studied in a juridical linguistic multi-person multi-criteria decision making problem under subjective and objective risk concerning the selection of a new regulation in the EU. In doing so, the MPMCLPWA operator was introduced. Its main advantage is that it can consider the subjective and objective opinions of the problem in an uncertain environment and be represented by linguistic variables from several experts and criteria. The numerical example has shown that depending on the particular type of LPWA operator used, the results may be different, leading to different decisions. Additionally, it is worth noting that any previous study that deals with linguistic information and the weighted average or the probability, can be revised and extended with this new approach. Principally, because the LPWA includes the weighted average and the probabilistic aggregation as particular cases. Therefore, many other applications could be developed in a wide range of areas including economics and engineering.

In future research, we expect to develop further developments to this approach by using more complex formulations such as the use of distance measures and unified aggregation operators. Other concepts will be considered in the analysis such as the OWA operator. Moreover, the applicability will be expanded to other research domains (Merigó, Palacios-Marqués, & Benavides-Espinosa, 2015) including statistics and other decision making problems.
