                  Respiratory drug delivery has been under the research spotlight for the past few decades, mainly due to the high incidence of pulmonary diseases and the fact that this type of delivery offers the highest efficiency for treatment. Despite its invaluable benefits, there are some major drawbacks to respiratory drug delivery, the most important of which being poor delivery efficiency and relatively high drug deposition in undesirable regions, such as the mouth cavity. One way to improve the efficiency of respiratory drug delivery with metered-dose inhalers is placing a respiratory spacer between the inhaler exit and the mouth. It is argued that high drug deposition in the immediate airways of the respiratory system is strongly affected by relatively high initial momentum of pharmaceutical particles leaving the inhaler. A respiratory spacer, however, can provide an expansion region in which the initial momentum of particles can subside. As a result, particles enter the patient׳s oral cavity more gradually and are more likely to reach the desired regions. In this study, the effectiveness of using three commercial spacers paired with a commercial inhaler is examined through numerical investigation of fluid flow and particle transport phenomena. Particles ranging from 1 to 50µm in diameter are tracked using a Lagrangian point of view and fluid flow fields are resolved using the LRN k-ω turbulence model. A novel particle injection method is introduced and is demonstrated to be able to adequately capture the effects of particle initial momentum. Lastly, a few design suggestions are made.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Respiratory drug delivery is currently considered to be the most promising method for directly relieving or treating respiratory diseases, such as asthma. As compared with other methods, there are some unique advantages to this type of respiratory drug administration such as lack of exposure to digestive acids and enzymes, unmediated contact with afflicted regions of the pulmonary tract, and rather instantaneous effect. On the other hand, one of the drawbacks that is typically attributed to pulmonary drug delivery is considerable deposition of drug particles in undesired locations, which, in turn, reduces its effectiveness. Furthermore, unfavorable take-up of medication poses health hazards to patients.

Among all pharmaceutical administration devices, metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) are undoubtedly the most popular. Although in common use, MDIs are known to result in poor drug delivery efficiency. This poor efficiency is typically attributed to the fact that MDIs impart an undesirably high initial momentum to the particles, which in turn increases unwanted deposition of particles in the oral cavity and upper airways. It is becoming more and more commonplace to use some sort of extension between inhaler outlet and mouth inlet in order to reduce the initial momentum of drug particles. Such extensions are typically referred to as respiratory spacers or simply spacers. Making use of a spacer is likely to improve the quality of respiratory drug delivery by providing a space for pharmaceutical particles to lose their initial momentum. As a result, drug particles are less likely to impact against the immediate walls of the oral cavity and upper airways.

During the past few decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has emerged as a powerful tool for capturing both airflow and particle transport characteristics in human airways. CFD simulations can be used to directly address complicated and interconnected geometrical and physical factors related to both particles and airflow, such as flow turbulence [1], breathing patterns [2], the impact of discrete particles on continuous phase [3], and Brownian motion of particles [4].

The main objective of this study is a numerical investigation of the transport and deposition of therapeutic particles, delivered by a commercially available MDI, in realistic models of the inhaler coupled with three commercial spacers. In this study, fluid flow is practically transient due to the transient nature of both breathing and delivery of drug particles to the spacer inlet. It is, however, well established that steady-state simulations using average flow rates are computationally efficient and able to estimate average deposition patterns that are in good agreement with in vivo and ex vivo experimental results [1,5]. Therefore, transient delivery of drug particles can also be approximated as being steady, at least within the scope of the present work.

                      at injector nozzle, for an average inhalation flow rate of 30lpm [6,7]) and geometrical irregularities associated with the inhaler and spacers, laminar to transitional and even fully turbulent flow is expected. To resolve these multiple flow regimes, the low Reynolds number (LRN) k-ω model is adopted based on its ability to accurately predict pressure drop, velocity profiles, and shear stresses for transitional and turbulent flows [8]. This model has been used successfully to accurately predict particle deposition profiles for transitional and turbulent flows in models of the oral airways [9,10] and multiple bifurcations [1].

The first application of CFD to study inhaler design was conducted by Versteeg et al. [11], where CFD was utilized to predict steady-state airflow through an experimental MDI package and the Astra Zeneca Pulmicort® MDI, and to model an aerosol plume emitted within a USP induction port (USP-IP). Flow fields through both MDIs were found to be similar and highly complex. Jet flows emerging from the annulus around the canister were simulated and multiple regions of recirculation were evident resulting in high levels of turbulence. In this study the majority of deposition was found within the horizontal regions of the USP throat, which is consistent with findings of more recent research [12]. However, Versteeg et al. [11] acknowledged that due to technological limitations at the time only qualitative agreement between the CFD model and experiment could be achieved.

Subsequent CFD studies on MDI and spacer devices have been done with a particular focus on the deposition of droplets within the device or spacer and the USP-IP or realistic mouth-throat geometries (MT). In a recent study, Longest and Hindle [13] evaluated the performance of the Respimat® Soft Mist Inhaler (SMI) through the concurrent use of CFD and in vitro experiments into the USP-IP and realistic mouth-throat geometry (MT). In vitro experiments indicated a substantial drug deposition loss of 27-29%. However, deposition of the Respimat® within the USP-IP and the MT was found to be relatively low, with most of the drug deposition occurring within the Respimat® mouthpiece. This high drug deposition observed within the mouthpiece was in good agreement with the CFD solution (within 20% error).

Kleinstreuer et al. performed a comprehensive study [14] to simulate the airflow, droplet spray transport, and aerosol deposition in an MDI attached to a human upper airway model. Different device propellants, nozzle diameters, and spacer use were also investigated in this study. Results of CFD simulations exhibited multiple vortices within the inhaler and attached spacer at a flow rate of 30lpm. Utilizing a spacer significantly reduced droplet deposition within the oral cavity and, as a result, a greater proportion of droplets reached the lung in comparison with the case of not using a spacer. For CFC-MDIs actuated without a spacer, only 5.2% of released droplets reached the lung whilst 52.9% of droplets reached the lung when a spacer was used. Similarly, in HFA-MDIs, 46.6% of released droplets made their way to the lung in the absence of a spacer whilst 74.6% reached the lung when a spacer was used. These simulation results were in good agreement with both ex vivo and in vivo tests [15].

Although a great deal of experimental and numerical studies have been devoted to investigating particle transport and deposition in human upper airways, relatively little work has been conducted in order to better quantify the particle transport phenomena in realistic models of commercially available spacer-inhalers. The fact that the previously utilized geometrical models are over-simplified (inhalers and spacers׳ geometries are often simplified and plastic quadrants which have considerable effect on the flow field are not included in the models) puts the accuracy of prior numerical studies in question and calls for more realistic investigation. In addition, particle injection conditions need to be more realistic so that the effects of particle initial momentum can be appropriately captured. In the present work, realistic models of three commercially available spacers and one MDI are developed, and care is exercised to capture almost all associated geometrical complexities. A novel particle injection method is proposed which is argued to be capable of properly capturing the impact of initial particle momentum and injection jet penetration on the characteristics of particle transport and deposition. This injection method is discussed in details in Section 3.

The k-ω turbulence model with low-Reynolds number (LRN) corrections has been proved to be able to successfully predict the average velocity profiles, pressure drop, and shear stresses for the multi-regime flow field in human airways [1,9,10]. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations governing the conservation of mass and momentum for the case of incompressible laminar and turbulent fluid flows are represented in Eqs. (1a) and (1b).

In the previous section an Eulerian approach was introduced to resolve the continuous phase flow field. Micro-particles, on the other hand, can be either treated on a continuous Eulerian basis or a discrete Lagrangian one. To date, both approaches have been utilized successfully in case of respiratory particles. The key point to make is that if treating the particles as a continuous phase, it is not possible to account for particle inertia effects on deposition rates [17]. However, it is well established that inertia is one of the major mechanisms affecting the transport and deposition of micron-sized particles. Since micron-sized inert particles are under the scope of the present study, Lagrangian point of view is adopted. The general form of the trajectory equations for a single particle with constant mass is as presented in Eq. (6a) and (6b).

In this study, it is assumed that the other forces, which are known to affect the particle trajectories under certain circumstances, are negligible.

It is well known that fluid turbulence results in enhanced dispersion of particles [1,5,9,10,19–21]. In the course of tracking a discrete particle in a turbulent field it is required that, at each time-step, velocity fluctuations be superimposed on time-averaged velocity vector. Velocity fluctuations, (Eq. (8)), should be appropriately estimated from scalar turbulent parameters at the location of particle.

                         and a standard deviation of unity [22,23]. The main shortcoming of this Random Walk approach is the assumption of isotropic velocity components. This assumption does not hold true in near-wall regions, and results in deposition overestimation of small particles. In order to account for turbulence anisotropy, especially in near-wall regions, more sophisticated models are required that are not considered in this study.

In order to develop realistic geometrical models, a commercial inhaler, Proventil®–HFA (albuterol sulfate), and three spacers were procured. Great care was practiced to measure the respective dimensions of each and develop its 3-dimensional model. The isometric views of these spacer–inhaler pairs are given in 
                        Fig. 1a-c. The spacers represented in Fig. 1a–c are, respectively, referred to as type I, type II, and type III. Volumes of these spacers are 0.224, 0.880, and 0.192l, respectively. Each spacer demonstrates an expansion region which is supposed to harness the initial momentum of the therapeutic burst leaving the inhaler. The expansion region is followed by an obstruction which is apparently intended to filter out undesirably coarse particles through inertial impaction and prevent them from finding their way to the patient׳s airways. To the best of our knowledge, this impaction section as well as geometrical irregularities associated with the pressured gas canister and its holder has not been considered in previous works.

In type I and III the impaction plane is, respectively, followed and preceded by a set of four plastic quadrants, which deflect open during inhalation and close during exhalation. In type II, however, the impaction plane slides open and close during inhalation and exhalation, respectively. The geometrical models are created with the valves open, since the scope of this study is transport and deposition of therapeutic particles during inhalation. In type I and III the presence of plastic quadrants has a considerable impact on fluid flow fields. As a result, excluding them in the physical models may lead to highly erroneous results especially in the course of particle tracking.

A constant volume flow rate of 30lpm (average flow rate for an adult person under light activity conditions during inhalation) is imposed on the spacer outlet and a gauge pressure of zero on the inhaler inlet. Drug particles have been reported to leave the inhaler at an initial velocity of approximately 150m/s for the inhaler of our interest [14]. The injection period is measured by means of sequential photography as shown in 
                        Fig. 2a-c. Fig. 2a and c indicate the start and stop of the therapeutic burst, respectively. The time interval between the images is 1/60s and total injection time is, therefore, approximately 0.05s.

Since the injection time is relatively small as compared to the inhalation time (approximately 1.3s), one common approximation could be ignoring the effects of the short-term burst and investigate the problem under the aforementioned mass-flow and pressure boundary conditions. The main challenge, however, arises when one considers injecting drug particles in a rather realistic manner.

It is argued that micron-sized particles quickly adapt themselves to the flow field. Therefore, realistic modeling of the behavior of injected particles calls for modeling the carrier gas in a realistic manner. The injection orifice is 0.5mm in diameter with an injection velocity of 150m/s [14]. If one attempts to fully incorporate these two facts, the first results in undesirably small mesh sizes at the injection port and the latter brings about convergence problems if the flow near the injection plane is not assumed to be compressible, as in the case of this study. As we aimed at imparting the particles at a realistic initial momentum, the injection plane is assumed to have a diameter of 4mm which is 8 times its original value. Assuming a constant momentum rate, it can be readily concluded that the injection velocity should be taken at one-eighth its original value.

This assumption can be put on a more solid foundation with the following argument. It is assumed that the jet is a cylindrical fluid element with a kinetic energy proportional to ρD
                        
                           2

                        , where ρ, D, and V are density, diameter, and velocity, respectively. The work done by viscous effects on the jet is proportional to τ

                        DL, where L is the penetration length of the jet. Equating these two expressions yields L=ρDV

                        DV. Then, it follows that the penetration length remains approximately unchanged provided that the product of DV is kept constant. The particles are, therefore, assumed to be injected with a carrier flow of a velocity of about 20m/s through an orifice of 4mm in diameter. In order to support this idea, velocity contours are compared in 
                        Fig. 3 for cases of V=20m/s, D=4mm and V=40m/s, D=2mm, and a striking similarity is observed. In addition, particle tracking results for these two cases demonstrate that particle deposition fractions are in good agreement with each other with a maximum deviation of about 5% (Fig. 3c).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS@&#

Grid study results for spacer type III are shown in 
                        
                        
                        Figs. 5a-d and 6a and b. The red line indicated in Fig. 4 is taken as a reference in order to compare velocity components for different computational grids. This line runs across the region that is characterized by high velocity gradients due to fluid injection as well as flow recirculation caused by the sudden expansion of the spacer. Flow fields are resolved for computational grids comprising approximately 700,000; 1,300,000; 1,600,000; 3,000,000; and 3,800,000 computational cells. The elements are mainly refined in the regions of high velocity gradient and in the vicinities of the walls. Near-wall regions are refined so that the values of y
                        + are kept below 5, which is said to be essential to the accuracy of enhanced wall treatment in the transitional k-ω model. It is observed that velocity profiles along the red line and pressure drop values along the inhaler–spacer are in good agreement for grids including more than 3,000,000 cells with variations of less than 5%.

Particle deposition efficiency is taken as another criterion for grid-independency examination, because it is highly dependent on grid quality especially in near-wall regions. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, once again the latter two grids result in almost identical particle deposition curves, with variations of less than 7%. Therefore, the grid with 3,000,000 computational cells is considered to yield results that are grid-independent. The same procedure was performed for the other two spacers, but the results are not presented here for the sake of brevity.

Fluid flow fields are resolved using the k-ω turbulence model of the ANSYS Fluent® CFD package. Ideally, the therapeutic jet should leave the canister aligned with the central axis of the spacer. Otherwise, the impaction sections of the spacers do not function properly. According to the geometry of the inhaler–spacer, if the carrier flow is assumed to leave in a direction perpendicular to the injection plane, the therapeutic jet turns out to be nonaxial. Therefore, carrier gas should be assumed to be injected in the direction of the spacer axis rather than perpendicular to the injection port.

Mid-plane velocity contours in the case of perpendicular injection are presented in 
                        Fig. 7a-c for inhaler-spacer types I, II, and III, respectively. For the sake of comparison, contours of velocity magnitude for the case of axial injection are presented in 
                        Fig. 8a-c for inhaler-spacer types I, II, and III, respectively. It is observed that the particle blast in the latter case heads straight toward the impaction plane. In this case, the impaction section efficiently filters out particles smaller than its respective cut-off diameter.

In order to have a clearer picture of the flow fields, sample stream traces are represented in 
                        
                        Figs. 9 and 10 for the three pairs, with mid-plane velocity contours in the backgrounds. The sudden expansion of spacers results in regions of recirculating flows, which in turn results in considerable particle entrapment. In the case of non-axial injection, larger regions of recirculation are observed, which means more particle entrapment and deposition as compared with the case of axial injection.

For particles under the mentioned flow conditions, two different deposition mechanisms can be considered effective; namely, inertial impaction and turbulent dispersion. The first refers to the deposition of larger particles with less ability to adapt their paths to the variations of the velocity field, and the second is diffusion and deposition of particles under the effects of turbulent eddies.

Particle deposition curves for the three inhaler–spacer pairs are presented in 
                        Fig. 11 for three different injection conditions; namely, zero-momentum particle injection, non-axial injection with a carrier gas, and axial injection with a carrier gas. Sample deposition patterns are also presented in 
                        Fig. 12a-c. For the sake of generality, particles ranging from 1 to 50µm are considered in the course of particle tracking study. For each size 1000 mono-disperse particles
                           1

                           Particle number independency of deposition result was checked and showed that tracking about 1000 particles of each size was enough.
                         are released from the injector surface and tracked. Because of the stochastic nature of the Random Walk method, particle tracking is repeated three times and the average values are reported here. No particle rebound and reentrainment are considered at the solid walls and spacer outlet, respectively.

The results of the zero initial momentum case are the least realistic since the effects of particle initial momentum are not captured. For non-axial injection, at least nearly 30% of the particles are filtered out through the type II spacer and, under the same injection conditions, the minimal deposition fractions are 40% and 70% for spacer type III and I, respectively. In the more realistic case of axial injection, the minimal deposition fractions are approximately 45%, 55%, and 70% for spacer type II, type III, and type I, respectively.

High deposition fractions of more than 30%, even for small particles, are partly due to the overestimation of the Random Walk model. Therefore, deposition fractions of particles within the early part of size range of our study should be referred to with caution. The highest amount of particle entrapment for spacer type I can be contributed to the fact that it features the greatest extent of flow recirculation both in the expansion region and downstream from the impaction plane and plastic quadrants. It should also be noted that placing the plastic quadrants in the recirculatory region downstream from the impaction plane results in the highest amount of particle deposition on them, as compared with the other two types. Fig. 12a supports the fact that a large number of tracked particles are deposited on the plastic quadrants of spacer type I.

It can be observed from Fig. 11 that the deposition curves of spacer type II do not exhibit sharp cut-off diameters, because of the fact that the expansion region is so large that the initial momentum of particles is almost completely suppressed. Therefore, it can be said that the sliding plane in this type of spacer merely acts as a one-way valve and not as an impaction section. It can also be observed that, of all three cases, deposition fractions are the lowest for spacer type II. This can be attributed to the fact that the impaction mechanism is not effective for this type of spacer.

The last thing that should be noted is the difference between particle paths using or not using the Random Walk model, as presented in 
                     Fig. 13a and b. In the case of mean-velocity particle tracking, as shown in Fig. 13a, particle trajectories are smooth. In Random-Walk particle tracking, however, particle paths are not smooth because of the impact of turbulent velocity fluctuations on particles, which in turn tends to increase particle deposition.

In order to validate the numerical method and model, results of particle deposition in the case of spacer type I with axial injection are compared with ex vivo experiments conducted by Iula et al. [24]. In this experiment, the size distribution characteristics of an Azmacort® MDI in combination with four different commercial spacers are measured with an 8-stage Andersen cascade impactor. Size distribution results with and without the AeroChamber® spacer (which is identical to spacer type I) are compared with the deposition curve (Fig. 11c) acquired from our numerical simulation, shown in 
                        Table 1.

As illustrated in Table 1, provided that the initial mass fraction of an inhaler is known the results of the numerical solution can be used to predict the mass fraction leaving the spacer within an error of less than 21% percent. It is also to be noted that Iula׳s experiments were done using a flow rate of 28.3lpm, which is approximately the same as the one adopted in this study (30lpm).

The discrepancies observed between the experimental and numerical results may be attributed to the following facts:
                           
                              •
                              The Random Walk model does not fully capture the actual turbulence effects.

The wide range of particles that are trapped in each stage of the cascade impactor (for example 5.8–9μm) make it difficult to estimate the average deposition fractions for discrete particle sizes.

Experimental and numerical flow rates are about 2lpm different.

Transport and deposition of micron-sized drug particles are investigated for three commercial spacers coupled with a common inhaler. It was observed that in order to realistically capture the effects of particle initial momentum, the burst of particle-laden carrier gas has to be included in the course of numerical simulations of flow fields. In order to simplify the solution procedure, it is argued that the injector diameter and injection velocities can be manipulated to more favorable values provided that the rate of momentum injection remains constant.

Regions of circulatory flow are observed inside the spacer and especially downstream of the spacer entrance and impaction regions. These recirculation regions in turn result in undesirable particle entrapment. Therefore, the first design implication of this study is to alter the geometry in order to reduce the number and extent of circulatory regions through, for instance, stream-lining the geometry, avoiding sudden expansions, etc.
                  

Spacer type I is characterized by the highest deposition fractions; a fact that may arise from its relatively small dimensions which might be inappropriate to harness the initial momentum of drug particles. Another point to be made here is that the impaction plane, in spacer type I, is followed, and not preceded, by a set of four pliable plastic quadrants that collectively act as a one-way valve. This is shown to result in excessively high particle deposition on the impaction plane and plastic quadrants. This, however, does not hold true for spacer III that is preceded by an equivalent set of plastic plates. In conclusion, the second design implication of this study is that the preferred placement of plastic quadrants is before the impaction section of the spacer, as in the case of spacer III.

It is observed that spacers type I and III show steeper deposition curves with distinct cut-off sizes. A distinct cut-off size is considered to be a positive characteristic of a respiratory spacer since it allows it to neatly filter out particles larger than an upper-limit particle diameter depending on the disease and favorable deposition regions in the respiratory system. Therefore, one single spacer is not recommended for all types of respiratory drug delivery and the specific design should be chosen so that favorable particles are guaranteed to pass through the spacer and undesirable particles are filtered out.

Last but not least, keeping flow turbulence down to a minimum is recommended so that turbulent diffusion of particles diminishes and inertial impaction dominates particle deposition [25]. Doing so makes it a lot easier to design a spacer best suited to the preferred particle size criteria for a particular disease, and a sharper cut-off curve can be expected.
