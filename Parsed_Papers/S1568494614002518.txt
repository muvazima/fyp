               Abstract
               
                  This paper proposes a framework based on the Dempster–Shafer Theory of Evidence (DSTE), Possibility Theory (PT) and Fuzzy Random Variables (FRVs) to represent expert knowledge and propagate uncertainty through models. An example of application is given with reference to a check valve of a turbo-pump lubricating system in a Nuclear Power Plant, which is degrading due to mechanical fatigue and undergoes condition-based maintenance interventions. The component degradation-failure model used to evaluate the performance of the maintenance policy contains parameters subject to epistemic uncertainty.
