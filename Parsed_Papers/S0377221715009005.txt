                  The concept of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is used in various applications in uncertain environment. This paper introduces CVaR (superquantile) norm for a random variable, which is by definition CVaR of absolute value of this random variable. It is proved that CVaR norm is indeed a norm in the space of random variables. CVaR norm is defined in two variations: scaled and non-scaled. L-1 and L-infinity norms are limiting cases of the CVaR norm. In continuous case, scaled CVaR norm is a conditional expectation of the random variable. A similar representation of CVaR norm is valid for discrete random variables. Several properties for scaled and non-scaled CVaR norm, as a function of confidence level, were proved. Dual norm for CVaR norm is proved to be the maximum of L-1 and scaled L-infinity norms. CVaR norm, as a Measure of Error, is related to a Regular Risk Quadrangle. Trimmed L1-norm, which is a non-convex extension for CVaR norm, is introduced analogously to function L-p for p < 1. Linear regression problems were solved by minimizing CVaR norm of regression residuals.

The concept of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is widely used in risk management and various applications in uncertain environment. This paper introduces a concept of CVaR norm in the space of random variables. CVaR norm in 
                        
                           R
                           n
                        
                      was introduced in (Pavlikov & Uryasev, 2014) and developed in (Gotoh & Uryasev, 2013), and is a particular case of general error measures introduced and developed by Rockafellar, Uryasev, and Zabarankin (2008). The term “superquantile”, free from dependence on financial terminology, can be used as a neutral alternative name for “CVaR”, like it was done in Rockafellar and Royset (2010); Rockafellar and Uryasev (2013). For the similar reason the alternative name “superquantile norm” is proposed to replace “CVaR norm” when desired. For the sake of consistency within the paper and with the earlier study (Pavlikov & Uryasev, 2014), this paper will use mostly the “CVaR norm” term.

This section provides a short introduction in the CVaR norm in 
                        
                           R

                      and shows the relation with the CVaR norm in the space of random variables. This paper is motivated by applications of norms in optimization. We consider norms in 
                        
                           R

                      and in the space of random variables. We use symbols x and xi
                      for a vector and an ith vector component in

                      and Lp
                      norms are considered in the space of random variables. For p ∈ [1, ∞], the norms lp
                      and Lp

A similar norm, called D-norm, was introduced in Bertsimas, Pachamanova, and Sim (2004, Section 3) in a different way. D-norm is defined as a maximum of a sum of weighted absolute values of vector components. The maximization is performed over all sets of indexes for components in the sum, with a constraint on cardinality. For

Both CVaR norm and D-norm can be viewed as important special cases of Ordered Weighting Averaging (OWA) operators, see Merigó and Yager (2013); Torra and Narukawa (2007); Yager (2010). A subfamily of OWA operators with monotonically non-increasing weights, when implied to the absolute values of the vector, were formalized as norms in Yager (2010). The worst-case averages, corresponding to CVaR, were also studied, e.g., in Ogryczak and Zawadzki (2002); Romeijn, Ahuja, Dempsey, and Kumar (2005).

The paper (Pavlikov & Uryasev, 2014, Definition 1) has also defined scaled CVaR norm

Item 3 from Proposition 2.1 can be viewed as a stochastic generalization of Hall and Tymoczko (2012, Lemma 1). Paper (Hall & Tymoczko, 2012) considers functions Σj

                      reduction of special cases of CVaR norm. Paper (Hall & Tymoczko, 2012) relies on majorization theory, see (Marshall, Olkin, & Arnold, 2011), which is generalized for the stochastic case with a concept of stochastic dominance, see Ogryczak and Ruszczynski (2002); Dentcheva and Ruszczynski (2003, e.g.).

This paper considers also non-convex functions closely related to CVaR norm. In deterministic case, by definition, CVaR norm is the average of biggest

                           1

                           α

                           n
                        
                      absolute values of components of a vector. The trimmed L1-norm is also known as a trimmed sum of absolute deviations estimator for LTA regression, see (Hawkins & Olive, 1999; Bassett Jr, 1991; Hössjer, 1994, e.g.). L1-based LTA regression is introduced similarly to the more common L2-based Least-Trimmed-Squares (LTS) regression, see Zabarankin and Uryasev (2014b, e.g.). Trimmed L1-norm is denoted here by tα
                     , it is the average of smallest αn absolute values of components of a vector. Calculation formulas and mathematical properties for tα
                     (x) in Eucledian space and Tα
                     (X) in the space of random variables are considered in Section 3. Trimmed L1-norm is also related to the sparse optimization, similar to functions lp
                      for 0 < p < 1, see Ge, Jiang, and Ye (2011). Note that the constraint on trimmed L1-norm directly specifies sparsity of the solution vector (see Item 6 of Section 3), compared to “indirect” sparsity specification with lp
                      function. This paper also provides an illustration for tα

                     (|X|) function family. Unfortunately, these functions are not convex or concave in general, and are out of the scope of this study, although robust regression applications based on these functions is a promising research direction.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a formal definition of CVaR norm in stochastic case and enlists various mathematical of CVaR norm, including that it is indeed a norm and a regular measure of error. CVaR norm is a parametric family of norms with respect to the confidence parameter α, properties of CVaR norm as a function of α are proved. Dual representation of the CVaR norm is derived, and a dual norm to the CVaR norm is defined. A short introduction to the concept of Risk Quadrangle is given. We derive the quadrangle related to the CVaR norm as a measure of error and we prove that this quadrangle is regular. Section 3 defines the trimmed L1-norm, both in

                      and in the space of random variables, and enlists several basic properties. The trimmed L1-norm is an extension of CVaR norm, but it is not actually a norm. Section 4 illustrates properties of CVaR norm with a case study. Section 5 provides concluding remarks and acknowledgements.

Paper (Ge et al., 2011) considers a class of functions defined similar to Lp
                      norms, but for p ∈ [0, 1). These functions are not norms and they are concave for some regions of the space they are defined

                        For p ∈ [0, 1) there is lp
                           (x) in

                            and Lp
                           (X) in the space of random variables. Concavity holds, for example, for region x ≥ 0 in 
                              
                                 R

                            and for region X ≥ 0 in the space of random variables.
                     . Such functions are used in optimization problems to achieve a sparse solution vector. We will define a similar functions in terms of CVaR concept.

Further we define trimmed L1-norm. Contrary to CVaR norm, this function takes average over smallest α-fraction of absolute values |X| of a random variable X. The word “norm” here is potentially deceptive, since it corresponds to L1 and not the resulting function itself: trimmed L1-norm is not actually a norm. The term “trimmed” is widely used in robust regression, when the average of a few smallest regression residuals is minimized. Before averaging, residuals are usually transformed with some function

                      corresponds to the least trimmed sum of absolute deviations (LTA) regression, see Bassett Jr (1991); Hawkins and Olive (1999); Hössjer (1994), it also corresponds to the trimmed L1-norm function here, see below. The general case for arbitrary function ϕ was described in Neykov, Čížek, Filzmoser, and Neytchev (2012, formula (3)) and formalized for random variables via average quantile function in Zabarankin and Uryasev (2014b, problem (6.5.9)).

One possible way to define trimmed L1-norm, or Tα
                     , is as follows.

                           (X) for α ∈ [0, 1] is defined by

                     (X) can be interpreted as an expectation of |X| in left α-tail. Note that Tα
                     (X) is then the average quantile of the random variable |X|, hence, formula (16) holds, see Zabarankin and Uryasev (2014a, formula (1.4.1)). Formula (17) follows from Rockafellar et al. (2006, formula (5)).

                     (X) ≤ 0 to achieve a given sparsity of a solution variable vector, or as max α subject to Tα
                     (X) ≤ 0 to maximize the sparsity of a solution variable vector.

Item 4 implies that Tα
                     (X) is a concave function for X ≥ 0. Notice that this property cannot be strengthened to concavity in the whole space of random variables. Consider a function g(X) such that g(X) ≥ 0,

                      then there exists X such that g(X) > 0. Then

It is desirable to use CVaR norm in regression when we want to control directly large absolute values of residuals. We are indifferent to the sign of the residual. We just do not want to have large absolute values, but are tolerant to small absolute values. Similar purpose can be achieved by minimizing Lp
                         norm, but in this case we do not control directly some specific percentage of largest outcomes. We can directly specify the percentage of largest absolute residuals with CVaR norm, e.g., 10% of largest outcomes. We also want to mention that the percentile regression (Koenker & Bassett Jr, 1978) with Koenker and Bassett function is quite close to CVaR norm regression. However, percentile regression is concentrated on large outcomes in one tail, while CVaR norm regression pays attention to large outcomes without identifying the sign of the residual.

Similar type of error has been considered earlier in OR literature. For instance, Zabarankin and Uryasev (2014b, formula (6.5.9)) considered so called “average alfa-quantile” error minimization applied to the transformed residual. In this problem, the average is taken over the left tail of the distribution. Such approach corresponds to trimmed error measures and to robust regression, it produces regression which is stable to outliers. By selecting the absolute value as a transformation function in “average alfa-quantile” error we are coming to trimmed L1-norm minimization, or to LTA regression. Here we consider averaging over the right tail of distribution, which leads to CVaR, or superquantile, functions. Similarly, by selecting the absolute value as a transformation function in CVaR we are coming to CVaR norm minimization. CVaR norm regression is not stable to outliers, moreover, it is a “pessimistic” estimator focused is on a fraction of the most “problematic” observations. Aside from potential benefits of the pessimistic approach, problem (18) is a convex problem and can be solved precisely and efficiently.

CVaR norm quadrangle is a regular quadrangle, see Proposition 2.2. According to Rockafellar and Uryasev (2013, Regression Theorem), first stated as the Error-Shaping Decomposition of Regression Theorem (Rockafellar et al., 2008, Theorem 3.2, page 722), the intercept, obtained in regression, equals to the Statistic of a modified residuals. In CVaR norm quadrangle, statistic equals

In the following case study we consider L1-norm as an out-of-sample criterion. For the in-sample criteria we consider elements of the CVaR norm parametric family. L1-norm is an element of this family with the corresponding parameter value 0. We vary value of the parameter between 0 and 1 for in-sample learning to optimize L1-norm of residuals in out-of-sample. We show that using CVaR norms with parameter value bigger than 0 can lead, for small training samples, to better out-of-sample performance than direct in-sample minimization of L1-norm.

We illustrate CVaR norm regression with a controlled numerical experiment. In this case study we set true law as

L1-norm of regression residuals is chosen as the out-of-sample error criterion. Similar to exponential distribution, Laplace distribution has heavy tails, which makes L1-based regression a reasonable choice. Moreover, minimization of L1-norm of residuals is equivalent to likelihood maximization for the case of Laplace-distributed error. Since the true distribution is known, there is no need to divide sample into training and testing subsamples to measure error of the estimated model.

This case study showed that even if CVaR norm is not an out-of-sample criterion itself, as it was assumed in Section 4.1, the minimization of CVaR norm can be more advantageous than direct optimization of the out-of-sample criterion.

This paper extended the definition of CVaR norm from Eucledian space to a 
                        
                           
                              L
                              1
                           
                           
                              (
                              Ω
                              )
                           
                        
                      space of random variables and proved that CVaR norm is indeed a norm. CVaR norm is defined in two variations: scaled and non-scaled. Several properties for scaled and non-scaled CVaR norm, as a function of confidence level, were proved. Dual norm for CVaR norm was proved to be the maximum of L
                     1 and scaled L
                     ∞ norms. CVaR norm was proved to be a regular Measure of Error and components of the corresponding CVaR (superquantile) Norm Risk Quadrangle were found. Trimmed L1-norm, which is a non-convex extension for CVaR norm, was introduced analogously to function Lp
                      for p < 1. Linear regression problems were solved by minimizing CVaR norm of regression residuals. CVaR norm has an intuitive interpretation to be chosen as an out-of-sample criterion, and also minimization of CVaR norm can be more advantageous than direct optimization of the out-of-sample criterion.
