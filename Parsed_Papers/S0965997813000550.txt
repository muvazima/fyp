                  Crude oil pipeline laid with products pipeline in the same ditch is a new technology to save investment and protect environment. In order to provide reference to construction and operation optimization, the majority of this paper investigates the thermal influential factors affecting the crude oil temperature in double pipelines system using the computational fluid dynamics methodology. A two-dimensional rectangular region including the two pipelines is selected as computational domain in this investigation. Heat transfer models are proposed to obtain the temperature field distribution and the crude oil temperature drop. The impacts of pipeline interval, crude oil temperature at the outlet of heating station, diameter of crude oil pipeline and atmosphere temperature have been reasonably captured and analyzed in details.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the last few years, a new pipe-laying technology, laying a crude oil pipeline and a products pipeline in one ditch, has been used in China in order to save excavation investment and protect environment [1,2]. In western China, more than one thousand kilometers of crude oil pipeline and products pipeline were laid in one ditch, which is the first and only application of this technology in long distance oil transportation in China until now. The main reason for restricting the promoted application of this technology may be the changes of temperature field distribution and crude oil temperature drop, which are key parameters for safe transportation, energy consumption and economic investment.

The majority of crude oil extracted in China is either waxy oil with high pour point or high viscosity oil, which brings about enormous pressure-drop consumption. One effective method adopted in transportation is heating the crude oil to a certain temperature at heating station. While the temperature of crude oil decreases along the pipeline due to heat transfer with external environment. So heating stations should be constructed in appropriate positions along the pipeline to keep the temperature of crude oil being above the pour point all the time. Great energy consumption and construction cost are the chief disadvantages of heating transportation [3–6].

If the new pipe-laying technology accelerated the crude oil temperature drop, higher temperature would be reached at heating station or more heating stations would be constructed. It may lose the original purpose of cost savings. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate and gain a deep understanding of thermal influential factors on crude oil temperature drop when double pipelines are laid in one ditch, and it is important to provide technical support to ensure operation safety and at last, really save energy and investment.

Extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the thermal characterization of hot crude oil pipeline [7–12], while few researches are about double pipelines laid in one ditch. Ling et al. [13] and Yu et al. [14,15] had simulated the temperature field of double pipelines system and analyzed the effect of pipeline interval and diameter combination on thermal impact. However, there are several points in their studies that do not conform to the actual conditions. Firstly, coupled heat transfer presents between crude oil and soil, which includes convective heat transfer between oil and the inner wall of steel pipe, heat conduction between the inner wall and outer wall of steel pipe, heat conduction between the inner wall and outer wall of insulating layer, heat conduction between the inner wall and outer wall of corrosion protective covering, and the heat emission between the outer wall of corrosion protective covering and the soil. So neglecting the heat conduction in insulating layer is unreasonable, which plays an important role in temperature drop. Secondly, the physical characteristic of crude oil changes with temperature, especially the viscosity, which cannot be seemed as unchanged in transportation. Thirdly, pipelines are usually laid in the same plane bottom of one ditch. So pipeline buried depths of the two pipelines, the depths from the center of pipelines to ground surface, are different. Fourthly, atmosphere temperature also influences the temperature field distribution, especially the extreme cold or hot atmosphere temperature should be considered. Last but not least, the grid used in their research is sparse. A denser grid should be adopted to ensure reliable accuracy. So a more accurate and comprehensive study is needed.

Since numerical methods can take more factors into account with fewer assumptions and have advantages of low cost and short research time [16,17], in this paper, simulation method is proposed to explore the changes of temperature field distribution in double pipelines system. And main factors affecting the crude oil temperature are discussed.

For incompressible oil flow, both crude oil and products oil, the universal averaged Navier–Stokes equations are employed to obtain the oil flow field [18], including the conservation of mass, momentum and energy, taking the following form:

                        The heat transfer of the whole thermal system of double pipelines laid in one ditch is composed of five components, namely, the convective heat transfer between the flowing oil and the inner wall of the pipe, the heat conduction in steel pipe, the heat conduction in insulating layer, the heat conduction in corrosion protective covering, and the heat emission between the outer wall of the corrosion protective covering and the soil around the pipeline, which includes the soil heat conduction and heat emission of the soil to the air [19]. In order to save computing costs, two spatial dimensions computational region is used in simulation, which calculated the temperature variations in radial. While unsteady model is employed to obtain the axial temperature gradient of oil, in which axial distance is determined by multiplying time step by velocity of oil flow. Therefore, the governing equations are simplified as following:

For heat transfer in soil, the closer the soil is to the oil pipe, the more it affected by the pipe. If the soil is sufficiently far away from the pipe, the soil temperature is hardly affected by the oil. In order to save computation time, thus, a finite thermal influence region should be adopted as computational region. It has been reported that the soil 10m away from the center of pipe is usually not influenced by the oil pipeline and the soil temperature at the depth of 8m can be similarly seemed as constant through the entire year [20]. Therefore, a 20m×10m rectangular region is selected as computational region, as shown in Fig. 1
                        .

GAMBIT 2.3 mesh-generator is employed to perform all geometry generation and meshing. As shown in Fig. 2
                        , computational domain is divided into several blocks, namely, the soil region, the oil region, the steel pipe region, the insulating layer region and the corrosion protective covering region. Progressive triangle mesh is used to discretize the soil region. The closer the soil to the oil pipe, the denser the grid is. Remaining blocks are discretized with rectangular cells. And boundary layers present near the oil pipe inner wall with four-layer grids (the cell height of the first layer is 1mm and the growth factor is 1.2). The suitable grid density is reached by repeating computations until a satisfactory independent grid is found.

At the inner wall of oil pipe, convective heat transfer between oil and pipe wall and heat conduction in steel pipe are coupled as:

                        One section of double pipelines system in Western China, 302.4km from the outlet of one heating station to the inlet of next station, is selected to simulate. And the physical characteristics of materials used in simulation are listed in Table 1
                        .

In order to obtain the initial temperature distribution of computational domain (especially the temperature field of soil region), the temperature of initial crude oil and products oil are set fixedly as that they are heat reservoir to release steady heat. After initial temperature distribution having been received, unsteady heat transfer model is began to be used in calculation, and crude oil and products oil temperature then change with time. Finally, we can obtain the temperature drop of oil and the temperature distribution changes along the pipeline.

Fifteen cases are simulated to compare the different influences among different pipeline intervals, crude oil temperature at the outlet of heating station, diameters of crude oil pipeline and atmosphere temperature, as listed in Table 2
                        . With the same economic flow rate, 1.2m/s, throughput increases with the increase of diameter. Combined with Tables 1 and 2, the range of Reynolds numbers used in simulation is from 18.5 to 807.3. So laminar flow model is employed.

All computations in this study are performed using the finite-volume commercial CFD code, FLUENT 13.0. The flow computations have been solved using the coupled implicit iterative solution procedure. And a Second-order upwind scheme is adopted for the momentum equation and heat conductive equations. Changing physical characteristic of crude oil is added to the flow governing equations using User-Defined Functions (UDFs). And time step Δt used in computation is 0.1s. Convergence is examined by noting the diminishing normalized residual levels (<10−5).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Because of relatively low viscosity and solidifying point, product oil is usually transported under normal temperature without insulation layer. However, high viscosity crude oil should be transported in high temperature and insulation layer should be needed to reduce heat loss. So products pipeline inevitably absorbs heat from crude oil pipeline in the same ditch. And the changes of temperature field and crude oil temperature drop are urgently needed to provide technical support for design and operation of double pipelines system, especially the effects exerted by changes of parameters such as pipeline interval, crude oil temperature at the outlet of heating station, diameter of crude oil pipeline and atmosphere temperature.

The simulation code is validated and verified by a simulation case. The parameters of this case are listed in Table 2 as case 6, which are consistent with the parameters of the actual pipes. Fig. 3
                         shows the comparison between the simulation result and the actual measurement value. It can be seen that the calculated crude oil temperature agrees well with the measurement value, which indicates that this numerical method is sufficiently accurate to predict the oil temperature distribution.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the temperature fields of double pipelines system at different pipeline intervals at the inlet of next station. For single crude oil pipeline or single products pipeline, temperature field presents a symmetrical distribution on the left and right sides of pipe. While for two pipelines laid in one ditch, temperature distributions have obvious changes due to the mutual impact of oil flow in two pipelines.

In order to analyze the impact of pipeline interval on temperature field in extreme cold environment, atmosphere temperature is set as 253.15K. As shown in Fig. 4, there is a clear temperature gradient in the direction of vertical depth on the left and right sides of double pipes. And the temperature gradient has very small change at different pipeline intervals. While obvious temperature changes mainly present below and between the two pipes. Owing to the low ambient temperature, products pipeline, beside absorbs heat from crude oil pipeline, also releases its heat to the surrounding soil. The larger the pipeline interval, the more the heat release of products pipeline is, and the bigger the high-temperature soil region below pipes is. However, the maximum temperature soil region, locating in the lower left of crude oil pipeline as the 278K temperature contour, increases with the pipeline interval increased from 0m to 1.2m, while decreases with the pipeline interval increased from 1.2m to 2.0m. It means the heat absorption of products pipeline from the crude oil pipeline is not the same at different pipeline intervals.


                        Fig. 5
                         shows the temperature differences in three different radial positions of pipe. For the heat absorption from crude oil pipeline, the temperature drop of product oil on the right side of products pipeline is smaller than that on the left side. And for the same reason, crude oil on the left side of crude oil pipeline has a greater temperature drop.

The axial temperature drop of crude oil and product oil at different pipeline intervals are shown in Fig. 6
                        . Compared with single crude oil pipeline, the presence of products pipeline enlarges the heat loss of crude oil pipeline and leads to a greater temperature drop of crude oil. However, the differences of crude oil temperature gradient at different pipeline intervals are small. The main reason is that in cold winter, the heat absorption of products pipeline is minor than the heat absorption of soil. From the partial enlarged detail near the inlet of next station, we can see the temperature gradient of crude oil does not increase with the increase of pipeline interval. In extreme cold environment, heat release from products pipeline at short interval lessens the heat loss of crude oil pipeline. And this effect is weakened when the interval is increased to 1.2m. Then the temperature gradient of crude oil increases when the interval increases.

Due to the heat absorption of soil, single products pipeline has a greater temperature drop, as shown in Fig. 6. Crude oil pipeline provides source of heat for products pipeline. So the temperature drop of product oil is smaller in double pipelines system. The shorter the interval, the smaller the temperature gradient is. With the increase of pipeline interval, the heat absorption of products pipeline from crude oil pipeline becomes lesser and lesser. When the interval is increased to 2.0m, temperature gradient of products pipeline in the inlet of next station is similar to that of single pipeline.

In Yu’s research [14], simulations are performed in normal environment. He found that the shorter the pipeline interval, the greater the heat absorption of products pipeline from crude oil pipeline is. So he suggested that the interval should not be less than 1.2m. However, in extreme cold environment, the temperature distribution is not the same, as described above. Therefore, proper pipeline interval should be determined by considering the impact of ambient temperature.

Temperature fields of computational domain at the inlet of next station with different crude oil temperatures at the outlet of heating station are shown in Fig. 7
                        . We can see that high-temperature soil regions below and between two pipelines increase with the increase of initial crude oil temperature at the same pipeline interval. It means the higher the initial crude oil temperature is, the more heat will be absorbed by soil and product oil, thus the temperature of surrounding soil and product oil will increase. This conclusion is also confirmed by the axial temperature drop curves, as shown in Fig. 8
                        . The downtrends of crude oil temperature along pipeline at different initial temperatures are roughly the same. The subtle difference is that the higher the initial crude oil temperature, the larger the temperature gradient of crude oil is, and the smaller the temperature gradient of product oil is.

The differences of temperature field at different diameters of crude oil pipeline are shown in Fig. 9
                        . Under the same initial crude oil temperature, the smaller the diameter of crude oil pipeline, the lower the temperature of surrounding soil is. Due to relatively higher thermal capacity and larger heat transfer area of big-diameter oil pipe, the heat absorption of product oil from crude oil is great. That is to say the crude oil temperature in big-diameter pipe is greatly affected by the presence of products pipeline, displaying more heat loss.

As can be seen from Fig. 10
                        , crude oil in small-diameter pipe has a larger temperature gradient. The smaller the diameter, the faster the falling speed of axial temperature of product oil is. The basic reason for this phenomenon is that the heat absorption of product oil from crude oil in small-diameter pipe is little, while the heat release into soil is great.


                        Fig. 11
                         shows the notable differences of temperature field under different atmosphere temperatures. In cold winter, both crude oil pipeline and products pipeline release heat into soil by heat conduction, and then soil release heat through ground surface into atmosphere by convective heat transfer. So we can see obvious vertical layering temperature distribution in Fig. 11a. However, in hot summer, soil absorbs heat from atmosphere and crude oil pipeline, and products pipeline absorbs heat from soil and crude oil pipeline. That is why the temperature distribution presents S-shaped distribution in Fig. 11c. Because of similar atmosphere and soil temperature in spring and autumn, there is almost no heat transfer between them. And heat transfer mainly takes place between soil and double pipelines. Thus, we see double pipelines-centered temperature contours in Fig. 11b.

Axial temperature drop curves of crude oil and product oil under different atmosphere temperatures are shown in Fig. 12
                        . The lower the atmosphere temperature is, the quicker the temperature of crude oil drops. In winter, products pipeline also releases heat, resulting in a clear temperature drop. However, in other seasons, products pipeline can absorb heat from crude oil pipeline or upper soil to compensate for heat loss. So there is nearly no axial temperature gradient of product oil in these seasons.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

CFD analysis has been used to simulate the effects of several key thermal influential factors on temperature field and oil temperature drop when double pipelines are laid in one ditch. From calculation results, following conclusions are drawn.
                        
                           (1)
                           Products pipeline inevitably absorbs heat from crude oil pipeline in the same ditch. And the heat absorption is different at different pipeline intervals. In cold winter, the heat absorption does not increase with the decrease of interval. So proper pipeline interval should be determined by considering the impact of ambient temperature.

High temperature crude oil provides great heat for absorbing, and big-diameter pipe provides large area for heat transfer. Therefore, the higher the crude oil temperature at the outlet of heating station, or the bigger the diameter of crude oil pipeline, the more the heat loss of crude oil is.

Heat transfer may be in different directions under different atmosphere temperatures. In cold winter, both crude oil pipeline and products pipeline release heat into soil and atmosphere. However, in hot summer, soil absorbs heat from atmosphere and crude oil pipeline, and products pipeline absorbs heat from soil and crude oil pipeline. The lower the atmosphere temperature is, the quicker the temperature of crude oil drops.
