                  Because of cost and time limit factors, the number of samples is usually small in the early stages of manufacturing systems, and the scarcity of actual data will cause problems in decision-making. In order to solve this problem, this paper constructs a counter-intuitive hypothesis testing method by choosing the maximal p-value based on a two-parameter Weibull distribution to enhance the estimate of a nonlinear and asymmetrical shape of product lifetime distribution. Further, we systematically generate virtual data to extend the small data set to improve learning robustness of product lifetime performance. This study provides simulated data sets and two practical examples to demonstrate that the proposed method is a more appropriate technique to increase estimation accuracy of product lifetime for normal or non-normal data with small sample sizes.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In practical manufacturing, the Process Capability Index (PCI), as a numerical measure on product lifetime, has been widely applied to measure the product lifetime performance (e.g., see Chen and Chen (2004), Chang and Wu (2008), Wu and Pearn (2008), Pearn et al. (2009), Wu et al. (2009)). Before using these indexes, it is necessary to determine an appropriate product lifetime distribution, because the estimation accuracy of the lifetime distribution plays a crucial role to influence the accuracy of applying PCI. Many studies have provided approaches for this, such as the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) (e.g., see Tan (2009), Park (2010)), the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (e.g., see Gupta et al. (2008), Jiang et al. (2008)), and Bayesian approach (e.g., see Wu (2008)). However, these approaches are generally used to fit a dependable product lifetime distribution under a necessary condition of sufficient samples. Unfortunately, with today’s extremely competitive marketplace of rapidly replaced products, decision-makers often only possess very few experimental data due to cost and time limitations. Under the circumstance, the sample size is too small to find a reliable lifetime distribution.

In practice, while the sampling distribution of product lifetime for small samples is not distinct, the nonparametric bootstrapping method (BM) (Mooney et al., 1993) has been used as an effective technique to estimate the distribution, such as in the PCI’s application, Hsu et al. (2009) utilized the BM to calculate the estimator of the PCI

                      for multiple process characteristics. However, when new samples are drawn from the small data set, the resampling BM may be too conservative to behave realistically for very small data sets. Facing this problem, many researchers tried to analyze the collected data and explore the potential information by producing virtual samples. For example, Cho et al. (1997) suggested generating virtual samples to improve learning accuracy with small data sets and selecting a close-by observation of a real sample to be a virtual sample via the underlying population network. Yonezawa et al. (1999) proposed the estimation method for a Normal distribution and directionally generated samples in the estimated region. However, since the generated sample may be not fitted by a Normal distribution in a small data set, some researchers produced other virtual samples to deal with non-normal data. Li et al. (2003) proposed an approach which used Functional Virtual Population (FVP) to generate more samples for training. The idea is to expand, directed by the selected criterion, the domain of each attribute or variable in a small data set to create a new virtual sample set. Li and Lin (2006) suggested a nonparametric statistics method called intervalized kernel methods of density estimation to improve small sample set learning to fit the correct data distribution. Li et al. (2006, 2007) proposed the Mega-Trend-Diffusion (MTD) technique to form a triangular membership function which was considered as a small sample distribution. Using this, they calculated the domain range of a small data set and produced virtual samples to improve the accuracy of small data set learning for early Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) scheduling knowledge. Furthermore, Lin and Li (2010) proposed the generalized trend diffusion modeling algorithm that was an improved version of the MTD method, and was applied for time series data sets. In the literatures of the MTD, the learning model is a linear function to generate virtual samples. However, virtual sample generation is often more appropriate to use a nonlinear model to learn various data sets.

With a small data set, a two-parameter Weibull distribution is popularly a used nonlinear distribution in reliability and lifetime testing. For instance, Abernethy (2004) proposed utilizing the flexible shape parameters of this distribution to manage manufacturing processes with limited data. His research was supported by Nelson (1982) who considered that the Weibull distribution could manage product lifetime distribution for normal or non-normal data. In order to find the parameters of the Weibull distribution, a hypothesis testing technique has been commonly used to consider rejecting the null hypothesis with a smaller and better p-value. However, it is hard to choose the best-fitting shape parameter due to the found distinct shape parameters may possess small and close p-values. Therefore, in this paper we present a new approach, based on the Weibull distribution, which develops a counter-intuitive hypothesis testing procedure to find a reliable shape parameter of the distribution. In the proposed testing procedure, we apply the Gini statistic, a kind of two-tailed distributions, as a testing statistic to accept the null hypothesis using the maximal p-value. Then, virtual samples can be generated from the found Weibull distribution to extend the lifetime data set to improve estimation accuracy for assessing product lifetime performance. Finally, several simulation data sets and two practical examples are used in the product lifetime performance testing procedure to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method (PM) by comparing it with the Least-Squares Estimation (LSE) approach.

This research is organized as follows: Section 2 offers the related works including reviews for Small-Data-Set problems and a widely-used LSE approach of fitting product distribution with a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Furthermore, product lifetime performance testing procedures are introduced based on the two-parameter Weibull distribution. Section 3 describes our proposed method how to generate virtual samples. Section 4 provides simulation data and two practical examples to illustrate the estimation accuracy of product lifetime performance by using methods (i.e., LSE and PM). Finally, we present the conclusions of this research in Section 5.

Our research mainly aimed at finding some of solutions of small-data-set problems, where the LSE method of parameter estimation of two-parameter Weibull distribution is employed in the developing process. Since it is a general sense that a great number of data ordinarily provide more information of a manufacturing system to researchers to obtain a more reliable product lifetime distribution. Therefore, researchers have tried to investigate effective ways to improve estimation accuracy of lifetime distribution from samples of small sizes by expanding the data sets.

In the statistical field, a small data set is difficult to find a stable sample distribution (Judge et al., 1988). Even in the application of the central limit theorem, it still requires a large data size to fit a normal sample distribution. Facing this specific condition, research has been implemented such as, Zhang et al. (2007) constructed two kinds of Least-Squares Estimation (LSE) methods with regard to different limitations for small sample analysis. Abernethy (2004) proposed a method to utilize the flexible shape parameters of the Weibull distribution to control manufacturing processes for small sample sets. Further, some studies are recommended about generating the virtual data set to improve small data sets learning with the concept illustration of Fig. 1
                        . For instance, Li and Lin (2006) proposed a nonparametric statistics method called intervalized kernel method of density estimation to improve small sample set learning to find the correct population distribution. Their paper gave a more accurate and stable method to estimate a data distribution for rare samples, excepting that the parametric statistics method is only applicable to numerical data with interval or ratio scales (interval scale means that the data show the properties of ordinal data and the interval between values is expresses in terms of a fixed unit of measure, while the ratio scale means that the data have all the properties of interval data and the ratio of two values is meaningful (Siegel, 1957). As portrayed in Fig. 2
                        , the MTD method Li et al. (2006) constructs a triangular form function to calculate the range of virtual data, which is the interval from a to b described mathematically as:

Weibull distribution is a commonly used distribution to estimate the fitted small data set distribution (Abernethy, 2004). Given a data set X which is denoted by a two-parameter Weibull distribution (Weibull, 1951), and the probability density function (p.d.f.) of the Weibull distribution is expressed as:

                        Nelson (1982) illustrated that the Weibull distribution had some special expressions for the shape parameter. Hence, we consider the shape of Weibull distribution to manage product data are drawn from approximately normal or non-normal distribution.

Based on the two-parameter Weibull distribution as Eq. (3), the LSE method is a widely-used by researchers to fit the shape and scale parameters. From Eq. (4), the sum of squares error (SSE) can be derived as:

                        =1, …, r. To fit the optimal value of β, we use various values of β when doing the “shape-first” approach to estimate λ based on the minimized SSE, as Eq. (6).

Before using the PCI, many researches usually assumed that the product lifetime was fitted by a specific probability distribution. Tong et al. (2002) provided an approach to estimate the process performance of electronic components by creating a uniformly minimum variance unbiased (UMVU) estimator of a PCI C

                        , where a hypothesis testing procedure was proposed based on the complete set of samples with an exponential distribution. Liu and Chen (2006) used the Burr XII distribution to extend many PCIs for the non-normal product lifetime performance. The C

                         is defined as a lifetime performance index for estimating product performance (Montgomery, 1985) based on the two-parameter Weibull distribution that is introduced as follows.

When a product is fitted by a two-parameter Weibull distribution, as Eq. (3), the lifetime performance index C

Obviously, the simplicity of the TPLP allows quality engineers conveniently assess whether a batch of product meets the requirement with a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Fig. 3
                         shows clearly that our consideration is that the larger-the-better C
                        
                           L
                         index indicates a long product lifetime and represents a required product lifetime performance and vice versa.

In general, a two-parameter Weibull distribution contains both unknown scale and shape parameters, and researchers are also interested in the latter. While many studies have provided approaches to estimate the shape of the two-parameter Weibull distribution with sufficient samples, it remains difficulty to do so when the sample size is small. Based on this, we propose a new approach to address this specific estimation problem in the following subsection.

The MPV approach is mainly used to explore the best-fitting product distribution shape. First, we introduce the Gini statistics (Gail and Gastwirth, 1978), which is employed to construct a counter-intuitive statistical hypothesis testing procedure to estimate whether a product is fitted by a two-parameter Weibull distribution, as Eq. (3), under a given level of significance α and a sample size r. The proposed strategic testing procedure is constructed as follows:

                                          0, the p-value has a maximal value, which means that there is strong evidence to accept the null hypothesis H
                                          0.

Following this hypothesis testing procedure, the best fitted shape parameter β can be found.

Virtual samples generation implies that potential information is explored to improve decision-making accuracy for small sample sizes. Therefore, we estimate a shape of small sample distribution and virtual samples are randomly drawn from the distribution. That is, this research proposes the MPV approach to approximately estimate a nonlinear and asymmetrical shape of small sample distribution for creating virtual data. The detailed procedures of the proposed approach are described as follows:
                           
                              Step 1.
                              Given a data set which is fitted by the Weibull distribution as Eq. (3).

Perform MPV to estimate a best-fitting β for the small sample set.

The MPV is a reliable and stable approach based on statistical theory. In particular, this approach overcomes the problem of small sample size, such as 3⩽
                        r
                        ⩽20. In addition, the proposed procedure offers a better shape parameter of small sample distribution. This fact is shown by using simulation data and two practical examples in the following sections. Note that the virtual samples are generated using the Compaq Visual Fortran, Professional Edition V6.6 Intel Version and IMSL computer software, based on above proposed procedures.

In this section, we provide several simulation data sets and two numerical examples to explain the procedures of the proposed approach. A testing procedure LPTP for estimating product lifetime in Section 2.3 is used to verify the proposed approach. First, the LSE approach for fitting the shape and scale parameters of Weibull distribution is introduced in Section 2.2, along with the detailed steps and a comparison of the results from the following methods: LSE, BM (bootstrapping method (Mooney et al., 1993)) and PM.

Given a sample set with size r and fixed scale parameter λ, several simulation data sets are generated to study the influence of various β (i.e., various lifetime shapes) on the estimation accuracy of product lifetime of the three methods (i.e., LSE, MPV, and PM). The estimation accuracy is the probability of correctly rejecting a null hypothesis H

These experiment results are listed in Tables 1–4 for various values of shape parameter β.

Note that notation ‘∗’ in the tables represents an impossible calculation, by the a definition of the Gamma Function Γ (t), t
                        >0, and thus, Eqs. (10) and (11) are infeasible when a sample size is smaller than 1/β. From Tables 1–4, the comparative results of LSE, MPV and PM are as follows:

                                 , when β is extremely large, PM still has better estimation accuracy of product lifetime than LSE and MPV.

For a fixed r
                                 
                                    real
                                 , β and r

                                 , PM has the best estimation accuracy of product lifetime.

From the above results, we observe that PM has the best estimation accuracy of product lifetime for a small sample size upon any of the shape parameters β among the three methods. It is thus obvious that when a data set has a small sample size, the estimation accuracy of product lifetime is significantly improved by PM.

To illustrate the use of the proposed method on real numerical examples, we consider both complete observations and incomplete observations (i.e., Type-II censored samples) based on a two-parameter Weibull distribution for several small data sets. First, LSE and MPV use the original data to fit the shapes of product distribution. We then follow the steps in Section 4.1 to perform PM to acquire the estimation accuracy with real sample size sets r
                        
                           real
                        
                        ={3,4,5} and virtual sample size sets r
                        
                           vir
                        
                        ={1,2,3,4}. The BM method is essentially to adopt a strategy of sampling with replacement in original data sets r
                        
                           real
                        
                        ={3,4,5} for creating new sample size sets r
                        
                           vir
                        
                        ={1,2,3,4}. Hence, the BM procedure differs from the PM one in Section 3.2. In this section, we perform the experiment in Section 4.1 30 times with two practical lifetime data sets. A paired T-test measures if EA averages have differences or not between BM and PM methods under a significance level 0.05.


                           Proschan (1963) showed the failure times of the air-conditioning system of 13 Boeing aircrafts. Here, we consider the data set of failure times for Plane 7907, which are: {X
                           (i), i
                           =1, 2, …, 6}={15,29,33,41,181,194 (hours)}. To illustrate the proposed method, we use this real data to perform the steps in Section 4.1, and a comparison of the results for the methods is shown in Tables 5 and 6.


                           Dodson (2006) reported the results of a lifetime testing experiment of grinders. The observed failure samples for the grinder lifetime are given as follows: {X
                           (i), i
                           =1, 2, …, 20}={12.5,24.4,58.2,68.0,69.1,95.5,96.6,97.0,114.2,123.2,125.6,152.7 (hours)}. It is assumed that the twelve observed samples are from the two-parameter Weibull distribution. Similarly, we use this real data to perform the steps in Section 4.1, and a comparison of the results for the methods is made, as shown in Tables 7 and 8.

We acquire comparative results of the estimation accuracy of the four methods with both simulation and numerical data. It is found that the estimation accuracy of product lifetime increases up to 100% using PM based on a two-parameter Weibull distribution. As shown in Tables 5 and 7, a paired T-test is used to analyze the significance on the EA averages for BM and PM methods with two real data sets. It is clear that most of p-values are smaller than 0.05 in the tables. Therefore, the results are statistically significant at the level 0.05. Note that a notation ‘NaN’ means that it is not significant for the two methods. In addition, when enough virtual samples is added to the sets r
                        
                           vir
                        , larger p-values represent that PM method has not more significant impacts than BM one. In other words, the effectiveness about assessing product lifetime of the two methods is quite closed with sufficient virtual samples generation. As noted in Tables 6 and 8, BM and PM methods have the slight difference on the EA variations with the two real data sets. Consequently, the proposed PM method is a more effective technique in assessing product lifetime with small data sets.

To address the problem of small data sets, this research proposes using PM to improve estimation accuracy using a nonlinear and asymmetrical shape of product distribution to explore potential data distribution based on a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Based on the Weibull distribution, we verified the proposed method for the estimators is superior to LSE, and the PM using the estimators can avoid generating noisy data or outliers for very small data sets. Besides, by choosing the maximal p-values, we can find the most appropriate shape of the lifetime distribution.

We implemented some experiments with multiple small data sizes for EA variations and T-test to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that our approach not only provides better estimation accuracy, but also is reliable and robust. Though, when sample size is larger, the PM and BM have close effectiveness for assessing product lifetime performance, our proposed method is a more effective way for small data sets.

In future research, we will attempt to delineate other shapes of probability distribution to select more appropriate virtual samples, as in our experience this is critical for raising estimation accuracy. In addition, we suggest applying PM to increase the estimation accuracy of data distribution and product performance in industry for further practical demonstrations of its effectiveness.
