                  Nowadays it is important to develop effective computational methods for accurately identifying and predicting biological activity in the virtual screening of bioassay data so as to speed up the process of drug development. Among these methods, multi-criteria optimization classifier (MCOC) is a classifier which can find a trade-off between the overlapping degree of different classes and the total distance from input points to the decision hyperplane. The former should be minimized while the latter should be maximized. Then a decision function is derived from training data and this function is subsequently used to predict the class label of an unseen instance. However, due to outliers, anomalies, highly imbalanced classes, high dimension, nonlinear separability and other uncertainties in data, MCOC and other methods often give the poor predictive performance. In this paper, we introduce a new fuzzy contribution to each input point based on class median, by defining the new row and column kernel functions the linear combination of different feature kernels to replace the single kernel function in the kernel-induced feature space and penalty factors to imbalanced classes, thus a novel multi-kernel multi-criteria optimization classifier with fuzzification and penalty factors (MK–MCOC–FP) is proposed and the effects of the aforementioned problems are significantly reduced. The experimental results of predicting active compounds in the virtual screening and comparison with linear and quadratic MCOCs, support vector machines (SVM), fuzzy SVM and neural network, the conclusions show that MK–MCOC–FP evidently increased the ability of resisting noise interference, the predictive accuracy of highly class-imbalanced bioassay data, the separation of active compounds and inactive compounds, the interpretability of importance or contributions of different features to classification, the efficiency of classification with feature selection or dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data, and the generalization of predicting the biological activity of new compounds.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

We know that in the process of drug discovery and development a large amount of time and efforts are devoted to the primary-screening and the confirmatory-screening for extracting the relevant compounds from the bioassays. For high-throughput screening (HTS) a large number of compounds are screened against a biological target to test whether the compound is capable of binding to the target, if the compound binds then it is an active for that target otherwise it is an inactive one. In order to increase the efficiency and accuracy of HTS, virtual screening (VS) can be employed by using some effective computational methods [43]. These methods mainly include protein-based approaches, ligand-based approaches and some data mining approaches [36,44,22]. However, owing to the challenges of the growing complexity of bioassay data, for instance, the higher dimensionality, the highly imbalanced class and the massive data, these methods often give the poor predictive performance, such as the high false positive rates, the low classification accuracy, the poor generalization of predicting the bioactivity of new compounds, the weak interpretability and the overfitting majority of inactive compounds. Recently, more and more data mining and machine learning techniques are used to aid the prediction and selection of active compounds in VS, for example, naïve Bayes classifier, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, and so on.

SVM based on optimization method and statistical learning theory is recently applied to prediction of bioactivity [43]. At the same time, the SVM classifier has been extensively utilized to a variety of applications because of its better generalization than some traditional data mining methods [49,9,32,42,12]. The main idea of the SVM classifier is to partition instances into different classes by finding a separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two supporting hyperplanes of two classes and minimizes the misclassification simultaneously. For the linearly separable case, the separating hyperplane is built in the input space. For the nonlinearly separable case, kernel techniques are used to map input points from the input space into a feature space, and the separating hyperplane is positioned in the new feature space.

However, in many real-world applications SVM is very sensitive to noise, outliers and anomalies in data set so that the separating hyperplane severely deviates from the right position and direction [5,6,51]. Thus several methods have been proposed to solve the problem by introducing a proper fuzzy membership function to the SVM model [45,31,48,41,25,47,18,23,3,14]. Additionally, in real world applications, it is very common that one class is more important than others, and the class distribution is imbalanced, which results in a rapidly degenerating classification precision and accuracy for instances from the minority class. In order to deal effectively with the class imbalance problem, some penalty techniques based on cost-sensitive learning and other methods are used [46,52,53,27,38,10].

Multi-criteria optimization classifier (MCOC) is another optimization-based method which can be used to solve the classification problems in data mining. The main idea of MCOC is to find a trade-off between the overlapping degree of input points belonging to different classes and the total distance from input points to their decision hyperplane. The first criterion should be minimized while the second criterion should be maximized. Then a linear MCOC model based on the comprise solution was proposed and applied to the credit card portfolio management and risk analysis [39,40]. A multiple phase fuzzy linear MCOC approach was provided and used for the behavior analysis of credit cardholders [20]. Subsequently, a linearly penalized MCOC was presented for improving the catch rate of the bad credit cardholders [29]. A quadratic MCOC in data mining was given and used to carry out credit analysis [28]. In order to increase accuracy and efficiency of classification, an appropriate fuzzy membership function is introduced to MCOC, that is to say, the objective functions and the constraints are transformed into the corresponding fuzzy decision sets, then the new MCOC with fuzzy parameters is constructed so as to improve the generalization in the unseen data [55]. For the nonlinearly separable case, a kernel-based MCOC was given just like the use of the kernel trick in the SVM classifier [54].

Besides, in many practical applications, owing to noise, outliers and anomalies, the highly imbalanced class distribution, and the nonlinear separability within a data set, MCOC will degenerate into an inefficient, instable, and inaccurate classifier when it is trained and tested with these data. To improve the predictive performance of MCOC, a novel MCOC using fuzzification, kernel and penalty factors was proposed and used for predicting protein–protein interaction hot spots, where a class mean-based fuzzy membership function was introduced to MCOC and associated with each input point in the input space, a kernel function was used to map input points into a high-dimensional feature space, and the unequal penalty factors are added to the input points of imbalanced classes [56]. At the same time, multi-criteria optimization classifier with kernel, fuzzification and penalty factors was put forward for credit risk evaluation. Different from the kernel trick in the former classifier, in this classifier a kernel function was firstly introduced, and then the fuzzy membership degree of each input point was calculated in kernel-induced feature space [57]. In a word, the results of the real world applications have shown that the two types of classifiers remarkably increased the predictive performance of classification. Therefore, the MCOC models and algorithms are gradually developing as a new alternative method for solving classification, regression and other problems in data mining and machine learning.

Although the improved MCOC has ability to discover noise in data, deal effectively with the nonlinearly separable case and overcome the case of overfitting majority-class instances for class imbalance, the interpretability of MCOC is weakened due to introduction of the single kernel function. Recently, in practice we also found that MCOC is still subjected to the effects of outliers and anomalies, and the classifier lacks of ability to efficiently process the highly dimensional data and obtain the better interpretability by means of feature selection or dimensionality reduction.

To this end, we reformulate the MCOC model and redesign the corresponding algorithm by introducing a new fuzzy membership function to each input point where class mean is not used but class median, substituting a linear combination of different feature kernels for the single kernel function, and integrating unequal penalty factors into highly imbalanced classes. Thus, the proposed MK–MCOC–FP approach can improved the overall performance of the original MCOC in stability, efficiency, separability and interpretability, that is to say, the aforementioned effects of outliers, anomalies, high dimension, class imbalance and nonlinearly separable problems can be reduced significantly.

Therefore, the main contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows: firstly, by using new fuzzification method based on class median the effects of noise and anomalies are removed to the greatest extent such that the stability and flexibility of MCOC are improved considerably. On the other hand, by defining new row and column kernels of different features in high-dimensional data and employing the new sparsification method based on multi-kernel learning the important features are selected and used for classification such that the interpretability and efficiency of MCOC are enhanced remarkably. In addition, by applying the cost-sensitive penalty factors to the highly class-imbalanced data the proposed MK–MCOC–FP method is used to identify active compounds in bioassay and achieves the better predictive performance than that of other classifiers as shown in the experimental results and comparative analysis.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes basic principles of MCOC. Then the new MK–MCOC–FP approach and the corresponding algorithm are illustrated in Section 3. The experimental results of predicting biological activity and comparison analysis are demonstrated in Section 4. Finally, discussions and conclusion will be given in Sections 5 and 6 respectively.

                      is the dimensionality of the input space, and n is the sample size. In order to separate different classes some researchers have chosen the two measures: the overlapping degree deviating from the separating hyperplane and the total distance departing from the decision hyperplane [15]. In the first case an input point is in the wrong side of the hyperplane and misclassified, while in the second case it is in the right side and correctly classified. Subsequently, Glover considered the above two factors in the classification models simultaneously [16].

It should be pointed out that the above classifiers in Eqs. (4) and (5) can only be used to solve the linearly separable problems. For the nonlinearly separable case, a kernel function can be introduced to the linear and quadratic MCOCs, which will be illustrated in the forthcoming Section 3 for the linear MCOC. For the quadratic MCOC, we can add a kernel function to the classifier by solving the corresponding dual problem of Eq. (5).

Besides, for the linear MCOC in Eq. (4), the compromise solution approach has been used to improve its classification performance in business practices [39,40]. With its obvious advantages in simplicity, high efficiency and interpretability, MCOC has to solve practical problems in recent years. However, MCOC has the significant limitations of unstability, poor generalization and insufficient flexibility, especially for outliers, anomalies, class imbalance, nonlinear separability, high dimension and other uncertainties in data. Therefore, it is necessary that we use fuzzification, sparsification and nonlinear techniques to rebuild MCOC so as to remarkably increase its robustness, predictive accuracy and efficiency in solving classification problem.

In this section a new fuzzification method, the theory of multiple kernel learning and the highly class-imbalanced case are firstly described, then these approaches are introduced to MCOC, and then the proposed MK–MCOC–FP approach and the corresponding algorithm are given in detail. Besides, a simulated data set is used to initially evaluate the classification performance of MK–MCOC–FP in the end.

For classification problems the nonlinearly separable data is very common in many practical applications, the kernel trick is often utilized to address this problem. That is to say, the original input space was transformed into a higher dimensional feature space by using an appropriate basic function 
                           
                              ϕ
                              (
                              x
                              )
                           
                         with respect to the input point 
                           x
                         and the data set can be separated linearly in the new feature space [7,49,19]. Thus the dot product 
                           
                              (

Recently, in order to deal effectively with the high-dimensional data, the multi-kernel learning is proposed by combining multiple kernel functions of different features or variables instead of using a single one [33,58,17,35,50,34]. According to the combination way of different feature kernels, multi-kernel learning method is mainly classified into three types: (i) the linear combination method is very popular one and expressed as the linear function of different feature kernels with respect to the corresponding kernel weights. (ii) the nonlinear combination approach is implemented by using nonlinear functions of different feature kernels and their weights. (iii) data-dependent combination is directly learnt from data to gain weights of the feature kernels.

By means of multi-kernel learning we can get the contribution or importance of each feature to classification based on the kernel weights of different features. In other words, the greater the kernel weight of a feature is, the more important it shows. Otherwise, it is a less important one. Therefore, according to the kernel weights of different features we can give a reasonable interpretation for the classification problem in practical applications. Moreover, feature selection or dimensionality reduction can be carried out so that the higher efficiency of classification can be obtained based on the reduced data set [4]. In this paper, we use the above linear and RBF kernel functions to obtain the linear combination of different feature kernels in our experiments.

The fuzzification method based on class means aforementioned in the fuzzy SVM classifier has gained the good effect of classification in practice. However, owing to noise, outliers and anomalies in data, mean may deviate from its real value. To this end the median is a better alternative to mean, and it lies in the middle of a list numbers and is immune to the above abnormal values. We consider the class median as a representative point instead of the class mean, and the fuzzy membership degree

                         is considered as an important part of modeling the classification problem. Otherwise, it is less important one or noise and can be discarded from classifier [31,57]. In this paper, we use the above fuzzification method so as to further improve the predictive performance of our proposed classifier.

We know that the class-imbalanced problem is also very common in data mining and machine learning, many studies show that in the case a classifier tends to overfit the instances of majority-class and underfit the instances of minority-class [1,24,8,52,27,53,5,6,21,56,26,37,30]. Generally speaking, some methods are proposed to solve the problem and they can be divided as two categories: (i) data preprocessing methods, for instance, resampling methods mainly include random and focused undersampling or oversampling methods and synthetic data generation methods. Ensemble methods include the random sampling, bootstrapping, Adacost and SMOTEBoost, in these methods data set is partitioned into multiple subsets such that each of these subsets has a similar number of examples as the minority-class data set, then majority voting method is used to determine the class of input points. (ii) integrated methods, for example, cost-sensitive learning, the unequal penalty factors are added to different classes so that the cost of misclassifying minority-class instances cost more than majority-class instances. Margin calibration, the method uses a margin compensation to refine the biased decision boundary for the highly class-imbalanced learning. Other methods mainly include one class learning, active learning, kernel modification methods, soft computing methods and hybrid methods, and so on. In our paper, we employed the cost-sensitive learning to correct of decision boundary and build a new classifier with the class-imbalanced penalty factors.

Thus, introducing a new fuzzy membership degree to each input point can further reduce the effects of noise, outliers, and anomalies in data. The class-imbalanced penalty factors are used to trade off overfitting majority-class and underfitting minority-class. At the same time, kernel function can transform a nonlinearly separable case into a linearly separable one.

However, in practice we found that the interpretability and sparsification of the classifier in Eq. (15) for different features are weakened because the single kernel function is introduced to the above classification model. Thus, according to the basic idea of multi-kernel learning the novel row and column kernels are defined and integrated into the classifier in Eq. (15) respectively. For the linear kernel case, given the data set

The reduced data set can be obtained by feature selection or dimensionality reduction. If necessary, the obtained classifier and other classifiers can be trained and tested with the reduced data set and the corresponding measures of predictive performance can be calculated and reported respectively.

In this section a simulated dataset is designed and characterized by outliers, anomalies, class-imbalance and nonlinear separability so as to test the new MK–MCOC–FP approach. In this paper, since the linear MCOC and quadratic MCOC are only fit for the linearly or approximately separable case, SVM, fuzzy SVM, and MK–MCOC–FP with the RBF kernels are tested on the data set. Besides, the data set is used for binary classification with 237 points for negative class and 74 points for positive class as shown by diamonds and crosses in Fig. 1

In this section we use MK–MCOC–FP and other classifiers for predicting active compounds in the virtual screening of bioassay data, including data sets, experiment design, feature selection and importance analysis, experimental results and comparison analysis in the following subsections.

The following are the descriptions of data sets used in our experiments. Bioassay data in VS are sourced from the online UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/). We select 2 primary screening data sets and 4 confirmatory screening data sets to test our proposed MK–MCOC–FP approach and conduct comparison with other classifiers. And they have been partitioned into training sets and the dependent test sets respectively. Before these data sets are used to train classifiers, they are normalized with the min–max standardization method for numerical attributes.

AID362 gives the results of a primary screening bioassay for Formylpeptide Receptor Ligand Binding University from the New Mexico Center for Molecular Discovery. AID439 is a confirmatory screen of AID373 which is a primary screen for endothelial differentiation, sphingolipid G-protein-coupled receptors 3. AID644 is a confirmatory screen of AID604 which is Rho kinase 2 inhibitors. AID721 and AID 1284 are two confirmatory screens of AID746 which is Mitogen-activated protein kinase. And the above four primary screens are sourced from the Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center. AID1608 is a different type of screening assay that was used to identify compounds that prevent HttQ103-induced cell death from National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Approved Drug Program.

Each data set has many conditional attributes and one class attribute which label a compound as active and inactive one. Table 1
                         illustrated the characteristics of different data sets, including the number of inactive compounds (negatives) and active compounds (positives) in training sets and the independent test set respectively, the number of nominal attributes and numerical attributes, and a ratio of inactive compounds to active compounds in bioassay data sets.


                        Table 1 has shown that the six data sets are characterized by high dimension, highly imbalanced class distribution and mixed data types. Besides, owing to some inevitable errors in computing the values of different features, these datasets may contain potential noise, outliers and anomalies.

In our experiments, the six data sets have been divided into training sets and corresponding test sets. Each test set is straightly used for the independent test set. For each training set of AID362, AID439, AID644, AID721, AID1284 and AID1608, the stratified 5-fold cross-validation (CV) method is employed to train MCOC, SVM, fuzzy SVM, neural network and MK–MCOC–FP with the training subsets, and each fold contains roughly the same proportions of different classes so as to evaluate different classifiers in a more reliable manner. According to the best predictive performance of these classifiers on the validation subsets, the optimal parameters are found. Then the averages of predictive performance of different classifiers with the independent test set can be calculated and reported. At the same time, the comparison analysis of these classifiers is implemented based on the predictive performance with the same test set.

Following the description of MK–MCOC–FP in Section 3, the classifier has not only the ability to solve the classification but also to carry out feature selection or dimensionality reduction. That is to say, by using the stratified 5-fold CV method the classifier with the best predictive performance on the validation subsets is selected. According to the given the minimum importance threshold and the optimal kernel weights, the minimal feature subset of each bioassay data set can be obtained.

In the total process of training different classifiers the optimal parameters of MCOC, SVM, fuzzy SVM and MK–MCOC–FP are selected from the predefined sets by grid search method. These parametric sets are defined as: the penalty factor C for MCOC, SVM and fuzzy SVM, the penalty factors

Besides, feed forward neural networks are trained on the six bioassay data sets and then they are tested on the independent test sets, where the topology of neural network are designed as a multi-layer structure, including input layer, one to three hidden layers with the number of neurons ranging between 10 and 50, and one output layer with two neurons. Apparently, the optimal network topology dependents on the best predictive performance by using grid search method.

For each of the aforementioned classifiers an iterative process on the predefined parametric set is used to find the best parameter, the stratified 5-fold CV method is applied in each iterative process. It should be pointed out that for the stratified 5-fold CV approach the best parameter of a classifier is determined by the best average of predictive performance on 5 validation subsets, therefore there are 5 classifiers corresponding to 5 training subsets. Then selected classifiers with the best parameter value are respectively used for prediction on the independent test set, and the average of their predictive performance can be computed and gained in the end.

Besides, in our experiments six accuracy measures are used to evaluate the predictive performance of the above classifiers. They are total accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, MCC and AUC. And these measures are respectively defined as

Finally, all of the experiments are carried out using Matlab 8.1. The linear programming problem of linear MCOC and MK–MCOC–FP, and the convex quadratic programming problem of quadratic MCOC, SVM, fuzzy SVM and neural network, are solved by utilizing Matlab optimal and neural network tools respectively.

In our experiments for the MK–MCOC–FP approach the stopping criterion is set as 
                           
                              ε
                              =
                              1
                              e
                              -
                              1
                           
                         so as to get the optimal kernel weights, and the predefined threshold is chosen as 
                           
                              ρ
                              =
                              1
                              e
                              -
                              4
                           
                         to carry out feature selection or dimensionality reduction for the optimal attribute subsets. Because for each training set the sum of different kernel weights is equal or lesser than 1 (
                           
                              S
                              =
                              1
                              )
                           
                        , the importance or contribution of each feature to classification is a proportion of its weight to the above sum. By using the stratified 5-fold CV method, MK–MCOC–FP with the best predictive accuracy on the independent test set is selected. Thus, for the selected MK–MCOC–FP with the linear and RBF kernels the results of feature selection and the interpretation of attribution contribution or importance are shown in Figs. 2 and 3
                        
                         respectively.

As the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2, for MK–MCOC–FP with the linear kernel, 14, 6, 17, 9, 3 and 18 attributes are selected from the training sets of AID362, AID439, AID644, AID721, AID1284 and AID1608 respectively. For MK–MCOC–FP with the RBF kernel, 8, 5, 7, 6, 2, and 5 attributes are selected from the training sets of the same bioassay data sets. Moreover, for each data set the sum of importance of selected features is very close to 1, it indicates that the selected attribute subset can be considered as a representative of the original attribute set. And the importance or contribution of each feature to classification is also exhibited in figures of the corresponding data set. Besides, for the above data sets, the corresponding test sets should be reduced to the same number of attributes as the training sets. Finally, we find that the number of selected features from each training set using MK–MCOC–FP with the RBF kernel is obviously less than that of obtained features from the same training set using MK–MCOC–FP with the linear kernel.

For the above each bioassay data set, firstly by using the stratified 5-fold CV method the MCOC, SVM, fuzzy SVM and MK–MCOC–FP models are trained on the training subsets and validated on the corresponding validation subsets, then the different classifiers are obtained and tested on the independent test set. Thus, the averages of the best predictive performance of these classifiers are respectively computed and reported in Tables 2–7
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                         as below.

As the experimental results illustrated in Tables 2–7 respectively, we find that for active compounds in bioassay the predictive performance (sensitivity) of our proposed MK–MCOC–FP approach outperforms that of other methods. That is to say, the MK–MCOC–FP method has the best identification rate of active compounds, and F1 score, MCC and AUC measures also show our proposed classifier has a good prediction for the biological activity. Due to the majority of inactive compounds in bioassay, the specificity values of some classifiers are slightly better than that of our classifier on the AID439 and AID644 data sets. Besides, we also see that the catch rate of the MK–MCOC–FP method is almost immune to the influence of high class-imbalance while other methods often heavily bias towards the majority-class instances and gain the poor predictive performance for the minority-class instances. Finally, it is obvious that for the total predictive performance the MK–MCOC–FP with the RBF kernel is slightly better than that of the linear kernel.

Similarly, by combining grid search and the stratified 5-fold CV method neural networks with different topological structures are trained on the training subsets and tested on the independent test sets. The average of the best predictive performance are calculated and reported in Table 8
                         as below.

Compared with the predictive performance in Table 2–7, we see that neural network generally has the better identification rate of inactive compounds (specification) than other classifiers. Due to the majority of inactive compounds and the minority of active compounds in data sets the neural network methods gives the poor sensitivity prediction as the evaluation results shown in Table 8. However, by using feature sparsification or selection and the class-imbalanced penalty factors MK–MCOC–FP approach has the better identification rate of active compounds than that of neural network and F1 score, MCC and AUC also verified the analytic results.

In order to compare predictive performance of different classifiers, statistical tests are often used on the same data sets [2]. The study shows non-parametric tests are safer and stronger than parametric tests without the assumption of normal distributions [11]. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test (WSR-Test) is a non-parametrically statistical test and often used to rank the differences in performances of two classifiers. To this end, here we employ the WSR-Test method to compare the classification performance of MK–MCOC–FP with that of MCOC, SVM and FSVM. In order to compare the predictive performance of two classifiers, the statistical values of total accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, MCC and AUC measures are calculated with the six bioassay data sets respectively.

For the WSR-Test method, let

                        , and then we can draw a conclusion that the difference between the two classifiers is significant statistically. Thus the statistics of the WSR-Test are calculated with the six bioassay data sets and shown in the following Tables 9
                        .

The results of nonparametric statistical test demonstrated in Table 9 show that the MK–MCOC–FP models achieve the statistically significantly better sensitivity than that of other methods for predictive active compounds in bioassay. And the results of the WSR-Test are almost consistent with the experimental results of predictive performance of different classifiers shown in Section 4.4. In other words, our proposed MK–MCOC–FP totally outperforms linear MCOC, quadratic MCOC, SVM and fuzzy SVM with the linear kernel on the sensitivity, F1 score, MCC and AUC. However, for the total accuracy and specificity measures we find that there is no statistically significant difference between MK–MCOC–FP and other classifiers, and the results show that our proposed method can accurately predict active compounds in bioassay without degrading the total accuracy and the identification rate of inactive compounds.

The separation on the simulated data in Fig. 1 shows that the MK–MCOC–FP model can effectively process uncertain data with anomalies, class-imbalance and nonlinear separability. From the results of feature selection and importance analysis in Figs. 2 and 3, we discover that MK–MCOC–FP can find the optimal feature subset with high efficiency and give the interpretable results of the importance or contribution to classification of each attribute in data set. Based on the stratified 5-fold CV method, the experimental results in Tables 2–8 illustrate that our proposed method provides the best average accuracy for prediction the biological activity, as we known, the ability to accurately predict active compounds in the virtual screening is a critical performance measure. Moreover, the values of F1 score, MCC and AUC also verify that MK–MCOC–FP remarkably enhance the classification performance of MCOC. Finally, the non-parametrically statistical test between our model and other classifiers in Table 9 also illustrate that MK–MCOC–FP is good classifier model with a dual function of classification and feature selection or dimensionality reduction.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we put forward the new MK–MCOC–FP model and the corresponding algorithm, which is an improved MCOC method, the classifier is based on multi-kernel technique, fuzzification method and penalty factors and used for prediction of the active compounds in bioassay. MK–MCOC–FP extends the capacities of MCOC so that it can conduct feature selection or dimensionality reduction in addition to solving the classification problem. The MK–MCOC–FP approach is characterized by introducing a new fuzzy membership degree to each input point, using new row and column kernels of different features to transform the original space into a new feature space and simultaneously obtain the contribution or importance of each feature to classification, and using penalty factors of the imbalance classes to reach a trade-off between overfitting majority-class and underfitting minority-class. The improved classifier which only utilizes linear programming approach can effectively reduce the effects of outliers and anomalies in data, highly class imbalance, high dimension and nonlinearly separable cases. At the same time, MK–MCOC–FP was tested with simulation data and six real world data sets, the experimental results and the statistical comparison analysis show that MK–MCOC–FP is a more effective classifier for the bioactivity prediction and has great potential as a prospective classifier for other real-world applications. Besides, we plan to reformulate the MK–MCOC–FP model and algorithm so as to generalize it to solve multiclass classification problems in the future.
