                  The heat shock protein 90α (HSP90α) provides a promising molecular target for cancer therapy. A series of novel benzolactam inhibitors exhibited distinct inhibitory activity for HSP90α. However, the structural basis for the impact of distinct R1 substituent groups of nine benzolactam inhibitors on HSP90α binding affinities remains unknown. In this study, we carried out molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and molecular mechanics and generalized Born/surface area (MM–GBSA) binding free energy calculations to address the differences. Molecular docking studies indicated that all nine compounds presented one conformation in the ATP-binding site of HSP90α N-terminal domain. MD simulations and subsequent MM–GBSA calculations revealed that the hydrophobic interactions between all compounds and HSP90α contributed the most to the binding affinity and a good linear correlation was obtained between the calculated and the experimental binding free energies (R
                     =0.88). The per residue decomposition revealed that the most remarkable differences of residue contributions were found in the residues Ala55, Ile96, and Leu107 defining a hydrophobic pocket for the R1 group, consistent with the analysis of binding modes. This study may be helpful for the future design of novel HSP90α inhibitors.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

As ubiquitous proteins in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of proteins induced by heat shock. The quintessential members of this group are associated with the folding and unfolding of a wide variety of other client proteins (Taipale et al., 2010). According to their molecular size, mammalian HSPs can be divided into six families, such as HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP100 (Khalil et al., 2011). Mammalian HSP90, a highly conserved molecular chaperone, has two major isoforms in the cytoplasm, namely HSP90α (inducible form) and HSP90β (constitutive form). To date, over 200HSP90 client proteins have been identified, including signaling protein kinases (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor, Akt kinase, Ras), transcription factors (e.g. p53), and steroid hormone receptors (Khalil et al., 2011). These client proteins are well involved in the cellular signal transduction pathways, such as PI3K-Akt-MAPK/ERK and cAMP-dependent pathways. Therefore, in addition to the involvement in protein folding, HSP90 also plays fundamental roles in a plethora of cellular processes, encompassing intracellular transport, signal transduction, protein degradation, gene regulation, and apoptosis (Zhao et al., 2005).

Various studies demonstrate that overexpression of HSP90 has been implicated in various human carcinomas, including both solid tumors and hematological malignancies, marking HSP90 a promising molecular target for cancer therapy (Li et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2009; Shiau et al., 2006). It is also well-documented that the secretion of HSP90α from the cytosol to the extracellular space can be processed under the stress conditions such as hypoxia and oxidative stress (Li et al., 2007). Recently, Wang et al. (2009) have ascertained that the secreted HSP90α is responsible for tumor invasiveness and blockade of the secreted HSP90α inhibits tumor invasiveness. Moreover, the level of plasma HSP90α is correlated with tumor malignancy in clinical cancer patients. These data not only imply the effective target of HSP90α in cancer therapeutics, but also reveal the feasibility of using HSP90α as a viable marker for diagnosis of malignant tumors. Indeed, HSP90α has recently been proved to be a new tumor marker (Khalil et al., 2011).

Structurally, HSP90 is a homodimer and each monomer is composed of three flexible domains, including an N-terminal domain, a middle domain, and a C-terminal dimerization domain. The N-terminal domain is the site of ATP binding and is related to the weak ATPase activity. Association of ATP molecule to the N-terminal domain allosterically induces conformational changes in the arrangement of the N-terminal and middle domains and then is hydrolyzed to ADP when the allosteric regulations are complete (Shiau et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2014a,b). This allosteric activation mechanism is greatly conserved in the HSP family (Lu et al., 2014c). From the therapeutic standpoint, it is feasible to design potent inhibitors to compete with ATP, thereby resulting in the inhibition of HSP90 function which contributes to an effective cancer therapy. Therefore, the functional role of HSP90 in the pathogenesis of cancer is gaining increasingly attention in developing HSP90 inhibitors.

Inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding site of HSP90α are currently in various stages of developments. As of yet, none of HSP90α inhibitors are available in the market. In fact, some promising HSP90α inhibitors display excellent antitumor activities and have entered clinical phase II and/or III trials in non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, and acute myeloid leukemia (Bhat et al., 2014), such as AUY922, AT13387, STA9090, KW-2478, and SNX5422 (Fig. 1
                     ). Very recently, Ernst et al. (2014) reported a novel benzolactam series of HSP90α inhibitors. Of them, the potent compound 33 showed an IC50 of 3nM for HSP90α. Remarkably, the compounds with the different carbon linked substitution ortho to the lactam, namely the R1 substituent groups (Table 1
                     ), may reduce the HSP90α binding affinity compared to the compound 33 with the R1 substituent group of the 4-tetrahydro-2H-pyran. For instance, the compound 36 with the R1 group of tert-butyl showed 60-fold lower potency against the compound 33. However, the structural basis for the impact of distinct R1 substituent groups on HSP90α binding affinities remains unknown.

Computational modeling, with its ability to assess the protein–ligand interactions at atomic level, has been increasingly employed to insight into the structural and energetic properties of the formation of biomolecular complexes. In this study, we performed molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the binding free energy calculations (molecular mechanics and generalized Born/surface area, MM–GBSA) to illuminate the detailed interactions between the benzolactam inhibitors and HSP90α. Based on the obtained results, we would unravel the structural basis for the effect of different R1 substitutes of benzolactam inhibitors on the inhibitory capability of HSP90α, which may be the benefit of developing the next-generation of potent HSP90α inhibitors.

The 1.93Å X-ray crystal structure of the HSP90α N-terminal domain in complex with the compound 31 was extracted from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 4O0B) (Ernst et al., 2014). The chemical structures for the remaining eight compounds were constructed using the ACD/ChemSketch software and subsequently energy-minimized using the B3LYP/6-31G* as implemented in the Gaussian03 program.

The compound 31 was deleted from the ATP-binding site of HSP90α and the resulting unbound structure was used in the docking experiments, which was carried out using the AutoDock 4.2 package (Morris et al., 2009). For the HSP90α, the polar hydrogen atoms were added and subsequently the heavy atoms were fixed and only hydrogen atoms were allowed to move during energy minimization to form optimal orientations. After minimization, the Kollman united atom partial charges and AutoDock atom types were assigned through the Hydrogen module in AutoDock Tools (ADT). For the compounds, all hydrogen atoms including polar and non-polar atoms were added and the Gasteiger-Hückel atomic charge was subsequently assigned. The grid center was defined at the centroid of compound 31 in the HSP90α/31 complex. The number of grid points in x, y, and z direction was set to 60, 60, and 60 with a spacing value of 0.375Å via the AutoGrid module. In the process of docking, the Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used for ligand conformational search. The parameters for the docking run were set as follows: a maximum number of 2500,000 energy evaluations, an initial population of 150 randomly placed individuals, a maximum number of 27,000 generations, a mutation rate of 0.02, a crossover rate of 0.8, and an elitism value of 1. For the local search, the so-called Solis and Wets algorithm was applied with a maximum of 300 iterations per search. The parameters were set the same in the previous studies (Lu et al., 2012). A total of 50 autodocked docking runs were carried out for each compound. Using the docked conformation with the lowest binding energy as a reference, the resulting docked conformations were ranked into clusters using a tolerance of 1.0Å root-mean square deviation (RMSD).

MD simulations of the nine systems, HSP90α in complex with the corresponding compound in the ATP-binding site, were carried out using the AMBER11 package (Case et al., 2010). The coordinates of the crystal water molecules in the PDB 4O0B were merged into the docked HSP90α-ligand complexes and subsequently kept in the MD simulations. The AMBER ff03 force field (Duan et al., 2003) was used for the HSP90α and the generalized AMBER force field (GAFF) (Mukherjee et al., 2011) was used for the nine compounds. The electrostatic potential for the compounds was calculated at the HF/6-31G* level using the Gaussian03 program. Then, the partial charges were determined via the restricted electrostatic-potential fitting method. A truncated octahedral box of TIP3P waters (Jorgensen et al., 1983) was added with a 10Å buffer around the complex. The appropriate number of counter-ions was added to maintain the electroneutrality of the nine simulated systems.

In the minimization, the protein–ligand complexes of the nine systems were first constrained to minimize the water molecules and counterions. Then, the whole system was minimized without any restraint. After the completion of minimization, each system was heated to 300K in 300ps, followed by constant temperature equilibration at 300K for 700ps with a positional constraint of 10kcal/(molÅ2) on the protein–ligand complex in a canonical ensemble (NVT). In the production run, each 50ns MD simulation was performed in an isothermal isobaric ensemble (NPT) with periodic boundary conditions. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method (Darden et al., 1993) was used to calculate the long-range electrostatic interactions. A cut-off distance of 10Å was used to calculate the short-range electrostatics and van der Waals interactions. The SHAKE algorithm (Ryckaert et al., 1997) was used to restrain all covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Each simulation was coupled to a 300K thermal bath at 1.0atm via the Langevin algorithm (Wu and Brooks, 2003). The integration step was set to 2fs in the MD simulations.

The popular MM–GBSA method (Sun et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2011; Bai et al., 2014; Shang et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2014d) was used to assess the binding free energy (ΔG
                        binding) between HSP90α and each compound. The 101 snapshots were extracted from the 20–50ns MD trajectories with an equal interval of 300ps to the ΔG
                        binding∙ ΔG

                        binding of each interaction pair consists of three terms, including ΔE

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

HSP90 function is associated with ATP that binds to the N-terminal domain and an intrinsic ATPase activity is essential for the operation of a functional “chaperone” cycle, which contributes to stabilize client proteins (Picard, 2002). Fig. 2
                      shows the HSP90α N-terminal domain of (residues: 16-224) in complex with the compound 31 in the ATP-binding site. The N-terminal domain of HSP90α consists of eight anti-parallel β-sheets and seven α-helices. The inhibitor binding site is formed by helices α4, α5, α6, and α2 as well as sheets β5, β4, and β7.

The crystal structure of HSP90α complexed with the compound 31 is available. Thus, according to this template, the other eight compounds, including the compound 31, were docked into the ATP-binding site of HSP90α N-terminal domain. After the completion of docking, the 50 docked conformations for each compound were grouped into clusters on the basis of 1.0Å RMSD criterion. The results of cluster analysis revealed that all compounds presented one conformation in the binding site, indicating the reliability of the docked results. Furthermore, AutoDock also uses the semi-empirical free energy score to evaluate each docked complex. The energy items consist of van der Waals energy, hydrogen bonding energy, desolvation energy, electrostatic energy, internal energy of ligand, and torsional free energy. Because each docked compound takes only one cluster, we selected the lowest binding free energy form the cluster to illuminate the predicted docking binding free energy between HSP90α and compounds. Table 1 lists the energy information for each docked complex and Fig. 3
                         shows the relationship between the predicted binding free energy (ΔG
                        predicted) and the experimental binding free energy (ΔG
                        experimental). The relationship between the docked ΔG
                        predicted and the experimental ΔG
                        experimental was calculated, yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.42. Indeed, the predicted binding free energies of the compounds 37 and 38 are comparable to those of the potent compounds 31–33, which are not consistent with the experimental data. This inconsistence is ascribed to the semi-empirical force field parameters used by AutoDock to estimate binding affinity. In addition, the use of the rigid protein in the docking experiments may also cause the inaccuracy. This is due to that the processes of ligands bound to the target proteins exist the induced fit interactions, which lead to the movement of the side chains of residues located in the binding site. Therefore, in the following we will exploit MD simulations that consider the flexibility of residues to sample conformations and subsequently utilize the powerful MM–GBSA method to calculate the binding free energy.

Conventional 50ns MD simulations were carried out in the explicit solvent for the HSP90α in complex with the nine compounds in respective binding site. To reveal the convergence of the simulated systems, the RMSD of the Cα atoms of the simulated protein relative to the initial structure was first analyzed to check whether the MD simulations were satisfactorily preformed. Each snapshot of the simulated trajectory was superimposed on the reference using the least-squares fit method (Lu et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2014). As shown in Fig. 4
                        , the fluctuation of RMSD plot for the HSP90α in complex with the compounds 30–35 and 37 was similar along the simulation, with the RMSD value of ∼1.2Å for these systems. However, in the compounds 36 and 38 systems, after the relax of the systems in prior to 20ns, the two systems reached equilibration in the range from 20ns to 50ns simulations, with the RMSD value of ∼2.0Å for the HSP90α. In addition, the RMSD for the heavy atoms of the compounds in the nine systems was also analyzed. The RMSD for the ligand was calculated with the protein aligned. As shown in Fig. 5
                        , the RMSD of the compounds was in a range from 0.3Å to 1.0Å, suggesting the stability of the compounds in the ATP-binding site of HSP90α. Based on the RMSD analysis of proteins, the first 20ns MD trajectory was ruled out and the remaining 30ns trajectory was used in the production analysis.

The root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) for the Cα atoms of the simulated protein was analyzed to reveal the domain dynamic. As shown in Fig. 6
                        , the HSP90α in the nine systems showed the similar fluctuation. The RMSF values were generally larger for the loops compared to the α-helices and β-sheets. In addition to the RMSF analysis, the dynamical cross-correlation matrices (DCCM) were further performed to reveal the domain motions of HSP90α complexed with different compounds (Fig. 7
                        ). To further reveal the differences of conformational dynamics of HSP90α triggered by binding of different compounds, we chose HSP90α/33 complex as a template (33 is the most potent compound) and subsequently generated new plots in which the DCCM matrix of the other eight complexes subtract that of the HSP90α/33 complex. As shown in Fig. 8
                        , the conformational motions of HSP90α in the compounds 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, and 38-bound states are similar, as evidenced by the vast majority of the differences of |C(i,j)| values less than 0.4. However, in the compound 30 and 36-bound states, the residues 65–71 of HSP90α exhibited unique conformational dynamics. Residues 65–71 form a short helix α3, which orientates the R1 groups of the compounds. As shown in Table 1, the R1 groups of the compounds 30 and 36 are short aliphatic hydrophobic group, which would lose the contacts between the aliphatic hydrophobic groups and the residues in the C-terminal helix α2 prior to the helix α3. As a result, the helix α3 in the compounds 30 and 36-bound HSP90α undergoes a significant conformational dynamics.

To assess the energetics of binding of the nine compounds to the ATP-binding site of HSP90α N-terminal domain, the components of the binding free energy (ΔG
                        binding) of the protein–ligand complexes were calculated via the MM–GBSA method. As listed in Table 2
                        , in all systems, the favorable energy contributions to the ΔG
                        binding are derived from the van der Waals (ΔE
                        vdW) and the electrostatic (ΔE
                        ele) items of the molecular mechanics energy as well as the nonpolar item (ΔG
                        nonpolar) of the solvation energy. However, the ΔE
                        vdW item contributes the most to the ΔG
                        binding in the above three items. This is due to that the chemical composition of the benzolactam inhibitors mainly contains hydrophobic groups (Table 1). As such, the main interactions between the benzolactam inhibitors and HSP90α were dominated by the hydrophobic ΔE
                        vdW interactions (Sha and Cao, 2015). As can be seen from the Table 2, the calculated ΔG
                        binding of the benzolactam inhibitors with the five-membered or six-membered hydrophobic ring groups in the R1 group, such as compounds 31, 32, 33, and 38, exhibited lower binding free energies compared to those with the R1 group attached by aliphatic hydrophobic groups (30, 35, and 36), small four-membered hydrophobic ring group (34), as well as the benzyl group (37). For example, the calculated ΔG
                        binding for the compound 31 was −13.11±2.22kcal/mol, whereas it was −12.10±2.01kcal/mol for the compound 34, −10.32±2.12kcal/mol for the compound 36, and −11.20±2.56kcal/mol for the compound 37. Overall, the calculated ΔG
                        binding showed more negative values by ∼−2kcal/mol than the experimental ΔG
                        binding. The error is stemmed form the empirical force field parameters in AMBER for estimating binding free energy (Mackerell, Jr., 2004; Wang et al., 2004). Despite the existence of deviations, we then correlated the calculated ΔG
                        binding and the experimental ΔG
                        binding and a linear equation was obtained (Fig. 9
                        ), yielding a good correlation coefficient (R
                        =0.88). This equation on the basis of the calculated ΔG
                        binding using the MM–GBSA method can thus be used for the prediction of the inhibitory activity of other HSP90α inhibitors.

The ΔG
                        binding was further decomposed into per residue contributions, which can be helpful to understand the mechanistic basis for the formation of a protein–ligand complex. Table 3
                         summaries the favorable residue contributions to the ΔG
                        binding for all systems. For example, the favorable residues contributing to the binding of compounds 31–33 and 38 to HSP90α include Asn51, Ala55, Asp93, Ile96, Met98, Leu107, Phe138, Try139, Trp162, Thr184, and Val186. In all complexes, the hydrophobic residues contribute larger energies as a result of the formation of the hydrophobic interactions between these hydrophobic residues and the hydrophobic groups of the compounds. However, as shown in Table 3, the most remarkable differences found in per residue contributions to the ΔG
                        binding were observed in the residues Ala55, Ile96, and Leu107, which may be responsible for the distinct binding affinities of different compounds.

The residue decomposition of ΔG
                        binding provides in-depth information for the interactions between the different compounds and HSP90α. The cluster analysis of MD trajectory was performed to extract the most representative structure for all systems. Base on the structural properties of R1 substitutes of benzolactam inhibitors, we divided the nine compounds into four clusters: compounds 31, 32, 33, and 38 as one cluster with the five-membered or six-membered hydrophobic ring groups in the R1 group, compounds 30, 35, and 36 as one cluster with the aliphatic hydrophobic groups (30, 35, and 36), compound 34 as one cluster with the four-membered ring group, and compound 37 as one cluster with the benzyl group. As shown in Fig. 10
                        , three hydrogen bonds were formed between these compounds and HSP90α. The hydrogen-bond contacts are characterized by means of average distances between the corresponding heavy atoms and by percentage of occurrence data. The criteria for the formation of a hydrogen bond consists of a distance between the acceptor (A) atom and the donor (D) atom smaller than 3.5Å and an angle A-H-D larger than 120° (Zhang et al., 2007). Specifically, as shown in Table 4
                        , in all complexes, the lactam moiety of the compounds formed two hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asp93 and Thr184, respectively. The carbonyl of the tetrahydroindolone moiety formed a hydrogen bond with the side chain hydroxyl group of Try139. In addition, the fused 3-methylpyrrole and tetrahydroindolone rings were located inside the hydrophobic pocket formed residues Phe138, Try139, and Trp162. The fused 6-membered lactam and phenyl rings were located inside the hydrophobic pocket formed by residues Asn51, Asp93, Met98, Thr184, and Val186. However, the significant differences were located in the binding site of the R1 group. For example, as shown in Fig. 10B, in the HSP90α/compound 31 complex, the cyclopentane moiety (R1 group) was encapsulated by Ala55, Ile96, and Leu107 residues defining a hydrophobic pocket. Due to the aliphatic hydrophobic R1 groups in the compounds 30, 35, and 36 as well as the small four-membered ring R1 groups in the compound 34, the R1 group in these compounds showed weaker hydrophobic interactions with the residues Ala55, Ile96, and Leu107 compared to the compounds 31, 32, 33, and 38 with the five-membered or six-membered hydrophobic R1 groups. These observations are in good agreement with the analysis of the per residue decomposition, where the residues Ala55, Ile96, and Leu107 showed main differences in the four clusters of compounds. In addition, in the HSP90α/compound 37 complex (Fig. 10D), due to the flexibility of the benzyl R1 group and the longer benzyl substituent group compared to the cyclopentane and cyclohexane moieties in the compounds 31–33, the benzyl group of the compound 37 formed weaker contacts with the residues Ala55, Ile96, and Leu107.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the present study, molecular docking, MD simulations, MM–GBSA binding free energy calculations, and decomposition of binding energy were performed to unravel the binding modes and the different binding abilities of the nine benzolactam inhibitors to the ATP-binding site of HSP90α N-terminal domain. The MM–GBSA calculations showed that the hydrophobic interactions between the nine compounds and HSP90α contributed the most to the binding affinity. Moreover, a good linear correlation was obtained between the calculated ΔG
                     binding and the experimental ΔG
                     binding, which can be utilized to predict other benzolactam inhibitors. The analysis of per residue contributions revealed that the most remarkable differences found in per residue contributions to the ΔG
                     binding were observed in the residues Ala55, Ile96, and Leu107. The obtained binding modes of complexes also supported the residue decomposition. Overall, the potent compounds 31–33 engaged in three hydrogen bonds with Asp93, Thr139, and Thr184. The hydrophobic pocket residues were composed of Asn51, Ala55, Ile96, Met98, Leu107, Phe138, Try139, Trp162, and Val186. The results obtained from this study will be valuable for future rational design of novel HSP90α inhibitors as promising anticancer therapeutics.
