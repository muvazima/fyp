                  This paper presents a novel method to quantify the effects of human-related factors on the risk of failure in manufacturing industries. When failures can be caused by operators, the decision maker must intervene to mitigate operator-related risk. There are numerous intervention methods possible; we develop a revenue model that provides the decision-maker with a systematic tool to perform a cost-benefit analysis, balancing the advantage of risk reduction, against the direct cost of the intervention method.
                  A method is developed to incorporate human-related factors, in addition to machine-related factors, in machine failure analysis. This enables the revenue model to use the expected uptime and the probability of failure, given the operator skill level and working conditions, to calculate the expected revenue associated with each intervention method. A case study of a manufacturing company is considered incorporating two possible intervention methods: reducing the production rate to provide more cognition time and adding a shift expert to guide the operators. Different courses of action are chosen for the various skill-shift scenarios presented.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The performance of a human–machine system is a factor of the performance of the hardware, as well as the correct operation of the hardware by the operators. One indicator of performance is reliability and to assess reliability, we can analyze the risk of failure of the system. The “risk of failure” is widely used and well understood by practitioners but is often not clearly defined (Zuashkiani, Banjevic, & Jardine, 2009). In our case, we define risk as the potential for a machine to become non-operational and quantify it by probability. Within this context, there are many reliability and failure risk models that deal with the machinery. But there are few that incorporate the role of human operators on uptime and overall performance. The first step in our analysis is to have a model to incorporate both Machine-Related (MR) and Human-Related (HR) factors. This can provide us with an all-encompassing assessment of failure risk. To achieve this, we use the Proportional Hazards Model (PHM), a commonly used tool to model the time of failure of equipment (Ghasemi & Hodkiewicz, 2012; Si, Wang, Hu, & Zhou, 2011). A PHM yields the hazard rate which can be affected by factors specific to the machine, the environment, or the humans within the human–machine system. The PHM has most often been used with quantifiable MR covariates, such as readings from vibration sensors or oil analysis. However, this usage can be expanded by including non-MR type factors (Centrone, Kiassat, Garetti, Banjevic, & Jardine, 2010; Kiassat & Safaei, 2009). The fact that this common and versatile model accommodates the inclusion of HR covariates, in addition to MR factors, makes the PHM an excellent model for our analysis.

Once we evaluate the risk facing the system, we may choose to intervene and reduce or eliminate it. Any intervention method pursued should have the benefit of reducing failure risk; it would also have the disadvantage of incurring a direct cost. Given the trade-off between risk reduction and direct cost, we develop a revenue model to perform a cost-benefit analysis for choosing the best intervention method. Given the machine factors, such as working age; operator factors, such as skill level; and the direct cost of the intervention method as well as its risk reduction factor, the best intervention method is selected as the one that results in the highest system revenue. In the absence of an analytical method for choosing among intervention methods, subjectivity and personal biases enter into the decision-making process, distancing it from being an evidence-based process. Providing a systematic tool to a Decision-Maker (DM) to choose the optimal intervention method is the main contribution of this paper.

The general framework of the methodology discussed in our paper is portrayed in Fig. 1
                     . Skill quantification is a necessary component but is not a part of our contribution. The loopback is not discussed in the paper; however, it is a necessary component if additional impactful HR factors are identified.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we perform a literature review, laying out the existing related work and pointing to the gap in the existing knowledge. Section 3 introduces the PHM, used as our failure analysis model to incorporate HR factors. This leads to Section 4 which discusses the development of the revenue model. Section 5 considers the case study of a manufacturing company and applies the revenue model to the data set. Section 6 provides a recap and suggests possible directions for future work.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

There has been much research on assessing human reliability and incorporating it into the overall risk analysis. But the literature is sparse when it comes to performance measurement models that incorporate human-related risk assessments. Barroso and Wilson (1999) consider a manufacturing environment and focus on estimating the overall effect of human reliability. However, their approach is not risk-based, but rather focuses on identifying sources of human error and reducing them. Horberry, Burgess-Limerick, and Steiner (2010) discuss human factors and their effects on operations and maintenance in a mining context but do not attempt failure prediction. Similarly, Kolarik, Woldstad, and Lu (2004) develop a model to monitor and predict an operator’s performance using a fuzzy logic-based assessment. But the purpose of their work is to solely provide a human reliability assessment, without providing any methods for risk reduction. Blanks (2007) discusses the need for improving reliability prediction, paying special attention to human error causes and prevention, but does not mention any predictive techniques for human reliability.


                     Carr and Christer (2003), and Dhillon and Liu (2006) focus on the maintenance workforce performing repair work at times when machines are not being used for production purposes. Reer (1994) discusses human reliability in emergency situations. Our discussion focuses on the production workforce during the operation of the machines. Our emphasis is not on decreasing the mean time to repair but on improving the mean time between failures. A further distinguishing feature of our work is its proposal for managerial interventions, or proactive measures, to deal with the risk stemming from the operators in the human–machine system.


                     Peng and Dong (2011) use a Markov chain approach for uptime prediction. Vrignat, Avila, Duculty, and Kratz (2012), discuss an approach, where they draw observations from the process to generate an availability indicator to be used by a DM to plan actions dynamically. The authors also mention the PHM as a tool. Our work is also helping the DM to plan actions dynamically. A major difference between our work and the two aforementioned works is that, in our case, the observations from the process include HR factors. There are studies, such as Biskup (2008) and Teyarachakul, Chand, and Ward (2011), which consider HR factors, specifically skill and operator learning, and their effects on system performance. But their scope is on production scheduling and not on failure risk analysis.


                     Castanier, Berenguer, and Grall (2003), discuss a continuously deteriorating machine where each maintenance operation makes sense at various stages. The DM can choose to run-as-normal, perform preventive repairs, or preventive replacement. Each has the benefit of improving the system a certain amount and each has the cost of taking the system out of production for certain duration. There is a certain element of cost-benefit analysis in this work that is similar to ours. But there is no mention of human-related factors either. Neither with the work of Vrignat et al. (2012) nor with Castanier et al. (2003) is there a deeper focus on the specific causes of degeneration. All causes leading to machine degeneration are combined together. The cost benefit analysis is not related to the specific risk culprits.


                     Burkolter, Kluge, Sauer, and Ritzmann (2009) propose personnel selection criteria to minimize risk during the operation. Karaulova and Pribytkova (2009) acknowledge the human role within the overall reliability analysis but simply make generalized comments, such as better ergonomic design or improved human–machine interface, as means of risk reduction. While studies such as Blumenfeld and Inman (2009) and Huang, Chiu, Yeh, and Chang (2009) note the impact of inferior operator skill and other HR factors on quality and performance, neither has a risk reduction scope. Our scope is different from all of these in that we propose intervention methods to deal with the HR risk in the short-term planning horizon. In addition, we supply the DM with a cost-benefit analysis of intervention methods. There are no other works in the literature that enable the DM to choose the optimal course of action in maximizing revenue by minimizing failure risk stemming from the operators in a human–machine system.

The PHM is a common tool for analyzing the risk of failure and this is especially true when the PHM is parameterized using the Weibull baseline (Jardine, Banjevic, Montgomery, & Pak, 2008; Sikorska, Hodkiewicz, & Ma, 2011). The PHM relates the time of an event, such as failure, to a number of explanatory variables known as covariates. Several factors, including the equipment age or specific system characteristics, may influence the equipment’s hazard rate, which is the rate of transition out of a non-failed state to a failed state.

The general form of the Weibull PHM is defined as follows:

                              (

                     The hazard rate, h(t), is proportional to the (instantaneous) conditional probability of failure at time t. The first part of the equation, called the baseline hazard function, is sensitive to the age of the equipment. It contains two parameters, β and η, the shape parameter and the scale parameter, respectively. In the absence of covariates, scale parameter provides the characteristic life of approximately the 63rd percentile of failure data. When the model includes covariates, η becomes a balancing figure.

The second part includes the explanatory variables, zi
                     (t), which influence the hazard rate. Each explanatory variable, also called a covariate, represents a monitored condition datum at the time of inspection, t, such as parts per million of iron in the oil sample taken on a particular day, or the skill score of an operator as measured on a certain date. The coefficient γi
                      of covariate zi
                     (t) determines the covariate’s influence on the overall hazard rate.

We develop a PHM that includes HR factors, in addition to MR factors, as covariates so that we can calculate their effect on failure risk. This can aid us in the calculation of expected uptime as well as the probability of failure. Both are essential in developing the revenue model that determines the optimal intervention method for mitigating risk stemming from the operators.

For our purposes, the PHM’s general form in Eq. (1) is enhanced to more explicitly consider the possible interaction between covariates; this is expressed as:

The extended PHM presented in Eq. (1a) is employed to construct a revenue function, showing the optimal trade-off between failure risk and intervention costs. Assume that we have a number of people operating a set of hardware; examples are operators of machines in a manufacturing environment. The machines are not 100% automated and random failures may stem from mechanical/electrical issues as well as human error. Machine’s probability of failure due to MR and HR factors can be measured, using the PHM or other appropriate failure analysis methods. Failure cause and downtime duration can be captured, as can people’s specific involvement with each machine. Following the failures caused by the operators, repairs are expected to bring the machine back to an as-good-as-new state (Bartholomew-Biggs, Zuo, & Li, 2009). This assumption serves the purposes of this paper and is made to simplify the discussions. Furthermore, there is a DM in the system who can intervene by using our proposed method to find the optimal trade-off between risk and revenue.

The general form of the net revenue function associated with finding the optimal trade-off is as follows:

                                 ϑ: cost function of intervention method

The net revenue function depends on three factors: (1) the machine’s survival up to the beginning of the planning horizon; (2) the set of PHM covariates, Z; and (3) the matrix of decision variables, A, resulting from the available intervention methods.

The various decision variables affect one or more covariates. Their effects can be expressed as the following matrix:

                        Eq. (5) is the expected net revenue function and includes the revenue scheme, as well as the cost, associated with each intervention method. A DM can use this function as a cost-benefit analysis to choose the intervention method that results in the highest net revenue for the system.

We consider an industrial setting to illustrate our argument. We analyze the data set of a manufacturing company, model its performance in terms of the characteristics of its machines and operators, and develop a model to select the intervention method, yielding the highest profit. It should be noted that the results of our analysis have not been implemented in the company because the department ceased its operations.

The setting is an automotive manufacturing company in Ontario, Canada, traditionally producing either engines or components for engines and transmissions. The hourly workforce, hereafter referred to as operators, have either worked on the engine assembly lines or been involved with machining processes. Unlike the manual, fast, and repetitious work on an engine assembly line, machining work is slow and cognitive. The operator’s tasks include periodically gauging the product at various stages of the process and making offsets to the machines accordingly. The particular human–machine system considered consists of three complex machines, AA, BB, and CC. The machines differ slightly in certain mechanical components but have the same operational procedures. On each shift, one operator is assigned to each machine. Each machine operates on three shifts per day; therefore, there are a total of nine operators to consider.

System experts within the department are consulted to identify the most important factors affecting machine failures, due to factors stemming from the operators. These are stated to be operator skill and shift work, followed by the effect of the days of the week. In our context, we define skill to be the ability to operate the machine and to trouble-shoot. In order for each operator to get assigned a skill score, everyone is assessed quarterly by system experts using a framework designed based on a Critical Incident Technique (CIT) (Butterfield, Borgen, Maglio, & Amundson, 2009). The CIT consists of a set of procedures that are used to collect observations of the human behaviour deemed to have a critical significance on the phenomenon being analyzed. Each observed incident must meet certain pre-defined criteria. In our context, a critical incident can be defined as a task that ensures the success or failure of machine operation. Each feature of the technical and behavioural component may affect the phenomenon differently. We observe each mode and have procedures and pre-defined criteria in place to standardize how we perform the observations.

The tools we use when applying the CIT are questionnaires, observational studies, and technical tests. The system experts we use, supervisors and manufacturing engineers, complete questionnaires on technical and behavioural questions about the operators. System experts also perform observational studies on the operators. Finally, the operators are also involved as they complete a test that evaluates their technical knowledge. All are performed multiple times and in varying locations to eliminate/minimize common-method bias.

We assess operator skill in terms of three components. To look at expertise or skill as one variable may be an over-simplification, resulting in the loss of some information. The study by Blau and Kahn (1996), expresses “skill” in terms of two components, experience and education. Following their lead in categorizing skill into components, we express operator skill using the following three components:
                        
                           (a)
                           Experience level: Similar to the model developed by Blau and Kahn, we adopt the usage of “experience level” in our analysis. Familiarity with machining processes, in general, and knowledge in gear manufacturing, in particular, are likely to assist an operator with his daily activities.

Analytical skill: We indirectly adopt another term used by Blau and Kahn: education. All operators in Alpha have a high-school diploma as the highest level of formal education. Therefore, it is pointless to have education level as a distinguishing factor. However, we adopt the idea behind formal education. A positive result of education is the acquisition of technical or analytical skills. As these are normally gained through formal education, on-the-job training/learning, we adopt “analytical” as the second component of skill.

While experience level and analytical skill are related, analytical skill refers to expertise on specific machines, whereas Experience measures familiarity with the general gear manufacturing environment. Agrote, Insko, Yovetich, and Romero (1995), mention an interesting study at Lockheed where even though 2000 “green” employees were put through a job-specific 4-week training program, the productivity suffered greatly as a result of the inexperience of these employees. The authors go on to mention the importance of experience in the general area, in addition to job-specific training, when the tasks are complex.
                        
                           (a)
                           Social interaction: Based on the study of Soller (2001), we can see a correlation between overall skill and social skills in the form of interaction with peers and/or supervisors. The interaction is referring to the willingness to ask for help from others, and to offer help to others. Operators can benefit when they share ideas and give and receive help; help-giving can benefit even high achievers (Blumenfeld et al., 1996). The correlation between operating the machine well and the operator’s social skills makes intuitive sense. In a hypothetical scenario, two novice operators have similar experience levels and initial analytical abilities. During the first few weeks, they are both overwhelmed by their work and are unsure of many of their machine operation tasks. One operator is shy and would try to troubleshoot on his own. As such, the machine would remain down for a longer period of time. The second operator is outgoing and can easily ask his more senior colleagues for help. Effective collaboration with peers has proven itself a successful and uniquely powerful learning method (Brown & Palincsar, 1989). It is likely that the performance of the second operator in the hypothetical scenario will be better, at least in the initial stages.

While we acknowledge that each skill score is unlikely to remain static over time and that on-the-job-learning is likely to have a positive effect on operator expertise, we make a simplifying assumption that this dynamic nature occurs as a step function. The planning horizon we consider is short-term (one 8-hour shift) and as a result, assuming a constant skill score throughout the planning horizon makes sense. Therefore, the covariates in the PHM are not expressed as a function of time.

When the operators are on the afternoon or night shift, they may be less efficient due to disruptions in their Circadian rhythms, the fluctuations of one’s physiological conditions governed by the earth’s day-and-night cycle (Davy & Gobel, 2013). Various studies have established links between common shift-work decision variables and physiological factors related to fatigue (Barker & Nussbaum, 2011; Hsie, Hsiao, Cheng, & Chen, 2009). Two indicator variables, (X
                     1,
                     X
                     2), are used to represent the shifts. Day shift is the baseline, (0,0), where no ill-effects of shift work are felt. Afternoon shift and night shifts are represented by (1,0), and (0,1), respectively. Since we use two variables to represent three entities, the variables are not independent on their own. However, if we think of (X
                     1,
                     X
                     2) as representing “afternoon shift or not” and “night shift or not” respectively, their presence (or absence) in the final PHM has a significance.

We divide the week into three segments: Monday, Friday, and “the rest” (other three weekdays). The first day may be less productive and more error-prone than some of the other weekdays because the operators are just returning from the weekend and have not gotten into a rhythm. This is in line with work by Williams (2004) where he finds the average time worked per person is very similar on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, but lower on Mondays, and lowest on Fridays. Two indicator variables, (V
                     1,
                     V
                     2), represent the three segments of the week: “Monday”, “Friday”, and “the rest”, represented by (1,0), (0,1), and (0,0) respectively. Lastly, the three machines are treated as control variables and are represented by two indicator variables (Y
                     1,
                     Y
                     2).

We use 3049 records of production for the three machines, which include operational periods as well as failures and suspensions (a combined total of 119 failures and 11 suspensions). A representative portion of the data set appears in the Appendix. Using a backward selection model, complemented with the Akaike’s Information Criterion (Carr & Wang, 2011), the following PHM is obtained for the system:

                      adds further detail to Eq. (6). The operational and failure data is used to construct a likelihood function and estimate parameters of the PHM. Significance of parameters is determined through a Wald test. A detailed procedure of developing a PHM, including the likelihood function, is discussed in Vlok et al. (2002) and Lin et al. (2005). The estimation is done using the software EXAKT, designed specifically for proportional hazards modeling in industrial settings (Jardine et al., 1997; Jardine and Banjevic, 2005).

This model adequately represents the data set; when we perform a K–S test on the model fit, the p-value is 0.2 and as a result, the model fit is not rejected.

It is necessary to interpret the presence or absence of the terms in Eq. (6). Among the nine main effects considered, seven are present and two are not.
                           
                              •
                              Experience: this variable is absent in the model. It is highly correlated with Analytical (correlation coefficient of 0.85). The model can work by including either Experience or Analytical, but not both. When both are included, neither is found to be significant. Therefore, we use our expert judgement to include Analytical and exclude Experience. As an operator becomes more experienced, he typically gains more knowledge, translating into Analytical skill, or the ability to operate the machine. This is the general belief in the literature (Ash & Levine, 1985; Quinones et al., 1995). But more experience does not always result in higher abilities; it may have diminishing effects over time. Some early studies conclude work experience is not as successful for job performance as previously thought (Fiedler, 1970). A study by Hunter and Hunter (1984) finds a correlation factor of 0.18 between work experience and job performance.

Social: This variable is not highly correlated with Analytical or Experience. The partial correlation coefficients are 0.572 and −0.498 with Analytical and Experience, respectively. Therefore, its presence in the model is not surprising. It has a negative coefficient which makes intuitive sense: the higher the social skill, the less the risk posed.

Analytical: This variable is found to be significant with a negative coefficient. This makes intuitive sense: the higher the analytical skill, the less the risk posed. Therefore, training programs can reduce the risk posed by operator error or the inability to operate the machine.

                                 2: These are the two binary variables representing the afternoon and the night shifts. Both are significant and both have positive coefficients. This indicates both are worse (riskier) than the day shift.

                                 2: These are two binary variables representing AA and BB machines. Both are significant and both have negative coefficients, indicating that the AA and BB lines run better than the CC line.


                                 V
                                 1: This is a binary variable representing “first day of the week or not”. It is found to be significant, with a positive coefficient. The first day of the week is worse than the rest of the week. An operator’s productivity may be reduced on Mondays as he/she needs to be reoriented after two days away from the work process. Another possibility is that operators may lack motivation on a Monday because this day is furthest from the next available day of rest or leisure (Bryson and Forth, 2007).


                                 V
                                 2: This binary variable, representing “last day of the week or not” is absent in the model. The original thought behind including this variable was that as the week goes on, fatigue accumulates; by the last day of the week, the operator is more tired and consequently, less productive or alert. We also thought that the operator on the night shift might become adjusted to the night shift hours and performs better as the week goes on. If so, the night shift performance on Fridays would be better than Mondays. Neither seems to apply to Alpha.

We consider two intervention methods proposed by the DM at Alpha: reduction of the production rate and addition of a highly-knowledgeable person (hereafter referred to as a Guide) on shift. An example of such a Guide would be a company representative for the machine manufacturer. These are not the only HR intervention methods available to a DM. We use these two approaches as examples because they may be applicable to many systems including the considered case study. In general, the intervention methods can come from the system’s DM and have to be appropriate for the particular context.

Each intervention method considered by the DM has a decision variable associated with it in the mathematical formulation. As an example, the decision variable associated with adding a Guide is a binary variable that will be equal to 1 when the Guide is present and zero otherwise. Each value of the decision variable will affect expected uptime and probability of failure differently.

We follow Eq. (5) to obtain the expected value of Alpha’s revenue function. The terms of Eq. (5) are updated and defined as follows for Alpha:

For the net revenue part of the function, the expected uptime hours are multiplied by the production-per-hour of the operator, the profit-per-part, and the production rate. Production-per-hour is calculated as a moving average of the hourly production of the last M-shifts of a particular operator. For the second part of the function, an operator’s average failure cost, CF
                        , is calculated by taking the total cost of all HR failure modes that occur during this operator’s last M shifts, divided by the total number of failure occurrences during the same period. The third part of the function is the additional cost of a Guide per shift.

The two terms a
                        2,2 and a
                        2,8 represent the effects of the second decision variable, the addition of a Guide, on the second and the eighth covariates. The other covariates are not affected and the reasons will be discussed shortly. The term a
                        2,
                        
                           j
                         is a function of two variables: a
                        2,
                        
                           j
                        (g2,
                        k)=1+g2
                        k. Variable k measures the effect of the presence of a Guide on an operator’s skill. When there is a Guide available for the operator to consult with, the operator is likely to commit fewer mistakes. This has the equivalent effect of the operator having a higher analytical skill score. The presence of a Guide will not affect the experience level or social interaction components of skill, but it will affect the analytical skill component. As a result, only covariates z
                        2 and z
                        8 which are functions of Analytical skill are multiplied by a
                        2,
                        
                           j
                        . One way to determine the correct value of k is to have an initial value based on expert knowledge and then refine this value with more data. Shifts with and without Guides can be compared to determine the reduction in the hazard rate. This can be equated to a gain in analytical skill if all else remains fixed.

Decision variable a
                        0 is a function of production rate, r, and has the form a
                        0(r)=
                        rγ
                        . The rate, r, ranges between zero, for a stopped machine, and 1, for running the machine at the regular rate of 100%. When we consider Eq. (2), the form of a
                        0 ensures the overall hazard rate is zero if r
                        =0. A stopped machine has no risk of failure. The value for γ determines the effect of the reduction in hazard rate when the production rate is reduced. Empirical evidence can be used to determine γ. To this end, various production rates can be implemented while keeping other factors constant. As this approach may be impractical or expensive and difficult, we may expert knowledge elicitation, similar to the approach proposed by Zuashkiani et al. (2009). In this case, a rate is proposed, such as 50%, and the corresponding reduction in hazard rate is estimated by the experts. The hazard reduction value is then used to calculate the correct value associated with γ.

Alpha’s general revenue function is expressed in terms of probabilities, expected values, and the specifics of the PHM obtained. In the following numerical example, we analyze the two modes of HR-interventions. For each set of inputs, six scenarios are possible (Table 2
                        ); they consist of the combinations of presence or absence of a Guide (g
                        2
                        =1 or g
                        2
                        =0, respectively) and running production at full-speed, partial-speed, or not running at all (r
                        =1, r
                        =0.5, and r
                        =0, respectively). The scenario where we stop the machine and add a Guide is not considered as it would never be the optimal course of action. We calculate the revenue for each of the remaining five cases and choose the one with maximum revenue as the optimal course of action.

For demonstration purposes, various hypothetical sets of inputs are considered to show the possibility of different optimal solutions. All scenarios take place on the first afternoon shift of the week, {X
                        1
                        =1,
                        X
                        2
                        =0} and {V
                        1
                        =1,
                        V
                        2
                        =0}. We analyze an eight-hour shift on the CC machine, {Y
                        1
                        =1,
                        Y
                        2
                        =0}, at a working age t
                        =40hours. Adding a Guide has an effect equivalent to a 25% rise in analytical skill, k
                        =0.25. Operator’s production count and failure cost are calculated based on his last 20 shifts. The figures used in the hypothetical scenarios are based on figures provided by system experts and previous expenditures within the company. For example, machine vendor technicians have been used in the past at a daily rate of $800 to assist the operators or the maintenance crew. This figure is used to represent the cost of a Guide per shift.
                           
                              
                                 Scenario 1: An operator with skill scores of {Analytical
                                 =64.39, Experience
                                 =72.49, Social
                                 =62.44} is scheduled to operate the machine. Average failure cost is $2000 per incident; the operator’s hourly production average is 33; profit per piece is $40; and a 50% reduction in production rate results in a 15% reduction in hazard rate. As can be seen from Fig. 2
                                 a, the optimal course of action is to run at regular rate but to add a Guide to help the operator.


                                 Scenario2: the optimal course of action changes if the profit per piece is $10. All other factors remain the same as in scenario 1. As can be seen in Fig. 2b, the optimal course of action is to accept the risk and run at a normal rate, with no Guide.


                                 Scenario 3: All input parameters remain the same as in scenario 2, except the failure cost which is increased to $7000 per incident. As Fig. 2c shows, the optimal decision is to take the machine out of production for a shift until a more skilled operator is available.

In scenario 3, we are in a situation where the best course of action is to shut down the machine until a more skilled operator becomes available. This translates into a great deal of expensive capital expenditure sitting idle. Fixed costs are accruing while we are not making any revenue.

Alpha’s current departmental policy is for a new operator to be trained for two weeks prior to independently operating a machine. This arbitrary two-week period has no scientific basis. It is unrealistic to expect a fixed-length training program to be appropriate for everyone, regardless of aptitude or motivation. It would be more practical to certify the operator to possess a minimum skill set before assigning him a machine to operate on his own. The mathematical model developed in Section 3 can be used to derive the minimum skill level in order to ensure profitability. The company should not run into a situation such as scenario 3; operator risk should never be high enough to justify a stopped machine as the best course of action.

We propose a model that can provide a decision-maker with a cost-benefit analysis which allows him/her to choose among various intervention methods to deal with operator-related risk. The proposed revenue model makes use of the proportional hazards model to estimate the expected machine uptime and the probability of failure.

We provide a case study of a manufacturing company and use it to develop the revenue model. The factors found to be significant in our model are experience level, social interaction, analytical skill, shift work, and days of the week. We demonstrate the decision-making process resulting in the highest profit.

We use the PHM to predict the failure risk. A possible future work may be to apply the work by Bertholon, Bousquet, and Celeux (2006) for possibly improving the accuracy of our model. Furthermore, the list of human-related factors we consider is by no means exhaustive. Additional factors can be considered in future studies; examples include seasonality, motivation, and reward systems. Other work directly following ours may include identifying additional human-related intervention methods. We have identified two such intervention methods, adding a Guide and reducing the production rate. Once again, this is not an inclusive list and many others are possible, depending on the context. In addition to identifying and analyzing additional intervention methods, future work may develop an improved estimation of the effects of intervention methods. This research could focus on accurately predicting the relationship between the production rate change and the hazard rate reduction, and on calculating the effects of a Guide on the skill of the operator. Furthermore, an important future work to stem from the work presented in this paper would be to use the revenue model to develop a risk threshold. This threshold can then be used to determine the minimum level of skill required for an operator in order to ensure system profitability. Lastly, we currently do not distinguish among the failure modes. Performing a certain wrong task may require a simple reset, causing a ten-minute downtime, whereas performing a certain wrong sequence may result in physical damage, requiring a lengthy maintenance and hours of downtime. Therefore, considering different consequences for the various failure modes would make our analysis more realistic.
