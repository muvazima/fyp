                  In this study, we developed an integrated hospital-associated urinary tract infection (HAUTI) surveillance information system (called iHAUTISIS) based on existing electronic medical records (EMR) systems for improving the work efficiency of infection control professionals (ICPs) in a 730-bed, tertiary-care teaching hospital in Taiwan. The iHAUTISIS can automatically collect data relevant to HAUTI surveillance from the different EMR systems, and provides a visualization dashboard that helps ICPs make better surveillance plans and facilitates their surveillance work. In order to measure the system performance, we also created a generic model for comparing the ICPs’ work efficiency when using existing electronic culture-based surveillance information system (eCBSIS) and iHAUTISIS, respectively. This model can demonstrate a patient's state (unsuspected, suspected, and confirmed) and corresponding time spent on surveillance tasks performed by ICPs for the patient in that state. The study results showed that the iHAUTISIS performed better than the eCBSIS in terms of ICPs’ time cost. It reduced the time by 73.27s, when using iHAUTISIS (114.26s) and eCBSIS (187.53s), for each patient on average. With increased adoption of EMR systems, the development of the integrated HAI surveillance information systems would be more and more cost-effective. Moreover, the iHAUTISIS adopted web-based technology that enables ICPs to online access patient's surveillance information using laptops or mobile devices. Therefore, our system can further facilitate the HAI surveillance and reduce ICPs’ surveillance workloads.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are infections that patients acquire during the course of receiving treatment for other conditions within a healthcare setting [1]. Mostly, HAIs only appear in patients hospitalized for 48h or longer (refer to the 48h criterion). It estimates that approximately 1.7 million HAIs occur in hospitals, and 99,000 associated deaths occur each year in the US [2]. According to World Health Organization report, HAIs are major worldwide causes of death and disability [3,4]. Thus, HAIs are critical patient safety and healthcare quality issues [5]. Prevention and reduction of such infection has become one of the top priorities for health care.

The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has published guidelines to define HAI and surveillance criteria for specific types of HAI in acute care settings [6–8]. One of the most effective approaches to prevention and reducing HAIs is intensive surveillance that detects changes in clinical signs that require frequent, repeated and detailed bedside assessment on a patient by patient basis [7,9]. It is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive to implement [10]. Most hospitals cannot afford to conduct such comprehensive surveillance activities. Based on the CDC's case definitions of healthcare-associated urinary tract infection (HAUTI) [8], the criteria involve the use of combination of signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings. Thus, making a firm diagnosis of HAUTI was not always straightforward because of the inconsistent relationship between symptoms, pyuria, and bacteriuria [11–13]. Therefore, infection control professionals (ICPs) spend most of time on patient data collection, suspected cases finding, medical records review, bedside investigation, and so on. They can hardly free up their valuable time for proactive preventive activities that may reduce HAIs [14–16].

The electronic medical records (EMR) are records about patient care that can be processed by a computer [17,18]. With increased adoption of EMR systems in recent years [10,14,19], more and more sophisticated HAI surveillance data are made available in the electronic medical records. Thus, hospital-wide surveillance data on HAIs can be collected in a cost-effective way. There have been computerized HAI surveillance information systems (HAISISs) that rely on culture-based information systems [20–23], or on predictive models to improve infection control and disease surveillance [24–26]. Although the electronic culture-based surveillance systems can help ICPs saving their time in HAI surveillance work as well as for case management (e.g. follow-up of isolation procedures), there lacks a formal model for measuring the work efficiency between different types of electronic surveillance systems. Our aims were to develop an integrated HAI surveillance information system based on existing EMR systems for improving the work efficiency of ICPs, and create a generic model as a common platform for comparing ICPs’ work efficiency when using different electronic HAISISs. In this paper, we focused on HAUTI to illustrate the settings and methods for evaluating the work efficiency of two different types of electronic HAUTI surveillance systems.

HAI surveillance involves active case-finding by infection control teams and clinicians, uses clinical case definitions, and requires the collection of additional data to determine the infection source. ICPs need to routinely collect patients’ clinical data and laboratory tests results, and then analyze the data based on the CDC's guidelines to determine whether the patients are HAI cases. In general, patients may have experienced three states from the time of hospital admission to the time of hospital discharge: unsuspected, suspected, and confirmed. Thus, we can use a state transition diagram to model the workflow of HAI surveillance (Fig. 1
                     ) [27]. A circle represents a patient state, and the arrow that connects two states represents a transition from one state to another, i.e., from the state at the tail end of the arrow to the state at the arrow head end. Each state may be associated with a group of patients whose states are the same as that state, and a set of surveillance tasks that should be performed to the patients with that state. The performance of the HAI surveillance tasks on an individual patient may lead to trigger the patient's state change. The trigger is labeled on the edge between a “from state” and a “to state”.

Patients admitted to a hospital are supposed to be non-HAI cases. They are assigned to “unsuspected” state. For a patient in “unsuspected” state, ICPs collect and analyze his/her data relevant to HAI. If the patient's conditions are likely to meet the HAI case definitions, and meet the 48h criterion, then he/she is suspected with HAUTI. The patient's state is changed from state “unsuspected” to “suspected”.

For each patient in “suspected” state, ICPs usually check the collected data, review the patients’ medical records in more details, and further conduct bedside/onsite investigation to see whether the patient's conditions truly meet the CDC's HAUTI case definitions. If the patient is confirmed to be a true HAUTI case, then his/her state is changed from “suspected” to “confirmed” state. Similarly, if the patient is determined not to be a true HAUTI case, his/her state is changed to the state “unsuspected”. For each patient in “confirmed” state, the ICPs must complete his/her infection card for follow-up or prevention procedures, and report the confirmed cases to the Taiwan CDC [28]. All the patients’ conditions are continuously monitored. Moreover, if the patient still stays in the hospital because of other conditions, his/her state is changed to the state “unsuspected”. The surveillance workflow ends when the patient is discharged after treatment. The ICPs handle the changes to patients’ states and coordinate surveillance tasks using pen and paper, or with the help of computer systems.

The study was conducted at Taipei Medical University Wan Fang Hospital (TMUWFH), which is a 730-bed, tertiary-care teaching hospital in Taiwan. The Infection Control Department (ICD) is responsible for HAI surveillance and control and has an existing culture-based electronic surveillance information system (eCBSIS) to help ICPs performing HAI surveillance tasks. The ICD consisted of six ICPs including one infection control physician, one medical technologist, and four infection control nurses. The four infection control nurses were certified by the Infection Control Society of Taiwan [29]. We developed an information system for integrating the information relevant to HAI surveillance and control, particularly for HAUTI, from existing EMR systems at the hospital. We called the system Integrated HAUTI Surveillance Information System (iHAUTISIS). To compare the work efficiency between the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS, we used the generic model for HAI surveillance, presented in Section 2.

The electronic culture-based surveillance information system (eCBSIS) used at TMUWFH includes several independent systems such as a laboratory information management system (LIS), inpatient management information system (IMIS), nursing information system (NIS), and other types of EMR systems, as shown in Fig. 2
                        . These systems partially support HAUTI surveillance information that can be accessed by ICPs just one at a time.

ICPs use the LIS to collect patients’ urine/blood culture tests and results. If the patients’ culture results are positive, they are suspected to be HAUTI. The suspected patients are assigned to the ICPs for further investigation. In order to rule out the community-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), the ICPs can access the IMIS to acquire the patients’ hospital admission records and the EMR systems to acquire their clinical data. The suspected patients are under comprehensive medical review and bedside investigation. If the patients’ conditions meet the CDC's HAUTI case definitions, they are confirmed to be true HAUTI cases. The ICPs complete the true HAUTI patients’ HAI cards for follow-up and prevention procedures. The required information can be acquired from the EMR systems. During hospitalization, all patients are routinely monitored by ICPs to ensure that HAI cases can be detected.

The iHAUTISIS consists of case detection, data services, case management, and visualization dashboard modules, as shown in Fig. 3
                        . It is designed for integration of HAUTI surveillance data from existing EMR systems to support HAUTI surveillance practice.

The case detection module is primarily designed based on a discriminant function with six variables (fever, urine culture, blood culture, routine urinalysis, antibiotic use, and invasive devices) for detection of suspected HAUTI cases [30]. A patient's discriminant score can be computed with the values of variables. If the patient's score is less than a cut-off point, then he/she is classified to a non-HAUTI case; otherwise he/she is classified to a HAUTI case.

The data services module, which consists of data collection service functions, is used to extract required surveillance data from EMR systems, and transform them into standardized formats. Each data service is associated with a specific task for data retrieval and has standard interfaces to access the underlying EMR systems. There are six data collection service functions corresponding to the six surveillance variables (fever, urine culture, blood culture, routine urinalysis, antibiotic use, and invasive devices) as indicated in [30]. In addition, each patient's signs and symptoms, and clinical data, such as patient profile, multiple drug resistance (MDR) reports, and radiology images and reports, are also collected. All data are integrated into the surveillance information database, as shown in Fig. 3.

The case management module handles a patient's state change based on the patient state transition diagram (Fig. 1). There are five major steps involved in the case management module as follows:
                           
                              (i)
                              When a patient is admitted, the case management module assigns “unsuspected” state to the patient, and initiates the HAUTI case detection module to monitor the patient's conditions.

When a patient is changed to “suspected” state, the case management module assigns “suspected” state to the patient, and sends an email and a short-message to the responsible ICP to conduct further chart review and bedside investigation.

When a patient is changed to “confirmed” state, the case management module assigns “confirmed” state to the patient, and sends a reminder to the responsible ICP to complete the patient's infection card by providing the patient's HAUTI related information such as clinical data, microbiology reports of culture results, and antibiogram, etc.

When a patient is excluded from a “suspected” case, the case management module assigns “unsuspected” state to the patient, and initiates the HAUTI case detection module to monitor the patient's conditions.

After treatment, if a patient is discharged from the hospital, the case management module removes the patient from the state. However, if the patient still stays in the hospital because of other conditions, the case management module moves the patient to the “unsuspected” state.

To facilitate the ICPs for better management of patients and their states change during their hospitalization, we designed an integrated tabular view as a visualization dashboard (Fig. 4
                        ). At the top of Fig. 4, patients’ clinical data are presented as variables displayed on “Application services” list. In this example, there are six variables fever, urine culture (culture order (U)), blood culture (culture order (B)), routine urinalysis (Urine routine), antibiotic use (Anti), and invasive devices (UTI devices). ICPs can select appropriate variables by dragging the variable tabs from the “Application services” list to the “Selected items” list. In this example, the selected items are fever and antibiotic use. The variables are then integrated with other patient information such as name, gender, bed number, etc., and displayed in the mid table area of the dashboard. If a variable is at a high/low risk of HAUTI, it is presented as a red icon (
                           
                        )/green icon (
                           
                        ). For example, if a patient's temperature >38°C, then the variable, fever, is presented as a red icon (
                           
                        ), as shown in Fig. 4.

At the very top of Fig. 4, the patients are grouped into “unsuspected”, “suspected”, and “confirmed”. For example, if “suspected” tab is clicked, all the patients in “suspected” state are listed in the table. An ICP can browse an individual patient's detailed clinical data by clicking the tab (
                           
                        ). A window is then popped up, as shown in Fig. 5
                        , to show more detailed surveillance information, including patient profile, antibiotic treatments, fever records, white blood cell count (WBC) results, invasive device use records, culture and MDR reports, and chest images/reports. If the tab “culture reports and MDR” is clicked, the popup window presents the patient's culture tests history. If we want to know the detailed MDR report of a test, we can click the “detail” tab (under MDR column) associated with that test.

Although the system can automatically detect a suspected HAUTI case, the ICPs still need to make decision on whether the suspected case is a true case. Thus, if ICPs confirm a suspected HAUTI case to be a true case, the ICP can click the 
                           
                         icon to move the patient to the “confirmed” group, or otherwise click the 
                           
                         icon to move the patient to the “unsuspected” group.

We adopted Adobe Flex technology to implement the visualization of surveillance information, which can run on all major browsers using Adobe Flash Player software [31]. Therefore, ICPs can use a laptop or mobile devices to access the system and the patients’ HAUTI related information to perform HAUTI surveillance tasks at any time and anywhere.

With the support of different systems, ICPs may perform varied tasks for their HAI surveillance practice. Thus, we used the generic HAI model presented in Section 2 as a common ground to compare the surveillance tasks required to perform when using the two different systems. When using the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS to support HAUTI surveillance, we can compare the surveillance tasks performed by ICPs for each patient state. Table 1
                         summarizes three surveillance task groups corresponding to the three patient states when using the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS, respectively. For example, to detect a suspected patient from the unsuspected group, an ICP has to check the patient's culture tests results when using the eCBSIS; however, the ICP does not need to do anything when using the iHAUTISIS because the system can detect the suspected cases automatically.

@&#METHODS@&#

To evaluate the work efficiency of the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS, we recruited four ICPs to perform surveillance tasks. Since the suspected cases can be detected using the two systems, ICPs start their surveillance tasks once the suspected patients were noticed. Thus, in this study, each ICP was asked to complete the surveillance tasks for 30 suspected HAUTI patients using the eCBSIS, and then complete another 30 suspected HAUTI patients using the iHAUTISIS. The former patients were called the eCBSIS group, and the latter were called the iHAUTISIS group. Therefore, there were 120 suspected HAUTI cases in the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS group, respectively. For each patient in the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS group, for each state we recorded the time needed to complete the surveillance tasks associated with that state, respectively. The patients were admitted to the hospital on and after November 1, 2010. To consistently compare the work efficiency between the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS, we only used truly infected HAUTI cases. Data analysis was performed using the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test for comparison of time differences between the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS group. Level of significance was accepted when p
                        <0.05. The statistics software SPSS™ 18.0 edition (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the analysis. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at TMUWFH.

@&#RESULTS@&#

This study started on November 1, 2010 and ended on April 22, 2011. Each of ICPs should collect 30 suspected HAUTI patients by using eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS, respectively. Therefore, there were 120 suspected HAUTI cases in the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS group, respectively. To compare the eCBSIS with iHAUTISIS, we only used truly HAUTI cases. Accordingly, of these, there were 35 and 69 true HAUTI cases identified in the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS group, respectively. The time spent on each patient state of the two groups is presented descriptively in Table 2
                        . The time spent on unsuspected, suspected and confirmed states in the iHAUTISIS and eCBSIS groups were 73.31±20.71 and 165.95±78.24, 134.83±73.76 and 175.44±85.56, and 134.63±39.61 and 221.22±85.42s, respectively. The marginal means in the iHAUTISIS and eCBSIS groups were 114.26±57.43 and 187.54±84.87s, respectively. We can see the time cost in the eCBSIS group was much greater than that in the iHAUTISIS group.

The test of homogeneity of variance between the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS groups was statistically significant (p
                        >0.05). That was, the assumption of the ANOVA test has been met. We then performed the two-way ANOVA (Table 3
                        ). We can see the interaction between system group and patient state (F
                        =4.818, p
                        =0.009) was statistically significant. That means, on one hand the some changes in both independent variables (Surveillance system * patient state) must have an effect on the dependent variable (time cost); on the other hand it cannot explain which surveillance system behaved differently. This is because the existing hospital's EMR systems do not support all of the HAUTI surveillance data, such as most clinical signs and symptoms. Therefore, for each patient's state, the ICPs’ use of degree of the surveillance system is different. For example, although the patient's surveillance data can be partially acquired from the surveillance systems in the “suspected” state, ICPs sometimes may spend more time for performing manually chart review and bedside investigation. On the contrary, when the patients in the “suspected” state, the ICPs can use the surveillance systems to capture the suspected HAUTI cases rather than conduct manually. Therefore, we used post hoc comparisons to test the marginal mean of each patient state between system groups. The results are shown in Table 4
                        . There were three pairwise comparisons, which had statistically significant difference between systems (p
                        <0.05), respectively. We can see that the time spent on all three patient states in the iHAUTISIS group was statistically significantly less than in the eCBSIS group.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

As previous studies indicated, the eCBSIS can reduce 60–65% of time spent on the surveillance work with respect to the conventional (manual) surveillance methods [32,33]. In this study, we developed an iHAUTISIS for mitigating ICPs’ surveillance workload. The system can collect data relevant to HAUTI surveillance from different EMR systems automatically. We also designed an integrated tabular view as visualization dashboard that enabled ICPs to get an at-a-glance overview and details of their surveillance work. For example, a patient with more red icons has higher risk of HAUTI. Then, ICPs can make priority for screening those suspected HAUTI cases based on red icons. Therefore, the visualization dashboard can help ICPs make a better surveillance plans and facilitate their surveillance work. However, in this study the ICPs still required to perform chart review and bedside investigation manually when using the eCBSIS and iHAUTISIS, respectively. This is because the existing EMR systems do not support all of the HAUTI surveillance data. For example, most signs and symptoms were not recorded in the EMR systems. Nevertheless, according to the study results (Table 2), it showed that the iHAUTISIS performed better than the eCBSIS in terms of ICPs’ time cost. The iHAUTISIS can reduce 73.27s (114.26s vs. 187.53s); in other words, it can effectively reduce 39% time cost for each patient on average. In practically, the time spent on HAI surveillance includes not only the time spent on system operations but also the time spent on the relevant data collection and preparation and communications between healthcare professionals, which consume most ICPs’ time. Thus, ICPs can save even more time by using the iHAUTISIS. The saved time can be used for patient care and promotion of HAI prevention.

Unlike previous studies, this study used a generic HAI model for measuring the work efficiency of different electronic surveillance systems. The model provides a common ground for comparisons, in terms of a patient state and the time spent on surveillance tasks performed by ICPs for the patient in that state, between different systems. This made the comparisons more precise and understandable.

More importantly, unlike the eCBSIS that prints out the patients’ culture tests results and passively provides suspected cases, the iHAUTISIS can automatically detect a suspected HAUTI patient, and send an alert through email or a short message service to the responsible ICPs. Therefore, ICPs can respond faster and conduct HAI surveillance tasks earlier.

With increased adoption of EMR systems, more and more HAI surveillance data are available. In other words, the integrated HAI surveillance information systems would be more and more cost-effective because data collection and case finding can be done automatically. Moreover, the iHAUTISIS adopted web-based technology that enables ICPs to online access patient's surveillance information using laptops or mobile devices. This can enhance ICPs’ surveillance capability and make them more rooms to conduct proactive HAI preventive activities.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this study, we developed an iHAUTISIS with a visualization dashboard for facilitating the HAUTI surveillance tasks and reducing ICPs’ workload. The system can collect data relevant to HAUTI surveillance from the different EMR systems automatically. We also proposed a generic model as a common ground for comparisons between different systems, in terms of a patient's state and the time spent on the surveillance tasks performed by ICPs for the patient in that state. This makes comparisons more precise and understandable.

With increased adoption of EMR systems of EMR systems, the development of the integrated HAI surveillance information systems would be more and more cost-effective. Moreover, the iHAUTISIS adopted web-based technology that enables ICPs to online access patient's surveillance information using laptops or mobile devices. Thus, the system can further facilitate the HAI surveillance.
