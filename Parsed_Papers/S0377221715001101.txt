                  A decision support tool is proposed for optimising the expansion planning of a semi-liberalised electricity market, whilst the underlying interaction of the generating mix with electricity prices is researched, in the long-run. A nonlinear stochastic programming algorithm is used for handling multiple uncertainties, optimising the power sector characteristics, both in terms of financial and environmental performance. Two endogenous models and an exogenous one are analysed and compared. The endogenous model results indicate that consumers might benefit by the moderate electricity prices in case the optimal loads and capacity orders are rendered. The exogenous model is insensitive to generating mix variations. The long-term actions suggested for system operators are comprised of the permits issued for new entries. They are affected by the evolution of electricity prices, since the permits granted for conventional technologies are maintained when their profits are rising. The permits granted for renewable technologies are also maintained, thus allowing cleaner electricity production to be induced to the grid. The optimal bid strategies of generators interact with their dispatching schedule and the diversification of their load curves. The relevant bids are primarily driven by the merit order, the plants are dispatched in. The assigned load levels may be raised in profitable producers so that their profit is maximised. They might be restrained instead, in case there are no significant prospects for individual profits. The lognormal distribution of electricity price results is characterised by increasing variance over time, indicating that the model is more robust in the most imminent solutions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Electricity markets are characterised by multiple uncertainties, which may have an impact to the evolution of electricity price. These uncertainties may be identified in the volatility of fuel and CO2 allowance prices, in the variations of power generating mix and/or in the displacement of mature workhorse technologies by emerging ones. The liberalised energy market progressively needs to respond to many challenges, which in turn make it more uncertain. This is the context of the evolution of System Marginal Price (SMP) i.e. the price paid by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) to the producers for generating an additional kilowatt hour of electricity. To an extent this price is partially transferred to civilian or industrial users and it is mainly influenced by the power generating mix.

The power sector may be considered as an integrated system, not necessarily limited to the borders of domestic electricity market. Different forms of interaction may exist between system agents, either internal (domestic fuel resources, power producers, providers and users) or external (international fuel trading markets, carbon trading markets etc.). A social planner would ideally try to find an optimal point of operation where the internal agents (power producers and users) would be satisfied: the producers should be profitable whilst the users should be able to buy cheap electricity. The research for that optimal point would probably entail the following query: “Let us suppose that fuel and CO2 allowance prices are somehow estimated for the following periods; what long-term actions should be realised in order to lead to highest yields or—more desirably—to optimal system's Net Present Value (NPV)”? These actions might be comprised of the permits foreseen for energy investments, based either on emerging or older technologies. An estimate of the impact of those strategic interventions to the evolution of SMP might be important: in case this is reduced, as a result of optimised expansion, then the cost transferred to civilian or industrial users is lower. Normally, the optimisation of system NPV has a two-fold advantage: (a) it would reduce the probability for individual producers to experience suboptimal yields (b) it would lead to the reduction of SMP. The former is a direct effect of optimisation, whilst the latter yet remains to be proved.

The present work focuses on the detailed description of a decision support model, proposed for the optimised generation expansion planning (GEP) of electricity market. Primarily, it has been adjusted to the case of the Greek Power Sector but it might be applied to other markets with similar characteristics. The operational research (OR) algorithm attempts to maximise the power sector's NPV. A non-linear, stochastic programming approach has been implemented to handle the multiple uncertainties of the optimisation problem. The optimal orders of power capacity (in megawatt electric (MWel)) are estimated annually. They correspond to licences (permits), granted by the State for approving the installation of power producing facilities based on different technologies/fuel types. The optimal load intensity factors are derived as well, for each technology, on an annual basis. The optimisation process implies meeting certain demand and environmental targets. Multiple constraints, related with the availability of energy recourses and grid stability are also imposed. The evolution of SMP is modelled, by simulating its mutual, recent interaction with power generating mix and fuel prices. Two endogenous approaches are used for this reason: an explicit and an implicit one. Additional constraints are imposed to simulate the current bidding system. The results of the endogenous methods are compared with those of a different, exogenous approach: representing the evolution of SMP by a Wiener process (Geometric Brownian Motion, GBM). The objectives and the contribution of the article may be summarised in the following points:

                        
                           -
                           To analyse the underlying mechanism of recent, endogenous interaction of power generating mix with the anticipated SMP evolution and extrapolate it in the long-run.

To investigate the robustness of the optimisation under multiple uncertainties and compare the endogenous SMP behaviour with the exogenous GBM approach.

Short term analyses of spot electricity prices, including sophisticated simulations of jumps and spikes, have been recently published (e.g. Amjiady & Keynia, 2011; Serinaldi, 2011). Medium to long-term simulation has been also effectively used in the analysis of the structure of year-ahead forward contracts (e.g. in Redl, Haas, Huber & Böhm, 2009). The evolution of electricity prices and other key energy commodities like fuel and carbon allowance prices has been simulated using stochastic Wiener processes i.e. the GBM (Blyth et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2008) and mean reverting (MR;
Tseng & Barz, 2002; Weber, 2005). These are special cases of a more generic class of stochastic processes, namely the ARMA and ARIMA models (Box et al., 1994), which have also been used for the simulation of the aforementioned commodities (
Bowden & Payne, 2008). More recently, the wavelet transform has been effectively used for filtering reasons in conjunction with GARCH (Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models able to handle the dynamic volatility of electricity prices, as shown by Schlueter (2009). Fuzzy systems and neural networks were increasingly appreciated during the last decade for long-medium-term simulations (Filik Gerek & Kurban, 2009; Kiartzis, Bakirtzis, Theocharis & Tsagas, 2000).

Unlike the traditional Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, which has been extensively used in the past for the analysis of energy investments, the method proposed hereby, follows the recent trend for time-varying approaches. Previously irreversible investment decisions have been progressively displaced by flexible planning, subject to optimisation processes. Early GEP studies focused primarily on the cost minimisation and not on the NPV maximisation (e.g. Park, Lee, & Youn, 1984): the expansion planning was optimised using the maximum principle, but without accounting the NPV over the entire operational life-time of the power sector. Progressively, the optimisation of the power sector required the utilisation of algorithms able to handle more effectively the underlying, non-linear, functional relationships of multi-variable sets. Particle swarms are recently used for GEP optimisation (Tafreshi, Shayanfar, Saliminia, Rabiee & Aghaei, 2011).

In modern, liberalised electricity markets, decision making depends not so much on centralised State or utility-based procedures, but rather on decentralised decisions of energy utilities, as stated in the article of Most and Keles (2010). In this work, a detailed review of commercial, decision-support tools is presented, regarding the O.R. modelling (either stochastic or deterministic) of liberalised electricity markets. Effective software like the AURORAxmp, the EMCAS and the GTMmax are described, though with few details about the solvers developed and the price modelling of commodities. Agents’ behaviour in oligopolistic markets has been traditionally represented by equilibrium models. Some works based on conjectural variations equilibrium models have been published, representing agents’ behaviour in electrical power markets under multiple uncertainties. These models provide insight of market equilibrium sensitivity to agents’ strategies and external variables, and therefore, they are widely applied (Rong & Lahdelma, 2007; Wang, Mazumdar, Bailey & Valenzuela, 2007). In other studies (e.g. Lise & Kruseman, 2008), deterministic models were used for the investigation of long-term investment decisions in power sectors. Other approaches replicate the system structure and the linkage among system components (Olsina, Garces & Houbrich, 2006). Thus, the dynamic response of the system is derived showing that the behaviour of power markets may differentiate from the results of more classic approaches. The introduction of uncertainties may somehow complicate the modelling of electricity markets. However, its importance is identified and various algorithms and computational techniques were lately used, as pointed out in the review of Foley, Gallachóir, Hur, Baldick and McKeogh (2010). Basically, they all end up in some form of stochastic programming, meaning the optimisation of multiple discrete scenarios, each one corresponding to a different input. Stochastic Programming based on Monte-Carlo algorithms has been effectively used in past researches of power generation planning under uncertainty (Fleten & Kristoffersen, 2007; Heinrich et al., 2007; Tanabe, Yasuda, Yokoyama & Sasaki, 1993). Nonetheless, different SMP modelling and linear solvers were mainly used in these studies, instead of the non-linear SQP solver of the present research.

The power sector of Greece was the market model for this research. Currently it experiences a transition from a regulated to a semi-liberalised form whereby the system marginal prices are modulated through day-ahead, double-auction processes. This bidding system is responsible for the formation of the electricity price through which the conventional technologies are compensated, whilst—on the other hand—the prices for renewable energies are regulated following a fixed path. Since, the profit of individual companies is not researched here, the power producers are grouped by their technology/fuel type. The power sector is considered to be operating for a 38-year period forward. The research is carried out on an annual basis: The energy variables are yearly averaged whilst the year 2013 is used as a reference for comparing fiscal values. Domestic electricity market, internal producers and external fuel and carbon trading markets constitute the agents of the model. The methodological approach is based on the non-linear optimisation of system's NPV. The mathematical model is transferred to a computational algorithm in order to produce the numerical results required for the analysis. Stochastic programming with recourse has been performed for this task, meaning that multiple scenarios of uncertainties were introduced as inputs and further optimised, one-by-one. The scenario generator was based on the reconstitution of commodity uncertainties through a Monte-Carlo method. This method leads to multiple strategies, operating on each one of the stochastic input states, respectively. Convexity may offer significant advantages when the optimisation of non-linear objective functions is considered and therefore a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) solver of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) equations has been applied (Waltz, Morales, Nocedal, & Orban, 2006).
                     

In a yearly averaged model, the generating mix might be simulated, using the load duration curves of the exemplary schematic shown in Fig. 1 (left side). The aggregate demand d(t) (blue curve) is sorted in descending order over time. The loads delivered by any technology, follow this order, but they are further regressed and smoothed. The resulted power lines simulate the merit order (Sensfuß, Ragwitz, & Genoese, 2007), in which the technologies are progressively dispatched starting from the cheapest fuels (i.e. lignite in black) and gradually proceeding to the more expensive ones, e.g. NG units in yellow and marginal, diesel-fired generators in red.

The electricity energy produced from each technology is known before each iteration of the optimisation algorithm (see Section 3.2.3). Pi,z
                               (given in megawatt hour electric (MWhel)) denotes that energy, produced from the power plants of type (i) during year z, linked with their relevant average factors (see Table 1

The energy produced from each conventional technology may be approximated by the area between its power line and the preceding one. It is derived by either the triangle or the trapezoidal formula, depending on the operating time. Usually the operation of base-load (e.g. lignite) plants is prolonged, whilst the marginal plants are temporarily dispatched for serving peak loads. Initially, the trapezoidal formula is supposedly used and investigated as follows:

In the exemplary Fig. 1, the marginal plants are indicatively approximated using the triangle area formula, due to the analysis leading to Eq. (6)
. On the other hand, the base-load and the NG-fired plants are approximated using the trapezoidal formula (Eq. (5)). It is noted, that the model investigates and eventually decides the appropriate modelling for each technology.

In the right part of Fig. 1, the interaction of demand (blue) and supply (red) curves is shown. The supply curve comprises of the marginal costs, which correspond to the bids offered by the various power generating technologies as a function of the offered capacity (approximated with successive linear segments). Any bid, if accepted, will be further compensated at a price defined by the intersection of demand and supply curves. In a uniform pricing system, this price would be at least equal to the bids of the most expensive plants so that their corresponding costs would be fully remunerated. The remaining cheaper plants would normally realise that price as a chance for profits, since it is higher than their unitary costs. Thus in Fig. 1, the part of the annual production corresponding to the t
                              OIL period should be remunerated at a price close to the bids offered by marginal plants despite that RES, base-load and NG-fired plants are also used to produce it. I.e. the red shaded trapezoid (energy) E1

The lowest price used for remunerating each technology is assumed to coincide with the higher of the previous cheaper one (e.g. SMP1
                                 z
                              : lowest for oil, highest for NG, Fig. 1 right) for diversifying the costs among the units of the same technology. Also, partly linear segments of SMP over time were assumed for the various technologies, since both power-time (left) and SMP-power (right) graphs were linearly modelled. Thus an annual, average SMP may follow:

The SMP constitutes the compensation rate for conventional power plants, which are normally paid by the State (TSO). The evolution of SMP over time may be also implicitly modelled using an alternative method, namely a time-sliding technique which constitutes an internal loop within each one of the optimisation iterations (Fig. 3). Electricity prices are primarily assumed to be linked to the generating mix and fuel prices.

                              A neural net structure would be ideal for identifying the functional relationship of those linked vectors. Initially, this was the modelling approach for the required pattern recognition: The elements of

                                  constitute the input pattern whilst the elements of pe constitute the target pattern. Unfortunately, the computational time spent on the minimisation of neural net weights was crucial: the external optimisation loop was considerably delayed and moreover, its convergence rate was compromised.
                            More specifically, the SMP may be written in implicit matrix form as a function of generating mix and fuel prices:

                              z(t). The above system is iteratively resolved for successive year-sets. In each set, the number of years equals to the number of technologies participating in the current bidding system and compensated through SMP-driven rates. More analytically, the system of Eq. (11) may be analytically formulated for the time range k + 1 →k + m as follows:

The vector pe of the right part corresponds to the target vector. Apparently, the following condition is required for a well-posed algebraic system:

The resulted weight vector Sx (valid for time-window k + 1 → k + m) is assumed to remain unchanged for the next set of years, which are further advanced by 1 (k + 2 → k + m + 1), thus following a time-sliding pattern. Then the system is being reconstituted for this next set (k + 2 → k + m + 1), meaning that the vector

                            (corresponding to k + 2 → k + m + 1) is multiplied to the weight vector Sx in order to generate the next vector pe (with the SMPs of years k + 2 → k + m + 1). All but the last element (pe

A new Sx vector is produced, which is considered to remain fixed until the next set of years (k + 3 → k + m + 2). This technique is iterated successively until the end of time considered for this research (year 2050). The technologies affected by this pricing model include plants fuelled by lignite, natural gas (NG) and oil. Hydroelectric plants as well as hydro-pumped depots are also assumed to be paid using the aforementioned SMP rates. The algorithm is customisable and other technologies might also be used, constricted though to a moderate number of proven conventional as well as emerging renewable technologies and their variants. An exemplary application of the preceding analysis is given in Appendix A.

The aforementioned two endogenous methods used for the modelling of SMP, are processed within each one of the iterations of a typical power-sector optimisation algorithm which is described, in detail, in recent works (Tolis, Doukelis, & Tatsiopoulos, 2010; Tolis & Rentizelas, 2011). An enhanced version, adjusted to the endogenous SMP modelling is adopted though, and it is presented hereby. The objective function, representing the aggregate system NPV, is formulated using either Eq. (18) or (18a), which correspond to the explicit and implicit endogenous SMP modelling, respectively. If the explicit SMP model is used, the average electricity prices, valid for each discrete period and remunerating the energy parts E1

Important notes concerning the objective function are pointed out in Appendix B. Its non-linear characteristics are identified in the first left and last right terms of the second line. They are also analysed in Appendix B together with the rationale of its structure and its discrete sub-functions. The independent variables of the optimisation problem are: the capacities ordered in the year v (Xi,v
                            in megawatt electric), and the dimensionless load intensity factor θi,z
                            (in percent) of the power plants of technology (i), operating during year z (z≠v). The capacity additions (either ordered in the past Ci,v
                           , or planned for the future Xi,v
                           ) are linked with the total installed capacity (Li,z
                            in megawatt electric) of current year (z), using the formulation of Eq. (28). The dashed symbols denote capacity additions exceeding their operational life time:

Thus, it is ensured that the plants exceeding their operational life-time, cannot contribute anymore to the power production process. The model's constraints are explained in Tolis et al. (2010) and in Tolis and Rentizelas (2011) but some improvements are proposed hereby:

Each technology should not produce more power than the aggregate potential Eni
                               (in megawatt electric) of its corresponding natural resources, statistically recorded (inequality (19)).

The average electricity energy production has to meet the simulated demand projection including transmission and distribution losses. Moreover, it should not exceed the demand by more than a very small value (e), since any excessive production may not be exploited by the system (inequality (20)). The installed capacities should also be able to serve the peak power demand (linearly projected) in order to avoid a generic power outage. An additional reserve margin has been further multiplied to the projected peak-power demand in order to account for the possibility of some plants’ failure or fuel unavailability (inequality (21)). The constraints above may affect either power or energy supply depending on which one proves to be stricter.

It is assumed that in the far future, the penetration of RES in total power production may be allowed to approach the 100 percent of the actual demand (inequality (22)) (ISE, 2012; SRU, 2011).

These constraints are applied in every country participating in the Kyoto Protocol. Greece is required to meet these targets imposed by the EU directive 2001/77/EC (Zhang & Wei, 2010): the renewable energy technologies should obtain a share of more than 30 percent of total electricity production by the year 2020. A future tightening of the aforementioned constraint may also be opted in the executable algorithm. In this work, the originally scheduled environmental constraints have been imposed in order to reveal the impact of generating mix on the evolution of electricity prices, under the pre-determined environmental obligations.

The annual capacity orders Xi,v
                               are imposed to be positives. Especially, lignite and NG plant orders (i = 1, 2) should exceed 350 megawatt electric, in order to achieve individual scale economies, otherwise, such an investment would not be feasible and thus it should be postponed. Higher or lower capacity thresholds may be opted in markets other than the investigated one (inequalities (25a)–(25c)). Moreover, an upper bound has been imposed on marginal plants’ load-factor, based on historical peak-load durations, linearly projected to the future (inequality (25d)). Otherwise, the operation of marginal plants would be prolonged in order to generate more profits from technologies fired by cheaper fossil fuels (i.e. base-load and borderline plants). This would be a direct consequence of the modelling, based on the merit order of dispatching and on the uniform pricing of conventional producers. On the one hand, these profits might contribute to the increasing of the optimised system's NPV. On the other hand, they would be unrealistic, despite their modelling, which is based on the aforementioned standard practices of pricing. More specifically, while these profits may be interesting for individual borderline and base-load producers of conventional energy, their linkage to prolonged operation of expensive marginal plants' would reflect (and finally lead) to constantly high SMPs. However, this is an unrealistic, unacceptable condition, as the high SMPs would further be transferred to the final users at a very high social cost. Unrealistically high SMPs may be avoided, by using the aforementioned constraint: the marginal plants (i = i
                              marginal: index resulted by merit order), only produce the supplementary energy needed for serving high peak-loads. By constricting their operation, to be less than the projected duration of peak-loads (25d), peers equivalently to imposing an upper bound in marginal plants' θi,z
                              .

In the implicit method, the resulting SMP should not exceed the average levels foreseen by the explicit method, through Eq. (10), (inequality (26)). A fluctuation margin (fm∼5–10 percent) is applied in that constraint, since there is no specific reason for the implicit results to lie necessarily below the explicit ones. This constraint prevents the optimised implicit evolution of SMP from driving in an uncontrolled, chaotic path. If the explicit method is directly used, there is no need for engaging this constraint within the optimisation model.

Each plant should be operational for at least some minimum time period in order to ensure a viable business plan. At an average, this might be reflected to the load factor (θi,z
                              ) of the corresponding technology's group (i). As formulated by the constraint-inequality 27 (or 27a), the profits of each technology should be at least zero (break-even state). The inquired minimal θi,
                              
                              min
                              
                                 z
                               should comply with this state. It is noted that, the fuel, CO2 and fixed costs, as well as the capital cost repayment annuities are different among the various technologies and therefore, their corresponding θi,
                              
                              min
                              
                                 z
                               should also be different. The unitary constraints—inequalities (27) or (27a) should be applied to the implicit or explicit endogenous SMP models respectively. The SMP levels, derived by Eqs. (8)
 and (
8a), are engaged in the latter case. The time-periods, during which the aforementioned SMP levels are valid, are used in accordance with the analysis leading to Eq. (6)
. The term (1-δij

Note that, in the calculation of profits, the average SMP levels additionally include the relevant PSPs (Power Subsidy Premiums), subsidising each megawatt hour electric produced. The PSPs are varying among the generating technologies. They have been incorporated as a motive for private investors to engage in the market. The user may opt for the level of PSPs (if any), depending on the investigated market regulations or retrieve them by the relevant TSO.

The optimisation is performed using a hybrid algorithm split in three steps:

                           
                              (I)
                              The initial guess of the independent variables is selected from a pool of randomly generated values. The optimal multivariate set is selected, as the one leading to the highest NPV. The duration of this procedure is short, despite the numerous numerical experiments.

The optimal annual orders and load intensities of Step I, constitute an initial guess for the second optimisation; the evolution of SMP over time is simulated through GBM. The optimisation solver is based on the KKT formulation of the objective function, performed through an SQP technique. This optimisation is executed once (stochastic programming without recourse): an average path for each one of the uncertainties is introduced to the input set thus forming the scenario to be further optimised.

The optimal load factors and capacity orders resulted from Step II are used as a first guess in the third optimisation. The same (SQP-KKT) solver is used, but now, the SMP is endogenously derived from the power generating mix and the fuel prices. The third optimisation is recursively repeated for multiple input scenarios, each one corresponding to a different uncertainty set. A Monte-Carlo method is therefore performed by implementing a stochastic programming algorithm with recourse for different states of fuel and CO2 allowance prices, interest and inflation rates, which are modelled by appropriate stochastic differential equations (SDE; see Appendix B). The SDEs are solved for random, normally distributed, Brownian differential vectors producing thousands of scenarios, which in turn are optimised one-by-one. Optionally, only two steps might be performed (I and III, omitting Step II), producing less biased, but equivalently robust solution vectors. The flow-chart of the hybrid three-step stochastic programming algorithm, is depicted in Fig. 2
                                  whilst the endogenous, iterative time-sliding procedure used for the simulation of SMP evolution is depicted in Fig. 3
                                 . One may alternatively opt for an algorithm without recourse in the third step: the Monte-Carlo is implemented prior to optimisation, for defining one, single input scenario to be further optimised. By resolving the SDEs of the multivariate uncertainty sets, the average solution is derived, thus constituting a single input state. The user may opt for one of those two strategies in the expense (with recourse) or in favour (without recourse) of the computational work.
                              

The numerical data used for the determination of the optimal power generating mix required: (a) Retrieving technological and economical inputs and (b) retrieving historical time-series of stochastic variables. The techno-economic inputs are shown in Table 2. They can be easily customised and adjusted on a case-by-case basis, according to the generating mix of the power sector examined, but also, according to any future technological progress. The historical data of the stochastically fluctuating variables have been acquired by various sources. The historical demand loads and SMPs, as well as the regulated prices for renewable producers, have been acquired by the national grid operator (HTSO, 2012). The actual demand data for 2012 are depicted in the blue curve of Fig. 1. The historical data of fuel prices have been provided by the Statistical Service and the International Energy Agency. The recent CO2 allowance prices were retrieved from Point-Carbon. For the case of biomass, lacking historical pricing data, their current gate fees were estimated using a holistic Activity Based Costing procedure (Tatsiopoulos & Tolis, 2003). From the above historical time series, the statistical correlations of the relevant data were extracted and further used to the reconstitution of their evolution, by solving their corresponding SDEs.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The results of the endogenous methods are compared in Fig 4
                        , with those of the base-line, exogenous GBM approach. Expansion and electricity prices are mutually interacting. In the former case (endogenous) the interaction is bi-directional. In the latter case (GBM) the electricity price only affects the optimisation of generating mix, but not vice versa: the electricity price evolution is insensitive to the changes of the generating mix. In this research, the differences of the aforementioned approaches are noted, concerning the resulted SMP evolution. Despite the prolonged operational life-time, considered to extend as far as 38 years in the future, only the first 32–33 years of the results may be valid. This can be attributed to the period required for absorbing the lead-time effects (construction and commissioning) of the latest investment entries. Different forms of the model were implemented, corresponding to different input-output states (Table 3
                        ).

The weighted-average of annual SMPs, defined in Eq. (10)
, are depicted with the red curve. They represent the results from the EWRe and EWORe optimisation models, which are almost coinciding. The mean results of EWRi and EWORi models, (black curve) are also coinciding. The implicit and explicit model results are close, since they are linked through inequality (26). Nonetheless, they progressively deviate in the far-distant future. An explanation of this behaviour may be identified in the way they are modelled. The explicit model is more straightforward and the SMP formation depends on analytic relationships with the generating mix structure and with the corresponding merit order of dispatching. On the other hand, the implicit model attempts to learn from the recent actions (capacity orders and load factors) of the agents in order to simulate their functional relationship with the SMPs. The merit orders of dispatching as well as the uniform pricing system are indirectly accounted: these standard practices are only used in the EWRi model for the restriction of the resulted SMP levels, thus preventing them from steep jumps and spikes. The blue curve depicts the stochastically evolved path of electricity price, using GBM. It was exogenously resulted from a GWOR model, by averaging multiple SDE solutions, prior to one single optimisation. Current (nominal) prices are shown in all graphs. The endogenous results fluctuate in lower levels than the GBM ones and they are generally divergent over time. An explanation may be sought in the dependence of the latter (GBM) on exogenous statistical parameters, leading to progressively uncontrolled paths. On the other hand, the formers (endogenous) depend on analytical relationships with the generating mix and the fuel prices, leading to moderately controlled SMP profiles. By accounting constant prices of base-year 2013, the long-run slopes of the SMP profiles, resulted by the endogenous models, become slightly negative. Thus, the endogenously estimated SMPs tend to be more interesting for final users, as realised—to an extent—through their electricity bills.
                        
                     

Interestingly, the improvement of nominal electricity prices is realised while the power sector is getting optimised. The model managed to optimise the characteristics of the power sector over time, both in terms of financial and environmental performance, as shown in Fig. 5.

The financial balancing (= revenues – expenses) is depicted with the red curve and scaled in the left (red) vertical axis. The CO2 emission path is depicted with the blue curve, scaled in the right (blue) vertical axis. Both are energy averaged (per megawatt hour electric annually produced) and therefore they may constitute an indicator of optimisation performance. The objective function is a complicated non-linear one, and therefore optimality might not be global, despite the convexity properties of the SQP solver. Nonetheless, the reduction of emissions over time and the increasing profits, indicate a significant improvement compared to the zeroth year, which basically remain unaffected from the optimisation, since it is based on current state inputs. Hence, the two-fold optimisation signals some prospects for improvement, regarding the management of energy resources. Moreover, the endogenous model derives lower SMPs, compared to GBM, in case the optimal investment entries of Fig. 6 are rendered.
                     

The capacity orders resulted from the stochastic programming are depicted in Fig. 6. The orders resulted from the implicit and explicit endogenous models resemble and therefore, only the explicit model results are shown for better legibility. The timing of the natural gas-fired and the lignite-fired capacity orders implied that such thermal plants should not be installed unless they are planned to exceed a minimum capacity, thus bearing more chances for profit. A lower bound of 350 megawatt electric was imposed for this reason. The post processed results were compliant to that constraint, as shown in the capacity orders scale (vertical axis). The solar park orders should not exceed a very low capacity of 50 megawatt electric annually. The underlying reason may be identified in the high capital costs and the low capacity factors of those plants. The biomass plants are very promising due to an interesting combination of high availability and capacity factors, zero emissions factor and relatively low fuel prices. The hydroelectric plant orders, either of high-medium heads or pumped depots, follow a relatively smooth profile. Finally, significant capacities of wind power should be ordered, contributing to the reduction of the averaged emission factor. From the endogenous results of Fig. 6, it seems that the algorithm attempts to gradually increase RES penetration and their relevant market share, more intensively, compared with the corresponding GBM results.

SMPs are primarily linked to the generating mix, which is derived from the capacity orders, shown in Fig 6. Therefore, more safe conclusions might be drawn by examining their interaction. This mechanism will be analysed in the next paragraph.

The model aims to the maximisation of the aggregate power sector's profit. The different plant types are programmed to learn from their recent actions, thus forming endogenously the electricity prices and the generating mix. This iterative loop of interactions takes place within the optimisation process. The generating mix is comprised of the energy produced annually from each one of the power generating technologies. It is calculated using the—yearly ordered—capacities and the load intensity factors shown in Fig. 6. Despite that the generating mix structure is primarily driven by the aforementioned variables, the effects to (and from) the electricity prices are significant. This interaction is finally reflected to the energies produced, which are different among the stochastic and the endogenous models. These are depicted in Fig. 7 (GWOR with blue lines, EWORe-EWRe with red lines). It is noted that the endogenous models managed to force progressively increasing production from renewable energy sources (solar and wind farms, biomass plants and hydroelectric technologies), thus contributing to the reduction of the average mixed emissions' factor. On the other hand, the GBM results exhibited lower production from renewable sources. This in turn has led to higher aggregate emissions and lower system's NPV, as will be shown later in Fig. 9. Since the corresponding SMP evolution, is based on an exogenous, statistical, and therefore insensitive method (GBM), this approach fails to simulate the Merit Order Effect (MOE), i.e. the shift of SMP reduction due to the engagement of RES. The MOE has been adequately simulated in the endogenous models, as partly justified by the lower levels of anticipated SMPs (Fig. 4).

The mean of multiple GBM fuel price paths and the profits of conventional technologies over time, are depicted in Fig. 8
                        , (up and down respectively, in nominal values of €/megawatt hour electric units).

The resulted structure of the generating mix has shown that profits are prone to rise, as long as the aggregate system NPV is getting optimised. The plants with low fuel prices (i.e. lignite), generally exhibit higher profits, as a result of the uniform pricing system: they are basically remunerated at a rate defined by more expensive plants. For the same reason, the marginal plants only managed to exhibit profits just above the break-even, whilst the profits of NG borderline plants fluctuated between the aforementioned two categories. The constraint (25d) prevents base-load plant's profits from becoming unrealistic, by forcing the operation of marginal plants not to be prolonged, but instead, to follow the historical average duration of peak-load records. Fig. 8 might also be interpreted synergistically with Fig. 7: As long as the NG current prices are low (e.g. years 5–20, 29–31), the chances of lignite plants for profits are diminished, and therefore, the algorithm reduces their production, thus preventing the system from high emission-trading and operating costs (due to the low efficiencies of lignite plants). However, when lignite plants are prone to exhibit higher profits, attributed to increasing prices of natural gas (e.g. 21–27, 32–36), they manage to maintain, or slightly increase their production level. Nonetheless, some intermediate “bridge” points were unavoidable, signalling that the aforementioned strategies were not followed. The main reason was the need for smoothly connecting transitions points, occurring for absorbing the commissioning of more recent investment entries. The oil and the NG profits have low fluctuations: as long as they partly define the SMP levels, their profits are basically influenced by their constant PSPs.

Simplified power sector models do exist (e.g. Sarıca, Kumbaroglu & Or, 2012; Shahidehpour, Yamin & Li, 2002) and they have been optimised in the context of short-medium term, but not—to the author's knowledge—in the context of long-term expansion planning. In this work almost 1300 scenarios were optimised through the stochastic programming algorithm in order to investigate the long-term impact of GEP on the electricity price formation. Each scenario of this Monte-Carlo procedure corresponded to a different input under uncertainty: i.e. time paths of fuel price, CO2 allowance price, inflation and interest rate. The NPV solutions were recorded for the cases of stochastically (GBM) and endogenously evolved SMPs and were fitted to the statistical distributions shown in Fig. 9
                     .

The log-normal distributions with the red-dotted and blue-dashed lines represent the NPVs from the EWRe and GWR models respectively. The latter was not included in the hybrid three-step optimisation but it has been separately performed, in order to compare the robustness of the two methods. At first, it may be observed that the anticipated NPV from the EWR model is higher, compared to the corresponding results from the GWR model. Slightly higher variances as well as lower levels of probability density, observed in the blue curve, indicate significant levels of uncertainty when assuming GBM–SMPs. As stated in the discussion of Fig. 4, this might be attributed to the probabilistic consideration of all input states as well as of the resulting SMPs. This leads to a more intense “low-bound” effect, considering that only positive values may be valid. When the endogenous algorithm is implemented, one level of uncertainty is removed, specifically the one leading to the SMP evolution, thus entailing lower variances. This justifies the lower skewness of the red-dotted log-normal curve. Therefore, the model is more robust in the endogenous case compared to the GBM–SMP.

The SMPs resulted from the Monte-Carlo procedure, were comprised of multi-element solution vectors for each year. These vectors may fit to lognormal distributions (Fig. 10
                     ), thus complying with the inherited property of SDEs to produce log-normally distributed solutions, as long as their Brownian differentials are normally distributed. It is reminded that implicit functional relationships of SMPs with Brownian fuel prices have been used. The latter were modelled by GBM–SDEs using normally distributed Brownian differentials. The solutions of the 2nd, 19th and 38th year of the optimised system were fitted to the lognormal distributions shown with the red-solid curve, blue-dashed and green-solid curves respectively. The kurtosis decreases with time, whilst the skewness seems to be increasing in the positive area. This should normally be expected: there is a definite low bound since only positive electricity price may be anticipated. Hence, the variance is increasing over time, indicating that the model is more robust in the most imminent solutions.

The MOE denotes the shift of residual production and prices due to the increasing penetration of RES in electricity market. It is presented in Fig. 11
                     . The load duration curves of years 1 and 25 are compared, in order to reveal the implication of the rising RES share over time. The base-year 1 represents the current state, which is sub-optimal and obviously cannot be modified from the optimisation, whilst the load-curves of the 25th year replicate the system as it is gradually stabilising at a near-optimal state (see also Fig. 5). The segments of the load duration curves, representing the various technologies, are linear, thus complying with the analysis of Eq. (10)
. The aforementioned curves have been extracted from the multiple scenarios generated by the Monte-Carlo process of the stochastic programming approach. More specifically, each curve has been produced by averaging the magnitudes of the resulting loads of all those scenarios. The discrete SMP results, shown in top-right, have been computed using the approach of Section 3.2.1 (Eqs. (1)–(10)).

As primarily observed, a significantly higher percentage of demand is served by RES in year 25, compared to year 1, depicted as the gap between the RES power-lines (in green). This justifies the environmental optimisation of the system over time, explained in Fig. 5. As a consequence, the residual load required is lower, constituting the benefit induced by the MOE in power generation. It can be differently represented, depending on how the researcher is willing to express it. One option is only described in Fig. 11 for convenience, in which two residual-load duration-curves of year 25 are compared: one for the optimised power-line resulted by the model, and another (blue dot-dashed), as if the residual load of the suboptimal year 1 was superimposed on top of the RES production of year 25. The latter is a virtual, representation of a non-optimised market, used for revealing the anticipated shift to the optimised one: i.e. reduction of residual load required, shown in the light-green shaded area.

                        3
                        Alternatively, the optimal power-line of year 25 (identical with demand) might be compared with the virtual residual load of first year, required though to reach the demand of year 25 (instead of the first year's) and further be superimposed on RES production of year 25. The gap between the two curves would form another representation of induced load reduction, equal to the optimised RES feed-in shift, which would be more notable than the one depicted in Fig. 11. Note: the colour palette used for the linear segments comprising the duration-curves of Fig. 11 is the same with the one, used for the linear segments representing the same technologies in Fig. 1.
                     
                  

Concerning the comparison of system marginal prices, present values are considered, so for the two years to be actually comparable. Despite that the demand of year 25 is assumed to be definitely higher than the 1st year's, subject to the demand's stochastic modelling with GBM, the corresponding average SMP is decreased by almost 4.5 €/megawatt hour electric, in present values. This constitutes the effect (i.e. the MOE) of the increasing RES share on the SMPs resulted by the model. It is noted that the SMPs of the implicit and explicit approaches are almost coinciding, notably in years 1 and 25, and thus, the same conclusions might come out from both models.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Electricity market modelling is usually based on one of the following discrete categories of OR models, namely: (i) the optimisation of an individual plant, (ii) the market equilibrium of the entire power sector on a firm-by-firm basis and (iii) the long-term simulation of grouped agents. The research presented in this article may be classified in the third class: a decision support tool is proposed for the optimised expansion planning of a semi-liberalised power sector, assuming plant types, which are grouped by their power generating technology, whilst a moderate number of investigated technologies are only supported. The effect of expansion to the price of electricity is investigated in the long-run. The contribution of this research focuses on the long-term actions of individual plants and the TSO, in order to optimise the market while keeping social cost to a low level. As shown by the—relatively—low electricity prices anticipated over time, liberalisation may help consumers benefit by competition.

The results from two models, endogenous and exogenous, are compared. The former indicates moderately increasing nominal values of electricity prices (or slightly decreasing present values), in case the optimal loads and capacity orders are rendered. The latter is insensitive to generating mix variations, but it is only sensitive on historical parameters’ data. The long-term actions, suggested for the TSO, are comprised of the permits granted for new facility entries. On the other hand, the behaviour of generators is based on their dispatching schedule and on their load intensity curves, diversified over time. The endogenous models proved that both strategies are linked to the formation of SMPs. The objective of generators is to maximise their profit in two steps. The first step implies rising of bid prices, as much as needed, in order to render profits for individual producers. This process is mainly driven by marginal producers with the highest fuel prices, which have to reach, at least, the break-even point. The second step is to raise the assigned load levels in the profitable producers so that the gap between the revenues (driven by electricity prices) and the production costs is maximised. The actions of the TSO are also affected by the evolution of electricity prices, since more permits are issued for conventional technologies when their profits are prone to rise, whilst more permits are issued for renewable technologies, in the expense of less conventional orders, when the profits of the latter are decreasing. These strategies, undertaken by the agents, essentially reveal the mechanism of market's long-run interactions.

The statistical analysis of the results indicates the robustness behaviour, as the endogenous SMP model proves to be slightly more robust than the exogenous GBM–SMP. Also, the lognormal profiles are characterised by moderately increasing variance (expansion) over time, indicating that the model is more robust in its most imminent solutions.

It might probably be implied that the SMPs resulted by the model, are influenced by the implicit-cap, set through the upper-bound imposed on marginal plants' load factor. In general, any restriction of the time for which some units are operational, might possibly (in the actual operation of the power system) reflect to load curtailment, in which case the SMP would escalate to the Value of Lost Load (VOLL). In this work, an average of the historical operating time of marginal units has been assumed to form its upper bound, whilst, any larger, otherwise acceptable value of operating duration, might be excluded in the results, due to the aforementioned upper bound. If an average duration is applied as upper bound of the optimisation process, then a new average should be expected, less, in theory, than the original one. In this context, the operating time of some units might be restricted that much as potentially causing load curtailment. However, it is noted that the marginal units’ load factors are notably low, whilst the historical range of their operating duration constitutes an even lower fraction of total time. As a result, the deviation of the excluded, higher values of operating duration from their resulting average is relatively minimal and therefore, the effect of this simplifying assumption on the anticipated SMPs is not substantial.

The proposed decision-making tool was proved to be able to optimise the power sector characteristics, both in terms of financial and environmental performance, despite the strict two-fold convergence criterion. The objective functions were strongly non-linear, and therefore optimality might not be global, despite the convexity properties of the SQP solver. The main handicap of the model may be identified in the prolonged CPU-time required for execution, especially in the cases of recourse models, which was though significantly decreased in the no-recourse scenarios. An inherent limitation of the model, originates on the usage of average, annual capacity-availability factors, which inevitably absorb the volatile noise from spot variations (i.e. loads, costs, RES feed-in etc.) over a year. What's more, the matrix-oriented, time-sliding method might be displaced by neural-nets, in order to better simulate the functional relationship of generating mix with electricity prices, without restricting the number of technologies. The anticipated results might then converge at a higher degree, with the ones of the analytic and more straightforward, explicit endogenous approach.
