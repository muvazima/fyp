                  We focus on multicriteria preference elicitation by matching. In this widely employed task, the decision maker (DM) is presented with two multicriteria options, a and b, and must assess the performance value on one criterion for b, left blank, so that she is indifferent between the two options. A reverse matching, which is normatively equivalent, can be created by integrating the answer to the description of b and letting the DM adjust a performance value on the previously totally specified option a. Such a procedure is called a bi-matching. Consistency requires that isopreferences resulting from the forward and backward matchings be identical, but they empirically differ in a systematic direction. In a matching task, multicriteria conflict refers to the magnitude of the advantage or disadvantage to be compensated. We investigate the effect of the multicriteria conflict, or trade-off size, on the difference of judgement between forward and backward matchings. We observed that the difference of judgement is increased both by multicriteria conflict and by asking deteriorating rather than improving judgements at both steps of the bi-matching. We derive some implications for the practice of preference elicitation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Supporting a decision maker (DM) involved in decision processes often requires using preference models, which incorporate the value systems and judgements of the DM. Hence the concept of preference is crucial in decision making, and accounts for the way the DM evaluates and compares alternatives. The field of preference modelling has grown steadily over the past fifty years and numerous models have been proposed, such as utility-based models (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976) or outranking-based models (Roy, 1996). Preference models define rationality from a normative point of view, that is, norms to which the decision maker should conform.

Implementing preference models to support a DM involved in decision processes requires incorporating her judgements in the model. This calls for acquiring preferences through an interaction with the DM, and integrating these preferences in the model: this is called preference elicitation. Numerous preference elicitation methodologies, most of which are interactive methods (Steuer, 1986), have been proposed in the literature (Bana e Costa and Vansnick, 1994; Edwards and Barron, 1994; Jacquet-Lagrèze and Siskos, 1982). They allow the analyst to capture the DM’s point of view and integrate it into a specific preference model. These preference models can be based on utility, but also on outranking relations (Mousseau and Slowinski, 1998) or decision rules (Greco, Matarazzo, and Slowinski, 2001). It is clear that the preference elicitation process is crucial for the preference model to represent faithfully the opinion of the DM, and lead to recommendations that can be viewed as reasonable and helpful by the DM.

However, preference elicitation methodologies implicitly hypothesize rationality principles to which the DM does not always conform. This can lead to elicited preference models that do not faithfully represent the DM’s judgements. It is therefore important to understand decision behaviour fully through empirical studies in order to avoid misinterpretation of the DM preference statements and to avoid decision biases. For instance, preference elicitation methods usually assume “procedure invariance which requires strategically equivalent methods of elicitation to yield the same preference order” (Tversky, Slovic, and Kahneman, 1990).

Violations of this procedure invariance principle have been observed when using matching vs. pairwise comparison tasks (e.g., Fischer, Carmon, Ariely, and Zauberman, 1999; Fischer and Hawkins, 1993; Tversky, Sattath, and Slovic, 1988; Willemsen and Keren, 2002). In pairwise comparisons, the DM compares two alternatives and says whether she prefers one to the other or is indifferent between them. In matching tasks, two alternatives are presented to the DM, one with assigned evaluations on all criteria and the other missing a value for one criterion. She is then asked to provide the missing value that makes the two alternatives indifferent. Experiments have shown that preferences elicited by matching and choice systematically differ since the more prominent dimension “looms larger in choice than in matching” (Tversky et al., 1988).

A positive feature of matching compared to other procedures is that it provides rich information on trade-offs from a limited number of questions (see Carmon and Simonson, 1998, for a discussion on this topic). For compensatory and attribute-based strategies, matching appears to be a natural elicitation procedure (e.g., Payne, Bettman, and Luce, 1998) and is widely used for decision-making under certainty or uncertainty (see for instance, Keeney and Raiffa, 1976 for utility assessment methods under uncertainty and Bana e Costa and Vansnick, 1994; Edwards and Barron, 1994 for utility assessment without uncertainty). Hence, matching is considered a suitable tool for preference elicitation because it offers a good compromise between the effort required from the DM and the obtained preference information.

Nevertheless, it is important to analyse empirically how DMs actually respond to matching questions, and whether their answers conform to rationality principles required by the preference models. For instance, suppose a DM assesses a matching between two alternatives a and b, providing a value on one criterion for alternative b (forward matching); a reverse task (backward matching), which is normatively equivalent, can be created by integrating the answer into the description of b and letting the DM adjust a performance value on the previously totally specified option a. This ordered pair of two matchings is called a bi-matching and the answers to this bi-matching should be consistent, i.e., isopreferences resulting from the forward and backward matching should be identical, or should not vary significantly. Previous experimental studies (Delquié, 1997; Willemsen and Keren, 2002; 2003) showed that DMs significantly deviate from such consistency in a bi-matching. In this paper, we extend these previous results and study the effect of the multicriteria conflict, or trade-off size, on the asymmetry (difference) of judgement between forward and backward matching questions.

In pairwise comparisons, multicriteria conflict arises when each alternative outperforms the other one on some criterion, which imposes a trade-off. Comparing two alternatives can be difficult if their respective advantages are of high magnitude (Deparis, Mousseau, Öztürk, Pallier, and Huron, 2012). In a matching task, the multicriteria conflict is related to how much the performances of the two options differ on the non-adjusted criterion. We propose an experimental setting to investigate the following questions: Is the observed difference in adjustment increased by the multicriteria conflict in a bi-matching task? Do the observed effects depend on the direction of the matching (evaluating an advantage or a disadvantage in the matching). As some elicitation procedures use matching questions with pairs of alternatives involving a strong conflict between criteria (e.g., Bana e Costa and Vansnick, 1994; Edwards and Barron, 1994; Keeney and Raiffa, 1976), we analyse the consequences of using such alternatives in matching questions when eliciting the preferences of a DM.

The paper is organized as follows. The next section is devoted to a description of the matching procedure. In Section 3, we formulate hypotheses about the effect of multicriteria conflict on the DM’s answers. The experimental design is described in Section 4; the results are presented in Section 5 and discussed in Section 6. In the last section, we draw conclusions and propose further research avenues.

Consider two alternatives a and b. We assume the decision problem only involves two criteria, called Criterion 1 and Criterion 2, that take real values (e.g. a salary in Euros). We write ai
                         to refer to the evaluation of alternative a on Criterion i. We indifferently write a or (a
                        1, a
                        2) to refer to alternative a in the following. When an evaluation is unspecified on any criterion, it is noted ?. For instance, (b
                        1, ?) refers to an alternative b, whose evaluation on Criterion 2 is not yet defined. In a bi-criterion setting, a matching between two alternatives a = (a
                        1, a
                        2) and b = (b
                        1, ?), where the DM must specify a performance for b on Criterion 2, can be denoted as: (a
                        1, a
                        2) I (b
                        1, ?), where I stands for “indifferent to”. Matching can also be defined in the general case of n criteria by considering two alternatives differing on two of the criteria and equivalent in all the others, or considering two alternatives differing on more than two criteria. We restrict ourselves to the bicriteria case in this paper, because it allows to focus on the simplest, irreducible form of a trade-off. For the remainder of Section 2, we assume that preference increases with the value on both criteria. All the results hold when preference decreases with marginal value, as is the case in the experiment presented in Section 4.

In the above example, a is called the stimulus alternative, b the adjusted alternative. The criterion for which an evaluation is missing is called the adjusted criterion (Criterion 2 in the above example). Non dominance between the two alternatives implies that some values should not be possible for b
                        2: for instance, if a
                        1 > b
                        1, the DM will choose b
                        2 greater than a
                        2.

Matching questions can be distinguished according to the direction of matching. As an example, let us consider the following elicitation: Consider a decision between jobs that vary according to the annual salary (expressed in Euros) and the number of vacation days per year. Suppose you currently hold a job with 20 days vacation, and a 30,000 Euros salary. In the following question, an unfavourable matching is asked: A new position is available with 25 days vacation, but an inferior salary. What loss in salary would make that new job equally satisfying to your current job? A favourable matching can alternatively be asked: A new position is available with only 15 days vacation, but a better salary. Which salary compensation would make that new job equally satisfying to your current job?
                     

The direction of matching is defined as such (see Fig. 1
                        ):

                           
                              •
                              
                                 Favourable matching: The DM estimates an advantage with respect to the adjusted criterion. When a
                                 1 > b
                                 1 (as in Fig. 1a), adjusting on Criterion 2 comes down to evaluate the proper advantage of b over a on Criterion 2 (b
                                 2 > a
                                 2), in order to compensate for the inferior evaluation on Criterion 1.


                                 Unfavourable matching: The DM estimates a disadvantage with respect to the adjusted criterion. When a
                                 1 < b
                                 1, (as in Fig. 1b) adjusting on Criterion 2 comes down to evaluate the proper disadvantage of b compared to a on Criterion 2 (b
                                 2 < a
                                 2), in order to compensate for the superior evaluation on Criterion 1.

Another important characteristic of a matching question is related to the intensity of the multicriteria conflict involved. We define the conflict of the matching (a
                        1, a
                        2) I (b
                        1, ?) as the difference of evaluation between the two matched alternatives on the non adjusted criterion, i.e. |a
                        1 − b
                        1|. Note that, in order to compare the conflict associated to two matching questions, the adjusted criterion should be the same for the two questions.

As we explained in the Introduction, a bi-matching is composed by a sequence of two consecutive matchings that we call forward matching and backward matching.

In the following paragraph, a performance value on a criterion is underlined when it was elicited from the DM, and an alternative is underlined when any of its performance was elicited from the DM. Table 1
                         presents an example of bi-matching where A = (a
                        1, a
                        2) is the stimulus alternative in the forward matching, 
                           B
                         =(b
                        1, 
                           b
                           2
                         ) is the adjusted alternative in the forward matching but the stimulus alternative in the backward matching, 
                           A
                         =(a
                        1, 
                           a
                           2
                         ) is the adjusted alternative in the backward matching. Notice that a bi-matching can involve any of the four possible combinations of favourable and unfavourable matchings: unfavourable followed by favourable, unfavourable at both steps, etc. In the remainder of the paper, we only consider bi-matchings that are either unfavourable or favourable at both steps. For simplicity, we use “unfavourable bi-matching” to refer to a combination of two unfavourable matchings , and “favourable bi-matching” for a combination of two favourable matchings.

Consider the bi-matching illustrated on Fig. 2
                        a, where the criteria are to be maximized. Procedural invariance (Tversky and Kahneman, 1986) states that normatively equivalent elicitation procedure should reveal the same preference, therefore one should elicit the same trade-off with the two matchings. Hence, the value elicited during the backward matching (
                           
                              a
                              1
                              ′
                           
                        ) should be the same as the stimulus value displayed during the forward matching (a
                        1). It is interesting to analyse, for different combinations of matchings, the value of 
                           
                              
                                 |
                              
                              
                                 a
                                 1
                                 ′

                         which is expected to be null according to the normative theory, or at least close to zero on average if we consider some noise.

Let us consider situations where

                        . In both situations, a′ deviates from a, on the adjusted criterion, toward b. We call this situation an underadjustment. Conversely, on the adjusted criterion, A′ could deviate from a away from b (e.g., in that case, we would have

                         for an unfavourable bi-matching. With this definition, δ > 0 when there is underadjustment and δ < 0 when there is overadjustment. Different types of bi-matching exist according to the direction of each matching (favourable-favourable, favourable-unfavourable, unfavourable-favourable, unfavourable-unfavourable) and according to the adjusted criterion. Fig. 2 depicts favourable and unfavourable bi-matchings when δ is evaluated on Criterion 1. Note that if the direction is kept constant for both matchings of a bi-matching, then the adjusted criterion must necessarily change between the two matchings.

The elicitation of indifference curves has been studied for several decades and there exists a large literature (e.g., Slovic, 1975), but the bi-matching procedure was first introduced by Hershey and Schoemaker (1985) in order to analyse the procedural invariance in the context of decision under risk. They compared two ways of eliciting utility functions: the DM must either specify the certainty equivalent of a lottery or specify the probability of gain for an equivalent lottery. Delquié adapted this notion to the context of certain multicriteria decision making (see Delquié, 1993; 1997).

A number of studies show that the trade-off elicited during a matching procedure with two criteria depends on the adjusted criteria (Fischer and Hawkins, 1993; Slovic, Griffin, and Tversky, 1990). Using experiments on lotteries and also with certain alternatives, Delquié observed underadjustment during the backward matching, as compared to the forward matching. The estimated value is between the benchmark value and the target as in Fig. 2.

It is interesting to note that the effects observed during the bi-matching procedure are more sophisticated than the effects observed when two different elicitation procedures are used. In bi-matching the same procedure is used at both steps, and only the adjusted criterion or the direction is modified.

By rearranging the results obtained by Delquié (1993) depending on the direction of each matching, Willemsen and Keren (2003) showed that a significant asymmetry is more frequently observed during an unfavourable bi-matching than a favourable bi-matching.

As mentioned in Section 2.3, previous experiments on the bi-matching procedure have shown the influence of direction on the answers to bi-matching. Our experiment aims to improve these results by adding the analysis of the impact of multicriteria conflict on preferences elicited using a bi-matching task. We also want to study the interaction of conflict with the direction. Our hypotheses are as follows:

                        Hypothesis 3.1
                        In a bi-matching task, the observed difference in adjustment increases with the multicriteria conflict.

During the forward matching, the DM is asked to match b (adjusted alternative) with a (stimulus) by specifying the evaluation of b on the adjusted criterion. During the backward matching, she is asked to match a′ with b, by specifying the evaluation of a′ on the adjusted criterion. The difference in adjustment refers to the difference in evaluation between a and a′ on the criterion adjusted during the backward matching (i.e., δ on Fig. 2).

Our hypothesis states that increasing the difference in evaluation between a and b (on the specified criterion) during the forward matching increases the difference in adjustment. In other words, a larger conflict in a bi-matching task reduces the consistency between the answers to each matching.

                        Hypothesis 3.2
                        The difference in adjustment observed during an unfavourable bi-matching is higher than during a favourable bi-matching. Moreover, this effect of the direction of matching increases with multicriteria conflict.

A Willemsen and Keren (2003) observed that the difference in adjustment was significantly higher in an unfavourable bi-matching task than during a favourable bi-matching task. We analyse our results in order to see if their observation remains valid in our context. In addition, we refine the hypothesis, stating that the effect of direction increases with conflict.

@&#METHOD@&#

In this section, we describe the behavioural experiment designed to test the hypotheses described in the previous section.

Twenty-nine graduate students (14 males and 15 females) in engineering at Ecole Centrale Paris, France, individually completed this experiment in return for 15 Euros. They were native French speakers. The experimental instructions (available in Appendix) were read to them by the experimenter. The stimuli and additional instructions were delivered through the E-Prime software program, on a computer screen. Subjects had to consider apartments to rent. Students in their final year were chosen because they had to achieve a training course abroad. As a result, judging apartments was a meaningful task for them.

The basic task was a matching between two apartments represented only by the associated rent and the commuting time to city center, and equivalent on any other criteria. Fig. 3
                         represents an example of the stimulus. The evaluations of the two apartments were displayed in gray boxes where the rent was indicated as an amount in Euros and the commuting time was indicated in minutes. The instructions informed the participants that their workplace, as well as three features they had designated as important during a preliminary survey (e.g., theatre, sports center, library) were located in the city center.

Evaluations on both criteria were available for Apartment A and displayed in the left box, whereas one evaluation was missing for Apartment B, represented in the right box. Using the keyboard, the participant had to indicate the missing evaluation for B, such that A and B provided her with the same satisfaction. The participant provided a value for rent during forward matchings, and a value for commuting time during backward matchings. Participants were unaware of the matching being forward or backward, and they always provided an evaluation for the apartment labelled B.

                           A third apartment, serving as a reference point, with fixed evaluations, was also introduced in order to independently study the effect of valence. However, the implementation did not make it salient enough and it was overlooked by subjects. For simplicity, we removed the description of this reference point, but interested readers can find details in a research report available at http://www.lgi.ecp.fr/Biblio/PDF/CR-LGI-2013-02.pdf.
                        
                     

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

At the beginning, participants were informed of the context in which they were to choose their accommodation: their internship was taking part in a big city, remote from their family. The compensation of their training was 1600 Euros per month, and they had to cover all common costs, including rent, using this amount. After receiving instructions, participants were asked to fill in an on-screen survey about their habits and tastes regarding accommodation. The aim of this survey was to acclimate the participants to the context of evaluating an apartment based on its rent and commuting time to the city center. For instance, the participants had to choose their three favourite places to have close to home (like a museum or a sports center). Then we elicited rent levels: we asked them to determine seven monetary amounts typical of their feeling about rent, from very unattractive to very attractive. In the same way, seven commuting time levels were elicited (Table 2
                            represents as an example the commuting time levels of one participant).

Before starting the main task, participants received a detailed explanation about the matching process and had to answer to three test matchings.

The experimental task was a matching. Each participant answered 64 matching questions, corresponding to 32 bi-matchings.

In the problem under study, both criteria (rent and commuting time) are minimized by the subjects.

Our experimental hypotheses involve two notions: direction and conflict involved in a bi-matching. To control the effect of the direction of matching we use bi-matchings with a constant direction (favourable or unfavourable) in order to have similar effects in both matchings. Constant direction imposes that the DM does not adjust the same criterion during the forward matching and the backward matching. We chose rent as the adjusted criterion for all forward matchings and commuting time for all backward matchings.

In what follows, we present the variables of our experiment (the first two are controlled variables and the last one is the observed variable).

                           
                              •
                              
                                 Direction: For each participant, half bi-matchings are favourable and the other half are unfavourable. In other words, the participant either makes improving judgements at both steps or makes deteriorating judgements at both steps, depending on the bi-matching.


                                 Conflict: It is defined by the trade-off size imposed during the forward matching. The level of conflict depends on the difference of evaluation on the non-adjusted criterion (commuting time) between the two alternatives. Using the individual scale obtained at the beginning of the experiment, we defined four levels of conflict corresponding to the number of level difference between the options on the scale. We ignored the two extreme levels of the scale (worst location and ideal location). For instance, considering the individual scale represented in Table 2, there is only one possible matching with conflict level four (very attractive vs. very unattractive, i.e., 15 minutes vs. 90 minutes), two possible matchings with conflict level three (15 minutes vs. 60 minutes and 25 minutes vs. 90 minutes ), etc. For a given level of conflict, the displayed matching was chosen randomly among the different possible matchings.


                                 The asymmetry of adjustment (
                                 δ 
                                 ): It is the dependent variable. It is defined as in Section 2.2, knowing that criteria have to be minimized in this experiment. δ is computed on the criterion commuting time as:

                                 where A is the stimulus alternative used during the forward matching and A′ is the response alternative in the backward matching. δ > 0 means the bi-matching resulted in an underadjustment, and δ < 0 means the bi-matching resulted in an overadjustment.

In order to measure conflict, we decided to build a scale with commuting time values for each subject. While we elicited it by asking for “a typical value representative of an attractive commuting time”, then “neutral commuting time”, etc. (see Table 2), we have no guarantee that this scale is an interval scale. This adjustment was necessary to have an inter-subject measure of conflict. Some experimental subjects consider 120 minutes as the worst possible commuting time, while for others it would be 50 minutes. Furthermore, each subject does not value variations uniformly along the commuting time scale. The preference scale used allowed us to take it into consideration. Finally, using particular values chosen by the subject to create the bi-matchings helped presenting a realistic decision problem to each subject.

In order to account for the difference in scale range between participants, on the criterion commuting time (one participant may consider 60 minutes as the worst value, while another may consider times as high as 120 minutes), the data have to be normalized according to the respective scale range of each participant. We define δ
                        norm = δ/(t
                        max(i) − t
                        min(i)), where t
                        max(i) is the commuting time considered as very unattractive by participant i, and t
                        min(i) is the commuting time she considered as very attractive. During the elicitation of commuting time values to anchor the scale at the beginning of the experiment, participants also assessed a worst commuting time and an ideal commuting time (respectively 1st and 7th echelon on the scale), but these values were not used to create stimuli during the experiment, so they were also ignored for normalization.

For each level of conflict, each participant responded to 8 bi-matchings (4 favourable and 4 unfavourable). Across direction and multicriteria conflict, the order of bi-matchings was random. Each matching was randomly drawn from a list, initially containing 32 forward matchings. After each answer to a forward matching the corresponding backward matching was added to the list.

@&#RESULTS@&#

We analysed the effect of multicriteria conflict and direction on the value of δ
                     norm. For a given combination of direction and multicriteria conflict, each participant answered four bi-matchings. Final data comprised 928 ordered pairs of answers.

Of the 928 pairs of answers to bi-matchings, only 114 were perfectly symmetrical (i.e., such that δ = 0). A vast majority of the remaining pairs displayed underadjustment: 725 underadjustments (356 during favourable bi-matchings, 369 during unfavourable bi-matchings), compared to 89 overadjustments (40 during favourable bi-matchings, 49 during unfavourable bi-matchings). In both favourable bi-matchings and unfavourable bi-matchings, the answer to the backward matching does not generally correspond to the stimulus of the forward matching. Rather, indifferent alternatives are closer on commuting time after the backward matching (a′ and b) than after the forward matching (a and b) as can be seen on Fig. 2, considering commuting time as Criterion 1.


In order to test the effect of the within-subject factors with more precision, we carried out a two-way ANOVA on the data after transformation in order to cancel inter-subject differences (the δ
                     norm were all translated to the mean δ
                     norm across all participants). Fig. 4
                      illustrates the data distributed along the factors. One can observe that direction and multicriteria conflict both influence the values of δ
                     norm:

                        
                           •
                           The analysis of variance shows that direction exerts a significant effect (F(1, 28) = 15.9, p < 0.001). When answering to unfavourable bi-matchings, the corresponding asymmetry between forward and backward matching represents 24 percent of the scale range on average, while it represents 16 percent of the scale range for favourable bi-matchings.

The asymmetry between forward and backward matchings also differed significantly depending on the level of multicriteria conflict (F(3, 84) = 193.5, p < 0.001). In order to know between which levels of multicriteria conflict did the asymmetry differ significantly, we performed Tukey’s HSD test (Honest Significant Differences). It showed that an increase of multicriteria conflict at any level (1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc.) has a significant effect on δ
                              norm. This means that the more dissimilar the alternatives on commuting time during a forward matching, the larger the deviation between the answer to the backward matching and the benchmark stimulus.

Finally, a significant interaction exists between multicriteria conflict and direction (F(3, 84) = 7.4, p < 0.001). For both directions of bi-matching, multicriteria conflict increases the resulting asymmetry, but the effect is stronger during unfavourable bi-matchings. Tukey HSD comparisons indicate that δ
                              norm differed significantly between favourable bi-matchings and unfavourable bi-matchings at multicriteria conflict level 3 (0.21 favourable vs. 0.29 unfavourable, p = 0.002) and level 4 (0.29 favourable vs. 0.44 unfavourable, p = 0.001). By contrast, the difference was not significant at multicriteria conflict level 1 and level 2.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

We introduced a new variable to measure how discrepancies in the evaluations between alternatives affect bi-matching judgements. Averaging across multicriteria conflict levels, our experiment confirms the main result of Delquié (1993) on bi-matchings: an asymmetry of adjustment can be observed between the forward matching and the backward matching. The answers to the backward matching deviate from the values of the forward matching in the direction of the stimulus.

Further on, our experiment allows to assess the effect of multicriteria conflict on the asymmetry of adjustment. This effect is significantly stronger for unfavourable bi-matchings. For bi-matchings with the highest level of conflict, the amplitude of asymmetry (29 minutes on average for unfavourable bi-matchings and 19 minutes for favourable bi-matchings) is considerable. It must be compared to the average difference in commuting time corresponding to conflict level 4, across all subjects, which is about one hour. Hence the asymmetry takes up a large part of the scale. Another way to appreciate the amplitude of the asymmetry is to compare the absolute asymmetry of adjustment (δ in minutes) and the difference in performance on the non-adjusted criterion during the forward matching (also in minutes). This last quantity is the quantity to compensate for at the first step of the bi-matching. Fig. 5
                         shows how the ratio between these two quantities increases with multicriteria conflict, for each direction. The observed ratios are extremely high. For unfavourable bi-matchings with the maximum conflict level, the absolute asymmetry of adjustment, which should be null following normative assumptions, is equal to nearly half the quantity to compensate for during the forward matching. As a comparison, we computed the ratio asymmetry/compensated quantity for Experiment 1 of Willemsen and Keren (2003). It represents respectively 15 percent and 17 percent, for their two types of unfavourable bi-matchings.

In Willemsen and Keren (2003), authors observed a significant deviation only in the case of unfavourable bi-matchings whereas our results also show a deviation for favourable bi-matchings. However, our results should not necessarily be viewed as contradictory to the results from Willemsen and Keren (2003). Our experiment shows a lower deviation for favourable bi-matching than for unfavourable ones; moreover, low conflict induces a lower value for δ. If we consider our results for level 1 conflict only, we also obtain a significantly non-null asymmetry for unfavourable bi-matchings only (unfavourable: t(28) = 4.68,  p < 0.001, favourable: t(28) = 1.87,  p = 0.07). Therefore, it is possible that the conflict levels involved in bi-matchings of Willemsen and Keren (2003) are not large enough to induce significant deviations for favourable bi-matchings (with larger trade-offs, deviations could have become significant).


The results of our experiment can also be interpreted as revealing a type of intransitivity of indifference. During successive forward matchings and backward matchings, we obtained statements of the type: aIb and bIa′. Yet, alternatives a and a′ cannot be indifferent since they share the same evaluation on one criterion and the difference on the other criterion may be very large (as much as half of the scale of the criterion adjusted in the second matching). Intransitivity of indifference has already been reported in the literature, as in the famous coffee example by Luce (1956) used for semiorders. In the coffee example, intransitivity of indifference is related to the cumulation of small indiscernible differences. Here instead, the differences in evaluation may be very large. In our experiment the observed intransitivities of indifference are related to the difference in strategies used during the forward matching and the backward matching.

In this subsection, we investigate if our experimental results can be explained by gain/loss asymmetry, assuming that participants considered the stimulus alternative as a reference point. The implicit use of the stimulus alternative as a reference point is plausible for several reasons: first, during a matching task, the stimulus alternative, against which the participant is matching, is entirely specified and easy to visualize. Second, it is the stimulus alternative that sets the overall value characterizing the matching task. The indifference curve corresponding to the matching task is identified by the stimulus alternative. Hence, it is natural for the DM to ask herself: “Relative to this apartment, how much am I ready to lose on commuting time, in order to gain this given amount on rent?”, framing the matching as a gain/loss relative to the stimulus alternative.

If the DM does consider the stimulus alternative as a reference point, gain/loss asymmetry in the encoding of marginal values intervenes in the adjustment made by the DM in order to answer the matching task. On a given criterion, the loss of a certain quantity on evaluation has a stronger effect on marginal value variation than the gain of the same quantity (see Highhouse and Johnson, 1996; Korhonen, Moskowitz, and Wallenius, 1990; Tversky and Kahneman, 1991), which can be summed up as: “Losses loom larger than corresponding gains”. Graphically, gain/loss asymmetry can be represented by a marginal value curve that is steeper for losses than for gains. If we decompose a bi-matching, we can identify how gain/loss asymmetry should affect the judgements occurring at various steps of the bi-matching. In the following, we assume a bicriteria decision, where criteria are both to be maximized. We consider traded quantities of evaluation, i.e., quantities subtracted or added on an evaluation when moving from one alternative to the other. ▵
                           j
                         refers to a traded quantity of evaluation on Criterion j.


Let us consider an unfavourable bi-matching. During the forward matching, (A(a
                        1, a
                        2) I B(b
                        1, ?), see Fig. 6
                        ), the DM observes that B outperforms A by + ▵1. This translates in a marginal value gain v( + ▵1). To keep the overall value constant when moving from A to B, the DM must compensate for that gain by a loss of same marginal value, on Criterion 2. Hence, she must assess a disadvantage − ▵2 on Criterion 2 such that:

This inequality follows from gain/loss asymmetry, applied to each criterion, and assuming that the DM trades equal amounts of marginal value when matching two alternatives. Our demonstration assumes that the DM uses the stimulus alternative as a reference point and predicts an underadjustment: the difference on Criterion 1 between the matched alternatives is smaller after the backward matching than the stimulus difference existing during the forward matching.

In our experiment, we have observed some inconsistencies in the preferences expressed by DMs. However, it should be emphasized that the role of elicitation is to help the DM step back and construct values, and in this context inconsistencies resulting from preference statements involving difficult trade-offs provide an opportunity for the analyst to further investigate and question the DM’s preferences. Nevertheless, the regularities observed in expressed inconsistencies induce guidelines for the practice of preference elicitation.

A Morton and Fasolo (2009) provide a rich literature review on the impact of behavioural studies of the practice of MCDA preference modelling. As with many experimental studies dealing with preferences (e.g., see Delquié, 2003; Korhonen, Silvennoinen, Wallenius, and Öörni, 2012), our results can be used to formulate some recommendations regarding the conduct of an elicitation process. We observe a significant variation in the elicited trade-off depending on the choice of the adjusted criterion. This asymmetry increases drastically with multicriteria conflict. This observation should lead any analyst to favour matching tasks imposing a low level of multicriteria conflict.

Yet many elicitation methods proposed for utility functions make use of examples with extreme levels of conflict. For example, the swing weights procedure, used in the SMARTS and SMARTER methods presented in Edwards and Barron (1994), involves comparisons of fictitious alternatives with the best evaluation on some attributes and the worst on all other attributes. In the first step, which is aimed at ranking attributes, the DM has to express her preferences about the set of extremely specialized alternatives. In the second step, she has to match a specialized alternative with another alternative having the worst evaluation on all attributes except one. By design, such tasks involve high, and possibly the highest, bicriteria conflict. Such a difficulty also arises in the method proposed by Keeney and Raiffa (1976) to elicit weights. Even if we consider a decision problem where the fictitious specialized alternatives are realistic, such a degree of conflict should make the analyst careful about how to interpret the preferential information that he/she obtains.

For these types of approach, it can be more careful to propose a bi-matching, preferably hidden, and to use the average trade-off if an analysis of sensitivity is impossible. Other methods avoid a large conflict, by involving carefully selected fictitious alternatives, such as MACBETH (Bana e Costa and Vansnick, 1994). While this method involves comparisons between fictitious alternatives differing on at most two criteria, the alternatives do not have the maximum or minimum evaluation on each attribute. Instead, the performance on each attribute is kept at a reference level chosen by the analyst (often a neutral and attractive level) assigning comparisons with a controlled level of conflict. Another way to avoid high multicriteria conflict is to consider real alternatives that the DM can easily compare (e.g., Greco, Mousseau, and Slowinski, 2008; Jacquet-Lagrèze and Siskos, 1982).

Beyond the above recommendations concerning the elicitation procedure to be used, stemming from the experimental data observed, it should be emphasised that the inconsistencies observed in actual elicitation processes with real DMs can also be viewed as a positive feature; these inconsistencies should lead the DM to think harder about the relevant preferences for the decision and to help her understand and construct the values appropriately.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we examined the effect of multicriteria conflict on the expression of preferences through the matching procedure. Multicriteria conflict refers to the differences of evaluation, along criteria, between two non mutually-dominating alternatives. In the context of matching in a bicriteria decision, it is defined as the difference in evaluation between the matched alternatives on the non-adjusted criterion. Using bi-matchings, where the answer to a first matching is used as a stimulus in a second reverse matching, we observed that expressed preferences become inconsistent when multicriteria conflict is increased. An asymmetry arises in a systematic direction between answers to the forward and backward matching: the compensation rate is more favourable to the adjusted criterion. Direction of the matching also affects the asymmetry of answers: deteriorating bi-matchings lead to a higher difference between compensation rates than improving bi-matchings. The effect of direction is increased by multicriteria conflict, resulting in differences of evaluation that can reach half of the scale between the benchmark (stimulus of the first matching) and the answer to the reverse matching.

One of the implicit assumptions behind elicitation through matching is that isopreference curves faithfully describe the multicriteria preferences of the DM. Yet our experimental results show that what DMs express through matching judgements is not as clearly defined as isopreference curves. We observed systematic underadjustments when matching apartments on commuting time compared to matching on rent. The size of the underadjustment was increased both by multicriteria conflict and by asking degrading rather than improving judgements. The asymmetry of the object we observed through matching contradicts one of the basic features of isopreferences. Our results question the interpretation of the preferences elicited through matching questions in terms of isopreference curves, as previously shown in Deparis et al. (2012) in the case of pairwise-comparison elicited preferences. Further research is needed to better understand the nature of preferences obtained through matching.
