                  Current complex engineering software systems are often composed of many components and can be built based on a multiagent approach, resulting in what are called complex multiagent software systems. In a complex multiagent software system, various software agents may cite the operation results of others, and the citation relationships among agents form a citation network; therefore, the importance of a software agent in a system can be described by the citations from other software agents. Moreover, the software agents in a system are often divided into various groups, and each group contains the agents undergoing similar tasks or having related functions; thus, it is necessary to find the influential agent group (not only the influential individual agent) that can influence the system outcome utilities more than the others. To solve such a problem, this paper presents a new model for finding influential agent groups based on group centrality analyses in citation networks. In the presented model, a concept of extended group centrality is presented to evaluate the impact of an agent group, which is collectively determined by both direct and indirect citations from other agents outside the group. Moreover, the presented model addresses two typical types of agent groups: one is the adjacent group where agents of a group are adjacent in the citation network, and the other is the scattering group where agents of a group are distributed separately in the citation network. Finally, we present case studies and simulation experiments to prove the effectiveness of the presented model.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Currently, there are many complex engineering software systems, such as networked control systems, emergency management systems, and air traffic control systems. A complex engineering software system has a large number of software components that can operate autonomously but coordinate with each other [1–3]. Due to the large number of software components, as well as their dynamic and heterogeneous nature, it is difficult to design and develop a perfect complex engineering software system to satisfy the requirements of users. To build high quality and industrial-strength software, a multiagent-based approach is proposed [4]; with the multiagent-based approach, the software components can be modeled by software agents, and the complex software systems can be implemented as a collection of interacting autonomous software agents.

In multiagent software systems, the software agents often interact and coordinate with each other; the operation of some software agents may be implemented by citing the operation results of other agents [5], which can be denoted as citation networks where the link between two nodes denotes that the software agent associated with the first node directly cites the operation result of the one associated with the second node [6]. In the citation network, each agent occupies a social position, which can only be shaped and described by the agent’s citation relations with other agents [6,7]; therefore, the impact of an agent on the entire software system is mainly characterized not by that agent’s inherent properties, but instead by its citation relations with other agents [8–11]. Obviously, if an agent is cited by more agents, then such agent is more influential in the multiagent software system; therefore, the citation frequency of an agent determines that individual agent’s impact within the entire software system. Finding influential agents is important to improve the performance of the entire system; for example, in some mission critical applications, such as financial systems and traffic control systems, it is crucial to find the influential software agents and ensure higher reliability onto them. To measure the impacts of software agents, the social ranking of agents can be used; this can be achieved by analyzing the citation relations among agents.

Moreover, a large-scale engineering software system is composed of several subsystems, and each subsystem contains a group of software agents undergoing similar tasks or having similar goals [12–14]; therefore, the software agents in a large-scale system are often organized into various groups [15–19]. Generally, an agent group can undergo certain tasks and build some impact within the entire multiagent software system; the impact of a group is determined by its members’ experiences in the systems [20]. In large-scale multiagent software systems, if the impact of an agent group is high, the group may have high dominance and influence the performance of the entire system. Therefore, while we want to improve the utility of the entire system, the groups with higher impacts should be considered more; if the utilities of the groups with higher impacts are improved, the outcome utility of the entire system can be easily improved accordingly. The following example in real world can express our motivation.

In a multiagent system for network intrusion detection [32], there are four groups of agents: intrusion sensor agents, intrusion detection agents, tracing agents, and recovery agents. In the system, tracing agents and recovery agents should decide their behavior strategies based on the operation results of intrusion detection agents; the intrusion sensor agents should also receive the instructions from the intrusion detection agents. Therefore, now the group of intrusion detection agents has higher impacts in the system. If we can improve the function of group of intrusion detection agents, the performance of the entire system will be improved accordingly.

Then, how can we evaluate the impact of an agent group (i.e., the social ranking of an agent group) formed by more than one agent? Obviously, we can also seek influential agent groups based on analyses of the citation topology among them. However, previous related approaches do not match the particularities of the social ranking of agent groups in complex multiagent software systems, as described in the following points: (1) previous approaches are often developed for the social ranking of individual agents but not agent groups; (2) because previous approaches only concern the social ranking of individual agents, they do not explore the effects of the citation topology within a group on such group’s ranking; and (3) previous approaches are often developed based only on the direct (immediate) citation relations between agents and ignore the indirect citation relations.

To address the above problems, in this paper, we extend the concept of group centrality and use it to evaluate the impact of agent groups in complex multiagent software systems through the analyses in their citation networks. Centrality is one of the most important and widely used conceptual tools for analyzing network structures [7]: if the centrality of an agent in the network is higher, its social ranking will also be higher. By the same rule, if the centrality of an individual software agent in a citation network is higher, that agent’s impact is higher in the multiagent software system. Traditionally, centrality measures have been applied to individual agents. However, an agent group usually includes more than one individual agent. Therefore, in this paper we introduce the concept of group centrality. The group centrality analysis method can find the group that has the maximal centrality, but the traditional group centrality is always determined only by the direct interaction from other agents outside the group [7]. In this paper, we extend the traditional concept of group centrality so that it is determined not only by the direct citations but also by the indirect citations from other agents outside the agent group.

In comparison with related work, our study makes the following contributions.
                        
                           •
                           We focus on the social ranking of agent groups but not individual agents, which can solve the social ranking problem in grouped multiagent software systems.

On the topology analyses of citation networks, we consider not only the direct citation relations of agents but also the indirect citation relations of agents. In other words, a group’s impact is determined not only by the direct citations from the group’s adjacent agents but also by the indirect citations from other agents that are not adjacent to the group.

We extend the traditional concept of group centrality and include the factor of topology within the group itself (such as the geographical center of the group), which can make the group centrality more effective at measuring the impact of the agent group in the entire software system.

In summary, in this paper, we present a novel model for seeking influential agent groups using group centrality analyses in citation networks. If a group has higher group centrality in the citation network, then such a group has a higher impact in the entire system, and the outcome utility of the system can be improved significantly by the influential groups.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we compare our contribution with previous work; in Section 3, we model the citation networks and groups in multiagent software systems; in Section 4, we present the model of group centrality analyses in citation networks; in Section 5, we make case studies and simulation experiments to prove the presented model; and finally, we conclude our paper and discuss our future work in Section 6.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

Our research is related to multiagent-based software systems, multiagent group collaboration, and ranking through citation. Generally, related work can be categorized as follows.

Currently, many complex and large-scale engineering software systems are emerging, and we are witnessing an enormous expansion of complex software in business, industry, and administration [2]. To address the large scale and complexity, component-based software systems are presented, where the software systems are composed of various components and the components can be reusable [1]. To exert the autonomy and dynamics of software components and build complex and dynamic software systems, the multiagent-based approach is presented, which is beneficial to design and develop high-quality industrial-strength software systems [4]. With the multiagent-based approach, the software system can be analyzed and implemented as a collection of interacting and autonomous software agents [28]. In multiagent software systems, each software agent can run autonomously for implementation of various tasks; software agents can also interact and coordinate with each other for implementation of various composite tasks. In reality, software agents can cite the operation results of others; for example, in a software system, the computing agent may cite the results of the resource allocating agent [18].

Complex multiagent software systems frequently take the form of a hierarchy; thus, a software system is composed of interrelated subsystems [4]. A subsystem contains many software agents that undergo the same task or some related topics, and those software agents within a subsystem form a group; the interactions within groups are both more frequent and more predictable than the interactions between groups [12]. In reality, subsystems (i.e., the agent groups) may work together to achieve various functionalities and to implement various tasks; therefore, subsystems (i.e., the agent groups) may also cite operational results from each other. In a complex multiagent system, some agent groups may be crucial to the overall performance of the entire system; therefore, many researchers mainly focus on the designing and developing of such crucial agent groups.

In multiagent software systems, agents always collaborate with each other for large tasks that cannot be performed by a single agent [15–17]. The cooperation of multiagents has achieved much attention in many related areas, and the cooperative control of multiagent software systems poses significant theoretical and practical challenges [21]. As said above, agents can be divided into various groups; and an agent group is considered to be a subsystem [13,14]. In related work on multiagent group collaboration, the focus is mainly on the collaboration mechanism between groups or the collaboration algorithm for groups to achieve consensus [21]. Generally, the aim of group collaboration is to achieve a higher utility outcome of the entire system. We now introduce some typical related works on multiagent group collaboration as follows.

Bornstein et al. [22] used an experimental study to investigate the effect of intergroup competition on group coordination and found that intergroup competition improved collective efficiency compared to single-group control treatments where each group played an independent coordination game. In [20], a spatial model for the collective diffusion of grouped agents is proposed. Jadbabaie et al. [23] studied the coordination of groups of mobile autonomous agents using nearest neighbor rules and provided a theoretical explanation for group behaviors of the mobile agents that are often observed in simulation studies of herds.

In summary, the abovementioned studies mainly focus on how to implement effective collaboration among agent groups and explore the related collaboration mechanism, algorithms and models. They seldom consider the social ranking of agent groups in the system. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to solve this problem and present a method for finding influential agent groups in systems through group centrality in citation networks. We find that the influential agent groups found by our model can achieve higher utility of the outcome of the entire system when compared to other groups.

In reality, graph theory tools are always used to analyze the topological characteristics of network structures [24]. Citation relations are initially seen in published papers, which denote that some papers cite the results of other papers; therefore, citation ranking is always used to determine the importance of a journal or a scientist [25]. Moreover, Page et al. [26] used citations to determine the ranking of webpages and described PageRank, a method for rating webpages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. Dang [10] described the construction of citation network systems and some subsystems (time sequence network, cocitation network, couple network) and established the structural modeling of these systems by means of system engineering.

Currently, citation relations are also used to determine the role of agents in multiagent systems. For example, in [6], a model for decision making that can satisfy the social role of each agent is proposed, and such a method only considers an individual agent’s role in the structure of the citation network. Pujol et al. [27] considered the degree calculation of reputation for agents in an electronic community and presented a method for extracting reputation in multiagent systems by means of social network topology. Marshakova [11] presented co-citation analysis to build citation networks in information science and revealed the topical structure of information science, the communities of authors and the names of single leading scientists.

To improve the outcome utility of a system, it is necessary to discover the influential agents; for example, Jiang [25] researched how to locate the active actors in a system based on interaction topology analyses and found that the operations of active actors can effectively improve the outcomes of the entire system.

In summary, the abovementioned studies mainly focus on the ranking of individual agents through citation relations but seldom consider the social ranking of agent groups through citation relations. Moreover, their models are mainly implemented based on the immediate citation relations (direct citation relations) between agents but ignore the influence of non-immediate citation relations (indirect citation relations).

A traditional citation network is formed by various nodes, and a link between two nodes denotes that the first node cites the second node. Therefore, if the nodes represent the agents, then the link between two agents denotes that the first agent cites the operation result of the second agent [6]. For example, let there be two software agents in the system, a
                        1 and a
                        2. Now, if the operation of a
                        2 is implemented based on the operation result of a
                        1, we can set a citation link from a
                        2 to a
                        1.

In reality, for one agent in a real system, there may be more than one citation for another agent’s operation results. For example, let there be two software agents, a
                        1 and a
                        2, where a
                        1 denotes the computation agent and a
                        2 denotes the data collection agent; in the operation of a
                        1, a
                        1 needs to call for a
                        2 to collect data in three separate instances. Thus, we can now say that a
                        1 cites the operation results of a
                        2 three times.

Therefore, we can expand the definition of traditional citation networks as follows.

                                       R, which is the weight associated with each edge. If the weight associated with ei
                                       
                                       =〈au

                                       〉 is x, it denotes that agent au
                                        cites the operation results of agent av
                                       , and does so x times.

Obviously, an expanding citation network is also a directed acyclic graph, the same as a traditional citation network.

We can use the agent citation matrix to represent the citation relations among agents.

In citation networks, if there is an edge (citation link) between two agents, we can say that they have a direct citation relation. However, if there is a path between two agents, even though there are no direct citation relations between them, we can instead say that there is an indirect citation relation between them. Such indirect citation relations are useful in reality. For example, let there be three agents, a
                        1, a
                        2 and a
                        3. If a
                        1’s operation result is cited by a
                        2, and a
                        2’s operation result is cited by a
                        3, we can now say that a
                        3 has an indirect citation relation with a
                        1. Therefore, now the social rank of a
                        1 is determined not only by a
                        2’s direct citation but also by a
                        3’s indirect citation.

To measure the indirect citation relations among agents, we now have the definition of citation distance, shown as follows.
                           Definition 3
                           Citation distance


                           Let there be three software agents, ai
                              , aj
                               and ak
                              . If agent ai
                               cites the operation result of agent aj
                              , and agent aj
                               cites the operation result of agent ak
                              , we can say that agent ai indirectly cites the operation result of agent ak
                               and the citation distance is 2. Generally, we can define the citation distance between two agents in a citation network, ai
                               and aj
                              , as the length of the shortest path between ai
                               and aj
                               in the citation network, which is denoted as dij
                              .

We can use a matrix, D, to denote the citation distances among different agents, D
                              =[dij
                              ], where:

                              (i) is an example of an expanding citation network of multiagents, (ii) is the agent citation matrix for the expanding citation network, and (iii) is the matrix of citation distances. From Fig. 1(i), a
                              1 cites the operation result of a
                              2 one time, and a
                              2 cites the operation result of a
                              3 three times; thus, a
                              1 contributes to the social rank of a
                              3 indirectly. a
                              1 cites the operation result of a
                              2 and a
                              5 one and two times respectively, and a
                              2 cites the operation result of a
                              3 and a
                              4 three and one time respectively, and a
                              4 cites the operation result of a
                              3 two times; thus, a
                              1 contributes to the social ranks of a
                              2, a
                              3, a
                              4, and a
                              5. Obviously, the amount of contribution of a
                              1 to other agents is determined by the citation distances between those agents and a
                              1 and the citation times associated with the shortest paths. Because the citation network and all citation relations can be described by the matrixes in Fig. 1(ii) and (iii), we can use the matrixes to compute the social ranks of agents.

Generally, an agent group is a set of agents that undergo a common task or explore related topics. The agents among different groups may cite the operation results of each other, so their citation relations form a citation network. An agent group can be explained as a sub-expanding citation network, which involves some agents and weighted citation relations in a citation network.

Generally, there are two types of groups, the adjacent group and the scattering group. In the adjacent group, agents are linked adjacently with each other, i.e., each agent in the group has at least one immediate citation link with other agents in the group. In the scattering group, agents may be distributed in various non-local places in the citation network, and the agents may have no direct citation links with each other. In reality, these two group classifications are very general; groups of the former type are always organized by local citations, and groups of the latter type are always organized by non-local citations. Now we have a definition of an adjacent group, shown as follows.

                        9. Obviously, Group 1 is very influential because it has many members as well as many citation relations from other agents. Group 2 (a
                        1, a
                        6, a
                        10) has more members than Group 3 (a
                        8, a
                        11), but Group 2 is less influential than Group 3 because there are no outside agents that cite the operation results of agents in Group 2. By the same rule, Group 4 is also more influential than Group 2, although it only has one member, because there is one outside agent that cites the operation result of Group 4 but none for Group 2.


                        Fig. 3
                         is an example of an expanding citation network in which there are three scattering agent groups. Group 1 includes agents a
                        2, a
                        6, a
                        7, a
                        8, a
                        9, a
                        11, a
                        13; Group 2 includes agents a
                        1, a
                        3, a
                        10, a
                        12; Group 3 includes agents a
                        4, a
                        5. From the citation relations among the agents of different groups, it appears that Group 1 may have the highest impact because it has the most number of agents, and the operation results of its members are frequently cited by other agents. Group 2 has four members (a
                        1, a
                        3, a
                        10, a
                        12), and Group 3 has two members (a
                        4, a
                        5); thus, the member size of Group 2 is higher than Group 3. However, from the citation network, we can see that none of the agents of Group 2 are cited by the agents of other groups, but the operation result of a
                        5 in Group 3 is cited by agent a
                        3 and a
                        7. Therefore, we can say that Group 3 may have higher impact than Group 2 although the member size of Group 3 is less than that of Group 2.
                           Theorem 1
                           
                              If two groups are merged to a new group, then the new group is either an adjacent group or a scattering group.

Here we enumerate all three cases on the situations of the two groups to prove the theorem. (1) Case 1: Groups a and b are adjacent groups, and group c is merged by a and b. If there is at least a direct citation link between agents in a and b, according to Definition 5, c is an adjacent group, or else c is a scattering group. (2) Case 2: Groups a and b are adjacent group and scattering group respectively, and group c is merged by a and b. If there are direct citation links connecting all separate agent sets of group b, and also at least one link connects agents in a and b, according to Definition 5, c is an adjacent group; or else, c is a scattering group. (3) Case 3: Groups a and b are scattering groups, and group c is merged by a and b. If there are direct citation links that can connect all separate agent sets of group b and c, and also at least one link connects agents in a and b, according to Definition 5, c is an adjacent group; or else, c is a scattering group. Therefore, we can conclude that a new group merged by any of the two types of groups is either an adjacent group or scattering group.□

Generally, it is difficult to intuitively determine the impact of a group when the citation network is complex and the member size of the group is large. Therefore, we devise a method to evaluate the impact of groups and find the influential group by topology analyses in citation networks, presented in Section 4.

As stated above, the impact of an agent group is collectively determined by its member agents’ citations from other agents, and such impact is determined by not only the direct citations but also the indirect citations of the group’s agents from outside agents. Moreover, the evolution of a citation network can change the impacts of agents. For example, Fig. 4
                        (i) is an initial citation network for agent a
                        4 and a
                        5. Obviously, agent a
                        4 has a higher impact than a
                        5 because a
                        1 and a
                        3 cite the operation result of a
                        4, but only a
                        6 cites the operation result of a
                        5. However, after some time has passed, more agents cite the operation result of a
                        6, shown in (ii)–(iv). Obviously, a
                        6 has become very influential in the system. Now, we can develop a new idea: because a
                        6 cites a
                        5, we can say that a
                        5 also becomes influential. Therefore, if more agents cite the operation result of a
                        6, they also contribute to the impact of a
                        5 indirectly. Finally, in Fig. 4(iv), there are four agents that cite the operation result of a
                        6, and a
                        6 cites the operation result of a
                        5, thus now we may say that a
                        5 is more influential than a
                        4. Therefore, from Fig. 4, we can see that the citations of a
                        7, a
                        8, a
                        9 and a
                        10 to a
                        6 also indirectly contribute to the impact of a
                        5.

Therefore, when we compute the impact of a group, we should consider both the direct and indirect citations from outside agents to that group.

Centrality is one of the most important and widely used conceptual tools for analyzing social networks [9]. Traditionally, centrality measures have been applied to individual agents. However, a group usually includes more than one individual agent. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the concept of group centrality. Group centrality can find the group that has the maximal centrality, and the traditional group centrality is always determined by the direct interaction relations from other agents outside the group [9]. In this paper, we extend the traditional concept of group centrality and present a paradigm in which the group centrality is determined not only by the direct citations but also by the indirect citations from other agents outside the group.

Therefore, in this paper, we define the group centrality as the citation frequency of outside agents that directly or indirectly cite the operation results of the group member. Now, we will present the methods for seeking influential agent groups in citation networks based on group centrality analyses, which are designed for two types of groups, namely adjacent groups and scattering groups.

For an adjacent group, we should first find the geographical center of the group in the citation network. Based on the traditional algorithm for computing the center of a graph [29], we present an algorithm that computes the geographical center of an adjacent group in a citation network, shown as Algorithm 1.

                              In the above equations, hxy
                               denotes the hops between ax
                               and ay
                              . The concept of hops between two agents is different from the one of distance between two agents. For example, now let there be a direct citation link from ai
                               to aj
                              ; the distance from ai
                               to aj
                               is 1 and the distance from aj
                               to ai
                               is ∞, but the hops between ai
                               and aj
                               is 1. Therefore, the hops between two agents do not concern the citation direction between them.

Now, we provide an example to demonstrate the citation distance from individual agents to an adjacent group, shown in Fig. 5
                        . From Fig. 5, we can see that the geographical center of group G is agent a
                        5, and the radius of G is 1. Now, we can calculate the citation distances from other agents to group G, shown via the table in Fig. 5. For example, for agent a
                        2, the agent in G that has the shortest citation distance from a
                        2 is a
                        7, and the citation distance from a
                        2 to a
                        7 is 1; thus, d
                        2
                        
                           G
                         is 1 by use of Eq. (4).

After the citation distances from individual outside agents to adjacent groups are obtained by Definition 6, we will next measure the contributions of those outside agents to the group, shown as follows.
                           Definition 7
                           Contribution of an individual agent to an adjacent group


                           Let there be an adjacent group, G, and an agent ai
                               that is outside G, and let the shortest citation path from ai
                               to G be PiG
                              . Now, if agent ak
                               is immediately cited by ai
                              , and ak
                               is in PiG
                              , we can compute the contribution of agent ai
                               to the impact of G as follows.

For a scattering group, the agents may be scattered in various non-local places in the citation network, which is different than for adjacent groups, where agents are linked immediately with each other. Therefore, we now present a new group centrality analysis model for scattering groups, which is somewhat different from the model for adjacent groups.

In a scattering group, agents are distributed separately in the citation network; thus, it is not meaningful to find a geographical center of the group. Therefore, we first present a new concept for the citation distance from an individual agent to a scattering group, shown as follows.
                           Definition 9

                           Let G be a scattering group, N(G) be the set of all agents that are not in group G, and dij
                               be the citation distance from agent ai
                               to aj
                              . The citation distance from agent ai

                               to group G, which is denoted as:

                                             d

Now, we give an example to demonstrate the citation distances from individual agents to the scattering group, shown as Fig. 6
                        . From the example, we can say that the citation distances from individual agents to a scattering group are only related with the localities of individual agents and the agents in the group that are nearest to the individual agents, which are not related to the geographical center of the group. Such an assumption is feasible in reality because real scattering groups may have very different distribution topologies. From the example, it is difficult to compute the geographical center of group G in the citation network, and thus, it is obvious that the citation distances of other outside agents to a
                        6 are related to the locality of a
                        6 but are not related to the localities of a
                        5 and a
                        7.

To consider the indirect contributions of any agents to the impact of a scattering group, we can utilize the following definition:
                           Definition 10
                           Contribution of an individual agent to a scattering group


                           Let there be an agent, ai
                              , and a scattering group, G, and let the shortest citation path from ai
                               to G be PiG
                              . Now, if there is an agent, ak
                              , which is cited by ai
                               and is in PiG
                              , we can compute the contribution of agent ai
                               to the impact of G as follows.

                              , which is described in Definition 2.

For example, in Fig. 7
                        , let agent a
                        1 and a
                        2 form a group, G1; the shortest citation path from a
                        5 to G1 is 〈a
                        5

                        a
                        1〉. Now, a
                        5 cites a
                        3 two times, and the citation distance from a
                        5 to the group is 2, so the contribution of a
                        5 to the impact of group G1 is: 2/2=1.

                           Centrality of a scattering group


                           Similarly to the definition of group centrality for an adjacent group (Definition 8), we define the group centrality of a scattering group G as the sum of the contribution of all outside agents to G, shown as follows.

Therefore, to find the most influential group, we should find the group with the maximum group centrality. We can devise the algorithm for finding the most influential scattering group, shown as Algorithm 3.

We now present a case study for adjacent groups and demonstrate how our model can work in such a case. We use the case in Fig. 8
                            to demonstrate our algorithm’s ability to locate the most influential adjacent group. In Fig. 8, there are three groups, namely Group 1(a
                           2, a
                           3, a
                           5, a
                           4, a
                           8, a
                           11, a
                           13), Group 2 (a
                           1, a
                           10, a
                           6), and Group 3 (a
                           7, a
                           9, a
                           12). We first compute the geographical centers of those three groups according to Algorithm 1; the results are the geographical center of Group 1 is a
                           5, the geographical center of Group 2 is a
                           10, and the geographical center of Group 3 is a
                           12. Let the set of all agents in the citation network be A. For each group Gi
                           , we calculate the citation distance from aj
                            (∀aj
                           
                           ∈(A
                           −
                           Gi
                           )) to Gi
                            according to Definition 6; then, we calculate the contribution of aj
                            to group Gi
                            according to Definition 7 after the citation distance is obtained. The citation distances and contributions of individual agents to the groups are shown via the tables in Fig. 8.

We next use Algorithm 2 to compute the group centrality of each group. From the computing results, Group 3 has the maximum group centrality; thus, we believe that Group 3 is the most influential group in the whole system; Group 3 has a higher group centrality than Group 1, although Group 3 has fewer agents than Group 1.

Here we use this case to illustrate an example of the application in real world. Let Fig. 8 denote an agent-oriented software, agents denote subprograms in the software, and the link denotes that a subprogram calls the result of another subprogram. Subprograms are divided into three groups according to the executing task types, shown as the three groups in Fig. 8. Because the computing resources are limited sometimes, we need to find the executing priority for groups. From the above results, we will let Group 1 be with the highest priority, Group 2 be with the middle priority, and Group 3 be with the lowest priority in the software. Therefore, in this application our model can help make a reasonable distribution of critical resources among groups.

We now present a case study for scattering groups and demonstrate how our model can work in such a case. We use the case in Fig. 9
                            to demonstrate our algorithm’s ability to locate the most influential scattering group. In Fig. 9, there are three scattering groups, namely Group 1(a
                           2, a
                           6, a
                           7, a
                           8, a
                           9, a
                           11, a
                           13), Group 2 (a
                           1, a
                           3, a
                           10, a
                           12), and Group 3 (a
                           4, a
                           5). Let the set of all agents in the citation network be A. For each group, Gi
                           , we can calculate the citation distance from aj
                            (∀aj
                           
                           ∈(A
                           −
                           Gi
                           )) to Gi
                            according to Definition 9; then, we calculate the contribution of aj
                            to group Gi
                            according to Definition 10 after the citation distance is obtained. The citation distances and contributions of individual agents to the groups are shown via the tables in Fig. 9.

Finally, we use Algorithm 3 to compute the group centrality of each group. From the computing results, Group 1 has the maximum group centrality; thus, we believe that Group 1 is the most influential group in the entire system; Group 3 has higher group centrality than Group 2, although Group 3 has fewer agents than Group 2. From the results, we can see that the group centrality of a group is not only related to the size of its member agents but is mainly related to the citation relations from outside agents.

To save paper space, here, we only present the case study on the change in topology of citation networks for scattering groups. We can make the citation network evolve over time, as shown in Fig. 10
                           . Fig. 10(i) is the citation network; by adding some citation relations within the three groups, we can see that the group centralities of Group 1 and 2 are changed because some outside agents cite their operation results. In Fig. 10(ii) and (iii), some new agents join the community, and they cite some operation results of the existing three groups. Finally, the group centrality of Group 2 exceeds that of Group 3 in Fig. 10(iii). Therefore, our model for seeking the influential group can dynamically update itself in accordance with the current topology of a citation network.

Now, we make a series of simulation experiments to test the effectiveness of our model. In the simulation experiments, we randomly set various citation networks and groups. The setup in the simulations is shown as the followings.

To ignore the effects of group size, we can set all groups to have the same size. Initially, each agent has an original utility. Let there be an agent, ai
                        , the utility of ai
                         can be denoted as ζi
                         which is set to a natural number. We describe the citation relation between two agents ai
                         and aj
                         as the following:

Let there be a citation relation from ai
                         to aj
                        , i.e., ai
                         cites aj
                        , in the citation network; let the original utilities of ai
                         and aj
                         be ζi
                         and ζj
                         respectively. Now, in the operation of the system, with the citation relation, the outcome utility of ai
                         will be: ζi
                        
                        =
                        ζi
                        
                        +
                        ζj
                        . Then, if the utility of aj
                         is changed to ζj
                        
                        +
                        λj
                        , then the outcome utility of ai
                         will also change to: ζi
                        
                        =
                        ζi
                        
                        +
                        ζj
                        
                        +
                        λj
                        . (Citation-Related Adjustment of Utility).

To measure the impact comparison of all groups in the system, we can present the following performance metrics:

Let the set of agent groups in the system be G
                        ={gx
                        }. ∀gx
                        
                        ∈
                        G, in the simulations we can make a trial by changing the utilities of all agents in gx
                        ; then, all agents in the entire system will adjust their utilities according to the above criterion of citation-related adjustment of utility. Let the change of the whole utilities of all agents in the entire system when the utilities of agents in gx
                         are changed be Δ(gx
                        ); then the maximum change of system utility when we change the utilities of any group is:

                        From the above performance metric, we can see that 0⩽

                        ⩽1. The higher τx
                         is, the more influential that gx
                         is for the whole utilities of the entire system.


                        Simulation processes: we increase the utilities of agents in the most influential group, and other agents outside the most influential group will then adjust their utilities according to their citation relations to the most influential group; then, we compute the outcome utilities of all agents in the network. We also test the outcome utilities of all agents in the network by increasing the values of agents in other groups. Now, we test whether the most influential group can better influence the outcome utility of the entire system more than the other groups.

In the simulation experiments, we test three situations: all groups are adjacent ones, all groups are scattering ones, and hybrid groups. In the experiments, we can increase the network scale step-by-step. Figs. 11–13
                        
                        
                         are the simulation experiment results, where the x-axis denotes different network scales (the network scales are denoted by the number of agents and are set as: 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90) and the y-axis denotes the comparison among different outcome utilities of the entire system by changing different groups (which is calculated according to Eq. (12)). For example, if the performance value of a group is 1 in an experiment, it denotes that the group can influence the utilities of the entire system most significantly. Now, we explain the experimental results as follows.
                           
                              (1)
                              In Figs. 11–13, when we change the values of the most influential group found by our model, the system can always achieve higher outcome utilities than those achieved by changing the values of other groups. This denotes that our model can find the influential agent groups effectively for both adjacent groups and scattering groups. Thus, the effectiveness of our model can be proven by the simulation experiments.

In Figs. 11–13, the most influential group sought by our model can achieve more obvious dominance than other groups with the increasing of network scale. This denotes that our model has more obvious effects when the citation network scales are large.

Our model has more obvious effects for scattering groups than for adjacent groups. A potential reason is that the citation directions within the group are neglected when we compute the geographical center of an adjacent group, which may influence the effectiveness of the model.

In summary, from the simulation experiments, we see that our model can find the influential agent groups that can significantly influence the total outcome utility of the entire system.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In current large-scale multiagent software systems, the agents are always divided into various groups for certain tasks. To improve the total outcome utilities of systems, it is crucial to find the influential agent groups within systems. This paper presented a new method to find the influential agent group by using group centrality analyses in citation networks. Our model can make the evaluation of group influence quantitative and measurable, in comparison with other related studies where the evaluation of group influence is sometimes qualitative. Moreover, we address two types of agent groups, adjacent groups, where the agents in a group are adjacent in the citation network, and scattering groups, where the agents in a group are distributed separately in the citation network. Finally, we present case studies and simulation experiments to prove the effectiveness of the presented model. From the simulation experiments, we see that our model can find the agent groups that can significantly influence the total outcome utility of the entire system.

Regarding the generality and future work of our model, the following are several aspects for discussion.
                        
                           (1)
                           In this paper, we only make the group centrality analyses in the citation networks. In fact, the relations among agents are very rich, even excluding the citation relations. Moreover, a group may sometimes be influential for other factors, even if its operation results are seldom cited by others. Therefore, in the future, we should implement group centrality analyses in other interaction topologies of agents and make our model more feasible for real complex software systems by including more real factors.

In the paper, we have the prior knowledge of group structures. In the future work we will investigate discovering group structures, which can be based on the graph clustering methods [30,31]. Moreover, although our model can be used in dynamic multiagent software systems on the basis of recalculating when the network topology is changed as described in Section 5.1.3, this recalculating method may be not efficient. Therefore, we will investigate models that can better be used in dynamic multiagent software systems.
