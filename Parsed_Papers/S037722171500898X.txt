                  There are usually multiple paths that can be followed in a decision analysis process. It is possible that these different paths lead to different outcomes, i.e. there can exist path dependence. To demonstrate the phenomenon we show how path dependence emerges in the Even Swaps method. We also discuss the phenomenon in decision analysis in general. The Even Swaps process helps the decision maker to find the most preferred alternative out of a set of multi-attribute alternatives. In our experiment different paths are found to systematically lead to different choices in the Even Swaps process. This is explained by the accumulated effect of successive biased even swap tasks. The biases in these tasks are shown to be due to scale compatibility and loss aversion phenomena. Estimates of the magnitudes of these biases in the even swap tasks are provided. We suggest procedures to cancel out the effects of biases.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This paper studies and discusses the phenomenon of path dependence in decision analysis (DA). By path we mean the sequence of steps taken in the decision analysis process. Path dependence refers to the phenomenon that the outcome of the analysis process depends on the path followed. We find this an important theme to be considered in the field of decision analysis in general. Decision analysis works directly with subjective data elicited from people and therefore biases are likely to be an important driver of path dependence in DA. Biases can be related to e.g. problem framing, preference assessment tasks and to how information is presented. The effects of biases can accumulate in sequential preference assessment processes and also in the whole decision analysis process. In each step biases can work in favor of some alternative. In the end, the effects of biases can have accumulated so much that one alternative becomes favored. It can also happen that the effects of biases cancel out. Path dependence is directly related to the emerging area of Behavioral Operational Research (Hämäläinen, Luoma, & Saarinen, 2013) because biases as well as other behavioral and social phenomena are likely to be major drivers of path dependence (Hämäläinen & Lahtinen, 2015).

The term path dependence has not been earlier used in OR but we see it as a useful integrative term that refers to different effects arising during problem solving processes (Hämäläinen & Lahtinen, 2015). The possibility that two valid but different modeling paths can lead to different outcomes has been noted already early in the Operational Research (OR) literature (Landry, Malouin, & Oral, 1983). Also the literature on best practices in OR (see, e.g. Morris, 1967; Walker, 2009) does implicitly acknowledge the possibility of path dependence since alternative practices are seen to be possible. Moreover, the concept of constructed preferences discussed in psychological literature (Lichtenstein and Slovic 2006; Slovic, 1995) relates closely to path dependence in decision making as noted by Payne, Bettman, and Schkade (1999). According to the concept, people do not have stable underlying preferences but construct them during the decision making process. Thus the path of the process can have an impact on the preferences that are formed. The effects of paths have been studied earlier also in the context of multi-criteria optimization (MCO). French (1984) notes that the decision maker (DM) can be anchored to the initial point in interactive MCO. This is later confirmed experimentally by Buchanan and Corner (1997). The experiment of Korhonen, Moskowitz, and Wallenius (1990) suggests that path dependence in MCO can be caused by prospect theory related effects. Still, the literature on path dependence remains very limited.

In many contexts we would naturally want to minimize the possibility and effects of path dependence. This is the case in particular in prescriptive decision support. One problem area where decision analysis is widely used and where the risk of path dependence is likely to be high is environmental management (see, e.g. Gregory et al., 2012; Huang, Keisler, & Linkov, 2011). In important policy decision problems, such as climate policies, one should at least be aware of the possibility of path dependence and its origins and of the possible range of its consequences. Yet, there are situations where the main benefits expected from the decision analysis project are related to learning and to the creation of a shared understanding of the problem as a whole. Then path dependence might not be a serious concern. In fact, reaching different conclusions along different paths could improve learning.

The Even Swaps method (Hammond, Keeney, & Raiffa, 1998, 1999) is simple and uses clearly defined paths: A path consists of the sequence of even swap tasks that the decision maker carries out to eliminate alternatives and attributes one by one until the ‘best’ alternative is found. Multiple strategies exist for carrying out the Even Swaps process, each leading the decision maker to a different path. This paper demonstrates how path dependence can emerge in the Even Swaps method. We show the existence of path dependence by experiments where the Even Swaps method is used with the Smart-Swaps software (Hämäläinen et al., 2004; Mustajoki & Hämäläinen, 2005, 2007). Different paths are shown to lead to different choices. This is explained by the accumulation of the effects of biases in successive even swap tasks. The biases in the even swap tasks are shown to be due to scale compatibility and loss aversion phenomena. Estimates of the magnitudes of these biases in the even swap tasks are also provided. We suggest ways to reduce the risk of path dependence in the Even Swaps method.

The Even Swaps method (Hammond et al., 1998, 1999) helps to identify the ‘best’ alternative out of a set of multiattribute alternatives. The DM carries out a sequence of even swaps in which she changes an alternative in two attributes such that the modified alternative is preferentially equivalent to the original one. The goal is to make swaps so that alternatives become dominated and can be eliminated or so that attributes become irrelevant. The process continues until only one alternative remains. The conducted sequence of even swaps forms the path of the process. The method allows to choose the path freely. Ideally, one would end up with the same alternative on each path.

The DM carries out the even swap in two steps. First she selects a change in one attribute of the alternative. This we call a reference change. Then she gives a compensating response change in another attribute which we call the measuring stick attribute.

A straightforward strategy for carrying out the Even Swaps process, suggested by Hammond et al. (1998), is to use even swaps to repeatedly make attributes irrelevant until only one remains. At this point the most preferred alternative can be readily identified. We call this the attribute elimination strategy. The pricing out method by Keeney and Raiffa (1976) is an attribute elimination strategy in which all attributes but the monetary one are made irrelevant and money is used as the measuring stick in every swap.

The Even Swaps method is less complicated than many other multi-criteria decision analysis methods that are based on the use of value models. For example, Even Swaps does not require the user to understand the idea of value functions or weights. It is simply, a “clear framework for making trade-offs” (Hammond et al., 1998).

It is known that people tend to give extra weight to the response attribute, i.e. the measuring stick, in two-attribute matching tasks (Anderson & Hobbs, 2002; Bleichrodt and Pinto 2002; Delquié, 1993, 1997; Tversky, Sattath, & Slovic, 1988). This is referred to as the scale compatibility bias. The task of determining the response change of an even swap is equivalent to giving a response in a two-attribute matching task. Therefore one can expect that the scale compatibility bias is found in a similar manner in even swaps as in matching tasks. The bias would cause the measuring stick attribute to get extra weight in the even swap. This would cause the result of an Even Swaps process to depend on the measuring stick attributes used.

When a single measuring stick attribute is used throughout the Even Swaps process, the DM repeatedly carries out even swaps in which this same attribute receives extra weight. This way the effects of the scale compatibility bias can accumulate. This leads us to the following hypothesis:


                        
                           Hypothesis 1
                           An Even Swaps process where only one measuring stick is used favors the alternatives that are good in this measuring stick attribute.

Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to give extra weight to losses compared to corresponding gains (Tversky & Kahneman, 1991). Bleichrodt and Pinto (2002) show that people are loss averse in two-attribute matching tasks. Asking for the response change in an even swap task is equivalent to a two-attribute matching task. Therefore one can expect that the loss aversion bias also exists in the even swap tasks.

In the even swap task an alternative is changed in two attributes. One of these changes made in the alternative is always a gain and the other one is a loss. A loss averse DM will give extra weight to the loss. This results in the situation where this alternative becomes more attractive in each swap. If the reference change of the even swap is a loss then the compensatory response change is a gain. In this case, the DM overstates the response change because she gives extra weight to the reference change. If the reference change of the even swap is a gain then the compensatory response change is a loss. In this case, the DM understates the response change because she gives extra weight to it. In either case the even swap increases the attractiveness of this alternative.

When the same alternative is repeatedly swapped, then loss aversion can make this alternative better and better. This way the effects of the loss aversion bias can accumulate in favor of this alternative. This leads us to the following hypothesis:


                        
                           Hypothesis 2
                           The Even Swaps process favors the alternative in which the most swaps are conducted.

We present a simple approach to model the effects of scale compatibility and loss aversion biases in even swaps. This approach is based on the Anderson and Hobbs (2002) model to estimate the magnitude of scale compatibility. We include a new loss aversion parameter in the model and assume that the value function for each attribute is linear. We use this model to provide a theoretical illustration of how path dependence can occur in the Even Swaps method in Section 2.5. The model is also used to estimate magnitudes of biases in even swap tasks performed during our experiments in Section 4.2.

To help the reader understand how the loss aversion and scale compatibility biases can lead to path dependence we provide the following simple illustrative example. The initial consequences table is given in Table 1 on the left. In this illustration we assume the DM's preferences to follow a linear additive value function with equal attribute weights. For illustrative purposes, overall values of the alternatives are shown below each consequences table. These overall values would not be available in a real case because we would not know the DM's preferences.

When the DM conducts even swaps she exhibits scale compatibility and loss aversion such that her swaps follow Eqs. (2) and (3) with bias coefficients

                        . These magnitudes for bias coefficients are selected because they are close to the average magnitudes observed in our experiments. Theoretically, when S or L differs from 1 we can always construct a similar illustrative example where the outcome depends on the path followed.

When there
                         are no biases, alternative B gives the highest value for the DM. Alternative A would contribute 75 percent of the value of B. However, when biases are assumed the DM can end up with either alternative. That is, there exists path dependence. We show this by considering the following two paths:

                           
                              
                                 Path 1: Attribute X is used as the measuring stick and all swaps are carried out in A.
                              


                                 Path 2: Attribute X is used as the measuring stick and all swaps are carried out in B.
                              

On both paths the DM has to conduct two swaps in order to find a non-dominated alternative. The scale compatibility bias works in favor of A on both paths because A is better than B in attribute X which is used as the measuring stick on both paths. On each path, the loss aversion bias works in favor of the alternative in which all swaps carried out. When the DM goes along path 1 she ends up with alternative A (Table 1). When the DM goes along path 2 she ends up with alternative B (Table 2).

Swap 1. Reference change: Alternative A improved in the attribute Z from 0 to 4.

Response change: Alternative A worsened in the measuring stick attribute X from 2 to α.

The subjects were Finnish speaking, mostly second year engineering students (N = 148) from Aalto University. The subjects used the Even Swaps method with the Smart-Swaps software (Hämäläinen et al., 2004; Mustajoki & Hämäläinen, 2005, 2007) in decision tasks related to selecting a rental apartment or a summer job.

Each session consisted of two steps. First the subjects were given a 15 minute tutorial on the method and they practiced using it for 10 minutes. Then the subjects were given a sheet that contained the instructions for carrying out the experiment. The subjects proceeded at their own pace. Completing the tasks took from half an hour to one and a half hours. Incomplete responses and those which do not follow the instructions are excluded from analysis.

Four different decision tasks are used in the experiment. The consequences tables for each of them are given in Tables 3–6. The subjects were told to think that the alternatives are equally good with respect to any other attribute that is not shown in the table. The 1–3 scales used for the attributes condition, atmosphere and flexibility are from the worst to the best. These scales were described to the subjects in more detail on the instruction sheets of the experiment.

Each subject carried out one apartment related task and one job related task. Both tasks were carried out two or three times. Each time the subject followed a different path, i.e., conducted a different sequence of swaps. The different paths resulted from different instructions given (Table 7).

The Pricing (PRI) and Hours (HRS) paths are based on the use of the attribute elimination strategy.

The dominance (DOM) and irrelevance (IRR) paths are used as references for these paths. The DOM and IRR paths are based on the use of the Even Swap proposal features of the Smart-Swaps software. The software allows the user to ask for proposals which help her to complete the Even Swaps process with as few swaps as possible (Mustajoki & Hämäläinen, 2005).

                           
                              •
                              The proposals for dominance aims at domination of alternatives with as few swaps as possible.

The proposals for irrelevance aims at making attributes irrelevant with as few swaps as possible.

Each proposal specifies the alternative that would be modified, the reference change and the measuring stick attribute. The user gives the response change based on her preferences. Fig. 1 illustrates a proposal for dominance.

The subjects were divided into two groups with different tasks and instructions (Table 8). Tasks 1 and 2 were used with the first group, Tasks 3 and 4 were used with the second group. The subjects repeatedly carried out a job related task followed by an apartment related task. The order in which the subjects followed the paths was altered across subjects.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Path dependence is studied by comparing the subjects’ choices across the paths. Path dependence exists if different paths lead to different final alternatives. We can only compare the results between paths but cannot determine which the ‘true’ most desirable alternative is for each subject.

For the analysis the alternatives in each task are grouped into two sets (Table 9). In Task 1 and Task 2 the alternatives are grouped based on their performance in the money attribute which is used as the measuring stick on the PRI path. In Task 3 the alternatives are grouped based on their performance in daily working hours which is used as the measuring stick on the HRS path.

Hypothesis 1 predicts that the percentage of subjects ending up with any of the alternatives in Set 1 is higher on the PRI path than on the IRR and DOM paths. Hypothesis 1 also predicts that the percentage of subjects ending up with any of the alternatives in Set 1 is higher on the HRS path than on DOM path. The reason is that only one measuring stick attribute is used on PRI and HRS paths and the alternatives in Set 1 are better in this attribute.

Hypothesis 2 predicts that the percentage of subjects ending up with alternative B is higher on the Swaps in B path than on the Swaps in D path. The reason is that on the Swaps in B path all swaps are conducted in alternative B.


                        Table 10 (column 5) gives the percentage of subjects ending up with an alternative in Set 1 on each path. This illustrates the effect sizes and shows that the results of the experiment align with the predictions by hypotheses 1 and 2. Additionally, we checked whether the results for either Task 1 or Task 2 change if only those subjects which have completed the task on all paths are included in the analysis. We found the same pattern of results. None of our conclusions would change if that data was used.

The statistical test results are presented in Table 11. McNemar's test (1947) is used because we have binomial paired data. The test is based on comparing the results of the same subjects between a pair of paths. Therefore, only subjects with data from both paths are included in each comparison. The null distribution of the test statistic k is binomial (K, 0.5) where K is the number of subjects who end up with alternatives in different sets on each of the two paths. The statistic k is the number of subjects who end up with any of the alternatives in the Set 1 on the PRI, HRS or Swaps in B path and end up with any of the alternatives in the Set 2 in the other path.

The difference between two paths is statistically significant with p < 0.001 in two cases, p < 0.01 in one case and p < 0.05 in one case (Table 11). In the remaining two cases the difference between the paths is small and statistically insignificant but in the direction predicted by the hypothesis.


                        Table 10 shows that the subjects used money as the measuring stick more frequently on the IRR than on the DOM path. This possibly explains why the IRR path has been more favorable than the DOM path for the alternatives that are good in the monetary attribute.

We also compare the choices by subjects who conducted Task 1 (job) on the PRI path and the choices by subjects who conducted Task 3 (job) on the HRS path. Two statistically significant differences are found. Job C is chosen more often on the PRI path (40 percent) than on the HRS path (11 percent) (Z-statistic: 3.35, p-value: 0.0004). Job D is chosen more often on the HRS path (53 percent) than on the PRI path (36 percent) (Z-statistic: −1.84, p-value: 0.03). These results are in line with hypothesis 1 because Job C has better salary and Job D has lower working hours.

We conclude that these results show the existence of path dependence. Hypothesis 1 is clearly supported when a monetary attribute is used as the measuring stick. Hypothesis 2 is supported.

Altogether the subjects carried out several thousand even swap tasks during the experiment. We form eight data sets out of this data and estimate the model (4) separately for each of them. The data set Apartment task – All attributes includes all swaps conducted in a task related to choice of an apartment. The data set Job task – All attributes includes all swaps conducted in a task related to choice of a job. The rest of the data sets are formed such that each contains all swaps where the same pair of attributes was traded-off against each other. Only those pairs of attributes are studied in which the measurement scale for both attributes is continuous. Table 12 shows the estimates of the bias coefficients.

We make the following three observations.


                        Observation 1. The scale compatibility and loss aversion biases are found in even swaps similarly as in matching tasks. The bias coefficients S and L are greater than one in all data sets. This confirms our initial assumption that these biases exist in Even Swaps.


                        Observation 2. The estimates of magnitude of scale compatibility obtained for data sets “Apartment task – All attributes” and “Job task – All attributes” are 1.21 and 1.34 respectively. These are close to the average of the subject specific scale compatibility estimates by Anderson and Hobbs (2002) which is 1.32 when their subject 4 is excluded as an outlier. This suggests the interesting conclusion that the average magnitude of scale compatibility can be a general bias effect which is of the same magnitude in different contexts. The experiment by Anderson and Hobbs (2002) was in the context of fisheries management and the subjects were managers instead of students. They report Bayesian posterior probability distributions of bias for each subject. The means of these distributions are (1.5, 2.07, 1.01, 10.9, 1.25, 1.45, 0.65) (R. Anderson, personal communication, September 10, 2013).


                        Observation 3. The estimates obtained for S range from 1.12 to 1.43 and the estimates obtained for L range from 1.05 to 1.16. A possible explanation is that the magnitude of the bias depends on which attributes are traded-off against each other. This would be contrary to the assumption by Anderson and Hobbs (2002) that the bias coefficient do not depend on which attributes are traded-off against each other. This matter could be investigated in a further study.
                     

We conducted residual analysis that suggests the assumption of homogeneity of variance and the assumption of normality to be reasonable. Multicollinearity is not found in the data sets.

When the subjects go through the Even Swaps process and use money as the measuring stick in the even swap tasks, i.e. they give responses in money, they end up favoring those alternatives which are good in the monetary attribute. When two alternatives are compared such that the same alternative is modified in every swap, the subjects favor the modified alternative. These results can be explained with the accumulated effect of successive statements biased by scale compatibility and loss aversion. These biases are found in the trade-off data provided by the experiments.
                        
                     

The general question of reducing the possibility of biases, or debiasing, in decision analysis has not been studied very much. There has been a number of suggestions including: Use consistency checks and give feedback (Keeney & Raiffa, 1976), average the responses given (Kleinmuntz, 1990), give better training (Anderson & Clemen, 2013; Carlson & Bond, 2006; Hämäläinen & Alaja, 2008) and calibrate the responses given (Anderson & Hobbs, 2002; Bleichrodt, Pinto, & Wakker, 2001; or Jacobi & Hobbs, 2007). However, there remains a limited number of studies on how successful these advice are. Currently, the general observation is that some biases, such as the splitting bias (Pöyhönen, Vrolijk, & Hämäläinen, 2001; Weber, Eisenführ, & von Winterfeldt, 1988), are very persistent and difficult to eliminate whereas some are easier to be reduced (Montibeller & von Winterfeldt, 2015). For example, in the study by Hämäläinen and Alaja (2008) they found that training did not help stakeholders to avoid the splitting bias. Yet, the studies by Carlson and Bond (2006) and Anderson and Clemen (2013) suggest that training can help to reduce biases related to priming, framing, asymmetric dominance and the prominence effect.
                     
                     
                  

Here we suggest a strategy for carrying out the Even Swaps process so that the accumulation of the effects of biases is reduced. Our idea does not rely on reducing biases in single even swap tasks. Instead, we suggest a way to design the path of the process so that the effects of biases do not accumulate in favor of any single alternative.

To reduce the accumulation of the effects of the loss aversion bias, one can carry out even swaps evenly in all of the alternatives. This way the effects of the bias do not accumulate in favor of a single alternative but are distributed evenly across the alternatives. To reduce the accumulated effect of the scale compatibility bias one can use a measuring stick in which the consequences of the alternatives differ the least. Scale compatibility gives extra weight to the measuring stick attribute. This extra weight does not matter if the alternatives differ only a little in this attribute.

These ideas can be illustrated with the example of Section 2.5. The DM should choose the attribute Y as the measuring stick because the alternatives’ consequences differ the least in this attribute. One swap should be conducted in each of the alternatives to distribute the effect of loss aversion evenly. Following these suggestions would lead to a path shown in Table 13. Along this path the DM would end up with the alternative B which theoretically gives her the highest value.

Another idea to reduce the accumulated effect of biases is to restart the Even Swaps process with the original consequences of the remaining alternatives at certain points during the process. This would remove any error or bias that has accumulated in the remaining alternatives. One possibility would be to restart the process with the remaining alternatives every time when an alternative is eliminated. The following example illustrates this idea: The decision task includes three alternatives A, B and C. The DM conducts four swaps in B which result in the elimination of C. Here loss aversion has accumulated and made the modified B more attractive than the original B because all swaps were conducted in B. Thus the DM is biased towards B if she continues the Even Swaps process with A and modified B. The accumulated bias could be removed by restarting the Even Swaps process with alternative A and the original, unmodified, alternative B. This idea can be applied in the Smart-Swaps software by using the backtracking feature which allows the DM to cancel previously made swaps. Every time an alternative is dominated the DM can backtrack to the start of the process and then eliminate the dominated alternative and continue with the remaining ones.

One can utilize all of the above mentioned ideas together with the following step-by-step procedure for carrying out the Even Swaps process:

Continue steps 1 to 3 until only one alternative remains.

                        
                           1.
                           Identify a pair of alternatives which are close to each other in some attribute that can be used as the measuring stick attribute.

Carry out swaps to make the consequences of these two alternatives equal in all other attributes. Alternate between conducting swaps in the two alternatives.

Eliminate the dominated alternative and restart the Even Swaps process with the original consequences of the reduced set of alternatives.

Using the step-by-step procedure described above will take at most (N−1)(K−1) swaps where N is the number of alternatives and K is the number of attributes. One needs N − 1 pairwise comparisons to eliminate all but one alternative. In each pairwise comparison at most K−1 swaps must be conducted to make all but one attribute irrelevant. In the attribute elimination strategies, e.g. the pricing out method, the upper limit for the number of swaps is the same.

It should be noted that using the procedure described above or other methods that use averaging or calibration of responses do not always lead to the most accurate judgments. For example, some decision makers might give the most thoughtful responses when using money as the measuring stick if they are used to evaluating benefits in terms of money. In such a case simply using money as the measuring stick can be the best option. Therefore, the procedure proposed here or other methods based on averaging or calibrating responses should be employed with consideration.

One could also think that sensitivity analysis can help to identify and avoid path dependence in Even Swaps. However, performing sensitivity analysis in a ‘traditional way’ is difficult in the Even Swaps method. This is because of the sequential nature of the swapping process. For example, changing the response change in the first swap by 10 percent might cause the subsequent swaps to be unfeasible. Thus the DM might have to revise all swaps accordingly. Instead, as a form of sensitivity analysis, one could carry out the whole Even Swaps process along multiple paths and compare the results.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

All decision analysis processes consist of a sequence of steps and typically different paths can be followed. The sequential character of the analysis process can give rise to path dependencies due to the accumulation of biases and possibly also due to other behavioral phenomena. We chose to study path dependence in the Even Swaps method because it is simple and consists of a clear sequential preference elicitation process. This hopefully makes our argumentation easier to follow and the experiments easier to replicate. In general, the drivers of path dependence are likely to depend on the method used as well as the problem context. In the following discussion we provide examples of how path dependence might occur in some well-known decision analysis methods.

The starting point effect is one path related phenomenon that can exist in decision analysis methods. Different starting points can set the decision analysis process on different paths. This can happen, for example, in structuring the value tree. A decision maker could give most attention to the one higher level objective she considers first and generate the richest set of lower level objectives under this objective. This would lead to the situation where extra weight is given to the objective considered first due to the splitting bias (Hämäläinen & Alaja, 2008; Pöyhönen et al., 2001; Weber et al., 1988).

Path dependence can exist when a sequence of trade-off tasks is performed to determine the weights for an additive value model. The choice of measuring stick attributes can matter because of the scale compatibility effect. Whether changes in the consequences are framed as gains or losses can have an impact due to the loss aversion effect. Laskey and Fischer (1987) suggest that in sequential preference elicitation the response given in one task could become an anchor for the next one. It is also possible that the problem context could evoke use of heuristics that can cause path dependence in the weight elicitation process.

We have shown that the scale compatibility bias can create path dependence in the Even Swaps method. In trade-off and even swap tasks the bias gives extra weight to the measuring stick attribute. The scale compatibility bias could possibly also play a role in the SWING and SMART weighting (von Winterfeldt & Edwards, 1986). In the SWING procedure one gives 100 points to the most important attribute and then proceeds by giving points to the other attributes. In the SMART procedure one gives 10 points to the least important attribute and then proceeds by giving points to the other attributes. One might possibly perceive the attribute with fixed points as the measuring stick and overvalue it. As a result the SWING procedure would create a greater spread of weights than the SMART procedure. Spread of weights is the ratio of the weights of the most important and least important attribute. Overvaluing the most important attribute would increase this ratio and overvaluing the least important attribute would decrease this ratio. In the experiments by Bottomley & Doyle (2001) and Pöyhönen and Hämäläinen (2001) the SWING procedure has, indeed, created a greater spread of weights than the SMART procedure. Other explanations are naturally possible as well, and there is clearly a need for further studies.

The existence and possible causes of path dependence in the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) by Saaty (1990) is also an interesting research topic which has not been addressed before. In AHP the decision maker performs a sequence of pairwise comparison tasks. It is possible that the order of these tasks has an impact on the result. If path dependence is found to exist in AHP, one can ask whether there is a sequence of pairwise comparison tasks which would minimize the effects of biases in AHP.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In decision analysis path dependence is likely to emerge from behavioral origins because the decision analysis processes directly involve people and work with subjective data elicited from them. This paper demonstrates how path dependence can emerge in the Even Swaps method. We also discuss possible ways in which path dependence could exist in other decision analysis methods.

Our experiment shows that when the subjects go through the Even Swaps process and use money as the measuring stick in the even swap tasks, i.e. they give responses in money, they end up favoring those alternatives which are good in the monetary attribute. When two alternatives are compared such that the same alternative is modified in every swap, the subjects favor the modified alternative. These results can be explained with the accumulated effect of successive even swap tasks biased by scale compatibility and loss aversion. We provide estimates of the magnitudes of these biases in the even swap tasks.

Finding ways to avoid problems related to path dependence is important in normative decision support where the aim is to give one correct outcome to be implemented. One option is to analyze the same problem following different paths. This can increase confidence in the solutions obtained. Debiasing methods can also be considered. In this paper we suggest a strategy for reducing the effect of biases in the Even Swaps method. Our idea is not based on reducing biases in single even swap tasks. Instead, we suggest to design the path of the process so that the effects of biases cancel out and do not accumulate in favor of any single alternative. This way there is no need to explicitly manipulate or calibrate the DM's judgments.

The drivers of path dependence are likely to depend on the method used as well as the problem context. Besides biases there can be other human related drivers of path dependence, including motivational and strategic behavior. These drivers can be related to the facilitator and to the problem owners as well as to the stakeholders involved. In future studies a natural next step is to consider the decision analysis process and the people engaged in the system created in the problem solving as a whole. More research is clearly needed to identify different forms of path dependence, to understand the causes of path dependence in different context and to find ways of dealing with it.
