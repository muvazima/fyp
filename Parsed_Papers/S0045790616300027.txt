                  In this paper, we consider the performance of a cellular uplink (UL) multi-user feedback multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system assisted by joint transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) design and polarization-multiplexing (PM). PM is realized with the aid of dual and triply-polarized antennas. At the transmitter, we take advantage of only the individual user’s channel impulse responses (CIRs) obtained through feedback channels that endure noise, fading and delay to construct the preprocessing matrix, while at the receiver the post-processing matrix construction relies on the perfect CIRs of all the users. In multi-user UL-MIMO transmissions, multiple-access interference (MAI) and inter-antenna interference (IAI) can severely degrade the system’s performance. Our study shows that the joint Tx-Rx is capable of completely eliminating the IAI as well as the MAI when it employs perfect CIRs based preprocessing and post-processing. On the other hand, noise, fading and delay tainted quantized-CIRs based preprocessing results in noticeable performance degradation due to imperfect removal of IAI. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that, when the preprocessing is based on the quantized-CIRs obtained through ideal feedback channels, the resultant achievable symbol-error-rate and sum-capacity remain close to that obtained with the perfect CIRs based design.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems that use multiple antennas at the transmitters and receivers have been one of the most actively researched areas in the context of wireless communications. A plethora of work in MIMO wireless systems and the results have led to lots of intermediate applications. The two most important benefits of MIMO systems are as follows: First, a significant enhancement in both the system’s capacity in addition to spectral efficiency can be achieved, i.e., the capacity of a wireless link swells linearly with the minimum of the number of antennas at the transmit or receive side. Further, the data rate can be increased by delivering parallel data streams through spatial multiplexing without calling for additional frequency resources and total transmit power. Second, a significant reduction of the effects of fading can be attained by increased diversity. This is on the whole advantageous when the different channels fade independently [1,2]. To be specific, space-time coding can be employed to encode the data stream spatially across all the transmitting antennas. The resulting diversity gain can be exploited to improve the reliability of the wireless links.

By and large, the performance of the MIMO systems either in spatial multiplexing or transmit diversity mode relies to a great extent on the overall MIMO channel attributes, which are in turn functions of transmit and receive antennas heights, spacing and scattering [3]. Usually, antenna spacing of the order of tens of wavelength and up to a wavelength is required at the base station (BS) and mobile station (MS), respectively, to attain substantial multiplexing or diversity gain [3]. Alas, this requirement increases the size as well as the cost of the BS. Moreover, the use of more number of antennas (usually in excess of four) at the MS is not practically feasible owing to size and energy constrictions. As a design choice and to get round the aforesaid limitations, dual or triply-polarized antennas can be exploited as they can lift the cost and space constrictions inflicted by unipolarized antennas. In a dual and triply-polarized antenna aided system, a single antenna that employs orthogonal polarizations [3,4] can replace two and three spatially separated unipolarized antennas, respectively. Further, dual or triply-polarized transmissions involve concurrent transmission of two or three independent signals with the aid of orthogonal polarizations. Nevertheless, in the context of a uplink (UL) system exploiting dual or triply-polarized antennas for conceiving polarization-multiplexing (PM) by creating orthogonally polarized transmissions, reflections, scattering and diffraction can cause the electromagnetic waves propagating through the environment to endure depolarization. Furthermore, imperfection in transmit and receive antennas and change in the polarization state of the transmitted signals due to channel anisotropy and polarization orthogonality loss can considerably degrade the performance of the system in terms of the achievable error-rate or capacity.

In the open literature, performance of the dual or triply-polarized MIMO communication has been investigated for a single user scenario to achieve either spatial multiplexing or transmit diversity. The performance of such a system for a multi-user UL communication has received little attention. Furthermore, in a multi-user MIMO-UL transmission, inter-antenna interference (IAI) and multiple-access interference (MAI) can further degrade the system performance. The effects of IAI and MAI can be suppressed by calling upon the optimum maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver [5]. But, it introduces excessive complexity in signal detection which precludes its use even at the BS, where higher complexity is tolerable. As a design choice, transmitter preprocessing (TP) and receiver side post-processing can be employed [6–8] to suppress the effects of IAI and MAI, respectively.

The performance of the preprocessing techniques for systems aided by unipolarized antenna configuration have been widely addressed in the literature in the context of time division duplex (TDD) type wireless systems [2,6–10]. This is because in a TDD type system, the channel knowledge that is needed to formulate the preprocessing matrix at the BS for downlink (DL) communication can be obtained from the UL channels while the channel knowledge that is required to construct the preprocessing matrix at the MS for UL communication can be acquired from the DL channels due to the channel reciprocity exhibited by such systems. By contrast, in a frequency division duplex (FDD) type system, reciprocity cannot be employed, at least not in connection with the small-scale fading characteristics caused by the multipath propagation. This is because, in practice the frequency separation between the UL and DL channels is usually larger than the channel’s coherence bandwidth. Consequently, in FDD type wireless systems, the channel impulse responses (CIRs) needed to conceive the preprocessing matrix have to be estimated by the receiver and feedback the estimated CIRs via feedback channels to the transmitter. Therefore, investigating the performance of the preprocessing in wireless systems that employ FDD is more exacting in comparison to its TDD counterpart. Further, to the best of our knowledge, in the open literature, the performance of PM combined with preprocessing has not been explored for a FDD type multi-user UL wireless system with limited feedback constraints where IAI and MAI are the dominant channel impairments.


                     Contributions: In this paper, the performance of an uncoded spatial multiplexing in a system employing dual and triply-polarized antennas is investigated. Specifically, the performance is investigated in terms of the achievable symbol-error-rate (SER) and sum-capacity with the aid of a joint Tx-Rx design for a UL multi-user feedback MIMO transmission employing dual and triply-polarized antennas. The joint Tx-Rx design involves the construction of preprocessing and post-processing. CIRs are paramount in the preprocessing construction. If the preprocessing is to perfectly eliminate the interference and yield optimum performance, perfect availability of the CIRs is required at the transmitter at the instant of transmission. However, in practice, CIRs can be imperfect owing to estimation errors, feedback errors and feedback delays. Preprocessing design that does not take into consideration the uncertainties in the CIRs will not reflect the actual performance in the presence of the aforementioned imperfections. Therefore, against this background, in this contribution, singular-value decomposition (SVD) based joint transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) design is investigated for a UL multi-user feedback MIMO system aided by PM in the presence of feedback errors and feedback delays. To precis, the contributions of our work are as follows.

                        
                           •
                           First, we present the channel models for communication milieus that employ dual and triply-polarized antennas by taking into consideration the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD).

Second, we demonstrate that, when SVD-based joint Tx-Rx design, i.e, preprocessing and post-processing are used assuming the CIRs of the individual user is perfectly available at the MS and all the users’ CIRs at the BS at the moment of transmission and reception, respectively, the effects of both the IAI and MUI can be efficiently suppressed in the UL transmission.

Third, we investigate the achievable SER and sum-capacity, when the joint Tx-Rx is designed using the preprocessing constructed with the quantized-CIRs knowledge (Note: Here, it refers to quantized-CIR matrix constructed at the MSs with the aid of the codebook indices that correspond to the codewords of the quantized channel vectors stored at the BS, which are acquired via feedback channels. Note, furthermore, that, wherever we refer to quantized-CIRs knowledge being contaminated, it means the bits representing the integers that correspond to the vector-quantized (VQ) codebook indices which are utilized to construct the CIR matrix at the MSs are being contaminated, as we feedback only the bits corresponding to the integers of the codebook indices and not the actual VQ-CIRs. Consequently, when these codebook indices corrupted by noise, fading and delay, are utilized to construct the VQ-CIR matrix, it may diverge significantly from the VQ-CIR matrix for which the codebook indices were fed back. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate the impact of the codebook indices inaccuracy imposed by noise, fading and delay on the VQ-CIRs construction as well as the SER and sum-capacity performance of the considered system when aided by the preprocessing matrix based on these VQ-CIRs.) obtained with the aid of ideal feedback channels and the post-processing with the perfect CIRs. We also investigate the attainable SER and sum-capacity when the joint Tx-Rx design is based on the preprocessing devised with the aid of the quantized-CIRs knowledge contaminated by noise and fading and the post-processing based on perfect CIRs.

Finally, we study the delay-limited performance of the considered system, i.e., the joint Tx-Rx design aided by the preprocessing based on the outdated CIRs knowledge to characterize the achievable SER.

Section III describes the power allocation regime employed in our contribution, Section IV describes the vector quantization and Section V provides the performance results. Finally, in Section VI we draw the conclusion of our work.

For a dual-polarized system the channel matrix is generally modeled in terms of the vertical and horizontal polarizations. Specifically, the entries of 
                           H
                         denote the input-output relation from vertical to vertical, vertical to horizontal, horizontal to horizontal and horizontal to vertically polarized waves, i.e., the channel matrix for a single dual-polarized antenna both at the BS and MS can be modeled with the aid of Fig. 1

For a dual-polarized antenna structure, the ability to separate the vertical and horizontal polarizations is given by the XPD factor which is directly related to the random component of the channel. XPD characterizes the amount of leakage from one polarization to another introduced by the channel [3]. Further, it is now well known that when the electromagnetic waves traverse through the medium, they may endure change in polarization due to reflections. Furthermore, experimental studies have shown that scattering can change the polarization states even if we employ antennas with good XPDs [4]. The XPD factor for the variable component of the channel can be defined as [3]

                        Here, we assume a symmetric leakage as in [4]. Now, defining α, 0 < α ≤ 1, as the parameter that denotes a portion of the radiated power that couples from vertical to horizontal and from horizontal to vertical polarization, ideal discrimination between the vertical and horizontal polarization is possible when α → 0 and a leakage between polarizations occurs when 0 < α ≤ 1. Therefore, XPD and α can be related as

Generally, when a multi-antenna signaling approach is exploited, the elements of spatially separated uni-polarized channel matrix will be correlated when the spacing between the antennas is too small and when the channels are not exhibiting rich scattering. Hence, to correlate the elements of the random matrix of (1), we adopt the following method as used in [2]

                         and Nk
                         in (15) should invariably be in multiples of two, whereas, in (28) they should always be in multiples of three.

In this section, let us consider an UL transmission with the BS capable of supporting K MSs that are randomly distributed in a single cell system. Fig. 3
                         illustrates the scenario associated with a typical UL transmission. Here, each of the K MSs employs Nk
                         dual-polarized transmit antennas and that the BS employs Nb
                         dual-polarized receive antennas. The joint transmitter-receiver design implemented in the considered UL transmission is as follows; the preprocessing is conceived by exploiting only the individual user’s CIRs to purge the IAI, whereas the post-processing relies on all the users’ CIRs to deal with the removal of MAI.

Let the preprocessing matrix be denoted by

                        Suppose, if the BS and the MSs are equipped with triply-polarized antennas then with the aid of (28) and (32), the preprocessing and post-processing matrices can be readily arrived at, similar to the dual-polarized UL communication discourse.

In an UL communication, the transmission power of the kth user’s MS should remain constant, i.e., after preprocessing, the transmission power should not exceed the originally assigned power. Hence, to maintain a constant transmission power, the power allocation is realized under the following constraint [9–11]

                     The capacity in (43) gives the maximum information rate only when ideal channel knowledge is employed at the kth MS to carry out the preprocessing. Further, the capacity in (43) is arrived at based on the assumption of uncorrelated noise samples at the BS. However, due to the post-processing operation, the noise samples get correlated. Consequently, the covariance matrix of noise can be expressed as [9,10]

The computation complexity for the preprocessing matrix formulation in the context of the UL communication is tabulated in Table 1
                      
                     [12]. Furthermore, the detection complexity in detecting a user’s symbol in the context of the dual and triply-polarized UL communications is 
                        O
                     {(2Nb
                     )2} and 
                        O
                     {(3Nb
                     )2}, respectively.

As mentioned earlier, the CIRs knowledge is crucial at the transmitter for formulating the preprocessing matrix. Since, we presuppose a UL multi-user feedback MIMO system, the BS receiver should estimate the CIRs of each of the UL users and communicate its knowledge to the MSs’ transmitters through feedback channels. Consequently, at the BS, we ideally estimate the CIRs by invoking pilot aided channel estimation method. The magnitudes and phases of the estimated CIRs are then vector-quantized (VQ) and the codebook indices are conveyed to the MSs for devising the preprocessing matrix. The channels that carry the channel knowledge from the BS to MSs are assumed to endure noise, fading and delay. In the subsequent discourse we describe the VQ process.

                     . In our work, we carry out the codebooks generation and updation by calling upon the classical Lloyd’s algorithm [14] detailed in Table 2
                     . In the Table 2, d(., .) returns the Euclidean distance between the arguments.

In our work we vector quantize the phases and amplitudes separately. This is because, amplitudes and phases are differently distributed [13], i.e., amplitudes are Rayleigh distributed whilst the phases are uniformly distributed. Therefore, in this contribution we vector quantize the phases and amplitudes by using two vectors. Now, let

In the above exposition, we assumed that the feedback channels experience zero feedback delay. However, in practice the feedback channels will endure delay and hence, the recovered CIRs would be outdated. Therefore, to characterize the outdated CIRs, the temporal variations of the channels can be modeled with the aid of first order Markov process [15]

In this section, we provide a gamut of simulation results to characterize the achievable SER performance of a joint Tx-Rx design-assisted dual and triply-polarized UL multi-user feedback MIMO system when communicating over correlated fading channels. The modulation format considered in this work is 64 QAM. Further, we assume that the BS employs 10 dual or triply-polarized antennas and that each of the MSs use one dual or triply-polarized antenna. Furthermore, the fading coefficients connecting the BS and the MSs are derived with the aid of (1), (15) and (28) with

                     Fig. 4
                      shows the SER versus SNR comparison of the considered dual-polarized UL-MIMO system with that of the system employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) based multi-user detector (MUD) [18], when communicating over the fading channels that are correlated. Here, the joint Tx-Rx design is based on the perfect CIRs assumption. From the results of Fig. 4, it is seen that the system aided by the joint Tx-Rx design results in better achievable SER. Further, it can be inferred that when the number of users increases, the performance slightly degrades. Although the performance degrades slightly, the considered joint Tx-Rx design outperforms the SIC-MUD

                      in terms of the attainable SER.

In Figs. 5
                      and 6
                     , we demonstrate the SER as a function of SNR performance for the dual and triply polarized UL communications, respectively, by invoking the preprocessing matrix

                     . Figs. 5 and 6 provide the comparison for perfect CIRs knowledge, ideal feedback of VQ-CIRs knowledge and noise and fading tainted VQ-CIRs knowledge based preprocessing matrix aided UL communication. From the figures, we may notice that when the VQ-CIRs knowledge contaminated by noise as well as fading are used to formulate the preprocessing matrix, performance degrades considerably. However, when the VQ-CIRs knowledge corrupted by noise alone is employed for the preprocessing matrix construction, the SER performance of the considered systems improves. Further, in both the above-mentioned cases, performance degradation is due to the imperfect removal of IAI by the preprocessing matrix. By contrast, when the VQ-CIRs knowledge acquired through ideal feedback channels is exploited for constructing the preprocessing matrix, the considered system’s SER performance degrades only marginally with respect to the perfect CIRs assumption.

                      for dual and triply polarized UL communications, respectively. From the Figs. 7 and 8, we may infer that similar to the SER performance, the sum-capacity achieved in terms of the number of bits per channel use degrades noticeably in the context of noisy and fading feedback, whereas in the case of ideal feedback of VQ-CIRs knowledge the achievable sum-capacity remains almost close to that achieved with the perfect CIRs. Nevertheless, the sum-capacity degrades further when the noise samples are correlated as alluded to in (46) due to the post-processing operation. Moreover, the maximum attainable information rate of (47) and (49) can be attained, when the BS exploits the knowledge of 
                        R

                      in the context of kth user’s symbol detection.

In Fig. 9
                     , we present the achievable SER of the system aided by TP devised with the VQ-CIRs knowledge acquired via ideal feedback channels and feedback channels that experience delay, i.e. outdated VQ-CIRs knowledge. The feedback delay considered in our simulation is 
                        
                           
                              f
                              d
                           
                           τ
                           =
                           6
                           ×
                           
                              10
                              
                                 −
                                 3
                              
                           
                        
                      
                     [15]. As expected, outdated VQ-CIRs knowledge based preprocessing approach results in performance degradation in terms of the achievable SER compared to the TP based on VQ-CIRs knowledge acquired through ideal feedback channels. The performance deterioration is considerable in the high SNR regime as can be witnessed from the Fig. 9. However, from our study and simulation results, we may conclude that feedbacking the VQ-CIRs knowledge to the MSs for preprocessing matrix formulation can be deemed as an efficient approach to deal with the IAI, when the feedback channels experience zero delay while exhibiting robustness against fading and noise. Further, it can be observed from our results that the TP based system outperforms the SIC-MUD aided system in terms of the achievable SER.


                     Fig. 10
                      demonstrates the performance comparison of the TP approach considered in this treatise with the well-known precoding approaches such as dirty paper coding (DPC) and Tomlinson–Harashima precoding (THP)[19–22]. From the result, we may infer that the SVD-based TP outperforms DPC and THP precodings in terms of the attainable SER as can be seen from the Fig. 10.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we investigated the performance of a UL multi-user feedback MIMO system with the aid of a joint Tx-Rx design and polarization-multiplexing. Our study shows that the joint Tx-Rx design perfectly eliminates the IAI and MUI when the preprocessing and the post-processing are constructed with the perfect CIRs knowledge assumption. Further, our results show that, noise and fading tainted VQ-CIRs knowledge based preprocessing coupled with the perfect CIRs based post-processing results in noticeable performance degradation in terms of the achievable SER and sum-capacity. Besides, our simulation results reveal that further degradation results in the SER, when the outdated CIRs knowledge based preprocessing is employed. Albeit the performance degrades, it can be inferred from our results that, the considered joint Tx-Rx design constructed with the aid of the preprocessing based on the ideal feedback of the VQ-CIRs knowledge and the perfect CIRs based post-processing yields an SER and sum-capacity performance that closely match the performance obtained with the perfect CIRs knowledge assumption. Therefore, we may conclude that polarization-multiplexing coupled with the joint Tx-Rx based on VQ-CIRs knowledge feedback based preprocessing and perfect CIRs knowledge based post-processing can be deemed as an efficient approach for the UL multi-user feedback MIMO system to deal with the IAI and MAI, provided the feedback channels endure zero-delay while exhibiting robustness against noise and fading. Furthermore, our simulation results evince that the joint Tx-Rx design results in better SER performance than the popularly known precoding approaches and the SIC-MUD.
