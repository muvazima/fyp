A rational motion is a motion with only rational trajectories. In the dual quaternion model of 
                        
                           SE
                        
                        (
                        3
                        )
                     , the group of rigid body displacements (Selig, 2005, Ch. 9), it is described by a rational curve on the Study quadric (Jüttler, 1993). In this article we construct a rational motion of minimal degree in the dual quaternion model with a given rational curve as trajectory, and we show that this motion is unique up to coordinate changes. This is an interesting result in its own right but it also has a certain potential for applications in computer graphics, computer aided design or mechanism science.

Usually, one defines the degree of a rational motion as the maximal degree of a trajectory (Jüttler, 1993). With this concept of motion degree, our problem becomes trivial as the curvilinear translation along the curve is already minimal. As we shall see, it is also minimal with respect to the dual quaternion degree if the prescribed trajectory is generic. The situation changes, however, if the trajectory is circular, that is, it intersects the absolute circle at infinity. In this case, the minimal achievable degree in the dual quaternion model is the curve degree minus half the number of conjugate complex intersection points with the absolute circle at infinity (the curve's circularity).

We will see that twice the circularity of a trajectory equals the trajectory degree minus the degree defect in the spherical component of the minimal motion. This leads to the rather strange observation that generic rational motions (without spherical degree defect) have very special (entirely circular) trajectories. Conversely, the minimal motion to generic (non-circular) curves are curvilinear translations which are special in the sense that their spherical degree defect is maximal.

We continue this article with an introduction to the dual quaternion model of rigid body displacements in Section 2. There we also introduce motion polynomials and their relation to rational motions. Our results are formulated and proved in Section 3. The proof of the central result (Theorem 2) is constructive and can be used to actually compute the minimal rational motion by a variant of the Euclidean algorithm. We illustrate this procedure by two examples.

In this article, we work in the dual quaternion model of the group of rigid body displacements. This model requires a minimal number of parameters while retaining a bilinear composition law. Moreover, it provides a rich algebraic and geometric structure. It is, for example, possible to use a variant of the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two polynomials. This section presents the necessary theoretical background on dual quaternions.

Given a reduced parameterised equation x of degree d, it is our ultimate aim to find a motion polynomial 
                        C
                        =
                        P
                        +
                        ε
                        Q
                        ∈
                        D
                        H
                        [
                        t
                        ]
                      of minimal degree such that the trajectory of one point p is parameterised by x. An obvious example of a motion polynomial with trajectory x is the curvilinear translation along x and it will turn out that this is already the solution to our problem in generic cases. However, for trajectories which are non-generic, in a sense to be made precise below, a lesser degree can be achieved.

A motion polynomial 
                           C
                           =
                           P
                           +
                           ε
                           Q
                         is called reduced, if both P and Q have no common real factor. The real factor of the primal part P with maximal degree is uniquely defined up to a constant scalar factor. We call it maximal real polynomial factor and abbreviate it by “mrpf”. It accounts for a difference in degrees between the rational motion, parameterised by 
                           C
                           =
                           P
                           +
                           ε
                           Q
                        , and its spherical component, parameterised by P. Hence, we also call the degree of the maximal real polynomial factor of P the spherical degree defect of C.

We only consider reduced rational motions but do not exclude motions with positive spherical degree defect. It will turn out that the spherical degree defect and circularity of trajectories are closely related:

Geometrically, circularity is half the number of (conjugate complex) intersection points of x and the absolute circle at infinity, counted with their respective algebraic multiplicities. Hence, it is always an integer (this also follows algebraically from the fact that

                           Remark 2
                           Calling a rational motion generic if the primal part has no real factors one interpretation of Theorem 1 is as follows: A trajectory of a generic rational motion can be entirely circular (actually, only few exceptions are known). A similar statement for algebraic planar motions can be found in Bottema and Roth (1990, Ch. XI). There, also a more detailed discussion on the circularity of trajectories can be found. For planar rational curves, the geometric circularity conditions there imply the algebraic circularity conditions of Theorem 1.

As one consequence of Theorem 1, among all rational curves of fixed degree, curves of high circularity can be generated by rational motions of low degree. In particular, we obtain the desired bound on the degree of a rational motion with a given rational trajectory:

                              If a rational curve of circularity c and degree d is a trajectory of the rational motion 
                              
                                 C
                                 =
                                 P
                                 +
                                 ε
                                 Q
                              
                              , the degree of C is not less than 
                              
                                 d
                                 −
                                 c
                              
                              . If it is of degree 
                              
                                 d

                                 c
                              
                              , the degree defect of the spherical motion component equals 
                              
                                 d

                              .
                           

We will see below in Section 3.2 that the bound of Corollary 1 is sharp.


                        
                           Example 1
                           Let us illustrate above results by simple examples from literature. In case of 
                                 deg
                                 ⁡
                                 C
                                 =
                                 1
                              , the only generic rational motions are rotations with fixed axis. Their generic trajectories (trajectories that maximise the degree among all trajectories) are circles and, of course, entirely circular. Rational motions with 
                                 deg
                                 ⁡
                                 C
                                 =
                                 2
                               are generated by reflecting a moving frame in one family of rulings on a quadric H, see Hamann (2011). The generic case is obtained if H is a hyperboloid. In this case, generic trajectories are of degree four. Their entirely circularity has already been observed in Bottema and Roth (1990, Ch. IX, §7). The non-generic trajectories are circles. Points with non-generic trajectories lie on two skew lines that coincide if H is a hyperboloid of revolution. Finally, if H is a hyperbolic paraboloid, generic trajectories are just of degree three and circularity one (Hamann, 2011).

Now we turn to the task of computing a rational motion

                           j
                           +
                           
                              
                                 x

                           k
                         as trajectory. Denote the degree of the trajectory by d and its circularity by c. By Corollary 1 we have 
                           n
                           ≥
                           d
                           −
                           c
                        . We will prove that, up to coordinate changes, exactly one solution of minimal degree 
                           n
                           =

                           −
                           c
                         exists and we also provide a procedure for its computation.

A key ingredient in our proof of Theorem 2 is a version of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the left gcd of two polynomials 
                           F
                           ,
                           G

                           H
                           [
                           t
                           ]
                        . This is a well-known concept in the theory of polynomials over rings, see Ore (1933). Call the polynomial 
                           L
                           ∈
                           H
                           [
                           t
                           ]
                         a left factor or left divisor of F if there exists 
                           Q
                           ∈
                           H
                           [
                           t
                           ]
                         such that

                           =
                           L
                           Q
                        . The polynomial 
                           D
                           ∈
                           H
                           [
                           t
                           ]
                         is called left gcd of F and G, if D is a left divisor of F and G and any left divisor E of F and G also left divides D. The left gcd is unique up to right multiplication with a non-zero quaternion.

The Euclidean algorithm in this context is based on polynomial right division. Given

                           Remark 3
                           In case of a rational curve of circularity zero, the primal part P of the rational motion 
                                 C

                               is a real polynomial and the trivial solution consists of the curvilinear translation along the given curve. In all other cases, Theorem 2 guarantees solutions of lesser degree than curvilinear translations.

Our formulation of Theorem 2 requires a special moving point, the origin 1, to generate the rational curve and produces a motion polynomial C with the special property 
                           C
                           (
                           ∞
                           )
                           ≡
                           1
                        . These conditions are just coordinate dependencies and are convenient for our algebraic formulation and proof. If we allow coordinate changes, we may translate 1 to an arbitrary moving point (this amounts to replacing C by 
                           C
                           
                              
                                 T

                         with a suitable translation, as in the proof of Theorem 1) and orient the coordinate axis arbitrarily (this amounts to right-multiplying C with 
                           r
                           ∈
                           H
                        ). Thus, we can re-formulate Theorem 2 as


                        
                           Corollary 2
                           
                              There is a unique (up to coordinate changes) rational motion of minimal degree in the dual quaternion model of rigid body displacements with a prescribed rational trajectory. If the trajectory is of degree d and circularity c, the minimal motion is of degree 
                              
                                 n
                                 =
                                 d
                                 −
                                 c
                              
                              .
                           


                        
                           Remark 4
                           Frequently, the degree of a rational motion is defined as maximal degree of one of its trajectories. With this concept of degree, Corollary 2 is no longer true. A counter example is a circle which occurs as trajectory of a circular translation and of a rotation about its centre. For both motions the maximal degree of a trajectory is two.

                               is the composition of two rotations about the second coordinate axis and the third coordinate axis with equal angular velocities, i.e., the motion generated by the rolling of a spherical circle of radius

                              . There, the moving frame is rigidly attached to the rolling circle.

This article unveiled some relations between rational motions and their trajectories. A rational curve occurs as trajectory of a unique (up to coordinate changes) rational motion of minimal degree in the dual quaternion model. This was a surprise to the authors as a mere trajectory seems to leave a lot of freedom for the construction of a suitable rational motion. Apparently, the requirement for minimality is rather restrictive.

Calling a rational curve “generic” if its circularity is zero and a rational motion “generic” if its primal part has no real factors (the spherical motion component has full degree), we may also say that rational motions of minimal quaternion degree to a generic trajectory are non-generic. Conversely, the trajectories of a generic rational motion are entirely circular and hence non-generic.

In conjunction with the factorisation of generic rational motions (Hegedüs et al., 2013) and its extension (Li et al., 2015b) to non-generic motion polynomials, our results contribute to a variant of Kempe's Universality Theorem (Demaine and O'Rourke, 2007, Section 3.2) for rational space curves. Via motion factorisation, it is possible to construct linkages to generate a given rational motion and hence also a given rational trajectory. The dual quaternion degree of the generating motion is directly related to the number of links and joints in the mechanism. As a consequence, rational curves can be generated by spatial linkages with much fewer links and joints than those implied by the asymptotic bounds for algebraic space curves given by Abbott (2008). For circular curves, the numbers of links and joints are even less. A precise formulation and a rigorous proof will be worked out in a future paper.

Our main result in Corollary 2 raises questions. Is a similar uniqueness statement true for algebraic curves and algebraic motions? What rational motions are not minimal for any of their trajectories? The Darboux motion and the circular translation of Remark 1 are examples. Finally, determine simple (classes of) curves with simple minimal motion as in Example 3 and exploit their low degree and rationality in a CAGD or engineering context.
