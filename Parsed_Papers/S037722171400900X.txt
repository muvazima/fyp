                  In this paper, we consider a multi-period fuzzy portfolio optimization problem with minimum transaction lots. Based on possibility theory, we formulate a mean-semivariance portfolio selection model with the objectives of maximizing the terminal wealth and minimizing the cumulative risk over the whole investment horizon. In the proposed model, we take the return, risk, transaction costs, diversification degree, cardinality constraint and minimum transaction lots into consideration. To reflect investor’s aspiration levels for the two objectives, a fuzzy decision technique is employed to transform the proposed model into a single objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Then, we design a genetic algorithm for solution. Finally, we give an empirical application in Chinese stock markets to demonstrate the idea of our model and the effectiveness of the designed algorithm.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     Markowitz (1952) originally proposed mean-variance model for portfolio selection, which laid the foundation of modern portfolio analysis. Portfolio optimization deals with the problem of how to allocate investor’s wealth among a basket of securities. To realize this idea, the proper portfolio model must be presented. Most of existing portfolio selection models have been proposed on the assumption of a perfect fractionability of the investments, which are difficult to implement. In real world, each security has its minimum transaction lot. So it is necessary to consider rounds. To reflect this realistic characteristic of security, some researchers have proposed a series of mixed-integer programming models. Speranza (1996) proposed a mixed-integer programming model on the basis of the mean absolute deviation model in Konno and Yamazaki (1991) by taking minimum transaction lots and maximum number of securities into consideration, and designed a simple two-phase heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed model. Mansini and Speranza (1999) considered a NP-complete portfolio selection problem with minimum lots and presented three heuristic algorithms to solve the problem. In Kellerer, Mansini, and Speranza (2000), a portfolio selection model with fixed costs and minimum transaction lots was proposed and two linear programming based heuristic algorithms were designed for solution. Konno and Wijayanayake (2001) discussed portfolio optimization problem with concave transaction costs and minimum transaction lots under the framework of mean-absolute deviation risk measure, and devised a branch and bound algorithm for solving the proposed model. Konno and Wijayanayake (2002) discussed the market illiquidity effects and investigated a portfolio optimization problem with D. C. transaction costs and minimal transaction unit constraints. Recently, Lin and Liu (2008) proposed three possible models for portfolio selection problems with minimum transaction lots, and devised genetic algorithms to solve them. Baixauli-Soler, Alfaro-Cid, and Fernandez-Blanco (2011) employed VaR as risk measure to investigate an asset allocation problem under real constraints, such as minimum transaction lots and non-linear cost structure.

Notice that all the models mentioned above are single period portfolio selection models. However, in real world, investors tend to invest long-term investment. The investors should adjust their wealth from time to time. So it is nature to investigate multi-period portfolio selection problems. Numerous researchers have studied multi-period portfolio optimization problems, see for instance, Elton and Gruber (1974),Fama (1970) and Hakansson (1971). Li and Ng (2000) made breakthrough result for dynamic portfolio. In their model, they employed the idea of embedding the problem in a tractable auxiliary problem to investigate the mean-variance formulation in multi-period portfolio selection and obtained the corresponding mean-variance efficient frontier. After that, Zhu, Li, and Wang (2004) used the same approach to study the continuous-time dynamic multi-period problem by taking risk control into account. Rocha and Kuhn (2012) formulated a dynamic mean-variance model for electricity portfolio management. Gülpınar and Rustem (2007) presented min–max formulations of multi-period mean-variance optimization problem with multiple rival risk and return scenarios. Fonseca and Rustem (2012) applied linear decision rules to a robust multiperiod international portfolio. Costa and Araujo (2008) considered a multi-period generalized mean-variance model with Markov switching in the key market parameters. Calafiore (2008) concerned with multi-period sequential decision problems for financial asset allocation and presented a multi-period portfolio optimization model with control policies. Briec and Kerstens (2009) proposed a general approach for multi-horizon mean-variance portfolio analysis. Fu, Lari-Lavassani, and Li (2010) considered continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection with borrowing constraint, i.e., under different interest rates for borrowing and lending, rendering the market incomplete. Fu, Wei, and Yang (2014) considered the optimal asset allocation problem in a continuous-time regime-switching market. Çelikyurt and Özekici (2007) presented several multi-period portfolio optimization models where the market consists of a riskless asset and several risky assets. The literatures mentioned were proposed on the framework of probability theory.

In probabilistic portfolio models, the returns of risky assets are regarded as random variables with probability distributions. The basic assumption of them is that the future situation of risky assets can be correctly reflected by its historical data. However, since financial markets are complex and ever-changing, this kind of assumption is hard to ensure in real world. As is well known, portfolio decision-making is often affected by many non-probabilistic factors including social, economic, political, people’s cognitive and psychological factors, etc. For example, REITs and the financial crisis mentioned by Basse, Friedrich, and Vazquez Bea (2009) are also affected by aforementioned human factors, which have caused some instability in markets affecting the correlations between the returns of different asset classes and that this observation is a reminder of the fact that the correlation matrices of returns on risky assets regularly used in financial optimizations are not necessarily stable over time. Thus, the influence of experts’ experiences and knowledge, and investors’ subjective opinions on portfolio selection cannot be neglected (such as Tanaka and Guo, 1999, Fang, Lai, and Wang, 2006, Vercher, Bermúdez, and Segura, 2007, Liu, Zhang, and Xu, 2012 and so on). Due to the influence of above-mentioned non-probabilistic factors, the future situation of risky assets is usually characterized by fuzzy uncertainty such as vagueness and ambiguity. Namely, decision makers are usually provided with information which is characterized by vague linguistic descriptions such as high risk, low profit, high interest rate, etc. Notice that all these factors mentioned above are affected by human’s subjective opinions. They have a great influence on financial markets such that the returns of risky assets are characterized by vague linguistic values or fuzzy values in many cases. Taking human’s subjective factors into consideration, fuzzy approaches are more suitable than probabilistic approaches in characterizing the uncertainty in real financial markets as pointed by Liu and Zhang (2013). With the wide use of fuzzy set theory in Zadeh (1965), more and more researchers have realized that they could use the fuzzy set theory to handle the vagueness and ambiguity, see for example, Tanaka and Guo (1999),Carlsson, Fullér, and Majlender (2002),Fang et al. (2006),Vercher et al. (2007),Zhang, Wang, Chen, and Nie (2007),Zhang, Zhang, and Xiao (2009), Zhang et al. (2010), Barak, Abessi, and Modarres (2013), and Liu and Zhang (2013). Though great progress has been made in fuzzy portfolio selection, most of existing models are single period models. Recently, Sadjadi, Seyedhosseini, and Hassanlou (2011) discussed a fuzzy multi-period portfolio optimization problem with different rates for borrowing and lending. Zhang, Liu, and Xu (2012) proposed a possibilistic mean-semivariance-entropy model for multi-period fuzzy portfolio selection. Liu et al. (2012) presented four multi-period fuzzy portfolio optimization models by using multiple criteria. To our knowledge, the researches about multi-period fuzzy portfolio selection problem with real constrains are few. The purpose of this paper is to investigate multi-period portfolio selection problem in fuzzy environment with minimum transaction lots. We present a mean-semivariance model by using possibility theory. In the proposed model, we consider six criteria, including the return, risk, transaction cost, diversification degree, cardinality constraint and minimum transaction lots. The investment return is measured by possibilistic mean value of the return rate of a portfolio. The investment risk is quantified by the lower possibilistic semivariance of the return rate of portfolio and the diversification degree is measured by the proportion entropy in Kapur (1990). Since the proposed model is a bi-objective programming problem, an S-shape membership function is used to express investor’s satisfaction degree for each objective and then transform it into a corresponding single objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. After that, we design a novel genetic algorithm for solution.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some basic conceptions about fuzzy variables. In Section 3, we first formulate a bi-objective multi-period portfolio optimization model with minimum lots, in which we assume that the investor wants to maximize the terminal wealth and minimize the cumulative risk over all investment horizon. Then, we employ a nonlinear S-shape fuzzy membership functions to express investor’s aspiration levels for the two objectives. By using the nonlinear S-shape membership functions, we transform the proposed model into a single programming problem. In Section 4, we design a genetic algorithm to solve the proposed model. In Section 5, we use an empirical application in Chinese stock markets to demonstrate the idea of our model and the effectiveness of the designed algorithm for solution. In Section 6, we conclude this paper by some remarks.

In this section, let us first review some basic conceptions about fuzzy variables, which we need in the following sections.

                        Theorem 1
                        Let A

                            be n nonnegative real numbers. Then, we have

In this section, we discuss a multi-period portfolio selection problem in fuzzy environment with minimum lot. We assume that an investor allocates his initial wealth W
                     1 among n securities and a risk-free asset at the beginning of period 1 and obtains his terminal wealth at the end of period T. He could readjust his wealth at the every beginning of the following T − 1 consecutive time periods. We also assume that the return rates of securities at each period are characterized by trapezoidal fuzzy variables and the return rate of the risk-free asset is a constant. For the better understanding of our paper, we first introduce all the notations that will be used in the following sections. For i = 1, 2, …, n and t = 1, 2, …, T, we let

Most of existing portfolio selection models have been proposed on the assumption that the investments are perfect fractionability, in such a way that the investment proportion of portfolio for each security could be represented by real numbers. However, in real financial market, the transaction of securities is usually associated with minimum lots or rounds. For different kinds of securities, the minimum lots may be different, for instance 100, 500 or 1000 shares. Let us take A-share in Chinese security markets for example. Its minimal unit is 100 shares. The worth for each transaction lot is equal to p

                        , where y
                        
                           t, i
                         is the market price of security i at period t and Ni
                         is the number of minimum units of security i required as minimum quantity. x

                         denotes as the part of the total available wealth that the investor decides to invest on security i at period t.

In this section, we employ the crisp possibilistic mean value of the net return on the portfolio at each period to measure the return of portfolio. The risk on the return rate of portfolio at each period is quantified by the lower possibilistic variance and the diversification degree is measured by the proportion entropy in Kapur (1990).

For the transaction costs, we assume in the sequel that the transaction costs at period t is a V shape function of the difference between the tth period portfolio xt

Based on the analysis above, we quantify the return of security by the possibilistic mean value and the risk by the lower possibilistic variance. We assume that the investor wants to maximize the terminal wealth and minimize the cumulative risk on the return rates of portfolios over T investment periods. At the same time, he requires the return rate and the diversification degree of portfolio at each period must achieve or exceed their corresponding preset minimum levels and the risk of the return rate on portfolio must be smaller than the given maximum risk tolerance level at each period. Moreover, he restricts to hold at most K assets in portfolio at each period. Then, the multi-period portfolio selection problem can be constructed as the following bi-objective programming problem (P

Notice that the problem (P
                        1) has two incommensurability and conflicting objectives. To remove the effects of their incommensurability, similar to Hwang and Yoon (1981), we need to perform normalization operation on each objective as follows

                         represent the middle aspiration levels for terminal wealth and the cumulative risk over the whole holding periods, respectively. After normalization, the value of each objective function is kept in the range [0, 1]. Thus, we can compare them because their values are independent of the scale of the objective functions in the problem (P
                        1).

In practical portfolio management, experts’ knowledge and experience are very important for making portfolio decision-making. Based on experts’ knowledge, the investor may express his aspiration levels for terminal wealth and the cumulative risk over the whole holding periods. In this paper, we employ the nonlinear S-shape membership function in Watada (2001) to express investor’s aspiration levels for the two objectives mentioned above. The S-shape membership function is given by

Then, by Eqs. (30)–(32), the membership functions of terminal wealth and the cumulative risk over the whole investment horizon can be, respectively, expressed by

                           Notice that θW
                               and θV
                               determine the shapes of membership functions μE
                              (x) and μV
                              (x), respectively, where θW
                               > 0 and θV
                               > 0. The larger the parameters θW
                               > 0 and θV
                               > 0 are, the less their vagueness becomes.

For the mix-integer nonlinear programming problem (P
                     3), the traditional optimization approaches cannot be used to solve the multi-period portfolio selection problem with minimum transaction lots and cardinality constraints. For this reason, we propose a novel genetic algorithm to solve the multi-period portfolio selection optimization problem.

Genetic algorithm (GA) is a kind of stochastic search technique based on the mechanism of the famous Darwin’s principal of natural selection “survival of the fittest”, which was originally proposed by Holland (1975). Due to computationally simple and powerful, genetic algorithms are often regarded as very good tool for solving different types of optimization problems since they make no restrictive assumptions about the solution space. Up to now, many researchers have used the GAs to solve complex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems. Li and Gen (1996) and Yokota, Gen, and Li (1996) proposed genetic algorithms based on penalty function to solve mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems. Deep, Singh, Kansal, and Mohan (2009) designed a real code genetic algorithm for solving integer and mixed integer constrained optimization problems. Recently, some researchers use GAs for optimizing the portfolio selection problems. Lin and Liu (2008) designed a genetic algorithm with penalty function to solve portfolio selection problems with minimum transaction lots. Soleimani, Golmakani, and Salimi (2009) used genetic algorithm to solve Markowitz-based portfolio selection with minimum transaction lots, cardinality constraints and regarding sector capitalization. Baixauli-Soler et al. (2011) proposed a multi-objective genetic algorithm for solving mean-VaR portfolio selection problem with minimum transaction lots and non-linear transaction costs.

In this section, we design a novel genetic algorithm on the basis of the solution algorithm in Deep et al. (2009) to solve the problem (P
                     3). We first introduce its initialization operation, constraint-handling, evaluation function, crossover operation, selection operation, mutation operation and stopping criterion.


                     Initialization operation: In this algorithm, we first randomly generate a solution in the range [l
                     
                        t, i
                     , u
                     
                        t, i
                     ] for each variable x
                     
                        t, i
                     . Then, we can obtain an individual, denoted it as X = (x
                     1, 1, …, x
                     1, n
                     ; …; x
                     
                        T, 1, …, x
                     
                        T, n
                     ). For convenience, we divide the nT components of X equally into T groups. Accordingly, the individual X can be rewritten as X = (x
                     1, …, xT
                     ), where xt
                      = (x
                     
                        t, 1, …, x
                     
                        t, n
                     ) for all i = 1, 2, …, n and t = 1, 2, …, T. Repeat above mentioned operation pop
                     −
                     size times, we can get a population.


                     Constraint-handling: Since the randomly generated solution may not satisfy the feasible region, we need to check the feasibility of each individual. We perform the following constraints-handling operation. To ensure each component of X satisfy the integer restrict, we perform truncation operation on it. The concrete rules of the truncation operation can be summarized as follows:

                        
                           (i)
                           If X is an integer number vector, then 
                                 
                                    
                                       X
                                       ¯
                                    
                                    =
                                    X
                                 
                              .

If X is a real number vector, then 
                                 
                                    X
                                    ¯
                                 
                               is equal to either ⌊X⌋ or ⌊X⌋ + 1 each with probability 0.5, where ⌊X⌋ denotes as the integer part of X.

To make the individual satisfy the cardinality constraint, we keep the largest K variables in each group. After truncation operation and cardinality repair, we normalize the remainder components in each group to keep them satisfy the budget constraint. Furthermore, we calculate the violent value of the individual X, denoted it as Viol(X).


                     Evaluation function: The evaluation function of this algorithm is formulated as follows

                     worst is the objective function value of the worst feasible solution at current population. From Eq. (36), we can find out that, if Xi
                      is an infeasible solution, then its evaluation value depends on both the amount of constraint violation value and the population of solutions at hand. However, if Xi
                      is a feasible solution, then its evaluation value is equal to the objective function value f(Xi
                     ).

                      is the sum of the violent values of Xi
                      both inequality constraints and equality constraints (where gj
                     (Xi
                     ) denotes as the left side term of the jth inequality constraint minus its right side term). For the equality constraints in the problem (P
                     3), we can transform them into corresponding inequality constraints by using a tolerance. If there are no feasible solutions in the population, then f
                     worst is set to zero. Notice that Eq. (36) is an evaluation function without penalty factor for constraint handling.

For any given two solutions, we compare them by the following rules in Deb (2000):

                        
                           (1)
                           A feasible solution is always preferred over an infeasible one.

Between two feasible solutions, the one with better objective function is preferred.

Between two infeasible solutions, the one with smaller constraint violation is preferred.

                      are the lower and upper bounds on the value of the decision variable; y is a random number in (0,1). Similar to crossover operation, we perform the constraint-handling operation on the two obtained offsprings. After checking the feasibility of the two offsprings and their parents, we select the two better individuals for next generation.


                     Selection operation: We use the common spinning the roulette wheel technique to perform the selection operation. To do that, we can keep the better chromosomes that have more chance to produce offspring. Notice that, for the problem (P
                     3), the chromosome with a higher objective value is better, i.e. the chromosome with a higher fitness value is better. Before performing the spinning the roulette wheel, we first introduce a rank-based evaluation function denoted by eval(Ck
                     ) to calculate the probability of Ck
                      for reproduction as follows:

To illustrate the idea of our model and the designed algorithm, let us consider an empirical application in Chinese stock markets. Assume that there are 10 stocks and a risk-free asset in a financial market for trading. The exchange codes of the 10 stocks are 600005, 600068, 000858, 600009, 000031, 000056, 000063, 000901, 600066, 600058. For convenience of description, we denote the 10 stocks successively as Stocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in this example. An investor intends to allocate his initial wealth 100,000 CNY among the 11 assets with a time horizon of three consecutive investment periods. In this example, we suppose that the investor uses the historical data of the 10 stocks and the risk-free asset to simulate the future transaction. Here, we collect the weekly closing pricing of these stocks in six years from January 2004 to January 2010 as the sample data. We set each two years as an investment period to handle these historical data. We assume that the return rates of stocks are trapezoidal fuzzy variables. The corresponding trapezoidal possibility distributions of these stocks at each period are shown in Table 1
                     . Assume that the market price of each stock can be reflected by its historical information. Table 2
                      shows the market prices of these stocks at the date of transaction for each period.

Assume that the transaction cost rate is 0.003, i.e., c
                     
                        t, i
                      = 0.003 (t = 1, 2, 3; i = 1, 2, …, 10). The expected return rate levels of the portfolios on the three investment periods are set as 0.0245, 0.0267 and 0.0333, respectively. The return rate of risk-free asset at each period is set as 0.02. The risk tolerance levels of the portfolios on the three investment periods are set as 0.015, 0.018 and 0.024, respectively. The maximum number of assets in the portfolio at each period is set to 6, i.e., K = 6. The diversification degree of the portfolio at each period is set to 1.2. Here, we set EM
                      = 1.12 × 105 and VM
                      = 0.025.

In this example, we consider three different values of parameters θE
                      and θV
                      to express different investors’ preferences, i.e., (θE, θV
                     ) = (80,20), (50,50) and (20,80). The parameters in the genetic algorithm are set as follows. The population size is set as 100. The probabilities of crossover operation and mutation operation are set as 0.8 and 0.1, respectively. The maximum generation G
                     max is set as 5000. After running the genetic algorithm 5000 generations, the corresponding computational results for the three preference cases mentioned above are shown in Tables 3
                      and 4. Table 3
                      shows the transaction lots of the 10 stocks at each period. Table 4 gives the invested amounts of the 10 stocks and the risk-free asset at each period. The satisfaction degree η, terminal wealth, net profit and total transaction cost are summarized in Table 5
                     .

From Tables 3–5 above, we find that different investment preferences lead to different investment strategies. If preference parameter vector (θE, θV
                     ) is set as (20,80), it means that the investor requires the less vagueness on μV
                     (X) than that on μE
                     (X). Namely, the investor is conservative. In this case, the investor should select a risk-free asset and four stocks (i.e., Stocks 1, 2, 4 and 5) for constructing portfolio at period 1. The buying lots of the four stocks are 2, 1, 7 and 37, respectively. The investment amounts on the four stocks and the risk-free asset at period 1 are 1282.00, 193.00, 4151.00, 82 547.00 and 19 680.76 CNY, respectively. Then, at the beginning of period 2, the investor will readjust his portfolio. After adjustment, the investor will select Stocks 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and the risk-free asset for constructing portfolio. The transaction lots of the six stocks are 7, 3, 5, 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The corresponding investment amounts on the six stocks and the risk-free asset are 861.00, 1725.00, 4125.00, 696.00, 17 324.00, 10 824.00 and 58 940.51 CNY, respectively. Then, at the beginning period 3, the investor should adjust his portfolio again. After adjustment, Stocks 3, 7, 9 and the risk-free asset are selected for constructing portfolio. The transaction lots on the selected three stocks are 7, 2 and 3, respectively. The corresponding investment amounts on the three stocks and the risk-free asset are 17 157.00, 35 792.00, 43 773.00 and 10 201.54 CNY, respectively. In this case, the obtained terminal wealth is 11 2713.18 CNY, the net profit is 12 713.18 CNY, the total transaction cost is 622.81 CNY and the investor’s satisfaction degree about the investment strategy is 0.8231. However, if the investor shows a neutral attitude toward both terminal wealth and cumulative risk, we set the preference parameter vector (θE, θV
                     ) as (50,50). The transaction lots of the 10 stocks of the three investment periods are shown in lines 5–7 in Table 4 and the corresponding investment amounts of the 11 assets in the three investment periods are given in lines 5–7 in Table 5. In this case, the terminal wealth is 112 431.37 CNY, the net profit is 12 431.37 CNY, the total transaction cost is 638.99 CNY and the investor’s satisfaction degree about the investment strategy is 0.9108. If the investor requires the less vagueness on μE
                     (X) than that on μV
                     (X). Here, the preference parameter vector (θE, θV
                     ) is set as (80,20). The transaction lots of the 10 stocks in the three investment periods are shown in lines 8–10 in Table 4 and the corresponding investment amounts of the 11 assets on the three investment periods are given in lines 8–10 in Table 5. The obtained terminal wealth is 112 123.27 CNY, the net profit is 12 123.27 CNY, the total transaction cost is 666.24 CNY and the satisfaction degree about the two decision objectives is 0.7432. If the investor is not satisfied with any of the obtained investment strategy, he could reset the value of θE
                      and θV
                     .

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper investigates a multi-period fuzzy portfolio selection problem with minimum transaction lots. Based on the possibility theory, we propose a mean-semivariance model for multi-period fuzzy portfolio selection problem with minimum transaction lots. In the proposed model, we consider six criteria, i.e., return, risk, transaction cost, diversification degree, cardinality constraint and minimum transaction lots. The proposed model is a bi-objective programming problem with the objectives of maximizing the terminal wealth and minimizing the cumulative risk over the whole investment horizon. To solve the proposed model, a non-linear S-shape membership function is used to express investor’s satisfaction degree for each objective and then the proposed model is transformed into a single objective mix-integer nonlinear programming problem. A genetic algorithm is designed for solving the proposed mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. A numerical example is given to illustrate the idea of our model and demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed algorithm. The computation results show that the proposed model can express investors’ intention by varying the parameter values of the satisfaction degree.
