                  In non-parametric regression analysis the advantage of frames with respect to classical orthonormal bases is that they can furnish an efficient representation of a more broad class of functions. For example, fast oscillating functions as audio, speech, sonar, radar, EEG and stock market are much more well represented by a frame, with similar oscillating characteristic, than by a classical orthonormal basis. In this respect, a new frame based shrinkage estimator is derived as the Empirical Regularized version of the optimal Shrinkage estimator generalized to the frame operator. An analytic expression of it is furnished leading to an efficient implementation. Results on standard and real test functions are shown.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the literature optimal results for non-parametric regression analysis of low frequency functions have been obtained in orthonormal basis, e.g. see Antoniadis et al. (2001) for a complete review on wavelet estimators; while, for more general functions and for overcomplete dictionaries literature is still growing in different directions: spatially adaptive methods as Hotz et al. (2012) and Portilla et al. (2003), Bayesian methods as Wolfe et al. (2004), variational methods as Candes and Tao (2007) and Chen et al. (1999), to cite only few. This paper proposes another possible direction. The problem is that of recovering a deterministic function

                     . In classical non-parametric regression analysis, reduction of noise is achieved by shrinking or thresholding the empirical frame coefficients. Among these procedures the best linear diagonal estimator is obtained by minimizing the Risk function (i.e. the mean-squared error of time domain data fit), which by the Gauss–Markov theorem is an optimal estimator when noise is Gaussian. The next statement provides its analytic expression. We assume that the vector of frame coefficients

                     -neighbor coefficients. Then, the estimator is an overlapping block shrinkage procedure where the length of the block is automatically decided by the correlation inherits from the frame operator. In De Canditiis et al. (2013) the advantage of considering shrinkage vector of type (5) instead of classical expression of type (6) is widely proved and explored. Finally, note that matrix

The shrinkage estimator proposed in (5) is an oracle estimator since it requires the knowledge of the true function. Hence, in real applications an empirical version of it is proposed. In particular, since

Let us comment on the computational cost of the proposed procedure. STEP I and III cost as a matrix multiplication 
                           O
                           
                              (

                              n
                              )
                           
                        , however, according to the frame choice, these steps can be obtained using fast analysis and synthesis algorithms respectively. In STEP II the most heavy computation is the spectral decomposition of a symmetric 
                           N
                           ×
                           N
                         matrix, which costs 
                           O
                           
                              (
                              
                                 
                                    N
                                 
                                 
                                    3
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                        . However, according to the frame choice, matrix 
                           y
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                           ∘
                           U
                         can have a sparse structure which can be used to improve the computation of its spectral decomposition. It is also worthwhile to observe that ERS (11) has an analytic closed form expression which can be advantageous with respect to a non-quadratic minimization procedure as classically proposed in literature, see experimental results for details.

We consider two classical test functions MishMash and WernerSorrows obtained by Makesignal.m of Wavelab and four functions extracted from different type of real functions, specifically: a speech function, a Glock sound, a EEG and a piece of Mozart’s music, all of which present oscillating characteristic. The six test functions are reported in Fig. 1
                     . We do not adapt the frame choice to each test function, while we fix a frame for processing all of them, moreover we stress that the RDWT frame can be applied to a signal of any length, here we fix 
                        n

All the results are presented in terms of MSE obtained over 100 independent simulated error runs with different SNR. The SNR is defined as the ratio between the standard deviation of the function and the standard deviation of the noise.

                     , the difference being more evident for highest SNR, while for small SNR the difference is on the second or on the third significant digit although it is not so evident from the box-plots for the presence of the others estimators. These results confirm the advantage to applying estimator SURE by the proposed empirical regularization procedure. On the other hand, results show a very poor performance of the Hard estimator, except for function Glock. This exception is due to the presence of the constant part in the true signal, in fact in that part all the other procedures reconstruct a no-constant signal, as it can be seen for ERS in Fig. 6. For which concerns estimators BP and Dan, results confirm that they are very competitive in many cases, however this is true at a bigger computational price. Although the computational cost depends strongly from the routines, at least in this study, we can state that the two shrinkage procedures ERS and

                      require in average the same computational effort; while estimators BP and Dan are more expensive depending on the particular case. In this respect, we have observed in our experimentation that estimator ERS can be computed saving almost 50% of its computational time when the first 
                        M
                      eigenvalues and eigenvectors are evaluated instead of the total spectral decomposition. This observation is based on the empirical evidence that vector

                      is a very good approximation of spectrum

                     . Then it is possible to know a priori how many eigenvalues–vectors are needed to obtain the regularized inverse matrix in Eq. (9). Empirically we have established computational convenience when condition

                        N
                      is verified. For example, in this study, for the last three functions in the case of 
                        SNR
                        =

                      this alternative procedure has been used without loose MSE performance, indeed the ratio 
                        M
                        /
                        N

We stress that all the procedures presented in this section are based on an a priori knowledge of the noise variance and of course this cannot be the case in many practical applications. For that reason we have performed a robustness analysis with respect to an estimator of 
                        σ
                     . In our hypothesis, estimation of noise variance is not straightforward and it can be different according to the type of analyzed function and application. In the speech denoising literature the noise variance is estimated from the preceding silent portion of speech, e.g. see Lim and Oppenheim (1979), while in the EEG application the “device” noise variance is estimated exploiting the spatial covariance of the source electrical activity, e.g. see Van Veen et al. (1997). Here we propose to use the following estimator. Consider the highest-frequency sub-band level decomposition coefficients, denote it 
                        
                           
                              y
                           
                           
                              J
                           
                        
                     . In 
                        
                           
                              y
                           
                           
                              J
                           
                        
                      we expect signal’s contribution to be less significant than noise, moreover noise is not i.i.d. since the corresponding diagonal sub-block of matrix 
                        U
                      denoted

                      represents its covariance. We propose to standardize elements of vector

Finally, it is instructive to quantify the sparseness of the analyzed functions into the chosen frame. Define sparseness degree as the ratio

                      is the reconstruction obtained using the first 
                        S
                      largest coefficients in a given frame. Then sparseness degree of the analyzed functions in the chosen frame are 0.38 for MishMash, 0.18 for WernerSorrows, 0.08 for speech, 0.38 for Glock, 0.18 for EEG and 0.11 for Mozart. They are well represented into the chosen frame, indeed one can compare their sparseness degree to 0.03 which is the sparseness degree of a Gaussian random vector into the same frame. However, the sparseness degrees of the considered functions result pretty small with respect to the sparseness degree of a classical function. For example, Doppler function has a sparseness degree of 0.85 in the chosen frame, but for that function none of the presented frame-based procedures is competitive with respect to the classical orthonormal bases-based procedures neither in terms of MSE neither in terms of computational effort.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Actually the majority of frame based denoising procedures are carried out directly pursuing sparseness on the coefficients. Here a component reduction in the computation of SURE estimator is proposed, it shrinks coefficients without pursuing sparsity on them. Sparsity is implicitly used into the regularization step where only a small number of eigenvalues–vectors are considered. The proposed estimator can be competitive with some of the proposed alternative in literature. Future research is devoted to the improvement of the algorithm based on specific frame structure.
