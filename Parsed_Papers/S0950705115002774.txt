                  This paper presents an extended model of biogeography based optimization (BBO) as opposed to the classical BBO wherein the HSI value of a habitat is not solely dependent upon the emigration and immigration rates of species but the HSI value is a function of different combinations of SIVs depending upon the characteristics of the habitat under consideration. The extended model also introduces a new concept of efforts required in migration from a low HSI solution to a high HSI solution for optimization in BBO. Hence, the proposed extended model of BBO presents an advanced optimization technique that was originally proposed by Dan Simon as BBO in December, 2008. Based on the concepts introduced in our extended model of BBO and its mathematics, we design a two – phase anticipatory system architecture for intelligent preparation of the battlefield which is the targeted optimization problem in our case. The proposed anticipatory system serves a dual purpose by predicting the deployment strategies of enemy troops in the battlefield and also finding the shortest and the best feasible path for attack on the enemy base station. Hence, the proposed anticipatory system can be used to improve the traditional approaches, since they lack the ability to predict the destination and can only find a suitable path to the given destination, leading to coordination problems and target misidentification which can lead to severe casualties. The designed system can be of major use for the commanders in the battlefield who have been using traditional decision making techniques of limited accuracy for predicting the destination. Using the above natural computation technique can help in enabling the commanders in the battlefield for intelligent preparation of the battlefield by automating the process of assessing the likely base stations of the enemy and the ways in which these can be attacked, given the environment and the terrain considerations. The results on two natural terrain scenarios that of plain/desert region of Alwar and hilly region of Mussourie are taken to demonstrate the performance of the technique where the proposed technique clearly outperforms the traditional methods and the other EAs like ACO, PSO, SGA, SOFM, FI, GA, etc. that have been used till date for path planning applications on satellite images with the smallest pixel count of 351 and 310 respectively. For location prediction application, the highest prediction efficiencies of the traditional method on Alwar and Mussourie was only 13% and 8% respectively as compared to the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this modern warfare era, it has become necessary to have the ability to anticipate the likely actions of the enemy’s maneuver and the troop mobilization strategies. The ability to accurately predict the deployment strategy of the enemy troops –to identify the most likely location for the enemy to position their forces and finding a feasible route is of critical importance to the commanders in the battlefield [38]. To understand and simulate the best available routes for attacking the enemy forces and to predict the ability of the enemy to position forces and mount attack, this paper has put forward natural computation algorithm. Natural computing refers to computational processes observed in nature and human designed computing inspired by nature.

ACO, PSO, BBO, Swarm intelligence, and artificial neural networks are some of the techniques under natural computation. For our military application, we have used the combination of three natural computation techniques of ACO, PSO and BBO, which are all a part of population based optimization. The reason for the selection of these techniques is the versatile and distributive nature of the soft computing techniques of swarm intelligence. The main aim of the work done in this paper is to enhance the decision capability which will enable the commanders in the battlefield to make better strategies to combat the actions of enemy.

ACO is a class of Swarm Intelligence Technique which means it is the study of the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems. It is in the nature of ant colonies to discover and travel upon the shortest from their nest to the food source. This search for the shortest path is based on a heuristic function and update of pheromone values upon each iteration [6]. PSO is a stochastic, population-based computer algorithm for problem solving. It is a kind of swarm intelligence that is based on social-psychological principles and provides insights into social behavior, as well as contributing to engineering applications. The particle swarm optimization algorithm was first described in 1995 by James Kennedy and Russell C. Eberhart [20]. The particle swarm simulates social influence and social learning. A problem is given, and some way to evaluate a proposed solution to it exists in the form of a fitness function. The swarm is typically modeled by particles in multidimensional space that have a position and a velocity. These particles fly through hyperspace and have two essential reasoning capabilities: their memory of their own best position and knowledge of the global or their neighborhood’s best. So a particle has the information to make a suitable change in its position and velocity. BBO, first introduced by Dan Simon in December 2008 [36,37] is a class of biology based optimization technique and is an optimization technique based on the geographical distribution of the biological species. Geographical areas that are well suited for biological species are said to have a high habitat suitability index (HSI). The variables that characterize the habitability are called the Suitability Index Variables (SIVs). SIVs are the independent variables and HSI the dependent variable. The migration of SIVs from bad to good solutions raises the quality of those solutions which is the main mechanism of optimization in the said technique. BBO has been used in a variety of applications one of them being biogeography based land cover feature extraction [31].

In our application, the base stations (habitats, according to the algorithm) that best suit the military purpose of the enemy troops for positioning their forces (depending upon certain influential parameters called the Suitability Index Variables) are assigned high HSI values than the other less suitable stations. Each of the suitable base stations can be considered as a candidate solution to the problem of finding the best suitable base station. High HSI solutions resist change more than low HSI solutions. High HSI solutions tend to share their features (SIVs) with low HSI solutions. Poor solutions accept a lot of new features (SIVs) from good solutions. With probability P
                     mod, we modify each solution based on other solutions. If a given solution is selected to be modified, then we use its immigration rate to probabilistically decide whether or not to modify each suitability index variable (SIV) in that solution. If a given SIV in a given solution S
                     
                        i
                      is selected to be modified, then we use the emigration rates of the other solutions to probabilistically decide which of the solutions should migrate a randomly selected SIV to solution S
                     
                        i
                     . This addition of new features to low HSI solutions may raise the quality of those solutions hence in turn leading to the best solution. This approach to problem solving is basically what is called the biogeography-based optimization that will eventually lead to the best solution which represents the best base station for the enemy troops, in our military application.

Hence, we find the best suitable base station for the enemy (with a very high probability since we have found the most probable solution) to position its forces and mount attack. Having found the destination, now we proceed to find the shortest and the safest path to this base station using a hybrid of the extended BBO technique with the ACO Technique [6] and the PSO [20] techniques. PSO path extraction and ACO path planning algorithm is used for the purpose [9,19]. To make a path more smooth morphological operations are implemented to minimize the effects of shadows, trees and inconvenient areas so that an optimized path can be more quickly planned even in a complex environment by effectively extracting the obstacles and finding the shortest and safest path. Thus, the proposed anticipatory system integrates the process of finding the shortest and the best feasible path to a destination after fixing the most feasible destination. Deciding efficient routes has so far been an intuitive and a cognitive process for the troop commanders. Automated simulation of the terrain (of the war area) and of the available routes, will allow the commanders to understand the implications of the terrain for effective maneuver. When simulated on the enemy’s terrain coupled with the provision for the automated prediction of the enemy base station, the system will help to predict the intents of the enemy’s troop deployment and the ways of attack.

In 1995, Gilson introduced the concept of anticipatory computing in warfield was identified during World War I where ‘the importance of gaining an awareness of the enemy before the enemy gained a similar awareness, and devised methods for accomplishing this’ was realized [8]. This idea of separation between the human operators understanding of system status and actual system status is the basis of the definition of anticipatory computing. One explanation for the considerable time lag between initial identification of the phenomena and maturity of the concept is the degree to which a real problem was perceived [40]. In 1997, the initial push for research and development came from the aviation industry, where there is considerable pressure for pilots and air traffic controllers to develop better situational awareness [18]. This call has arisen with the increased realization that system design is no longer optimized for human operation and, under some conditions, has ‘overstepped the human’s capability to keep track.’ It is perhaps no surprise that the coming of age of the research into situational awareness is closely coupled with the increase in the degree of automation in defense control systems. There are a few works available in this field of anticipatory computing for situation awareness [2], which we modify to suit our purpose of intelligent battlefield planning. Some of which are disaster situation awareness [17], terrorist camps detection [35] and electronic situation awareness [16]. But as such no computing method is available for the prediction of enemy base station directly. The known available methods for the prediction of the enemy base camps are still the conventional methods employed by military which involve manual study of geography of the area and various other factors. Nature inspired techniques have been extensively used in varying applications in related areas like UCAV path planning, supply chain management, bilevel programming with multiple objectives, etc. [42,44,46].

BBO [36,37] is an evolutionary algorithm motivated by the migration mechanisms of ecosystems. In BBO each candidate solution is called as a habitat and is characterized by a habitat suitability index (HSI) which is determined by factors called as the suitability index variables (SIV). Habitats with a high HSI are characterized by greater number of species, lower immigration rate, higher emigration rate and a dynamic species distribution and vice versa for habitats with a low HSI value [25–27]. A good solution is treated as an island with a high HSI and a poor solution indicates an island with a low HSI. High HSI solutions resist change more than low HSI solutions but tend to share their features with low HSI solutions. Poor solutions accept a lot of new features from good solutions. This addition of new features to low HSI solutions may raise the quality of those solutions. This approach to problem solving is called biogeography-based optimization [36,37]. The theory of biogeography is summarized below [36,37]:
                        
                           [1]
                           Suppose that we have a problem and some candidate solutions characterized by an index which we call as the HSI and is analogous to “fitness” in other population-based optimization algorithms. HSI is determined by factors which we call as the SIVs.

High HSI solutions represent habitats with many species, and low HSI solutions represent habitats with few species however, it is assumed that each solution (habitat) has an identical species curve (with

The concept of SIV mutation is also included in BBO to incorporate the changes in the species count from equilibrium condition and the species count probabilities are used to determine mutation rates. The mutation approach makes low HSI solutions likely to mutate, which gives them a chance of improving. The algorithm for biogeography based optimization is given in Fig. 1
                     . The immigration and the emigration rates are functions of the species count of the habitat and are calculated as given in Eq. (1).

BBO has demonstrated good optimization performance on various benchmark functions as demonstrated in the work by Simon [36,37]. In the original BBO paper [36], it was illustrated that BBO is competitive with other EAs [33]. It could become a popular EA if it continues to improve with additional extensions and modifications (for example, oppositional BBO [7] and blended BBO [25–27]), and if it is applied to additional practical engineering problems (for example, ECG diagnosis [30], power system optimization [34], economic load dispatch [4], satellite image classification [11,31] and ground water exploration [32]).

This section presents the extended form of BBO based on the extended species abundance model of biogeography that we proposed in our papers [10,12] by considering the fact that the characteristics of each habitat vary greatly and hence, comparing all the habitats using the same set of SIVs may be misleading and also may not lead to an optimum solution. This is equivalent to the coefficient of that particular SIV in the solution vector becoming zero. Hence, the HSI value of a habitat is not solely dependent upon the emigration and immigration rates of species but it is a function of different combinations of SIVs depending upon the characteristics of the habitat under consideration as detailed and discussed in our papers [10,12].

Let the problem dimension be t. Now, t is constant for all solutions. The number of decision variables is equal to t for all solution vectors which is analogous to SIVs. We define HSI as the function of SIVs i.e.

                     The SIVs which are not applicable for the given habitat is removed during the calculation of HSI by making the coefficient of those SIVs in the solution vector as zero. For the purpose, we calculate the factor of relevance of a particular SIV in the HSI calculation on different habitats and eliminate the SIVs for which the relevance factor value is below 50%. This will be useful when we consider the problem of finding the best suited destination enemy base station on different terrain types such as plain or a desert region and mountainous region since some SIVs may be more relevant on a plain/desert terrain and may not be applicable for a hilly terrain and vice versa.

Also, the contributions of each SIV for the HSI calculation may be different for different habitats (representing different terrain types in our case) and hence the HSI function may change dynamically depending upon the type of terrain under consideration and its characteristics. This is well modeled through the factor α that is added in the HSI calculation for a given habitat. The factor α is also called the weight assigned to each SIV in the HSI calculation for a given habitat.

In the initial stage of the algorithm, number of species=number of candidate solutions to the problem and each of these solutions are put in the universal habitat. We also consider an isolated habitat with zero SIVs. This habitat represents the state of no solution in the initial stage of the algorithm. We also construct a standard habitat which is analogous to an ideal solution with ideal characteristics. This habitat is called the feature habitat and consists of the collection of standard SIVs (or ideal SIVs). The feature habitat is used for comparison with the candidate solutions in the universal habitat. Next, we calculate the HSI of the feature habitat based on its SIVs and hence calculate the ideal HSI value (SIVideal) and the threshold HSI value (SIVthreshold).

Now calculate the HSI for the candidate solution based on its SIVs based on the corresponding HSI formula and compare the HSI of the habitat (base station) with the threshold HSI. The threshold HSI denotes that the candidate solutions of the Universal habitat can only be made feature habitat after migration if their HSI falls within this range (i.e. it is greater than the threshold HSI). If the HSI is greater than the threshold HSI value, then find out the SIVs to be migrated and the effort required for migration using the weights assigned to those SIVs (on a scale of 1–5). Probabilistically use immigration and emigration to modify the non elite solution by immigrating the ideal SIVs of the feature habitat that match with the SIVs of the candidate input solution of the universal habitat to the universal habitat & emigrating the SIVs of the candidate input solution that do not match with the ideal SIVs of the feature habitat from the universal habitat to the isolated habitat. This is the effort required in migrating the SIV’s during the computation for the selection of the best solution and is measured by the difference in ideal and actual SIV values for each SIV multiplied by its weight to calculate the effort required in making a particular solution to become an ideal solution. If the amount of effort required is infinite or very large, then this solution will never be able to become an ideal solution as it does not satisfy the threshold condition for HSI. We calculate the effort required for each candidate solution by using Eq. (5).

This input solution will not be considered further and is removed from the Universal habitat. Repeat the steps for each of the candidate solutions in the Universal Habitat. Next, calculate the selectivity factor for the remaining solutions in the Universal Habitat. We define the term selectivity factor which is the factor which determines the selectivity of the candidate solution to be chosen as the best solution. The solution which has the highest selectivity factor is most likely to be the best solution and hence at the end of the processing by our algorithm, this candidate solution will be the one which will be anticipated by the system to be considered as the best solution. To calculate the selectivity factor, we subtract the threshold HSI value from the candidate base station’s calculated HSI value and then divide it by the effort as below

This section presents our proposed two-phase anticipatory system design. The section is further divided into four subsections wherein the first section gives some important relevant definitions for the first and the second phase of the anticipatory system, the second section presents the two-phase anticipatory system architecture. The third section presents the functional architecture of the two-phase anticipatory system and the algorithms for both the phases. The fourth section gives the mathematical formulation of the anticipatory system which takes as input the candidate base stations and gives as output the best feasible destination base station and the most suitable path of attack.

We now identify some important relevant definitions of the parameters originally proposed by Dan Simon [36,37] which have been modified to suit our purpose of enemy base station prediction and thereafter finding the most feasible path of attack [9,13,36,37]. These parameters define the preprocessing steps of the two-phase anticipatory system design. Following are some important relevant definitions of the parameters and the details of the other concepts used in the design of the proposed anticipatory system [13].

In accordance with the problem statement and the expert knowledge of the military domain, the following SIV’s are taken into consideration for deciding the HSI for the Base Stations. Each of these factors are weighted on a scale of 1–5 where 1–5 are decoded as below depending upon their values in the ideal and the actual scenario.

                                 Transportation network availability (N). The more the accessible the area is with respect to transport facilities, the greater are the chances of it being selected as the probable base station for the enemy to position their forces since the transportation of logistics and mobile forces would be easier. In case of a mountainous region, the ease of deployment of air traffic is a major factor in the consideration of the most likely base station of the enemy since the areas which are nearby to an airfield network are more suitable for Air lifting of forces such as para-commandos and launching of aircrafts and are also favorable for the replenishment of arms and ammunition. Hence, the transportation network availability should be high in order for a base station to be selected and hence, HSI is directly proportional to N (

                                 Enemy and firepower range constraints (F). Firepower range is a constraint since an enemy’s base station has an arc of influence within which the arms and ammunition are effective on the war theater. The enemy’s base station which has more firepower range is more probable for being selected by the enemy as their base station. Hence, HSI is directly proportional to the enemy’s firepower range constraints

                                 Concentration of enemy stores & logistics (L). Concentration of logistics like ammunition & communication equipments, tanks, missiles, boffer guns & other strategic assets play an important role in the selection of the destination base station. The more the concentration of logistics in a particular area, the more is that candidate base station likely to be the enemy’s base station for positioning their troops. Hence, HSI is directly proportional to L

                                 Ease of setting up forward base stations and maintaining all-time, all-weather connectivity with the headquarters (C). Better connectivity with the neighboring areas is a desirable factor in the selection of a base station as the destination base station.

                                  can be measured by analyzing the evenness of the area. This can be determined by considering the neighboring area of the small area taken into consideration at a time. If the neighboring area was of similar height than the area was considered even. The levels were decided by considering the percentage of area (around the area under consideration) that is even. Table 1

                                 Enemy’s ability to influence the friendly base stations (I). Enemy’s ability to influence the friendly base station is also an important factor while considering the location suited for the enemy to position its forces. The areas that are geographically located in areas where the enemy can get an indepth access into the territory of the friendly forces is more suitable to be chosen. Hence,

                                 Aspect (direction/angle) (H). Aspect can be measured in terms of alignment of the area under consideration. The area which is more vertically aligned towards the enemy is more suitable for becoming the likely base station for the enemy troops deployment since it can act as a natural shield for them. The aspect can be categorized in the range of 0–360 degrees at an interval of 45 degrees as 0–45, 45–90, 90–135, 135–180, 180–225, 225–270, 270–315, 315–360 degrees. Based on these categories the scales for I can be classified as given in Table 2

                                 Enemy,s ability to counter maneuver and counter deployment of troops (A). The enemy’s ability to counter-maneuver can be measured by the area covered under slope. More is the area covered under slope the greater is the probability of locating a base station there since the visual access improves on such regions. In mountainous regions, this area under slope plays a major role since more is the area under slope, more is the dominating height ground and hence more suitable for setting up of a base station. The area covered under slope can be classified into subcategories as: less than 5%, 6–10%, 11–16% and greater than 16% are covered under slope. Hence,

                                 Areas of Strategic importance (G). The areas which are strategically important for the enemy troops are more likely to be selected. An area can be of strategic importance for the enemy to select it as the base station if it gives in depth access into the friendly base station’s territory. These are also the areas where the enemy can retrieve strategically important statistics through geo-stationary satellite observations and such strategically important areas are more suitable for the setting up of a base station. The strategic importance of an area is measured in terms of the elevation of the area which can be calculated through the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) values by fixing ranges on a scale of 1–5. However, since a region with lower elevation is more desirable, hence,

                                 Perception of enemy strengths, weaknesses and intent (P). Ability to perceive the enemy’s intents is a measure of the cognition of the commanders in the battlefield. This factor is an important factor which indicates the enemy’s ability to anticipate the manoeuver and locate their most probable location and accordingly position themselves at alternate positions. In other words, the perception ability of the enemy is an important factor in the choice of the destination base station. Hence, the base station which provides relatively lower perception of enemy strengths and weaknesses is more likely to be selected by the enemy and hence,

Each SIV is assigned a weight value according to its priority place in deciding the best location for the enemy to position themselves. SIV’s are assigned equal weights if they have the same role and equal priority in deciding the location. The weights assigned to each of these factors are as given in Table 6
                         below (based on military inputs).

                              ) is a vector of m integers that represent a feasible base station for the enemy. A Habitat Suitability Index HSI: H→R is a measure of the goodness of the solution that is represented by the habitat. In our algorithm, we first calculate the HSI of the ideal base station and then for the other candidate base stations using the formulation derived in (7) which has been derived from the interpretation of military data and by analyzing the results of a statistical survey of the military camping areas.

It is to be noted that in Eq. (7), the weights α and the power θ of each SIV x is taken as unity. However, depending upon the factor of relevance of each SIV to a given terrain, the value of α may be fixed as 1 or 0 to include or exclude the SIV from HSI calculation.

                              Required effort: We also define a variable called Effort which calculates the amount of effort required in migrating the SIV’s during the computation for the selection of the most probable base station which enemy is likely to choose and in our case, this is the destination base station which the second phase of the algorithm takes as input. We calculate the effort for each base station using Eq. (5).


                              Ideal base station: We define the term ideal base station which is the base station which is the collection of ideal values of each SIV under consideration. The ideal SIV values are determined by a statistical data analysis and through the expert knowledge in the military domain. These values are then normalized so that they range on a scale of 1–5. The HSI calculated for this base station is also ideal and used for comparison in the algorithm.


                              Threshold HSI: is defined as the minimum HSI value which makes the input/candidate base station an eligible candidate for the further consideration in the algorithm for the choice of the destination base station. If the HSI value for the input base station is less than the threshold HSI, then the base station is rejected without proceeding further in the algorithm because this base station cannot be an enemy base station.


                              Selectivity factor: We define the term Selectivity Factor which is the factor which determines the selectivity of the candidate base station to be chosen by the enemy as their base station. The base station which has the highest selectivity factor is most likely to be chosen by the enemy and hence at the end of the processing by our algorithm, this candidate base station will be the one which will be anticipated by the system to be considered by the friendly troops as the enemy base station and the destination base station for the next phase of the algorithm to begin with. To calculate the selectivity factor, we subtract the threshold HSI value from the candidate base station’s calculated HSI value and then divide it by the effort as in Eq. (6).

                               is a group of n habitats. The size ‘n’ of an ecosystem is constant. Here ‘n’ is the No. of candidate base stations of the enemy which are put in the universal habitat plus one standard habitat with ideal SIVs for matching in order to find the best solution; which is called the feature habitat, since it contains all the features which are required in the destination base station.

In our research, we demonstrate the performance of our proposed extended BBO model for designing an anticipatory system which anticipates the most suitable destination base station for the enemy troops to position their forces and also finds the shortest and the best feasible path of attack on it. We have proposed the implementation of the two-phase anticipatory system wherein the first phase is the automated prediction of the deployment strategies followed by the enemy troops in warfare coupled with the prediction of the shortest and the safest route for attack on the enemy which forms the second phase of our anticipatory system. In the second phase of the anticipatory system design, we integrate the proposed model with the Particle Swarm Optimization technique and the Ant Colony Optimization technique for the computation of global thresholds and the detection of the shortest path respectively. The system architecture of the two-phase anticipatory system based on the extended BBO model is shown in Fig. 3
                        .

In the original BBO, the HSI of a habitat is determined by the immigration and emigration rates solely. The habitats with a high HSI value are characterized by a high immigration rate and habitats with a low HSI are characterized by a high emigration rate. However, the above HSI calculation does not take into account the population evolution and extinction rates which play a significant role in the determination of the species count on a habitat at a given time instant as proposed in our papers [10,12] and as explained in the previous section.

We have implemented the extended BBO model combined with the ACO2/PSO technique for the purpose of two-phase anticipatory system design. The generic functional architecture of our Two-phase Anticipatory System is given below in Fig. 4
                         and is explained layer by layer next. The procedures in each of the layers are necessary as each one performs a specific functionality to add sophistication to the proposed model of our anticipatory system. The first phase of the anticipatory system begins by taking as input the set of candidate base stations feasible and initializes the universal habitat, feature habitat and the isolated habitat which contain the set of candidate base stations, ideal base station and rejected base stations respectively in the Universal Habitat Initializer Layer. Habitat Suitability Index Function Calculation Layer is then used for dynamic HSI function modeling based on terrain characteristic analysis and using the relevance factor for HSI definition and then calculating the HSI values for each candidate base station based on the chosen HSI function definition. This layer also calculates the ideal and threshold HSI values. Next, Threshold HSI based Selective Base Station Elimination Layer is used to eliminate the base stations which have their HSI values lower than the threshold value and migration efforts are calculated for the remaining base stations in the Universal habitat. Selectivity Factor Analyzer Layer is then used to compare the selectivity factor of these remaining base stations in order to choose the one with the highest value which is the output of the first phase in the Destination Base Station Assignment Layer. The second phase takes as input the friendly base station and the destination enemy base station as output by the second phase. The Ecosystem Initialization Layer initializes a new ecosystem consisting of universal, local and global feature habitats corresponding to local and global best positions in the current iteration of the path planning algorithm. Path Extractor Layer is used to initialize random positions and HSI calculation based on which local and global feature habitats are updated and universal habitat’s position and velocity values are updated. Next, based on the histogram analysis of the agents’ pixel DN values, the Global Threshold HSI Computation Layer calculates the local and global best values. The value of global best position is called as the threshold HSI which is then used by the Obstacle Detection Layer to categorize the obstacles. Next, a binary image is obtained where the obstacles and the accessible pixels are clearly distinguished and further morphological operations are applied in the Path Refinement Layer for smoothening of the image. Next, a shortest path is planned using the ACO technique and effort and selectivity factor values are calculated in the Path Planning Layer. The path with the highest value of selectivity factor is chosen as the safest and shortest path which is then output as the best feasible path of attack. The detailed architecture is explained layer by layer below:


                        (i) First phase of the Anticipatory System
                     

The first phase of the anticipatory system is used to predict the deployment strategies of enemy troops by predicting the location of the enemy base station for positioning their forces [9]. The input to the phase is the set of suitable base stations for the enemy to position its forces and the output is the most probable enemy base station detection. The functional architecture for the first phase of our model based on extended BBO for enemy base station prediction is detailed next.


                        Assumptions:
                        
                           
                              [1]
                              Initially it is considered that there exists a Universal habitat consisting of all the candidate base stations.

It has been assumed that the SIVs migrate between the Universal habitat, Feature habitat and the isolated habitat.

All the candidate base stations are considered exactly once.

At the completion of the algorithm we get a base station that is best suited as the destination base station.


                        Input/output layer. This layer is used to input the set of candidate base stations suitable for the enemy to position its forces and mount attack and output the best feasible base station for the enemy troops to mount attack.


                        Ecosystem initialization layer.This layer is responsible for the initialization of the ecosystem comprising of the Universal habitat, feature habitat and the isolated habitat.
                           
                              (a)
                              
                                 Universal habitat initiator. This layer is responsible for initializing the set of species which correspond to the set of candidate solutions to the problem in the Universal habitat. The No. of species in the Universal habitat is equal to the No. of candidate solutions to the problem. In our system design, the universal habitat is initialized with the set of suitable base stations for the enemy to position its forces. Hence, we put the set of the above base stations in the Universal Habitat.


                                 Isolated habitat constructor. This layer is responsible for isolated habitat construction and initialization. The isolated habitat represents the state of no solution in the initial stage of the algorithm. Hence, in our system design, we initialize the isolated habitat with zero SIVs.


                                 Feature habitat constructor. The feature habitat represents a standard habitat is constructed which is analogous to the ideal solution. The feature Habitat is used for comparison with the candidate solutions in the Universal Habitat.

In our case, it consists of the collection of Standard SIVs (or ideal SIVs) on the basis of historic and intelligence data obtained through a statistical survey of the area, the parameters (SIVs) of which were defined in sections before. The feature Habitat is used for comparison with the candidate base stations in the Universal Habitat.


                        Habitat suitability index function calculation layer. This layer is responsible for calculation of the HSI function value for each of the habitats using the appropriate HSI function applicable depending upon the habitat characteristics. Also, the ideal and the threshold HSI are calculated in this layer. The subunits that are categorized under this layer are described in detail next.
                           
                              (a)
                              
                                 Terrain characteristic analyzer. The HSI function used depends upon the characteristics of the habitat under consideration. In other words, the HSI function for each of the base stations in H
                                 
                                    u
                                  will depend upon the type of terrain under consideration since the SIVs which are applicable on a particular terrain may not be relevant for the other types of terrain. Hence, this layer analyzes the terrain under consideration for the decision about the applicable HSI function. In our case, we have taken up two case studies one, is that of a plain or a desert region (Alwar region in Rajasthan) which have similar characteristics from the viewpoint of base station location prediction, and the other, is of mountainous/hilly region (Mussourie region in Himachal Pradesh).


                                 Factor of relevance adjustor. Based upon the terrain characteristics, we define the HSI for each of the base stations in the universal habitat. This layer models this phenomenon through the factor of relevance adjustor by calculating the factor of relevance of a particular SIV in the HSI function calculation. The SIVs which are less relevant are eliminated from the HSI function of Eq. (3). In our case, the SIVs which have their factor of relevance value, 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             f
                                          
                                          
                                             r
                                          
                                       
                                       <
                                       0.5
                                    
                                 , are eliminated. The value 0.5 is a logical value chosen based upon the quality of solution required, the factors which have less than 50% relevance to the particular terrain are those which can be removed from consideration without affecting the search for the best base station (fixed based on military inputs). Hence, depending upon the habitat characteristics, the HSI function gets modified since some SIVs get eliminated.


                                 HSI function modeler. Since, the HSI function is not a fixed function of SIVs and changes dynamically, the function chosen for HSI calculation may vary for each base station in 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             H
                                          
                                          
                                             u
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                  and hence this layer models the HSI function. To model this phenomenon for our system design, we define two HSI functions depending upon the value of H, where H is the enemy’s ability to counter-maneuver or counter deployment of troops which in turn depends upon the Aspect (Direction/Angle) of the area under consideration. If the value of H is less than 3, we use the first function else the second. The value of 3 is the threshold for the angle which is defined as cos (π/2 
                                    
                                       ×
                                    
                                  H) and will be negative in the second case and thus the two equations are formulated as given in Eq. (7).


                                 Ideal HSI calculator. This layer is responsible for calculating the HSI of the feature habitat based on its SIVs and hence calculating the Ideal HSI value (SIVideal) using a similar procedure as above.


                                 Threshold HSI calculator. This layer is responsible for calculating the threshold HSI value. We calculate the threshold HSI value in our system design by taking one-third of the ideal HSI value (based on military inputs). The threshold in our case has been fixed to this value for simplification and the best result with highest selectivity factor value has been taken as output in the first iteration only however, the threshold may be varied to allow the algorithm to proceed iteratively until it converges to the best solution indicated by an acceptable selectivity factor value out of the obtained ones as is done in the standard BBO algorithm. This will be the iterative procedure incorporating all the features of standard BBO however, the one discussed in the paper is a close representation of the original BBO and incorporates all essential features which are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed anticipatory system.


                        Threshold HSI based selective base station elimination layer. This layer is responsible for elimination of the candidate base stations which do not satisfy the threshold HSI condition. The subunits under this layer are:
                           
                              (a)
                              
                                 Threshold HSI condition applier. This layer compares the HSI of the habitat (in our system design, candidate base station) with the threshold HSI. The threshold HSI denotes that the candidate base stations of the Universal habitat can only be made feature habitat after migration if their HSI falls within this range i.e. it is greater than the threshold HSI.


                                 Weighted HSI function modeler. If the HSI value of the base station under consideration is greater than the threshold HSI value, then this layer finds out the find out the SIVs to be migrated and the effort required for migration using the weightsassigned to those SIVs (on a scale of 1 to 5). This is how this layer models the concept proposed in our extended BBO that the contributions of each SIV for the HSI calculation may be different and hence the HSI function should reflect this phenomenon. This is well modeled through the factor α that is added in the HSI calculation for a given habitat in Eq. (4). The factor αis also called the weight assigned to each SIV in the HSI calculation for a given habitat.


                                 Migration efforts calculator. This layer models the factor α in the migration efforts calculation for the choice of the best suited enemy base station amongst the remaining base stations in H
                                 
                                    u
                                 . We probabilistically use immigration and emigration to modify the non elite base station by immigrating the ideal SIVs of the feature habitat that match with the SIVs of the input base station of the universal habitat to the universal habitat & emigrating the SIVs of the input base station that do not match with the ideal SIVs of the feature habitat from the universal habitat to the isolated habitat. This is the effort required in the migration of SIVs to and from the universal habitat which can be calculated from the formula in Eq. (5). If the HSI is less than the threshold, transfer the SIVs of this base station to isolated habitat. This base station will not be considered further and is removed from the Universal habitat. We repeat the steps above for each of the candidate base stations in the Universal Habitat. This step forms the main mechanism of the proposed system since a base station which might appear as a near-ideal combination of SIVs may require a very large effort value to make it an ideal solution and hence its feasibility of selection will be zero. This may reflect upon the advantage of the proposed algorithm over the straightforward Euclidean distance calculation using traditional method.


                        Selectivity factor analyzer layer: This layer calculates and analyzes the selectivity factor for the remaining candidate solutions in our case, base stations, in the Universal Habitat.
                           
                              (a)
                              
                                 SelectivityFactorCalculator: This layer calculates the selectivity factor for the remaining base stations in H
                                 
                                    u
                                  using the formula given in Eq. (6). In our case, these are the set of left over base stations, one among which will be the most likely enemy base station and the output of the first phase of the 2-phase anticipatory system algorithm.


                                 SelectivityFactorComparator: This layer is responsible for comparing the selectivity factor of all the base stations so that the base stations with high selectivity factors can be sidelined.


                                 MaximumSelectivityFactorSelector: This layer selects the base station with the highest selectivity factor.


                        Destination base station assignment layer: The base station with the highest selectivity factor is the most suitable base station for the enemy troops for their deployment and this layer assigns this base station as the destination base station for the friendly troops to mount attack on.


                        (ii) Second phase of the anticipatory system
                     

The algorithm for finding the shortest as well as an obstacle free i.e. best feasible path of attack from the friendly to the destination enemy base station is the second phase of the anticipatory system. The algorithm begins by the obstacle detection and path extraction of image procedures by automatically categorizing all pixels in the image into roads, forest, barren land, water bodies and settlements [19,39]. Next, we extract the paths from image using PSO algorithm. To do this, appropriate threshold values have to be computed and then segmentation is performed [19]. Now, obstacles have to be avoided and we need to reach the goal through the shortest path for which we use the ACO technique [6,19,39]. The algorithm in this phase is a hybrid of ACO, PSO and bases itself on extended BBO concepts. The reason for the selection of ACO and PSO for the purpose of path finding and obstacle detection is that the performance of ACO on this application far outperforms BBO which may be well suited for classification applications but is less competent over path planning application as ACO demonstrates a faster convergence speed than BBO [1,15,19]. PSO is used for the purpose of obstacle avoidance by calculating global threshold values and applying morphological operations thereafter. However, BBO remains to be the basic framework of design for these algorithms in our proposed system. The steps followed in the algorithm are explained in detail layer by layer below.


                        Input/output layer: This layer is used to input the friendly base station and the best suited enemy base station obtained as the output of the first phase and output the shortest and the safest path for attacking the enemy base station.


                        Ecosystem initialization layer: This layer is responsible for the initialization of the ecosystem comprising of the Universal habitat and the feature habitat.

                                 Universal habitat initiator: This layer is responsible for initializing the set of species which correspond to the set of candidate solutions to the problem in the Universal habitat. The No. of species in the Universal habitat is equal to the No. of candidate solutions to the problem. In our system design, this layer initializes a Universal habitat consisting of a set of random positions from the source to the destination base station also called as the species (population)

                         as the threshold HSI value, HSIthreshold to be used as input for the obstacle detection layer. For calculation of the global threshold (average), this layer uses the PSO algorithm.

                                 Histogram analyzer: To obtain the desired results, this layer plots the histograms of several of the scenes in the database containing Objects, for analysis. Based on the observations, the histogram is divided in five main regions. Region I starts from the lowest intensity values to half of the midway of average intensity. For most of the cases, the intensity values on this region cover water bodies. Region II covers intensities that go from approximately half of the midway of the average intensity to midway of average intensity, and typically covers trees.

Region III goes from midway of average intensity, to average intensity and covers bright gray objects such as highways. Region IV goes approximately from average intensity to midway of highest intensity and generally covers bright objects like buildings, road dividers, etc. Region V goes approximately from midway of highest intensity to highest intensity and generally covers barren land [19,39].


                                 Local feature habitat calculator based on agent modeling: In this layer, a numerical simulation model based on agent modeling is devised for calculation of the local feature habitat value. To evaluate the threshold values, we create ten agents which scan their respective regions assigned to them from the image. Every agent scans the image row wise to find local best values for each row.


                                 Global feature habitat estimator: This layer is responsible for estimating the global best value. For the purpose, every agent scans the image row wise to find local best values for each row and eventually evaluates the global best for the assigned region. Among these regional global bests the agents select the most suitable candidate solution by communicating with each other. This is known as the Threshold value or the Global best (global feature habitat value).


                        Obstacle detection layer: This layer is responsible for calculating the threshold value (global best) which is used in the image to extract the paths as accessible area (barren area) and obstacles (like vegetation, water, rocky area etc.). This corresponds to converting the satellite image into a binary image in which 0 (black=0) predicts inaccessible area and 1 (white=1) predicts the paths. For the purpose, we proceed as detailed next.

                                 Global feature habitat as threshold HSI assignor: This layer assigns the value of

                                  as the threshold HSI value, HSIthreshold for the obstacle detection step.


                                 Obstacle categorizer: This layer is responsible for categorizing the paths as obstacle free or an inaccessible area by using the global threshold HSI value which is the output of the previous layer. The pseudo-code for the obstacle detector is detailed next in Fig. 5
                                 .


                        Path refinement layer: This layer is responsible for refining of the paths obtained as output of the previous layers using morphological operations.

                                 Morphological operations applier: This layer refines the extracted paths using morphological operations. After the extraction of the paths from the output of the previous layer, it is observed that there are some isolated white pixels that correspond to trees, shadows etc. and therefore for further refinement of the paths, we use the morphological operations [19]. Four morphological operations are applied in our system design as given in Fig. 6
                                 .


                        Path planning layer: This layer is responsible for path planning using ACO. After the operations in the previous layers, many possible paths are extracted amidst the cross-country. In this layer, ants are created and randomly initialized from the starting point. They randomly chose different ways of getting to the target. While moving to the target they deposit pheromone, after reaching to the target they retrace their respective paths. The path of the ant which reaches the starting point earliest is considered the shortest. Now the shortest path is obtained. While finding the way to next node they check for the obstacle, if obstacle occurs they choose the next node. Hence, the ants avoid obstacles coming in their way. On the whole, we have the safest and shortest path. The numerical simulation model for this phase is explained next.

where α and β are the tuning parameters for balancing the effects of pheromone τ and heuristics η.


                                 Selectivity factor calculator and comparator: The distance between the current position and the neighborhood is the selectivity factor since here this distance plays the role of the deciding factor in determining the choice of the best path (shortest and the best feasible path) [22,24]. From equation above, the effort factor is calculated for the next nearest node. Then the pheromone is deposited on length (L) covered and the distance covered so far is calculated also called as the selectivity factor i.e. the total distance covered by each ant was obtained according to equation in the pseudo-code above.


                        Best feasible path detector layer: This layer selects the path with the highest selectivity factor which corresponds to the shortest distance among the given paths. The obtained path is the shortest and the safest path.

The functional architecture of the proposed two – phase anticipatory system can be represented mathematically the form of the following equation. The equation presented in Fig. 8
                         is the combined representation of the output of the first and the second phases of the anticipatory system. In the first part of the mathematical equation, the set of candidate base stations suitable for the enemy to position its forces is taken as input and the best feasible base station for the enemy troops to mount attack is the output base station and the corresponding output of the first phase of the anticipatory system. The output of the first part of the equation is Max(c) which is the base station with the maximum value of selectivity factor and also the output of the first part of the equation. The value of Max(c) is expressed in Eq. (14).

                        In the second part of the mathematical equation, the set of friendly base station and the destination enemy base station for the enemy to position its forces is taken as input and the shortest and the safest path of attack for the enemy troops to mount attack is the output path and the corresponding output of the second phase of the anticipatory system. The output of the second part of the equation is Max(i) which is the best feasible path of attack with the maximum value of selectivity factor and also the output of the second part of the equation. The value of Max(i) is expressed by Eq. (15).

Now we evaluate the truth value of the proposed framework on different natural terrain scenarios. For the purpose, we consider two scenarios mainly, plain/desert region and the mountainous region. The reason for choosing the above two scenarios is that the SIVs (factors) under consideration for the choice of the most likely enemy base station for the plain as well as the desert region are the same (concluded from military inputs). Also the weights assigned to each of these SIVs is also equal for both the regions and hence the plain and the desert regions are both considered on equal grounds while proving the proposed framework for our two-phase anticipatory system. The mountainous region is a different scenario since it will have different factors for consideration in making a particular base station more suitable than the other candidate base stations in the hilly region. We also define the SIVs applicable to a base station in each of the scenarios. Thus, we demonstrate the implementation of the newly introduced concepts of migration efforts calculation and dynamically modeling the HSI function in our extended BBO by presenting the implementation results of the two-phase anticipatory system for military application of battlefield preparation on two different terrains that of Alwar area in Rajasthan (Plain/Desert) and that of Mussourie region in Himachal Pradesh (Mountainous/hilly) [22]. The datasets chosen are satellite images taken through LISS-III sensor obtained courtesy of DRDO with candidate stations marked based on military inputs.

For the demonstration of the implementation of our extended BBO based two-phase anticipatory system, we choose the Alwar area in Rajasthan, India (Desert Scenario) of size 472×576 with the ground resolution of 23.5 meters taken through LISS-III sensor (courtesy of DTRL, DRDO) as shown in Fig. 9

This section describes the implementation of the proposed system on the dataset of Alwar where the HSI values for each station is calculated and hence the effort and selectivity factor values based on the proposed extended-BBO model are evaluated. The selectivity factor values are normalized based upon which the decision regarding the best feasible station is taken.

Input/output layer: We input the set of candidate base stations suitable for the enemy to position its forces and mount attack [22] on the Alwar image (shown in red in Fig. 9).

Ecosystem initialization layer: In this layer, the ecosystem consisting of the universal habitat, feature habitat and the isolated habitat is initialized.

                                 =10, and we input all the SIV values for each of the base stations as shown in Fig. 10
                                  (based on military inputs).

Isolated habitat constructor: The Isolated habitat is initialized with zero SIVs.

Feature habitat constructor: The feature habitat which represents a standard habitat is constructed which is analogous to the ideal solution. Table 7
                                  fixes the SIVs and the corresponding ideal values on a scale of 1–5 for an Ideal Base station in a Plain/Desert region.

Habitat suitability index function calculation layer: This layer is responsible for calculation of the HSI function value for each of the habitats using the appropriate HSI function applicable.

Terrain characteristic analyzer: Since Alwar region is a desert region, some SIVs may not be relevant for the HSI calculation on this type of terrain and hence, the applicable HSI function may be different. We begin with the terrain characteristic analysis wherein we observe that in a plain/desert region, the aspect factor is of less importance since it is the hilly regions in which the choice of the base station location is more aspect-driven, we have not considered the Aspect factor. Also, in a planar region, M
                        
                           F
                         and G are not applicable. Same is the case with A i.e. the area under the slope which is also applicable in case of a mountainous region [22,39].

                              Factor of relevance adjustor: Hence, the above 4 factors have their factor of relevance values f

                                 <0.5 and therefore in the factor of relevance adjustor layer, these SIVs are omitted from the HSI function calculation.

HSI function modeler: In our case, the factor H was eliminated in the factor of relevance adjustor layer and hence, the HSI function becomes fixed since, the parameter governing the dynamic modeling of the HSI function is no longer relevant in a desert scenario. Hence, the HSI function remains the same as in the previous layer and is given by:

Threshold HSI based selective base station elimination layer:
                           
                              (a)
                              Threshold HSI condition applier: This layer compares the HSI of each of the 10 candidate base stations with the threshold HSI value of 9. From the Table 7, we observe that the HSI values for the candidate base stations 3, 5, 6 and 9 being 6.33, 7.56, 8.5 and 5.58 respectively is less than the threshold value of 9 and hence these base stations are preliminarily rejected.

Weighted HSI function modeler: Since the HSI value of the base stations 1,2,4,7,8 and 10 is greater than the threshold HSI value, the effort required for migration will be calculated for these base stations using the weights assigned to the SIVs (on a scale of 1 to 5). Adding weights to the applicable SIVs, the mathematical formula for calculating the effort can be formulated and modified.

Migration efforts calculator: For each of the 6 remaining base stations, the migration efforts is calculated as shown in Table 8
                                  which depicts the HSI, effort and selectivity factor calculations for each of the candidate base stations.

Selectivity Factor analyzer layer: This layer calculates and analyzes the selectivity factor for the remaining candidate base stations in H
                        
                           u
                        . It is this factor which demarcates between good and bad stations based on the amount of effort required for migration and the difference in HSI values of ideal and input base station (Eqs. (5) and (6)). Thus, the selectivity factor values are a reflection of the station fitness and is normalized between 0 and 1 generally.
                           
                              (a)
                              Selectivity factor calculator: This layer calculates the selectivity factor values for the set of left over base stations, one among which will be the most likely enemy base station and the output of the first phase of the 2-phase anticipatory system algorithm. The selectivity factor calculations are shown in Table 8.

Selectivity factor comparator: This layer is responsible for comparing the selectivity factor of all the base stations by means of normalization of our results by considering the normalized value of the selectivity factor for the base station with the highest selectivity factor as 1. After obtaining the selectivity factors for each of the remaining base stations, the remaining base stations normalized selectivity factor’s values are then calculated by calculating their value as a percentage of the highest selectivity factor value. This is done so that the base stations can be categorized into different probability classes and the base stations with high selectivity factors can be sidelined.

We categorize our findings based on the Normalized selectivity factor values into the following ranges as given in 
                                 Table 10
                                 .

                                       Since base station 4 is the base station with the Normalized selectivity factor value as 1, the destination base station is n
                                          =4 and this is the ‘n’ which is also the output to the next phase of the algorithm to begin.

                        (ii) Second phase of the anticipatory system
                     

The next phase is prediction of feasible path to this predicted base station for which a combination of ext-BBO/ACO2/PSO has been used and the corresponding path has been traced in the form of a table. The results of the second phase of the anticipatory system on the Alwar image are described in this section.

Input/output layer: This layer is used to input the friendly base station with coordinates (250,7) and the best suited enemy base station obtained which has coordinates (26, 164) as the output of the first phase. Fig. 12
                         below represents a portion of the Alwar image with the source (friendly) base station and the destination enemy base station marked in red. The destination enemy base station is obtained as the output of the first phase of the two-phase anticipatory system where we obtained the base station numbered as 4 (n
                        =4) as the destination enemy base station. The source base station is chosen to demonstrate the second phase of the anticipatory system.

Global feature habitat estimator: Every agent scans the image row wise to find local best values for each row and eventually evaluates the global best for the assigned region. The global feature habitat calculations for each of the ten agents are represented in Table 11.

Obstacle detection layer: This layer is responsible for calculating the threshold value (global best) which is used in the image to extract the paths as accessible area (barren area) and obstacles (like vegetation, water, rocky area etc.).
                           
                              (a)
                              Global feature habitat as threshold HSI assignor: This layer assigns the value of 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             H
                                          
                                          
                                             g
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                  as the threshold HSI value, HSIthreshold for the obstacle detection step.

Obstacle categorizer: This layer is responsible for categorizing the paths as obstacle free or an inaccessible area by using the global threshold HSI value which is the output of the previous layer.

The paths extracted after applying PSO is shown in Fig. 13
                        , where black area depicts inaccessible area and white depicts the accessible path.

Path refinement layer: This layer is responsible for refining of the paths obtained as output of the previous layers using morphological operations. The image obtained with the paths refined after applying morphological operations is shown in Fig. 14
                         below.

Path planning layer: This layer is responsible for path planning using ACO.
                           
                              (a)
                              Ant position initializer: This layer is responsible for initializing the ants at the starting point wherein they chose random paths from getting to the target.

Effort factor calculator: This layer is responsible for effort factor calculation for the next nearest node. In our system design, we model the effort factor by calculating the HSI function as a function of the shortest distance from the current position to the destination base station which is based on the observation that the destination coordinates is reached when the HSI function or the fitness value of the solution at that step becomes infinity or the shortest distance between the current position and the target becomes zero.

Selectivity factor calculator and comparator: The distance between the current position and the neighborhood is the selectivity factor since here this distance plays the role of the deciding factor in determining the choice of the best path (shortest and the best feasible path). At each step, the neighborhood position with the highest value of selectivity factor is chosen as the next best position. Table 12
                                  presents the table of highest selectivity factor values chosen at each step as the next best position.

Best feasible path detector layer: This layer is the formation of the path with the highest selectivity factor values which corresponds to the safest and the shortest path between the source friendly base station (250, 7) and the destination base station (26, 164) on the Alwar image as shown in Fig. 15
                        .

The second case study for the demonstration of the concepts of our extended BBO for the development of the anticipatory system is the Mussourie area in Himachal Pradesh, India (Mountainous scenario) of size 472×576 with the ground resolution of 23.5m taken through LISS-III sensor (courtesy of DTRL, DRDO) as shown in Fig. 16
                         
                        [22]:


                        (i) First phase of the anticipatory system
                     

Input/output layer: We input the set of candidate base stations suitable for the enemy to position its forces and mount attack [22] on the Mussourie image (shown in red in Fig. 17
                        ).

Ecosystem initialization layer: In this layer, the ecosystem consisting of the universal habitat, feature habitat and the isolated habitat is initialized.
                           
                              (a)
                              Universal habitat initializer: We consider our Universal habitat as consisting of 4n/5 base stations in a mountainous region (since the ratio of No. of base stations in a mountainous region to a plain/desert region is 4: 5 derived from military inputs) as shown in Fig. 17 and input all the SIV values for each of the base stations (based on military inputs) as given by Table 13
                                 . Hence, n
                                 =8.

Isolated habitat constructor: The Isolated habitat is initialized with zero SIVs.

Feature habitat constructor: The feature habitat which represents a standard habitat is constructed which is analogous to the ideal solution. Fixing the SIV’s and the corresponding ideal values on a scale of 1–5 for an ideal base station in a Mountainous/hilly region. (For our study, we chose the Mussourie region in Himachal Pradesh).

Habitat suitability index function calculation layer: This layer is responsible for calculation of the HSI function value for each of the habitats using the appropriate HSI function applicable.
                           
                              (a)
                              Terrain characteristic analyzer: Since Mussourie region is a mountainous region, some SIVs may not be relevant for the HSI calculation on this type of terrain and hence, the applicable HSI function may be different. We begin with the terrain characteristic analysis wherein we observe that in a hilly region, the aspect factor is very important since it is the hilly regions in which the choice of the base station location is more aspect-driven. Also, in a hilly region, M
                                 
                                    F
                                  is also applicable. In a hilly region, a base station is chosen depending upon its strategic importance which is decided on the basis of measuring the elevation of the area under consideration. Ability to counter-maneuver and counter deployment of troops depends upon the area covered under slope which is also applicable in case of mountainous/hilly regions and hence, we consider A as an SIV in case of hilly region.

Factor of relevance adjustor: Hence, the above 4 factors have their factor of relevance values f
                                 
                                    r
                                 
                                 >0.5 and therefore in the factor of relevance adjustor layer, these SIVs are included in the HSI function calculation.

HSI function modeler: In this case, the factor H is included in the factor of relevance adjustor layer and hence, the HSI function becomes dynamic since, the parameter governing the HSI function modeling becomes relevant in a mountainous scenario. To model this phenomenon for our system design, we define two HSI functions depending upon the value of H. If the value of H is less than 3, we use the first function else the second.

Hence,

Hence, we derive the values as calculated in the following table (Table 14). The table also shows which of the two formulae of HSI is applicable on each of the candidate base stations by representing this information in brackets along with the HSI calculation in Table 14.

Selectivity factor comparator: This layer is responsible for comparing the selectivity factor of all the base stations by means of normalization of our results by considering the normalized value of the selectivity factor for the base station with the highest selectivity factor as 1 as described earlier.

We categorize our findings based on the Normalized selectivity factor values into the following ranges as was given in Table 9.
                           
                              (1)
                              Since base station 3 is the base station with the Normalized selectivity factor value as 1, the Destination base station is n
                                 =3 and this is the ‘n’ which is also the output to the next phase of the algorithm to begin.

                                 <0.5, base station 8 is a likely destination enemy base station.

                                 <0.3, base stations 2, 5 & 6 are the least likely base stations for the enemy troops to position their forces.

                                 =0 for base stations 4 and 7, these are not considered as candidate base stations.

                         below represents a portion of the Mussourie image with the source (friendly) base station and the destination enemy base station marked in red. The destination enemy base station is obtained as the output of the first phase of the two-phase anticipatory system where we obtained the base station numbered as 3 (n
                        =3) as the destination enemy base station. The source base station is chosen to demonstrate the second phase of the anticipatory system.

Effort factor calculator: This layer is responsible for effort factor calculation for the next nearest node. In our system design, we model the effort factor by calculating the HSI function as a function of the shortest distance from the current position to the destination base station which is based on the observation that the destination coordinates is reached when the HSI function or the fitness value of the solution at that step becomes infinity or the shortest distance between the current position and the target becomes zero.

Selectivity factor calculator and comparator: The distance between the current position and the neighborhood is the selectivity factor since here this distance plays the role of the deciding factor in determining the choice of the best path (shortest and the best feasible path). At each step, the neighborhood position with the highest value of selectivity factor is chosen as the next best position. Table 17

Best feasible path detector layer: This layer is the formation of the path with the highest selectivity factor values which corresponds to the safest and the shortest path between the source friendly base station (250, 7) and the destination base station (16, 190) on the Alwar image as shown in Fig. 22
                        .

This section presents the performance analysis of both the phases of the proposed two-phase anticipatory system. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed system accurately which integrates three techniques that of extended BBO based on HSI function modeling, the PSO and the ACO2 techniques, we present the performance comparison results of each of the two phases of the anticipatory system separately.

The first phase of the anticipatory system which is used to predict the deployment strategies of enemy troops by predicting the location of the enemy base station for positioning their forces is based on the extended model of BBO [9]. Hence, we compare the performance of the extended BBO with the traditional decision making techniques that have been used till date for anticipating the probable enemy base stations but have shown limited accuracy. Table 19
                         presents the results of the performance analysis of the Extended-BBO technique (first phase) on the datasets of the Alwar and Mussourie regions. From expert knowledge and military inputs, the destined enemy base stations are known to be station 4 and station 3 for Alwar and Mussourie regions respectively. From the results in Table 10 and 15, we know that the proposed extended BBO model for predicting the enemy base station resulted in the 4th and the 3rd base stations as the destination enemy base stations for the Alwar and the Mussourie images respectively which is correct. Traditional decision making involves a simple sum of the factors affecting the fitness function and picking up the one with the near-ideal fitness value. Thus, if the traditional decision making would have been applied, the SIV values should have been added up linearly for each of the candidate base stations and the value that is nearest to the ideal value will be chosen as the output base station. Using the above traditional decision making, the HSI values for each of the candidate base stations for the Alwar and the Mussourie regions is calculated as given by Table 18.

From the above table, the base stations which are closest to the ideal HSI values are 2, 4 and 10 for Alwar and 3 and 6 for the Mussourie region. This means that the traditional decision making technique could not produce refined results since it resulted in more than one (3 for Alwar and 2 for Mussourie) base stations as output. Thus, traditional decision making fails to produce a unique output which is where lies the weakness of this technique. Also, if we model the probability of the selection of the 4th and the 3rd base stations through traditional decision making technique, then the probability of their selection is 1/3rd and 1/2 respectively. In other words, the efficiency of the destination enemy base station prediction of the traditional technique can be written as 33% and 50% for Alwar and Mussourie regions respectively. Also, for the Alwar image, the base stations 2 and 10 which have been outputted as the destination base stations are categorized as ‘Least Likely’ and ‘Likely’ base stations by our proposed system selection with the N
                        SF values as ‘0–0.3’ and ‘0.3–0.5’ respectively. This also is in contradiction to the predictions made by the traditional method and its classification accuracy derived as a percentage of that predicted by the proposed model is only 1/3×((0+0.3)/2)×100 and 1/3×((0.3+0.5)/2)×100 i.e. 5% and 13% respectively. For the Mussourie image, the base station 6 which has been outputted as the destination base stations is categorized as ‘Least Likely’ base stations by our proposed system selection with the N
                        SF value as ‘0–0.3’ and the classification accuracy as 1/2×((0+0.3)/2)×100 i.e. 8%. Also, the secondary outputted base stations 5 and 8 which can be considered as the next closest categorized as ‘Least Likely’ and ‘Likely’ base stations by our proposed system selection with the N
                        SF values as ‘0–0.3’ and ‘0.3–0.5’ and the classification accuracy as 1/2×((0+0.3)/2)×100 and 1/2×((0.3+0.5)/2)×100 i.e. 8% and 20% respectively. From the above discussion, it is reflected that the results of the traditional decision making techniques are imprecise and do not reflect a true suitability index which is reflected by the lower values of normalized selectivity factor range of the base stations outputted by this technique as destination base stations. Moreover, the technique is imprecise as it does not produce a single output and produces multiple base stations as output of the first phase.

The second phase of the anticipatory system which is used to find the best feasible path of attack (the safest (obstacle-free) and shortest) on the enemy base station is based on an integration of extended BBO with the PSO and ACO techniques of path extraction and path planning respectively [6,20]. Hence, we compare the performance of the hybrid technique that we employed with the results obtained by the use of other optimization techniques [15] such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [6], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [20,43] (For details on how PSO is used for path planning application, the reader is referred to the paper [43]), hybrid ACO2/PSO [19], fuzzy inference mechanism [23], genetic algorithms [5,29], etc. that have been used extensively for path planning applications which form the second phase of our anticipatory system. Table 20
                         presents the results of path planning implementation for the Alwar as well as the Mussourie images using the optimization techniques of Ant Colony Optimization [6], Particle Swarm Optimization [20,43], Hybrid ACO2/PSO [19], Stud Genetic Algorithm (SGA) [1,21], Evolutionary Strategy (ES) [3,41], Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) [1], Fuzzy Inference mechanism (FI) [1] and Genetic Algorithms (GA) [14,28]. The figures in the table are the pixel count of the path planned from the source to the destination base station. In other words, it is the distance of the path planned from the friendly to the destination enemy base station by using each of the said optimization techniques on Alwar as well as the Mussourie region. From the table, it can be seen that the proposed extended BBO based hybrid ACO2/PSO technique employed in the second phase produces the lowest pixel count of 351 for Alwar and 310 for Mussourie region when compared to the other techniques of ACO, PSO, hybrid ACO2/PSO, SGA, ES, SOFM, FI and GA that were implemented for the path planning application which produce a pixel count of 352, 358, 363, 361 and 358 for Alwar and 311, 316, 321, 319 and 316 for Mussourie region. This means that the path planned by the proposed technique is the shortest and the safest path of attack on the enemy base station for both the datasets used.

Based on the results of the proposed two-phase anticipatory system, the commanders in the war theater will have an increased battlefield awareness since they can now anticipate the destined enemy base station and can also select the shortest path to attack the enemy base station hence anticipating enemy’s future actions. This will be of prime importance since in the modern warfare strategies, the ability of an army to position it’s troops at an effective geographical location (having predicted the location of the enemy base station), in the shortest possible time, will significantly gain a tactical advantage over the enemy and prove to be the deciding factor for winning. Thus the proposed system is very well suited for anticipating the next action of the enemy – to anticipate the enemy’s deployment strategies and can replace the currently employed traditional decision making techniques.

The proposed hybrid algorithm can be of major use to the military and the commanders in the battlefield as demonstrated in the paper. However, the algorithm can be generalized to fit in commercial applications also, such as in predicting the most suitable location for establishing a manufacturing plant for some industry and thereafter finding the shortest and the safest path for transportation of finished goods and raw materials to and from the manufacturing plant. The algorithm can also be used to predict the best location for exploration of ground water possibilities by taking the ideal features required in it as the feature habitat consisting of the set of ideal SIVs. The set of attributes that comprise of the SIVs are obtained by considering factors such as geology, land form, soil, land use, slope, and linearment, etc. In fact, the algorithm can be generalized in such a way so that it can be used in any application wherein the best suited location and the shortest path for reaching there has to be found out. Thus, the algorithm can be of major use in both military and scientific applications and commercial applications as well.

The proposed work can be further refined by modifying the existing SIVs and the addition of some more SIVs. Addition of new SIVs such as climate/weather conditions; state-liquid (water/petrol), solid (land/mountain), vapor (clouds), gaseous extracts (fog/smog); distance from roads (highways); water transportation modes; air strips supporting landing and flying of aircrafts (various sizes); railway network, land mine prone areas etc.; can help in building of a more versatile anticipatory system. Refinement of present SIVs by the inclusion of factors such as dimension (Height/Length/Breadth), habitat, animals (Friendly/Dangerous), vegetation (Edible/Poisonous/Allergic), surprise Factor, etc. can further refine the anticipatory system to make it more efficient and robust. Couple of factors such as weapon capability and skills of the enemy are certain things which require human interpretation as these cannot be judged by the machine. Also the surprise factor contributes negatively to the comfort factor in other words we can say these are inversely proportional to each other. This would further help in determining additional information aiding in building a very refined anticipatory system that can be of great help in designing of the war/battlefield strategies. Also we can sample the above SIVs round the year to generate very precise and accurate results. Also, in future, the proposed path planning algorithm in the second phase of the two-phase anticipatory system can be compared with new and more sophisticated algorithms like Artificial Bee Colony Optimization [45] to prove its effectiveness over advanced algorithms too.
