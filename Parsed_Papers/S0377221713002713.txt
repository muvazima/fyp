                  This paper proposes a test for whether data are over-represented in a given production zone, i.e. a subset of a production possibility set which has been estimated using the non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. A binomial test is used that relates the number of observations inside such a zone to a discrete probability weighted relative volume of that zone. A Monte Carlo simulation illustrates the performance of the proposed test statistic and provides good estimation of both facet probabilities and the assumed common inefficiency distribution in a three dimensional input space. Potential applications include tests for whether benchmark units dominate more (or less) observations than expected.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This paper introduces a test for whether observed data points are over-represented in certain production zones, i.e. subsets of (input sets of) the production space. The test is based on considerations of the relative volumes of these zones, weighted by probability estimates of observation frequencies. Specifically we consider the number of observations located in a certain zone, relative to the number that could be expected based on its relative weighted volume.

To motivate the need for such a test, consider for example the hypothesis of rational inefficiency put forward by Bogetoft and Hougaard (2003). Given a set of common and known input prices, one might expect all observations to be located close to the cost minimizing input combination if the production units are assumed to be rational. Within the rational inefficiency framework, arguments are made, however, that it is still rational to be located inside the cone dominated by the cost minimizing point since production units may derive utility from the consumption of excess resources, leading to the notion of rational inefficiency. Thus, according to the rational inefficiency hypothesis, one should expect over-representation of data point within this cone. If we further assume that a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) estimated frontier is a good approximation of the true underlying production possibilities, rejection of a test for no over-representation of data points inside the cone dominated by the cost minimizing input combination provides empirical support for the hypothesis of rational inefficiency. In this paper, we will derive such a test based on a Data Generating Process (DGP) suggested in Simar and Wilson (2000).

Another potential use of the proposed test concerns benchmarks in DEA, where the set of undominated observations is typically considered as benchmark units for the inefficient producers. However, not all benchmarks may be equally influential (Thanassoulis, 2001, Chapter 5) and part of the literature on outlier detection uses counts of how many times a given efficient firm enters as part of a benchmark to detect outliers, see e.g. Tran et al. (2010). Such methods undoubtedly provide important information, but to the best of our knowledge no formal test-statistics exist that allow us to test whether a given benchmark unit dominates more observations than what is expected.
                        1
                        Several other outlier detection methods exists which are more remotely related to the approach proposed in this paper. One example is the Wilson (1995) outlier detection based on leave-one-out efficiency.
                     
                     
                        1
                      The test-statistic proposed in this paper fills this gap by allowing a formal test of under/overrepresentation of observations in areas of the input space dominated by frontier facets spanned partly by any of the efficient firms.

Since the proposed test considers the number of points in certain zones relative to the weighted volumes of those subsets of the production space, what we call over-representation could also be viewed as higher (weighted) data density. Empirical investigation of data density can be approached in different ways. Statistical cluster analysis aims at identifying groups or clusters of data points. Parametric cluster analysis (Fraley and Raftery, 1998, 1999; McLachlan and Peel, 2000) is based on the assumption that each group of data points is represented by a density function belonging to some parametric family. The analysis then estimates the number of groups and their parameters from the observed data. In contrast, non-parametric statistical clustering approaches identify the center or mode of various groups and assign each data point to the domain of attraction of a mode. These approaches were originally introduced by Wishart (1969) and have subsequently been expanded on by especially Hartigan (1975, 1981, 1985). Common for the statistical cluster analysis approaches is that they aim at detecting the presence of clusters rather than considering differences in density in pre-specified production zones.

Within the realm of DEA, data density is at least indirectly considered in the recently quite popular bootstrapping approaches (see e.g. Simar and Wilson, 2000). For example, a distinction is made between a homogeneous and a heterogeneous bootstrap, reflecting whether or not it is reasonable to assume that the inefficiency distribution is independent of the choice of output levels and of input mix. Bootstrapping, in this context, analyzes the sensitivity of efficiency estimates to sampling variations of the estimated frontier and is used as a tool for bias correction and statistical inference. Hence, this stream of the bootstrapping literature has focussed on estimating statistical properties of the efficiency estimators.

The focus in this paper is quite different since we aim at getting estimators of the probabilities of being located in pre-specified production zones and to the best of our knowledge no test like the one proposed here, building on such probabilities, has been developed before. Yet, our approach is related to that of Simar and Wilson (2000a) where a density estimation approach combining a bootstrap estimator of a distance function with a general multidimensional Gausian kernel based density estimation is proposed. The test we propose in this paper could alternatively be constructed by specifying an estimator 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 ˆ
                              
                           
                        
                      of the probability of a projected data point being located within a specific production zone from the Simar–Wilson density estimator. Specifically, in principle an estimator 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 ˆ
                              
                           
                        
                      could be provided by plugging the estimator of Simar and Wilson (2000a) into our Eq. (9) in the following.

Compared to the rather complicated and computationally intensive Simar–Wilson density estimator, we propose a more direct approach based on a discrete approximation of the true density, using the facet structure of the DEA-estimation to define discrete areas. The probability related to each of these areas is estimated based on probability estimates on (i) input mix in cones spanned by facets, and (ii) distance function values in certain intervals. It is worth noting that while the Simar–Wilson estimator is consistent, we here through Monte-Carlo simulations only demonstrate that our estimator seems to converge. It is, however, left for future research to explicitly compare these two different approaches for testing over-representation of observations.

To sum up, we derive a binomial test that relates the number of observations inside certain production zones to a discrete probability weighted relative volume of these zones. This is done by considering the ratio between the volume of the zone and the volume of the total production possibility set, where these volumes are weighted by probability estimates of observations belonging to given facets and efficiency levels. The ratios of volumes provide estimates of expected frequencies which are then related to the observed frequencies given as the ratio between the number of observations inside the zone and the total number of observations.

Banker et al., 1984) we impose the following set of maintained hypotheses on the true underlying production technology: Convexity, Ray Unboundedness (constant returns to scale), Strong input and output Disposability and Minimal Extrapolation. Furthermore, we need some additional assumptions on the Data Generating Process (DGP).

                        The use of polar coordinates allows us to specify a meaningful sequence of production decisions, such that the first decision made by the production unit is how much output to produce. Conditioned on this first decision the unit next decides in what proportions to use the various inputs. Finally, conditioned on these two decisions the unit then decides on how much of this composite input bundle to use.

Choosing a small value for α means only ignoring production plans from areas of the production space with low probability
                        3
                        The choice of α should reflect to what extend the analyst needs to ignore input vectors from very inefficient production units in order to avoid including large areas void of observations. In the generated data in Figs. 1, 2, α
                           =0. Hence, all observed input vectors are included in

The various concepts are illustrated in Fig. 1
                     . We have generated 200 data points according to a two-input version of the DGP from the Monte Carlo simulation described in Section 5. An envelopment is provided by 10 facets denoted fj, j
                     =1,…, 10. Two of these facets, f9 and f5, are part of unbounded exterior facets. These two facets are spanned by a CCR-efficient observation and one of the two projected inefficient observations indicated by the two arrows in Fig. 1. Notice that strong disposability is imposed. Otherwise we would not need these two projected inefficient observations included in the set of points spanning the frontier.

If this point was the only cost efficient input combination, and if the rational inefficiency hypothesis was true, then we would expect to see observations concentrated within the intersection of this dominance cone and

As mentioned in the introduction we aim to identify over-representation of data points in certain subsets of the input set, for instance a dominance cone with vertex in an efficient production plan (x′,
                        y′), e.g. a cost minimizing observation.

This is a restrictive assumption, but it allows us to directly use the ratios of volumes as a simple estimator

                           An obvious approach to this problem would be using a resampling strategy to generate information of this sampling distribution for a particular data set. Details of such an approach is left for future research.

Rejecting this null hypothesis in a two-tailed test indicates that the number of observations inside the cone is either too big or too small relative to the volume of the cone. Alternatively, we can formulate a one-tailed test specifically for over-representation.

Finally, it should be noted that the two volumes

                         used in the test depends only on the ratio between the volumes, as given by (11), and the ratio is scale invariant, i.e. the observed data points can be scaled with strictly positive weights without changing

                         is not affinely invariant). Hence, the validity of the test is not affected by the dependence of the units of measurements in the calculation of the volumes.

Where the introduction of the proposed test above relied on the assumption of the observations being uniformly distributed we now, probably more realistically, relax the distributional assumption on the radial efficiency score as well as on the input mix (η). Let us simplify by considering the one output case and assuming a common distribution of the efficiency scores of some parametric form, i.e.

                     Fig. 2
                      illustrates the discretization of the efficiency distribution with I
                     =10 and a DEA envelopment frontier with F
                     =10 facets, denoted fj, j
                     =1,…, 10. The dots represent 200 generated observations and the two dots marked by arrows are two projected inefficient observations located on unbounded exterior facets. Adding these two pseudo-observations to the data set results in a bounded subset of the input possibility set with a lower envelope consisting of points that dominate all inefficient observations among the generated data.
                        6
                        It is necessary to add these two pseudo-observations because otherwise the convex hull of the observations would not provide a lower envelope belonging to an isoquant that is consistent with strong input disposability. At first glance the backward bending envelopes in Figs. 1 and 2 seem to suggest a maintained hypothesis of weak input disposability. But note that the two included pseudo-observations imply that all radial projections will reach the part of the convex envelopment that is a proper subset of the full frontier from a traditional envelopment of data based on strong disposability.

The figure illustrates the situation where we have generated 200 data points according to a two-input version of the DGP from the Monte Carlo simulation described in Section 5. The input mix is uniformly distributed
                        7
                        Note that the use of the uniform distribution to generate data used in Fig. 2 is only for illustrative purposes. The test considered here does not rely on any assumption of a uniform distribution of input mix and/or inefficiency.

                        Note that a uniform distribution of η
                           ∈[0.1,
                           π/2−0.1] of course implies that projected data points on the boundary are more sparse in the specialized regions closer to the axes compared to the regions in the center with η close to π/4.

                      The density of the radial efficiency score in the Monte Carlo simulation is assumed to be a uniform distribution on a support [0.5,1]. 10 intervals are used in the discrete approximation. Note that a uniform distribution of the efficiency scores combined with of a uniform η does not imply that data points are uniformly distributed on some bounded subset of

                      where all inefficient data points are projected onto facets complicates the subsequent use of Qhull to determine facets and volumes. Hence for practical purpose we only project a subset of inefficient points to the facets. To determine which points are needed the following procedure is used.

Project all inefficient observations dominated by points on exterior facets

                        In Figs. 1 and 2, f5 and f9 are part of the two exterior facets which correspond to the assumption of strong input disposability. f5 is, for example, a subset of the exterior facet spanned by the observation just to the left of the label “f5” and the first unit vector. The facets f11 and f12 are clearly not part of the efficient (neither strongly or weakly) frontier in the input space. Facets f1–f4, f6–f8 and f10 are interior facets (the normal vectors for these facets are strictly positive in both components).

                      to the frontier. Inefficient observations dominated by points on interior facets are ignored since they provide no additional information.
                        11
                        These projected points add no information about feasible input combinations. The estimated frontier is piecewise linear and we maintain that any input combination expressed as a convex combination of points spanning an interior facet is a feasible input combination. Hence, adding projected points located in the relative interior of the interior facets will only provide information on feasible input vectors that was already known.

Solve a modified CCR-DEA model evaluating each of the projected data points, where the objective function minimizes the sum of input slacks and the evaluated DMU is excluded from the set of potential peers. We only project DMUs having a strictly positive sum of slacks, i.e.points that cannot be expressed as a convex combination of other projected points or the points in I

It should be noted that the proposed algorithm is well defined and can be performed using a standard LP-solver combined with QHULL, which is sufficient for most data sets. The Monte Carlo studies reported below is performed using a combination of CPLEX (step I, and saving results on files) and a Mathematica code (step II-VI) reading the CPLEX results concerning scores and dominating vertices and calling a QHULL-code for getting the H-representation of each intersection with the bounded cone and each volume calculation.

In this section we use Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed test statistic.

                     =3 ) has been estimated using cross validation (see Daraio and Simar, 2007, Chapter 4; and Silverman, 1986, Chapter 3). The score function is rather flat on the interval [0.1,0.2] for l
                     =3. Hence in the tables we have included results from more than one bandwidth in this interval. The optimal bandwidth for l

Results are presented for the accuracy of the proposed test statistic. The summary statistics and the empirical coverage accuracy of both z
                     31 and z
                     32 with bandwidth equal to 0.2 are behaving reasonably, partly recovering the characteristics of the DGP. Hence, these are the test statistics with the best characteristics. The results in Tables 1 and 2 show that the test statistic z

                     52 shows a nice recovering of the DGP, but as mentioned above this test statistic relies on the use of the true information of the distribution of the scores. Replacing this true information with the kernel based information in z
                     32 with a bandwidth of 0.2 provides a coverage somewhat below the nominal value, which is to be expected because the variance is biased upwards even for a sample size above 150. Fig. 4
                      shows the variance for z
                     32 for increasing sample size and suggests that the variance is indeed biased. Hence the Monte Carlo study seems to suggest (accepting the premises in the form of the assumptions behind the DGP) that when testing H
                     
                        o
                      using z
                     32 we should refrain from rejecting H
                     
                        o
                      at e.g. 5% confidence with ∣z
                     32∣>1.96. Instead we should allow ∣z
                     32∣ to be as extreme as Φ

                      of the standard deviation of the test statistic z seems indeed to be downward biased as expected.


                     Tables 3 and 4 present the summary statistics and coverage accuracy for z
                     32 and z
                     52 for varying sample size and bandwidth. We again see that increasing the bandwidth tends to decrease the variance of z
                     32 towards one. We have also experimented with a kernel estimation of the bias corrected empirical score distribution. These results are not encouraging. The bias correction (Wilson, 2008; Simar and Wilson, 1998) apparently imply a structural over-representation of scores in the lower part [0.5,0.75] of the support compared to the upper part [0.75,1]. As illustrated in Tables A1 and A2 in Appendix B this structural error implies that both the summary statistics and the coverage accuracy are far from being satisfactory. It is beyond the scope of this paper to analyze why the bias correction has this peculiar impact on the kernel based density estimation, and this is left for future research.

This paper has introduced the idea of testing for over-representation of data points in specific production zones. The approach was then operationalized based on discrete approximations of the densities of both the efficiency scores and the input mixes (angles). The test is non-parametric and being ratio-based it is scale (but not affinely) invariant. It relates to estimated technologies using only standard assumptions of convexity, ray unboundedness, strong disposability, and minimal extrapolation. For practical applications the assumption of ray unboundedness (constant returns to scale in production) probably seem limiting, but in fact the DEA literature is full of empirical studies where the constant returns to scale assumption seems justified, at least within a reasonable range of input–output values. Furthermore, well-established theoretical approaches, like the DEA based Malmquist index of productivity change, rely on constant returns to scale (see e.g. Wheelock and Wilson, 1999).

That the practical test procedure in this paper is presented in a multiple input–single output setting alone, is simply for notational and computational convenience. The idea can easily be generalized to the multiple output scenario, but note that the increased dimensionality increases the probabilities of getting thinly populated combinations of facets and slices (for a given sample size), which reduces the strength of the test.

                        While it would be useful to know more about which combinations of sample sizes and dimensionality that would allow the proposed test to provide useful results, this is left for future research.

Several takeaways are available from the Monte Carlo simulation. Based on different choices of both facet probabilities and of probabilities of the discrete approximation to the assumed common inefficiency distribution, we have illustrated the performance of the proposed test statistic. The best estimator of the common inefficiency distribution is apparently the estimator based on a kernel density estimation from the empirical score distribution (denoted

                      is somewhat biased, even for sample sizes above 150 in a three dimensional input space. This result is in accordance with the discussion of the characteristics of the test statistic suggested in Section 2.1. The estimator

                      of the standard deviation of the test statistic z seems to be downward biased as expected. Additional research is needed to analyze this performance and perhaps refine the estimator. The apparent bias of the variance of the best combination of estimators seems to suggest that we should be cautious when testing at a confidence level of e.g. 5% confidence, i.e. we should allow the test statistic to be slightly more extreme than Φ
                     −1(0.95) before rejecting the hypothesis, as explained above in Section 5.
