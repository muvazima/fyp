                  Some manufacturers sponsor “free” retailer gift cards to be given to consumers who purchase their products. These gift cards are paid for by the manufacturer and are redeemable on all products at the retailer. We develop a model of such a supply chain. We analyze cases in which the gift cards’ redemption rate is constant or increasing in gift card value. The results indicate that in addition to the redemption rate and consumers’ valuation for gift card dollars, the profitability of manufacturer-sponsored gift cards depends on the average gross margin of the retailer and the type of purchases consumers make with gift cards. Furthermore, we show that under certain conditions, free gift cards will increase the expected profits of the retailer and manufacturer as well as decrease the retail price of the product. These conditions include a retailer with large average gross margin and consumers using gift cards to purchase products they would not buy with cash otherwise. Furthermore, all consumers, including those who do not redeem the gift card, are more likely to benefit from a reduced retail price when their probability of redeeming the gift card after purchase is equal to their estimated redemption probability at purchase time. We show the conditions under which gift cards are more profitable than cash mail-in rebates. We develop an incentive scheme to improve the performance of supply chains with gift cards.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Consider the promotion shown in Fig. 1
                      where a consumer gets a free $20 Home Depot gift card for buying a Delta faucet from Home Depot for $89 or more. Here, the manufacturer (he) pays for the gift card which benefits both the retailer (she) and the consumers. Fig. 1 also shows a promotion in which consumers get a free $25 gift card for buying $75 or more of Avery products and $10 gift card for buying Proctor and Gamble products. This use of “free” gift cards paid for by the manufacturer and redeemable at the retailer differs from promotions studied in the literature and offered by the retailer or the manufacturer.

Manufacturers and retailers have used various promotional instruments to increase their sales and profits. Manufacturer promotions can be directed at the retailer through incentives, such as rebates (Taylor, 2002) or buybacks (Pasternack, 1985), or directed at consumers through coupons (Anderson and Song, 2004), instant rebates (Caliskan-Demirag et al., 2009), and mail-in rebates (Khouja and Zhou, 2010). Retailers use similar promotions targeted to consumers. Another promotion which has gained popularity in recent years has been the use of “free” gift cards and gift certificates given to consumers by retailers with the purchase of certain products or with purchases of certain amount or larger.

Retailers use gift cards in two ways. The more common way is to sell gift cards to consumers who use them as gifts (Offenberg, 2007). The second way is to use gift cards to increase sales by giving them “free” to consumers who fulfill some requirements, such as reaching a threshold amount in a single purchase (Khouja et al., 2011) or buying a particular product (Khouja et al., 2013). For gift cards given “free” to consumers spending an amount equal to or greater than a threshold, the retailer bears the entire cost of the card. For gift cards given “free” with the purchase of a particular product, the cost of the gift card may be entirely incurred by the retailer or by the manufacturer of the product as shown in the examples of Fig. 1. While the cost of a promotion, i.e. gift cards, can be shared between the manufacturer and the retailer, such as in cooperative advertising models (Seyedesfahani et al., 2010), we are not able to find any examples of sharing the cost of gift cards in industry.

In this paper, we analyze the use of manufacturer-sponsored retailer-issued gift cards in a single-manufacturer single-retailer supply chain. We use a Stackelberg game framework where the manufacturer is the leader, because he pays for and determines the value of the gift card, and the retailer is the follower. This supply chain structure is commonly used in the literature (Esmaeili et al., 2009). Other power distributions where power is equally distributed between the retailer and the manufacturer (Bichescu and Fry, 2009) or the retailer is the leader (Aust and Buscher, 2012) are possible.

We first analyze a decentralized supply chain and then a centralized supply chain to use as a benchmark. In both cases, we analyze supply chain performance under constant gift card redemption rate and a variable rate which is increasing in gift card value. In a decentralized supply chain, we first assume that the manufacturer keeps the wholesale price fixed when introducing the gift card and that the redemption rate of gift cards is constant. We show that under certain conditions, gift cards not only allow manufacturers to pass savings directly to consumers, but also may encourage retailers to reduce the retail price. This decrease in the retail price is more likely to occur when the retailer’s average gross margin, hereafter margin, on products is large, consumers use the gift cards to buy products they would not have purchased with cash, and when their estimates of the redemption probability at purchase time is the same as their actual redemption probability post-purchase. We also analyze in which the manufacturer changes the wholesale price and show that in this case the manufacturer keeps a larger share of supply chain profits and makes twice as much profit as the retailer. Also, for this case, the manufacturer’s average margin increases and on average, consumers are worse off when it is optimal for the manufacturer to sponsor gift cards. In a centralized supply chain, we show that when gift cards are introduced, demand, profit, and retail price increase. In this sense, while the supply chain benefits, consumers may not, especially those who do not redeem the gift cards. Finally, we examine the effects of consumer behavioral inconsistency and a pricing scheme the manufacturer can use to improve the effectiveness of gift cards. We show that an incentive scheme in which the manufacturer imposes a negative relationship between gift card value and the retail price can improve the performance of the supply chain and can ensure that all consumers, the manufacturer, and the retailer are better off with gift cards.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Our analysis draws on both marketing promotions and supply chain management. Since the gift cards are paid for by the manufacturer and are redeemable at the retailer, their effectiveness will be determined by the decisions made by both manufacturer and retailer.

Marketing promotions such as price discounts, coupons and rebates have been extensively investigated (Anderson and Song, 2004; Chen et al., 2005; Dhar et al., 1996; Krishna and Zhang, 1999; Ramaswamy and Srinivasan, 1998). Little work has been done on gift cards. Gift cards given free with purchase of a product and are redeemable in the future can be thought of as a type of delayed incentive because consumers can use them after purchase. In this respect, they are similar to mail-in cash rebates (Chen et al., 2007) as compared to instant rebates (Caliskan-Demirag et al., 2009) where the rebate is given on the spot.

Gift cards have several advantages. When gift cards are given “free” to consumers fulfilling certain requirements, they are similar to cash mail-in-rebates in the sense that they may not create a perception of reduced value of the product like discounts (Folkes and Wheat, 1995). However, the cost of gift card redemption is less than that of rebate redemption because only the cost of goods sold with gift cards is incurred. The second advantage of gift cards is that they can be given by the recipient to another consumer, and thus have the potential of expanding a retailer’s consumer base. A third advantage of gift cards is that some consumers may only redeem part of the card or even not redeem any of it. We refer to this partial redemption as slippage. Consumer Reports reported that 19% of gift cards went unused in 2005 (Wolf, 2007). Finally, a consumer redeeming a gift card may make a purchase of greater amount than the amount of the gift card. In a survey of more than 500 US consumers conducted by Accenture, 45% of respondents said they spend more than the value of the gift card. One estimate of the average spending of consumers beyond the card value is about 20% of card value (Thomas and Dillenbeck, 2004). The above advantages make gift cards attractive for retailers. This is evident from gift cards’ increasing popularity worldwide, and particulary in Europe and Asia, as technological conditions favoring their adoption are being put in place (Vrancart, 2007; Norberg and Horne, 2006).

An important aspect of gift cards is what happens to unredeemed gift cards. For gift cards purchased with cash by consumers, there are three possibilities depending on the location of the retailer. In some states, unredeemed gift cards are treated as abandoned property and the money is taken by the state. In some states, the retailer keeps the money from unredeemed gift cards. Some states have an intermediate policy of taking part of the money from the unredeemed gift cards and leaving the retailer with what would have been her margin if she made a cash sale equal to the value of unredeemed cards. Since the gift cards considered in this paper are given “free” to consumers, we assume that money from unredeemed cards of this type is kept by the retailer.

Another important factor in determining the profitability of gift cards is the type of purchases consumers make using the gift cards. When consumers use the gift cards to make purchases they would have made with cash in the future, i.e. gift card substitute for cash in future regular purchases, gift cards become less effective. We refer to the reduction of future cash sales due to gift cards redemption as the future cash sales offset. In the survey conducted by Accenture, 56% of respondents stated that when redeeming gift cards, they buy themselves something they would not normally buy. We anticipate that gift cards are most effective for a retailer when consumers use them to buy products they would not buy without gift cards or to buy products they would buy with cash at another retailer.

Due to the newness of gift cards, research on their use has been limited. Khouja et al. (2011) developed a model in which gift cards are given free to consumers whose purchase amounts exceeds specific thresholds. Khouja et al. (2013) analyzed the use of free gift cards by a retailer to sell excess inventory of a product in the newsvendor model. Some related models examining the use of rebates in a supply chain context (Chen et al., 2007; Khouja and Zhou, 2010; Yang et al., 2010) or for a single firm (Khouja, 2006) have been developed.

Supply chain management and coordination literature is rich and recent reviews of it can be found in Arshinder and Deshmukh (2008), Li and Wang (2007), and Sarmah et al. (2006). These models usually analyze incentives offered by the manufacturer to the retailer. In particular, several coordination mechanisms have been suggested in the literature including quantity discount, buyback contracts, and lump sum side payments. Other incentives may be targeted to the consumer. These include cash-mail in rebates (Khouja and Zhou, 2010) or sales coupons and on-site rebates (Yue et al., 2006). A free manufacturer-sponsored retailer-issued gift card is different from the above incentives in that it targets both the retailer and consumers. Since consumers get the gift card with purchase, they can use the card to obtain some goods for free from the retailer if they redeem the card. The retailer benefits from the gift card whether the consumers redeem the gift cards or not. The retailer receives $G from the manufacturer for each unit sold. If a consumer does not redeem the gift card, then the retailer keeps all $G. If a consumer redeems the gift card, then the retailer incurs only the cost of good sold for the $G gift card value.

In making a purchase decision, consumers place a value on the gift card and subtract this value from product price to compute a net product price. In valuing gift card dollars, consumers consider two factors, the gift card is redeemable only at the retailer and there is a probability they may not redeem the gift card. As a result, consumers do not view gift cards as equal to the same amount of cash, that is, they value $1 of gift card by less than $1. Gneezy et al. (2006) found that when asked to bid for $50 Barnes and Noble gift certificate, people on average where willing to pay $26.10 for it. Evidence from resale of gift cards on a website shows that consumers value $1 of gift card in the range of $0.75 to $0.90 cash equivalence (Offenberg, 2007). In considering the redemption probability at the time of purchase, consumers may simply assume that they will certainly redeem the gift card or they may further discount the cash equivalence value they assign to the card to account for the possibility of not redeeming it. This discounting may be done consistently or inconsistently.


                     Consistent consumers take the value of their time into account as well as decide whether they will redeem the card when they make purchase decisions and then they follow through with their purchase-time redemption intentions. On the other hand, inconsistent consumers’ redemption probabilities when they make their redemption decisions are different from their purchase-time intended redemption probabilities. In other words, the discount consumers apply to the cash equivalence of the card to account for possibly not redeeming it at purchase time does not fully predict the probability of redemption after purchase. Inconsistency in consumer behavior has been supported by several empirical studies (Soman and Gourville, 2005) and many explanations for it are rooted in the temporal separation of the purchase and redemption decisions. Other researchers have explained inconsistency in consumer behavior using construal-level theory (Lynch and Zauberman, 2007).

After purchase, consistent consumers carry through with their purchase-time redemption intentions. The redemption probability of inconsistent consumers is independent of the purchase-time intended redemption probability. Two cases may occur: (1) the average redemption probability does not change with the value of gift cards (constant redemption rate); and (2) the average redemption probability increases with the value of gift cards (increasing redemption rate).

The product has a market size of n consumers. Consumer i′s valuation for the product, v
                     
                        i
                     , is a uniformly distributed random variable on [0, b] (b
                     >0), random variables v
                     1, v

                        n
                      are independent and identically distributed (iid). The uniform distribution is commonly used to model reservation price in the Marketing and Operations Management literature (Tang and Yin, 2010) and results in the classic linear demand function. Suppose B
                        i
                      is the cash equivalent of $1 of gift card for consumer i, B1, B2, …, B
                        n
                      are iid on a uniform distribution [L, U], E[B
                        i
                     ]=(L
                     +
                     U)/2=
                     β, (0<
                     β
                     ⩽1). Suppose also consumers estimate their probability of redeeming the card at purchase time as δ. So in addition to discounting the card by (1−B
                        i
                     ), consumers discount the gift card by (1−
                     δ) to account for the probability of not redeeming it. This results in a total valuation for $1 of gift card by consumer i of Γ
                     
                        i
                     
                     =
                     δ
                     B
                        i
                     , where Γ
                     1, Γ
                     2, …, Γ
                     
                        n
                      are iid on a uniform distribution [δL, δU], and E[Γ
                     
                        i
                     ]=
                     δβ
                     =
                     γ(0<
                     γ
                     ⩽1). For example, a consumer may value a $20 gift card at $18 cash equivalence (B
                        i
                     =0.9) and discounts the $18 by a factor of 0.20 to account for the probability of non-redemption resulting in a net card value of 0.9×0.8×20=$14.4. These assumptions about consumers’s valuation result in a linear valuation of gift card dollars with a slope of γ.

The cost of the product to the manufacturer is c per unit, he charges the retailer a wholesale price of W per unit, and pays the retailer G per unit to give consumers who buy the product a gift card of value G, G
                     ⩾0. The retailer charges a price of P per unit and has a margin on sales (of all products) of M, i.e. the cost of goods sold for $1 is $ (1−
                     M). The margin indicates retailer type. Low-margin retailers include grocers and big box retailers with margin of 0.25 whereas high margin retailers include department stores with margin of 0.43 (Retail Owners Institute, 2010). There are no shortages or salvage of excess inventory in our model. The retailer pays the manufacturer W
                     −
                     G per unit and is contractually obligated to issue a single gift card of value G to each consumer buying a unit of the product.

When gift cards are redeemed, some consumers use them to buy goods they would not have bought without the gift cards which leaves the retailer’s future sales unaffected by gift cards. Other consumers use their gift cards to fully or partially pay for goods they would have purchased with cash in the future, which reduces the retailer’s future sales and profits. We use θ to denote future cash purchase offset per $1 of redeemed gift cards, 0⩽
                     θ
                     ⩽1.

For benchmark, we analyze a supply chain without gift cards. We call this the decentralized no-gift card problem and denote it by 
                        DNG
                     . Consumers buy the product if their valuations for the product are greater than the retail price. The demand is

We develop different models depending on the type of supply chain, centralized vs. decentralized, the wholesale price in the decentralized supply chain, fixed or endogenous, and gift card redemption rate, constant or increasing in gift card value. A summary of these supply chain problems as well as their designation are shown in Table 1
                     . A summary of the optimal solutions of DNG as well as other supply chains are listed in Table 2
                     .

When introducing the gift card, the manufacturer may want to keep the wholesale price fixed because the card will be used for a limited time and the manufacturer does not want to renegotiate the wholesale price for a short period. We analyze this problem in this section and then analyze the problem with unrestricted wholesale price in the next section.

Now we introduce the use of a manufacturer-sponsored gift card. The redemption rate of the gift card is constant. The manufacturer keeps the wholesale price at (b
                        +
                        c)/2 and determines the gift card value G. We call this problem the gift card decentralized unchanged wholesale price problem with constant redemption and denote it by 
                           DUC
                        . A consumer buys the product when her valuation for the product is greater than the net price, where the net price incorporates a discount of (1−
                        Γ) of the face value of the gift card to account for its inferiority to cash and to account for the probability of not redeeming the card. The net price of the product for a consumer is the retail price minus the gift card valuation P

                         indicates that gift cards are more likely to increase the manufacturer’s profit when consumers apply low discounting to gift cards, i.e. large β. Also, gift cards are more likely to increase the manufacturer’s profit when [1−

                        ]η is small which implies that the retailer’s margin is large, consumers have a low redemption rate, and consumers do not use the gift cards to offset future purchases they would have made with cash. Interestingly, the profitability of gift cards for the manufacturer depends on the retailer’s margin. This may explain why the gift cards in Fig. 1 are offered at Home Depot where the margin is higher relative to other retailers such as deep discounter (Retail Owners Institute, 2010). Also Eq. (4) implies that the retailer may increase or decrease the retail price from the no gift card case of (3b

                        )η, then the manufacturer, the retailer, and gift card redeemers will be better off. Consumers who do not redeem the gift cards may or may not be better off. Proposition 1(d) shows that gift cards causes retailers to drop prices if (1−

Unlike rebates, where the retailer responds to the manufacturer’s rebate to the consumer by raising prices, when gift cards are used, the retailer may benefit from reducing the retail price.

In this subsection we examine the same problem as in the previous section with the assumption that the redemption rate increases linearly in gift card value. We call this problem the gift card decentralized unchanged wholesale price problem with increasing redemption rate and denote it by 
                           DUI
                        . For simplicity, we assume the probability of gift card redemption increases linearly in gift card value, until G reaches G
                        0 at which value the redemption probability reaches 1. The redemption probability is

                         in (b) is also positive. In other words, the manufacturer is always better off by sponsoring a gift card when the redemption rate is increasing. This is because for G
                        0
                        >0, there is a positive gift card value for which G/G
                        0 results in a redemption rate η which satisfies Theorem 1. The manufacturer, retailer and gift card redeemers are better off. Consumers who do not redeem the gift card may or may not be better off.

In this section we analyze the problem where the manufacturer determines the gift card value as well as the wholesale price. Since the fixed wholesale price is a special case of this case for the manufacturer, he will be no worse off by allowing the wholesale price to change. We are interested in how the retailer and consumers will fair out.

We call this problem the decentralized gift card joint with a changed wholesale price and constant redemption and denote it by 
                           DJC
                        . We can prove the following Theorem.

Unlike problem

                           DJC
                         then, it is best for him to keep increasing the wholesale price and the gift card value and for the retailer to respond by increasing the retail price. This situation is unlikely to occur since 1−

                           i
                        ) is unlikely to hold. At large gift card values, consumers will discount the gift card by larger factor (1- B
                           i
                        ) due to diminishing utility of consumption.

We call this problem the decentralized gift card joint with changed wholesale price and increasing redemption rate and denote it by 
                           DJI
                        . We are interested in how this option changes the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s decisions, their profits, and the consumers.

Part (a) of Theorem 4 can be rewritten as γ
                        >1−
                        M
                        
                           s
                         which after multiplying by G gives γG
                        >[(1−
                        M)+
                        Mθ]G. γ G is the increase in product price the retailer can have when a card of value G is given without changing demand. In other words, γG is the increase in profit per unit the retailer can get because of the gift card. [(1−
                        M)+
                        Mθ]G is the sum of the cost of goods sold with the gift cards and the loss in profit due to reduced future cash sales under 100% redemption. Therefore, even for 100% redemption, if γG
                        >[(1−
                        M)+
                        Mθ]G, then as the manufacturer increases the wholesale price and gift card value, the retailer responds by a price increase which is sufficiently small to keep both her profit and the manufacturer’s profit increasing. Thus, both the manufacturer’s and retailer’s profits are monotonically increasing in G and the problem is unbounded. For the reasons described after Theorem 3, this situation is unlikely to occur. If γ
                        <1−
                        M
                        
                           s
                        , then as the manufacturer increases the wholesale price and gift card value, which results in increased redemption, the retailer responds by substantially increasing the retail price. This causes the manufacturer’s profit to start decreasing at some value of G and thus the manufacturer limits the gift card’s value. Corollary 3 follows from Theorem 4.

                        Proposition 2 compares a decentralized supply chain without gift cards and a decentralized supply chain with gift cards with increasing redemption rate and endogenous wholesale price.

                                       The manufacturer increases the wholesale price.
                                    


                                       The retailer responds by increasing the retail price.
                                    


                                       The expected consumer demand always increases.
                                    


                                       The retailer’s profit always increases.
                                    


                                       The manufacturer’s profit always increases.
                                    


                                       The manufacturer’s profit increases by twice the increase in the retailer’s profit.
                                    


                                       The average margins of retailer, manufacturer and supply chain increase.
                                    

The manufacturer’s margin increases over 
                           DNG
                        . On average, consumers are worse off when it is optimal for the manufacturer to offer gift cards in 
                           DJI
                        . While gift card redeemers may be better off due to increased utility from goods purchased with gift cards, non-redeemers may be substantially worse off. In Proposition 3, we compare a decentralized supply chain with gift cards with increasing redemption rate and fixed wholesale price to one with endogenous wholesale price.

Part (a) of Theorem 6 can be rewritten as γ
                        >1−
                        M
                        
                           s
                         or γ 
                        >(1−
                        M)+
                        Mθ. Multiplying by G gives γ G
                        >[(1−
                        M)+
                        Mθ]G. The left hand side of the inequality, γ G, is the increase in price the supply chain can have when a card of value G is given with the product without changing demand. The supply chain can give a gift card of value G and increase price by γG without changing demand. Thus, γG is the increase in profit per unit the retailer can get because of the gift card. The right hand side of the inequality is the sum of the cost of goods sold with gift cards and the loss in profit due to reduced future cash sales under 100% redemption. Thus, if γG
                        >[(1−
                        M)+
                        Mθ]G, then the increase in profit is greater than the cost for any redemption rate and the problem is unbounded. This case may arise due to the assumption that consumers’ utility of gift dollars is linear. While this assumption is realistic for small gift card values, we anticipate that consumers’ utility becomes strictly concave at larger gift card values, which prevents this case from arising. If γG
                        <[(1−
                        M)+
                        Mθ]G, then at a 100% redemption, the cost of gift card redemption and loss of future profit for the supply chain is larger than the increase in profit from the increase in the retail price. Also, as Theorem 6 shows, the optimal price with a gift card is larger than the optimal price without gift card of (b

                        =1, the gift card value will be G

                         due to gift cards. As θ approaches 1, i.e. consumers use gift cards to pay for goods they would have purchased with cash, gift cards will have a smaller impact on demand and profit. Therefore, gift cards are best for supply chains selling seasonal products where forward buying/stockpiling is difficult.

Manufacturers use different promotions to increase profits such as cash mail-in rebates (Aydin and Porteus, 2005; Khouja and Zhou, 2010). With cash mail-in rebates, consumers fill out a form and submit it with proof of purchase to receive a rebate of R. Both constant and increasing redemption rates in rebate value have been used in previous research (Soman, 1998; Aydin and Porteus, 2005; Khouja and Zhou, 2010). We develop a model of decentralized supply chain with unchanged wholesale price and constant rebate redemption and denote it by 
                           DUCR
                        . Let the subscript t denote the rebate case. We can provide the following Theorem.

Thus, the left hand side of the inequality is the advantage the gift card provides in terms of higher demand compared to rebates.

                        η), compared to gift cards where the retailer benefits from slippage. The benefit the manufacturer gets from rebate slippage increases with consumer inconsistency, which increases as their valuation per $1 of rebate (γ) increases relative to their actual redemption rate (η).

                         means larger benefit from slippage. Therefore, the advantage of the rebates for the manufacturer over gift cards is the product of

                        θ) for a fixed redemption rate η
                        =0.75, which is the product of the retailer’s margin and the proportion of gift card redemptions spent on products consumers would not have bought from the retailer without the gift card. As the retailer’s margin increases (larger M) and/or her ability to limit future cash sales offset improves (smaller θ), she increases the retail price by a smaller amount in response to the gift card which results in larger demand. On the other hand, as the valuation per $1 of rebate or gift card (γ) increases, the performance of the rebate as measured by γ
                        −
                        η improves resulting in the two regions shown in Fig. 2a. For example, if consumers value each $1 of gift card as γ
                        =$0.9, then M
                        
                           s
                        
                        >0.067 will result in gift cards being more profitable for the manufacturer than rebates. For example, in a supply chain with a retailer whose margin is M
                        =0.3 and future cash sales offset of θ
                        <0.778, the manufacturer’s makes more profit with gift cards than with rebates.

Since rebates are given as cash which is superior to gift cards, we examine the case of γ
                        
                           t
                        
                        =(1+
                        ϑ)γ which implies that consumers value each $1 of rebate by $ϑ above $1 of gift card. In this case, we can show that the required M

As we have shown in Propositions 1–3, the retailer frequently responds to manufacturer-sponsored gift cards by increasing the retail price, which increases the margin paid by consumers and reduces consumer surplus, especially for consumers who do not redeem their gift cards. Legally, manufacturers cannot dictate prices to retailers. However manufacturers can publicly suggest a retail price, referred to as the manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) and is printed on the sales tag, the product tag, or advertised, at which the product is expected to sell (Yang et al., 2010). Consumers may adopt this MSRP as a reference price and demand can substantially decrease because of consumers’ loss aversion if the retailer charges a higher price than the MRSP. The use of the MRSP to limit the retailer’s price increase when the manufacturer offers a cash-mail-in rebate has been investigated by Yang et al. (2010). We suggest an incentive scheme utilizing the MSRP. The manufacturer limits the retailer’s price increase by imposing a negative relationship between the gift card value and the MSRP, which is denoted by P
                        
                           S
                        . We show that under certain conditions, such incentive can guarantee that all consumers, the manufacturer, and the retailer are better off. We illustrate the incentive scheme for the constant redemption rate case.

With this incentive scheme, the manufacturer sells the product to the retailer at wholesale price of

Under this incentive scheme, the manufacturer uses the relationship between the gift card and the retail price, to reduce double marginalization. As known in supply chain literature, double marginalization causes the retailer to charge higher price than optimal from a supply chain perspective resulting in suboptimal supply chain profits. By reducing double marginalization using the incentive scheme, the manufacturer can increase the supply chain profits and while making it optimal for the retailer not to increase price.

Consumers take their probability of redeeming the gift cards into account when they make their purchase decisions. Consistentconsumers follow through with their purchase-time redemption intentions (η
                        =
                        δ). Inconsistent consumers’ redemption probabilities are different from their purchase-time intended redemption probabilities (η
                        ≠
                        δ). We suggest a simple measure of consumer inconsistency. Let Δ=

                        Proposition 6 indicates that if consumers are consistent, then the profitability of gift cards hinges on the retailer’s ability to induce consumers to use the gift cards to purchase products which they would not have purchased in the future with cash. Some retailers are able to exert such influence by making cards valid for only a limited period. For simplicity, in the following analysis we assume that consumers value gift cards as cash, i.e. β
                        =1 and thus γ
                        =

                        =
                        η), value gift card as cash (β
                        =1), and use the gift cards to make purchases they would not have made if they did not have the gift cards (θ
                        =0). As shown in the table, gift cards increase the expected profits of the retailer and manufacturer in all three models (

                        Table 4 shows the effect of a Δ
                        =0.2, which implies that consumers’ probability of redeeming the gift cards is 0.2 below their estimated redemption probability at the time of purchase. Comparing Tables 3 and 4 shows that consumer optimism leads to an increase in retail prices in

                           DJI
                        , and larger expected profit for both manufacturer and retailer.


                        Table 5 shows the combined effect of Δ
                        =0.2 and θ
                        =0.5, i.e. consumers use 50% of redeemed gift cards to pay for future purchases they would have made with cash. Comparing Tables 4 and 5 show that the optimum gift card value, the expected demand, and the expected manufacturer’s and retailer’s profits all decrease with the increased future cash sales offset.


                        Table 6 shows the effect of consumers’ discounting of the card to a lower cash equivalence with β
                        =0.80. Comparing Tables 3 and 6 we see that when consumers discount the card to a lower cash equivalence, optimum gift card value, expected demand, the expected manufacturer and retailers profits all decrease.

In this paper we examined the use of manufacturer-sponsored gift cards in a single-manufacturer single-retailer supply chain using a Stackelberg game where the manufacturer is the leader. In general, gift cards are more likely to increase the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s profits when the retailer has a large margin, consumers use gift cards to buy goods they would not have bought in cash from the retailer, and the redemption rate is low.

In a decentralized supply chain, we addressed a case in which the manufacturer does not change the wholesale price and showed that when the redemption rate is constant, if gift cards increase the manufacturer’s profit then they will also increase the retailer’s profit. Also, under some conditions, gift cards will lead to a decrease in retail prices under certain conditions. This case, in which consumers, the retailer, and manufacturer are all better off, arises when the retailer’s average margin is large, consumers are consistent and make purchases with gift cards they would not have made with cash. We also analyzed a model in which the wholesale price is endogenous and showed that the manufacturer keeps a larger share of the supply chain’s profit increase from gift cards. Also, for this case, the manufacturer’s margin increases and, on average, consumers are worse off when it is optimal for the manufacturer to offer gift cards.

We compared the performance of gift cards to cash-mail-in rebates and found that under some conditions, gift cards increase the manufacturer’s profit more than rebates. These conditions include having a retailer with a high profit margin and having a large proportion of gift card redemptions spent on products consumers would not have bought from the retailer without the gift card. In those cases, it is optimal for the retailer to increase the retail price by a smaller amount in response to a gift card compared to a rebate of the same amount, which results in higher demand and larger manufacturer’s profit even though he does not benefit directly from slippage.

We also developed an incentive scheme the manufacturer can use to improve the effectiveness of gift cards. In this scheme, the manufacturer limits the retailer’s price increase by imposing a negative relationship between the gift card value and the retail price. We show that under certain conditions, such incentive can guarantee that all consumers, the manufacturer, and the retailer are better off.

Future research may focus on the effect of government legislation on the treatment of unredeemed gift cards. Other extensions may focus on cases in which consumer utility from gift card dollars is increasing and strictly concave. Finally, cooperative programs where the manufacturer and the retailer share the cost of gift cards merits further examination.
