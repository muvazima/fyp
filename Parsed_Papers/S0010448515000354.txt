                  Due to the complexity of geometry, the feed direction with maximal machining strip width usually varies among different regions over a freeform surface or a shell of surfaces. However, in most traditional tool path generation methods, the surface is treated as one machining region thus only local optimisation might be achieved. This paper presents a new region-based tool path generation method. To achieve the full effect of the optimal feed direction, a surface is divided into several sub-surface regions before tool path computation. Different from the scalar field representation of the machining strip width, a rank-two tensor field is derived to evaluate the machining strip width using ball end mill. The continuous tensor field is able to represent the machining strip widths in all feed directions at each cutter contact point, except at the boundaries between sub-regions. Critical points where the tensor field is discontinuous are defined and classified. By applying critical points in the freeform surface as the start for constructing inside boundaries, the surface could be accurately divided to such that each region contain continuous distribution of feed directions with maximal machining strip width. As a result, tool paths are generated in each sub-surface separately to achieve better machining efficiency. The proposed method was tested using two freeform surfaces and the comparison to several leading existing tool path generation methods is also provided.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Freeform surfaces are widely used in design of complex parts in the field of automotive and aeronautics to meet the aesthetic and functional requirements. The machining of freeform surfaces is time-consuming with significant manual interactions by using the current CAM systems. Thus how to generate the tool path automatically and optimally has become one of the most popular aspects in the current research of freeform surface machining  [1].

Quality and efficiency are two criteria to evaluate the tool path. First, requirements in surface tolerance should be satisfied and no interference or gouging is permitted. Then the machining time should be reduced as much as possible. Great efforts have been made in machining strip width optimisation in tool path computation to increase the machining efficiency  [2–4]. In most of these methods, the whole surface is considered as one machining region. Tool paths of the surface are computed by shifting an initial tool path which may be one of the surface boundaries or a curve within the surface generated under some rules. However, for complex surfaces machining, the feed directions with maximal machining strip width usually present varies among different regions. If the surface is still treated as one region in this condition, only local optimal machining results could be achieved. In this paper, machining strip width is evaluated using a rank-two tensor and the surface may be divided into several sub-surface regions. Each region contains continuous distribution of feed directions with maximal machining strip width. Then tool paths in each sub-surface could be generated separately to achieve optimal tool paths.

This part will first review the recent research work about machining strip width optimisation in freeform surface machining. Then a survey about region-based freeform surface machining methods will be given.

Basically, the approaches to increase the machining efficiency in freeform surface machining could be classified into tool path length reduction and optimal feed speed assignment. Machining strip width is defined as the range of the machined region that lies within the required tolerance. Wider machining strip width leads to less machining passes which also means shorter tool path length. Cutter shape, feed direction and tool orientation are factors to decide the machining strip width at each cutter contact point. Normally, the maximisation of machining strip width is integrated with the optimisation of cutter shape, tool path as well as tool orientation.

Effective cutting shape (ECS) was defined as the approximation of the cutter surface to find the machining strip width by calculating the intersection between the offset surface and the ECS  [5]. However, this approximation may cause unwanted collisions. Yoon et al.  [6] used Dupin indicatrices of cutter surface and the designed surface at the contact point to find out the locally millable cutting positions. Then the second order approximations of the machining strip width were applied to generate the optimal cutting positions for cutting directions. Effective cutter radius (ECR) is the core attribute to describe ECS. To overcome the deficiencies of less flexible and time-consuming in traditional ECR computation based on numerical approach and geometric approximations, Redonnet et al.  [7] proposed a relation authorising an analytical calculation of the ECR for torus milling cutter. They also concluded that the increasing of the ECR had a direct improvement in machining strip width. To extend this conclusion in a more general manner, the increasing of machining strip width is induced by the increasing of proximity of ECR and the surface normal curvature. Jensen et al.  [8] presented a tool selection method for five axis curvatures matched machining. The machining strip width was evaluated by ECR and the surface curvature. Lu et al.  [9] also used curvature matched method to approximate the cusp height for machining strip width maximisation. 3D configuration space is established to guarantees that the cutter is gouge-free and that the cusp height is less than the machining tolerance. Gong et al.  [10] gave a new local optimisation method for tool positions to maximise the machining strip width by minimising the relative normal curvature between the tool envelope surface and the designed surface. Anotaipaiboon and Makhanov  [4] utilised the concept of adaptive space-filling curve (SFC) for tool path generation. Two iso-parametric tool paths will be first overlapped and then SFCs are generated adaptively by following the direction with optimal machining strip width to construct tool paths from the existing iso-parametric tool paths. However, the iso-parametric tool paths usually do not follow the local optimal feed direction with maximal machining strip width especially for complex surfaces. Fard and Feng  [3,11] applied the maximisation of machining strip width as the optimisation goal for tool orientation determination. Their study indicated that although the minimum curvature direction was mostly not the optimal feed direction in free-form surface machining, the minimum curvature direction did represent a good approximation of the optimal feed direction at a CC point, in particular for a free-form surface with low-curvature relative to the cutter size. Similarly, Fan and Ball  [12] proposed a method for cutter orientation optimisation method for flat-end cutter milling on a quadric.

Chiou and Lee  [2] established the concept of machining potential field to select the tool path curve with the maximum average machining strip width among the potential paths across the surface as the start tool path. And during the generation of adjacent tool paths, if the cutting efficiency of a newly generated adjacent tool path falls below a predefined value, the procedure will stop and a new initial tool path will be selected to continue the tool path computation in the blank area of the surface. This work applied the similar procedures to generate tool paths as the abovementioned research work: (1) construct an initial tool path curve, this curve could be selected from the boundaries of the surface or generated based on other specific considerations; (2) discrete the initial tool path curve into a set of points under the tolerance requirement; (3) offset these points in directions orthogonal to the initial tool path curve with proper path intervals and form the consecutive tool paths; (4) select the tool path curves generated by step (3) as the new initial tool path curves and repeat step (2) and (3) until the tool paths cover the surface completely.

According to the above procedures, it could be concluded that once the initial tool path curve is selected, the overall tool paths are largely determined  [2]. However, for complex freeform surfaces, feed direction, tool orientation and cutter shape for optimal machining strip width usually vary in different regions. Tool paths generated by the above procedures usually follow the same or similar regularity all over the surface thus only local optimal solution could be achieved. To overcome this deficiency, the surface may need to be subdivided into several sub-surfaces according to the regularity of the feed direction, cutter shape or tool orientation. As a result, region-based freeform surface machining strategy becomes more and more imperative in real manufacturing industry.

Region-based freeform surface machining is based on dividing the freeform surface into regions by identifying meaningful features  [1]. Usually, there are various optimisation goals in freeform surface machining like machining strip width optimisation, feed rate optimisation, cutter or machine tool determination. Tool paths for these optimisation goals may present a regional regularity overall the surface. For example, surface could be subdivided into regions with different curvature bounds, each of which can be milled using tools appropriate to that region. Convex and relatively flat regions can be machined using flat-end cutters in milling, regions with small curvature can be accurately milled faster with larger ball-end cutter. In  [13], a surface is divided into several regions to generate tool paths for even cusp height. But the division algorithm is restricted to specific surface geometry. In  [14], tool paths will be generated by constructing geodesics on an abstract Riemannian manifold for constant cusp height. However, those geodesics may intersect with the others. Thus the surface cannot be machined completely as one machining region and should be subdivided into distinct segments to avoid the intersections of the tool paths. In Lee’s method for machining strip width optimisation  [2], a surface may be divided into multiple regions with different initial tool paths. In Tuong’s method  [15], the chain code technique in the image processing field is applied to divide the surface for cutter selection optimisation. Han et al.  [16] used the iso-photo concept for surface segmentation. Surface is divided into regions with similar normal vectors for tool path computation. In the method proposed by Chen et al.  [17], the surface is first divided into a number of regions based on the accessibility of the 3-axis machine tool, and then the part set-up is adjusted to machine each region by a tilt/rotary table. Roman  [18] developed a method that uses the simplicity of 3-axis tool positioning and the flexibility of 5-axis tool orientation to machine complex surfaces. The method divides a surface into patches and then machines each patch using a fixed tool orientation. The tool orientation and section boundaries are determined to minimise the overall machining time. Elber  [19] divided the freeform surface into 3-axis machining regions and 5 axis machining regions based on the surface curvatures to improve the machining efficiency. Giri et al.  [20] proposed a method to divide the surface in to distinct zones with similar curvature. The boundaries of these regions are then applied as the master cutter path to compute the overall tool path. Zhang et al.  [21] divided the surface into orientation regions based on the surface normal vector over a certain point density grid. Then orientation regions with the same orientation type will be grouped into surface features to support automatic process planning.

In the above research, a surface may be divided into several sub-surfaces for better machining results. But most of the existing surface subdivision methods are either passive or only consider the surface geometry. This paper is to present a more scientific region-based machining method which will divide the surface before tool path generation and consider both the surface geometry and the cutter shape. In the authors’ previous work  [22], a tensor based surface subdivision method is proposed by introducing the tensor property of the objects to be optimised. In this research, a rank-two tensor to represent the machining strip width with ball end mill will be first presented. Then a surface subdivision approach is established by applying the property of the machining strip width tensor field. With this method, a surface is able to be divided into several sub-surface regions and each region contains continuous distribution of feed directions with maximal machining strip width. By generating tool paths within each sub-surface separately, tool paths for machining the whole surface could follow the optimal feed direction as much as possible to receive a more global optimal result. In Section  3, the machining strip width will be evaluated with a rank-two tensor with which a complete and continuous representation to machining strip width at each cutter contact point could be obtained. In Section  4, a surface subdivision method will be discussed. Test examples will be provided in Section  5. The proposed method was tested using two freeform surfaces and the comparison to several leading existing tool path generation methods. At last, Section  6 will conclude the whole paper and discuss the future work.

Currently, machining strip width is usually represented by scalar. Scalar can only represent the machining strip width at one feed direction and in most related research, the scalar based methods only give the maximal machining strip width solution at each cutter contact (CC) point like machining potential field  [2]. However, due to the complexity in both geometry and machining in freeform surface machining, maximal solutions cannot be always received. As a result, most of the scalar field based methods are greedy which could achieve only local optimal machining results. In this section, the machining strip width using ball end mills will be evaluated using a rank-two tensor. By introducing the tensor property of the machining strip width, a complete and continuous representation to all solutions at every cutter contact point could be achieved.

                      is called the feasible machining strip  [2] and its width is called machining strip width as 
                        w
                      shown in Fig. 1(b). To increase the machining efficiency, machining strip width at all CC points within the surface should be as large as possible.

When using ball end mills, the cutter surface is always a sphere surface no matter which tool orientation is selected. As a result, once the cutter and machining tolerance is determined, feed direction becomes the only factor to decide the machining strip width. Different feed directions usually lead to different machining strip widths due to the variation of local surface curvature. The surface surrounding the CC point could be approximated as a second order quadratic surface and its second order derivatives are assumed to be continuous around the CC point. In the normal section that crosses the CC point, 
                        h
                      is defined to represent the height in

                      as shown in Fig. 2

                        h
                      could reflect the proximity between the part surface and the cutter surface around the CC point. It could be found that the larger 
                        h
                      will cause smaller machining strip width in the feed direction that normal to this section plane.

                      is more accurate to generate the optimal initial tool path. In the next section, the tensor metric of machining strip width could be used to divide the surface.

Due to the complexity of geometry, the feed direction with maximal machining strip width usually varies among different regions over a freeform surface as shown in Fig. 4
                     . In this condition, the surface should be machined as different machining regions. Surface subdivision is to establish the boundaries that divide the surface into different sub-regions. In this paper, an approach will be presented to divide the surface into several sub-surface regions such that each region contains continuous distribution of feed directions with maximal machining strip width.

Points located on the boundaries inside the surface could be classified into two types: 
                        
                           (i)
                           The adjacent sub-surface regions have different optimal feed directions to machine the point. In this condition, the maximal and minimal eigenvalues of tensor

                                 h
                               which means every potential feed direction at this point has the same machining strip width. This kind of boundary point is called degenerate point (DP). For complex freeform surfaces, DPs usually distribute overall the surface discretely and boundaries cannot be constructed only by DPs. Here we introduce another type of boundary points to connect DPs to generate inside boundaries.

The adjacent sub-surface regions have the same optimal feed direction at this point. For this kind of boundary point, its tangent vector at the boundary is the feed direction with maximal machining strip width. This kind of boundary points is named as normal boundary point (NBP).

                     : Trisector point. A pathline in a tensor field is generated by following the eigenvector with maximal machining strip width at every point. For a trisector degenerate point, there are three hyperbolic sectors where pathlines sweep past the degenerate point. In the context of manufacturing, the surrounding region of a trisector degenerate point should be divided into three portions with different feed directions by the separatrices among the three hyperbolic sectors.


                     
                        δ

                        0
                     : Wedge point. A wedge point has only one hyperbolic sector and the degenerate point locates at the direction in which the curvature of the pathline is positive. In the viewpoint of machining, there is only one separatrix at a wedge point thus the surface will not be divided at a wedge degenerate point. Normally, wedge degenerate points exist in couples and the each pair of wedge degenerate points share a separatrix.


                     
                        δ

                        0
                     : Merge wedge point. A merge wedge point refers to a special condition that two wedge points are merged to one point. Thus the merge wedge point will also be enclosed by pathlines.

As a conclusion, only trisector points in DPs should be selected as the starts to construct the sub-surfaces boundaries.

After extracting trisector degenerate points within the surface, the next step for surface subdivision is to generate NBPs starting from the trisector points. The procedures to generate an inside boundary could be described as follows:

Construct a small circle on the tangent plane at a trisector degenerate point. Discretise this circle into points based on a predefined step angle 
                        
                           Δ

                           °
                           )
                        
                      and project these points onto the surface along the normal direction of this trisector degenerate point. Make sure that no other DPs are surrounded by these points. Use 
                        
                           
                              T

                      to calculate their maximal eigenvectors. Then project these eigenvectors back to the tangent plane. At the same time, a set of potential vectors could be constructed by connecting the simple points to the trisector degenerate point. Compute the angle between the projected eigenvector of each discrete point and its potential vector, as 
                        θ
                      shown in Fig. 6
                     .

According to the definition of trisector degenerate point, there should be three points on the circle which make 
                        θ
                      equals to zero, so called seed points (SP). Each SP refers to an inside boundary that starts from the trisector degenerate point. Usually, not all SPs could be obtained by the abovementioned procedure. In this condition, we first locate the arc that contains the rest SPs.

A circle with the same diameter as that of the trisector point will be constructed on the tangent plane at the NBP. Then project the former boundary curve segment onto the tangent plane.

                     . Then apply the same NBP searching method at trisector degenerate point on the semi-circle that contains the SP to find out the next NBP.

NBP searching will be continued until a border or another trisector degenerate point is found. By applying the abovementioned procedures, all inside boundaries could be generated. These boundaries divide the surface into several sub-regions. Compared with traditional tool path generation algorithms, tool paths generated within each sub-surface separately are able to follow the optimal feed directions with maximal machining strip width all over the surface.

The proposed method is tested in finishing the two surfaces as shown in Figs. 9 and 11. The proposed method is developed using Visual Studio 2005 as one module of a feature based NC programming system named FBM_NUAA based on CATIA CAM platform. With the proposed method, the input surface will be first analysed for surface subdivision and then an initial tool path will be selected for each sub-surface for tool paths generation.

In the current version, we use the searching algorithm for adjacent non-isoparametric tool paths discussed in  [24] to compute the tool paths in each sub-surface. However, other adjacent tool path generation algorithms could also be applied to compute tool paths in each sub-surface by following its optimal feed directions. In the proposed method, tool paths for the inside boundaries will not be computed exclusively. When generating tool paths for each sub-surface, we will extend the tool paths outside the boundaries as shown in Fig. 8
                     
                     . The extra distance 
                        l
                      could be decided by the user and in the case study of this paper, we set 
                        l
                      as 
                        0.5
                        ∗
                        r
                      where 
                        r
                      is the cutter radius. To show the advantages, comparison between the proposed method and several leading existing tool path generation methods will be given in this section.

The first test surface is a part of a car mould surface. In this case study, the diameter of the selected ball end mill is 6 mm. The maximal allowed cusp-height is 0.05 mm. There are two trisector degenerate points found within this test surface. Starting from the two trisector degenerate points, five inside boundaries are constructed and the surface is divided into four sub-surfaces. Tool paths are then generated separately in each sub-surface as shown in Fig. 9(d). For comparison, tool paths are also generated by using the iso-parametric method, iso-scallop method and the machining potential field based method, as shown in Fig. 9(a)–(c) respectively. In iso-parametric method and iso-scallop method, we choose the longest boundary of the surface as the initial tool path curves since it may achieve better results in total tool path length and machining time  [25]. In the machining potential field based method, the cutting efficiency index

                      for continuing the adjacent tool paths generation is set to be 0.8. All the finishing tool paths in Fig. 9 are then applied to machine the first test surface and the machined results are shown in Fig. 10
                     
                     . The total tool path length and the corresponding machining time of each method are also provided in Figs. 9(e) and 10(e).

The second test surface is the bottom surface from a PET bottle mould. This surface is much more complicated than the former one. This case applies the same cutter and maximal allowed cusp-height. By applying the proposed method, six merge wedge degenerate points and five trisector degenerate points could be found. The surface is then divided into six sub-regions as shown in Fig. 11(d). Finishing tool paths for this case are also generated by the abovementioned three leading existing tool path generation methods as shown in Fig. 11. The machined results are provided in Fig. 12
                     .

The proposed method divides the surface according to the regularity of the feed directions with maximal machining strip width. Thus tool paths generated in each sub-surface can follow the optimal feed directions as much as possible. In the above two cases, the proposed method could achieve a better result both in total tool paths length and machining time. This improvement will be increased with growth of the surface complexity in frequent changes to concave–convex property. However, the reduction in machining time is less than that of tool path length since the feed speed waste in frequent feed direction variation. The integration of machining strip width optimisation and feed speed optimisation will be carried out by the authors as future work.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

This paper presents a new regional based tool path generation method for freeform surface machining. The complex freeform surfaces may need to be divided into several sub-surface regions for machining separately to avoid local optimisation. Instead of representing the machining strip width as a scalar in traditional tool path generation methods, a rank-two tensor is developed to evaluate the machining strip width with ball end mill. Based on this tensor, machining strip widths in all feed directions at each cutter contact point could be evaluated continuously. The machining strip width tensor could be used both in tool path generation and surface subdivision. In tool path generation, it is helpful to find out an optimal initial tool path curve. For surface subdivision, a machining strip width tensor field is established. Critical points in the tensor field are called degenerated points which are further classified into three types. Only trisector degenerate points are selected as the start to construct inside boundaries for dividing the surface. In each sub-surface, feed directions for maximal machining strip width of the cutter contact points follow the similar or same pattern. Then tool paths in each sub-surface are generated separately. This method is tested in finishing two freeform surfaces and the comparisons with the iso-parametric method, iso-scallop method and the machining potential field based method are provided. It shows the proposed method could achieve a better result both in total tool paths length and machining time. The future work will focus the derivation of the tensor for machining strip width evaluation with other types of cutters like flat end mill and fillet end mill. We are also interested in integrating the machining strip width optimisation to feed speed optimisation.
