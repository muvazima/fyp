                  A minimization problem with a convex separable objective function subject to linear equality constraints and box constraints (bounds on the variables) is considered. Necessary and sufficient optimality condition is proved for a feasible solution to be an optimal solution to this problem. Primal-dual analysis is also included. Examples of some convex separable objective functions for the considered problem are presented.

                      as well as efficient algorithms for solving such problems will be very useful.

Related problems and methods for solving them are considered in the papers listed in References. The solution of knapsack problems with arbitrary convex or concave objective functions is studied in Bitran and Hax (1981), Luss and Gupta (1975), Moré and Vavasis (1991), Zipkin (1980), etc. Quadratic knapsack problems and related to them are studied in Brucker (1984), Pardalos, Ye, and Han (1991), Robinson, Jiang, and Lerme (1992), etc. A branch and bound algorithm for separable concave programming is proposed in Hong-gang Xue, Cheng-xian Xu, and Feng-min Xu (2004). Algorithms for the case of convex quadratic objective function are proposed in Brucker (1984), Dussault, Ferland, and Lemaire (1986), Helgason, Kennington, and Lall (1980), etc. Algorithms for bound constrained quadratic programming problems are proposed in Dembo and Tulowitzki (1983), Moré and Toraldo (1989), Pardalos and Kovoor (1990). A polynomial time algorithm for the resource allocation problem with a convex objective function and nonnegative integer variables is suggested in Katoh, Ibaraki, and Mine (1979). Surrogate upper bound sets for bi-objective bi-dimensional binary knapsack problems are studied in Cerqueus, Przybylski, and Gandibleux (2015). Valid inequalities, cutting planes and integrality of the knapsack polytope, which is the feasible region of the problem under consideration, are considered, for example, in Stefanov (1998; 2011), etc. Well-posedness and primal-dual analysis of convex separable optimization problems of the considered form are studied in Stefanov (2013b). Methods for solving variational inequalities over box constrained feasible regions, defined by (3), are proposed, for example, in Stefanov (2002; 2007; 2013a), etc. Iterative methods of nondifferentiable optimization are applied to some separable problems of approximation theory in Stefanov (2014), etc.

(Only for comparison, recall that astrophysicists have determined that the age of the Universe is approximately 15 billion years, that is, approximately “only” 1018 seconds.) Furthermore, in each case, we have to solve a large-scale system of nonlinear equations in

                        . Therefore, the direct application of the KKT theorem, using explicit enumeration of all possible cases, for solving large-scale problems of the considered form would not give a result in real time, and efficient characterization theorems and methods for solving the considered problem will be very useful.

Thus, using the Lagrangian duality and Theorem 1, we can replace the multivariate problem

                      by another multivariate problem (15)–(16) of 
                        
                           λ
                           ∈
                           
                              R

                     . Since usually the number m of “general” linear equality constraints (2) is less than the number n of variables (of box constraints (3)) of the original problem 
                        
                           (
                           
                              C

                      it turns out that in many cases the dual problem (15)–(16) is easier to be solved than the original problem

In this paper, we have formulated and proved a necessary and sufficient optimality condition (characterization) for a feasible solution to be an optimal solution to problem 
                        
                           (
                           
                              C
                              m
                              =
                           
                           )
                        
                     .

An open question for future work is developing a convergent algorithm of polynomial complexity for solving problem 
                        
                           (
                           
                              C
                              m
                              =
                           
                           )
