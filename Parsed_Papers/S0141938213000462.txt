@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  Menus are commonly employed within user-interfaces, but are not necessarily a suitable solution for emerging new contexts. For instance, for in-vehicle displays, the use of visually oriented menus creates a clear distraction burden. To investigate how the visual demand of menus varied as a function of their breadth, depth and structure, a study was conducted following the ISO occlusion protocol. Participants were asked to find and select target words on a touchscreen by navigating menus of varying breadths and depths (16×3; 8×4; 4×6; 12×2) when options were arranged either in alphabetical order (structured menus) or randomly (unstructured menus). Tasks were achieved either with full vision or whilst wearing occlusion goggles enabling only brief (1.5s) opportunities to visually access the touchscreen. Preliminary equations were derived from the data indicating fundamentally different relationships for the visual demand of an interface dependent on whether anticipation can be used during the task. For structured menus, the visual demand was a logarithmic function of the breadth of the menus, whereas for unstructured menus, the relationship was quadratic. Moreover, results indicated that for structured menus breadth was favoured over depth, as the lowest visual demand was associated with 16×3 menu hierarchies. Conversely, for unstructured menus, compromise hierarchies (e.g. 4×6; 8×4) were associated with the least visual demand. Conclusions are drawn regarding the setting of boundary (acceptable/unacceptable) conditions for alternative menu structures for use within vehicles.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Menus are ubiquitous within contemporary user-interfaces forming a key part of the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointing) direct-manipulation philosophy [1]. Menus rely on a user’s increased ability for “recognition rather than recall”, and subsequently provide clear benefits in usability over command-based interface styles [2].

A key design issue for menus concerns the depth vs. breadth trade-off within a hierarchical tree structure. Designers will commonly need to decide whether to emphasise breadth (number of options on individual screens) or depth (number of screens to navigate through) in an interface solution. Researchers recognised the significance of this issue early in the development of graphical user-interfaces and several key studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g. [3–5]). In fact, this topic has continued to retain the interest of researchers (e.g. [6]).

The present work places an emphasis on two studies that span the period of research activity. The first, reported by Landauer and Nachbar [7], investigated the time required to locate and select (acquire) targets on a touchscreen within menus of varying depths and breadths. Their paper has subsequently been cited over 100times and appears in several key textbooks (e.g. [1]) forming the basis for the overall recommendation that breadth is favoured over depth when considering user performance for different menu hierarchies. For instance, the time to acquire a target within a 16×3 menu (16 options/screen; 3 screens to navigate through) would be predicted to be quicker than the time to select an equivalent target in a 2×12 menu.

The second study is reported by Cockburn and Gutwin [6]. They collected their own data and compared it with that of Landauer and Nachbar [7] and others and concluded that the degree to which a user can anticipate where a target is located within options on a screen has a significant effect on results. Such anticipation may arise, either as a result of structure in the layout of options (as was the case for the Laundauer and Nachbar study) or due to a user’s familiarity with an interface. In the current paper, the term structured refers to menus in which selectable items are arranged with alphabetical order; unstructured refers to menus which are arranged in a random fashion.

The research studies of Laundauer and Nachbar [7] and Cockwin and Gutwin [6] themselves build upon the findings of Hick [8] and Hyman [9] who investigated the relationship between the time taken to react to a stimulus based on the amount of information presented in that stimulus. Their work is often expressed as the Hick–Hyman law presenting a logarithmic relationship between reaction time and the number of choices available. It was postulated that such a logarithmic rule exists because people subdivide the total number of options into categories, eliminating about half of the remaining choices at each step. However, this sub-dividing strategy can only occur when users are able to anticipate where a target stimulus exists within the range of options [6]. In situations where users have to consider each option one at a time, the relationship between response time and the number of choices has been found to be linear [6]. Landauer and Nachbar (p. 76) refer to this as “a sequential visual scan-and-evaluate” strategy [7].

The WIMP philosophy arose for GUIs in which users carried out tasks using a keyboard, pointing device (typically a mouse) and accompanying visual display. In particular, the suitability of a WIMP-style interface for a given task assumes fundamentally that users are wholly engaged in the activity. The ubiquity of modern user-interfaces has ensured that such notions are no longer valid. User-interfaces now exist in a range of contexts where divided attention is required, for instance, using a mobile phone while walking [10] or using a vehicle navigation system while driving [11]. In these situations, interface designers have to consider the interactions between tasks of varying priorities placing different demands on a user’s mental and physical resources.

For driving, the visual demand of the user-interface is particularly important. Research has shown that visual distraction has considerable negative effects on driving safety, related to the lateral control of the vehicle and response to emerging hazards [12]. In the complex, safety–critical driving situation, it is essential that user-interfaces do not place unacceptable levels of demand on the driver. Distraction and lack of attention are widely recognised to be considerable contributory factors in current vehicle crashes (e.g. [13]).

In-vehicle user-interfaces increasingly employ menus as a flexible, intuitive means of enabling drivers (and passengers) to access functionality. In particular, this has been the case as the range of functionality on offer within vehicles has escalated and designers have sought ways of allowing users to interact with new information and services within the space-restricted vehicle environment [14]. The previous empirical and modelling research noted above concerning menu design has been conducted in conditions where a user has full vision available to navigate a menu to acquire a target. Under conditions where visual access to menus is time-limited (as is the case with driving), it is unclear whether the fundamental relationships observed in previous research exist to the same degree or even in the same form.

This paper describes a study based largely on the aforementioned experiments by Landauer and Nachbar [7] and Cockburn and Gutwin [6]. The overall aim was to identify recommendations for depth vs. breadth for in-vehicle user-interface menu hierarchies.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

A range of methods exist for assessing the safety-related impacts of in-vehicle user-interfaces (e.g. lane-change task, peripheral detection, occlusion). As noted by Burnett [14], methods vary according to the environment in which they operate (road, test track, simulator, laboratory, etc.), the task manipulations that arise (multiple task, single task loading, no tasks given, etc.) and the measures taken (driving performance, secondary performance, opinions, etc.). Despite considerable research and standards activities in this area, there is no universally agreed upon method for use by researchers and practitioners [12]. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages from different perspectives (validity, reliability, sensitivity, economy, usability, etc.).

The current paper utilises the Occlusion protocol as an example of a laboratory-based method in which single task loading is provided and measures are taken related to in-vehicle user-interface visual demand. An international standard [15] exists which describes the method in considerable detail and aims to ensure consistency in approach (through descriptions of how many participants are required, what the occlusion cycle should comprise, how much training to give, how many task variations to set, data analysis procedures, and so on).

With occlusion, participants carry out tasks with an in-vehicle system (stationary within a vehicle or vehicle mock up) whilst wearing computer-controlled goggles with LCDs as lenses which can open and shut in a precise manner. Consequently, by stipulating a cycle of vision for a short period of time (1.5s), followed by an occlusion interval (1.5s), glancing behaviour is mimicked in a controlled fashion. Two key metrics are stipulated:
                        
                           •
                           Total Shutter Open Time (TSOT – the total time required to carry out tasks when vision is available)

Resumability (R – the ratio of total shutter open time to task time when full vision is provided, considered to provide an indication of the ease by which a task can be resumed following a period without vision [16].

The occlusion approach was selected for this study as it offers a relatively simple method of assessing the visual demand of an in-vehicle user-interface based on performance data. A key advantage of occlusion is that criteria now exist defining acceptable/unacceptable limits for TSOT and R. The US-based Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (AAM) states that tasks where TSOT is greater than 15s are unacceptable [17] and should not be operated by a driver in a moving vehicle. This value was derived based on relationships between the number/duration of glances and the likelihood of lane deviations [18,19]. Moreover, the value considers the visual demand associated with an established “acceptable” in-vehicle secondary task, manually tuning a radio [17,19]. Alternatively, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) state “the operation of a display monitor is prohibited” for tasks with TSOT values greater than 7.5s ([20], p. 7). This more conservative value was predominately based on research, later reported by Asoh and Iihoshi [21], which focused on drivers’ feelings of anxiety whilst performing secondary tasks of varying visual demand. More recently, Stevens, Burnett and Horberry [22] defined a criterion value for TSOT (termed a Demand Reference Level-DRL) which accounted for the variability in data from occlusion studies. The DRL was based on a review of the literature, together with data from their own occlusion studies, expert reviews and a survey of drivers’ attitudes. An equation stated that TSOT (mean+“spread”) should be less than 8.0s.

The latest research in this area has recently been summarised in a new set of guidelines published in February, 2012 that have emerged from the US [23]. This work follows a similar approach to the original AAM proposals, but includes more recent research relating to the visual demand of varying user-interfaces [24]. Importantly, the final recommendation is closer to the JAMA and Stevens et al. view, in that they consider that tasks are unacceptable if TSOT is greater than 9s.

With respect to the Resumability Ratio (R), as discussed in the driver metrics international report [25], an R value of 1.0 is often considered the cut-off. If R is greater than 1.0, it is assumed that an individual is likely to be experiencing difficulties resuming a task following an occluded period.

Research has examined the validity of the occlusion approach and concluded that the method can predict key visual demand measures from road and simulator studies. For instance, Pettitt et al. [26] evaluated two user-interfaces using occlusion and a road study. The occlusion metrics were subsequently compared with a range of traditional visual demand measures (glance frequency, glance duration, dynamic task time, percentage of time with eyes off road). The comparison found that TSOT and R were able to differentiate between the two designs for all measures apart from glance duration. Baumann et al. [16] and Noy et al. [27] have made similar comparisons in their research and reached the same conclusions regarding the usefulness of the method. Importantly, Uno et al. [28] recently compared the results of a road study with the data from simulator and occlusion approaches and concluded that TSOT was the most sensitive measure with the greatest link to the safety-related impacts of secondary tasks.

Nevertheless, it is important to note that the occlusion protocol is not without its critics (e.g. [29,30]. Critically, the method does not involve performing a driving-like task together with a secondary task, as would generally be the case when interacting with an information display in the real world. Moreover, the protocol paces users in their visual access to a display. Finally, concerns have been expressed about the diagnostic ability of the Resumability Ratio, as values can be difficult to interpret [31]. Specifically, a value obtained in a study will be affected by two conflicting characteristics of a task, the extent to which a task requires reorientation following an occluded period (acting to raise R) and the potential for non-visual interaction (acting to lower R).

To combat some of these concerns, researchers have recently considered the use of tasks during the occluded period (e.g. [32,33]). Whilst such endeavours undoubtedly increase the face validity of the method, they inevitably raise significantly the complexity of the protocol whilst simultaneously reducing the likelihood of the method being used in practice.

@&#METHOD@&#

As far as possible, the current study aimed to follow the method as described within the Landauer and Nachbar [7] research. In addition, the unstructured (random) menu hierarchy condition described by the Cockburn and Gutwin [6] paper was utilised. The overall research was conducted within the context of an occlusion protocol [15].

In accordance with the ISO occlusion protocol, ten people were recruited for the study (5 males; 5 females). All were experienced drivers (mean number of years with licence 12, range 2–33; mean miles driven in last 12months 6000, range 3000–12,000). Twenty percent (2 from 10) of the participants were aged over 50. All participants were reimbursed for their time.

Plato occlusion goggles were used for the study. These use LCD panels and are commonly used in research studies in this area [34]. A 9-inch resistive touchscreen was fitted in the centre console of a right-hand drive car and used for the study. Audio feedback was given on button presses through speakers within the car. The vehicle was part of a driving simulator facility and was stationary throughout. Fig. 1
                         shows the equipment set-up used in the study.

A set of 4096 words were used as target stimuli in the study. These were all 4–14 characters long and chosen randomly from an on-line English dictionary. Participants had a goal word written at the top of each screen. Their task was to find the range that included the goal word from each screen and then press the button for that range in order to move onto the next screen (see Fig. 2
                        ). On the last screen, the task was slightly different. In this case, the goal word was contained within a button and participants had to find and select this button. A separate goal word was used for each task.

The following breadth/depth menu hierarchies were used in the study (within subjects independent variable): 16×3; 8×4; 4×6; 12×2. In addition, the following two types of structure were imposed on the menus (within subjects independent variable):
                           
                              •
                              Structured – word ranges were listed alphabetically within a screen.

Unstructured – word ranges were arranged randomly.

Finally, participants completed tasks either under conditions of occlusion or with full vision (within subjects independent variable).


                        Fig. 3
                         shows how the study design incorporated the three independent variables. The type of structure was the primary block for the study and was counterbalanced, such that half the participants completed tasks with structured menus first and unstructured second, and half the opposite. Within a structured menu or unstructured menu block, each participant completed the menu navigation tasks either with full vision or under conditions of occlusion. The ordering of full vision and occlusion was also counterbalanced. Five variants of each individual task for the specific menu breadth/depth combinations were carried out. The order of these was randomised. Therefore, the total number of tasks undertaken by each participant in the study was 2×2×4×5=80.

The time to complete tasks was calculated automatically by the system software (based on when the goggles initially opened and when the final target button was pressed). This time was used to calculate the three dependent variables:

Total Shutter Open Time (TSOT) – time required with vision to carry out tasks, under conditions of occlusion – i.e. the sum of the vision intervals;
                           
                              •
                              Static task time (STT) – time required to carry out tasks with full vision, i.e. without conditions of occlusion (referred to as Total Task Time Unoccluded in the ISO occlusion standard [13]);

Resumability Ratio – The ratio of TSOT to STT.

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

The study was split into two separate sessions run on separate days; one for structured menus and one for unstructured menus. The two sessions took place within 5–7days of each other. On arrival at the research laboratory for the first session, participants read an instruction sheet, and then completed a consent form and a short questionnaire. They were introduced to the occlusion goggles and the vehicle cabin/touchscreen and given time to familiarise themselves with the equipment and environment. A training procedure was in place, such that participants completed several practice trials with each task prior to an experimental phase.

When the experimenter was confident that participants were expert performers of the tasks, they undertook the experimental phase, in which blocks of five variants of individual tasks were experienced in succession. Short breaks (less than one minute) were permitted between each of these blocks of tasks. A longer break (approximately five minutes) was permitted after twenty tasks (i.e. after either all the occluded or full vision tasks had been encountered). The experimenter was present in a separate room throughout the study and communicated with participants using an intercom. Each session took approximately 1h to complete.

@&#RESULTS@&#


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the mean total shutter open times (TSOT) and the static task times (STT) for each of the structured menus used in the study. The values relate to the times taken to locate and select the final target word within the different hierarchies. The graph highlights that TSOT was generally lower than STT throughout, and that broader, shallower menus led to quicker acquisition times than narrower, deeper menus. Resumability ratios were calculated from these data and revealed similar values for R across the different structured menus (mean R
                        =0.69–0.74).


                        Figs. 5 and 6
                        
                         show the mean TSOT and STT values plotted as cumulative time to navigate through the different structured menu levels. The graphs also highlight the advantage for broader, shallower menus over narrower, deeper menus, which is particularly evident for STT (Fig. 6).


                        Fig. 7
                         shows the results for mean TSOT and STT for individual screens experienced by participants with structured menus. The final screen was removed from this analysis, as the task was different from all other screens (recognising and selecting final target, rather than selecting range for target). A natural logarithmic relationship was apparent and plots were made to show the trendlines (and accompanying equations) associated with the data (For TSOT, r
                        2
                        =0.990; for STT, r
                        2
                        =0.997).

For the TSOT values, based on the relationships given above, the following equation was generated:
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 TSOT
                                 
                                 (
                                 structured menus)
                                 =
                                 D
                                 (
                                 0.87
                                 +
                                 1.24
                                 
                                    
                                       log
                                    
                                    
                                       e
                                    
                                 
                                 B
                                 )
                              
                           
                        where D
                        =Depth of menu, and B
                        =Breadth of menu.

This equation was then used to calculate predicted combinations of depths and breadths of menus based on the acceptable/unacceptable cut-off values for TSOT within the literature of 7.5s for JAMA [20], 9s for NHTSA [23] and 15s for AAM [17] – see Fig. 8
                        . The demand reference level stipulated by Stevens, Burnett and Horberry [22] was also calculated based on the study data using the mean and 85th percentile values. However, the curve has not been included in the figure, because values were extremely similar to the JAMA profile [20].


                        Fig. 9
                         shows the mean total shutter open times (TSOT) and the static task times (STT) for each of the unstructured menus used in the study. The values relate to the times taken to locate and select the final target word within the different hierarchies. The graph highlights that TSOT was generally lower than STT throughout, and a U-shaped relationship exists, such that values are greatest for the “extreme” menus (i.e. either high breadth or high depth). As before, resumability ratios were calculated from these data and revealed similar values for R across the different unstructured menus (mean R
                        =0.70–0.73).


                        Figs. 10 and 11
                        
                         show the mean TSOT and STT values plotted as cumulative time to navigate through the different structure levels. The graphs highlight how values are very similar between the different menu hierarchies.


                        Fig. 12
                         shows the results for mean TSOT and STT for individual screens experienced by participants with unstructured menus. As for structured menus, the final screen was removed from this analysis. A quadratic relationship best fitted the data in these conditions, and plots were made to show the trendlines (and accompanying equations) associated with the data (For TSOT, r
                        2
                        =0.999; for STT, r
                        2
                        =0.999).

For the TSOT values, based on the relationships given above, the following equation was generated:

This equation was then used to calculate predicted combinations of depths and breadths of menus based on the cut-off TSOT values from previous work [20,23,17] – see Fig. 13
                        . As for structured menus, the curve based on Stevens, Burnett and Horberry [22] was omitted from the diagram as it followed a very similar profile to JAMA [20].

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

It is apparent from the data that TSOT values are generally less than STT values, regardless of whether menus are structured or unstructured in arrangement or the depth/breadth combination. Correspondingly, the resumability ratios are consistently less than 1.0, reflecting the fact that navigating a menu hierarchy is not wholly a visual task and it is still possible for people to progress a task during a shutter closed (occluded) period. For instance, vision is not required when moving a hand towards a target in anticipation of the next step or pressing a button once the hand has been located. Given the safety implications of visual distraction, it is important for designers to minimise the visual demand of in-vehicle controls and displays. Nevertheless, given the similarity in R values throughout, it is apparent that key variables associated with menu design (breadth/depth and structure) have no noticeable effect on how easy a task is to resume and/or the extent to which a user can carry out a task without vision.

The current study replicated as far as possible the methods reported in Landauer and Nachbar [7] for structured menus and Cockburn and Gutwin [6] for unstructured (random) menus. Consequently, it was expected that mean values for STT would be similar to the response times observed in previous studies. Fig. 14
                      shows the values reported across the different studies.

The comparative analysis shows similar trends in the data between the current study and previous studies. In particular, the mean values for the current study were very similar to that reported in Cockburn and Gutwin [6] for both structured and unstructured menus. Differences are apparent between the current study and the work of Landauer and Nachbar [7] for structured menus. For unstructured menus, there is also a disparity in results for 2×12 menu hierarchies across studies. These variations may have reflected specific differences in experimental set up not apparent from the method description.

Following the occlusion protocol, it is apparent that breadth is still favoured over depth for structured menus. However, this is not the case for unstructured menus. This is similar to previous conclusions (e.g. [6]) and reflects the fact that, with structured menus, users are able to adopt efficient scanning, by “jumping” visually to an appropriate target within the screen. For unstructured menus this benefit is lost and users must instead evaluate each possibility in turn. This difference in inherent strategy becomes particularly apparent in performance terms for high breadth menus.

This research provides two preliminary equations (1 and 2) for use by vehicle designers in predicting the visual demand of alternative user-interfaces based on knowledge of the breadth and depth of the menu hierarchy. The equations account for whether a user can anticipate the location of an option (structured vs. unstructured menu in this study). For the former, a logarithmic relationship is observed, reflecting the fact that a sub-division strategy is evident, as has been shown for situations where full vision is available for a task (e.g. [7]).

Conversely, for unstructured menus a quadratic relationship between menu breadth/depth and acquisition time was found. It was anticipated that a linear relationship would be evident, in line with previous research (e.g. [6,3]), although it was recognised from the discussion section of the Landauer and Nachbar paper [7] (p. 77) that other functions were possible for unstructured menus. A potential reason for the disparity may lie in the nature of the hand ‘movement’ used across research studies. For our study, users selected options directly using their finger/s on the touchscreen (as was the case for the Landauer and Nachbar [7] study), whereas in previous research with unstructured menus, selections were made with a mouse. These differences will inevitably affect the relative dominance of the movement time (modelled as a logarithmic function according to Fitts Law) with the search time component of overall acquisition time.


                     Figs. 8 and 13 are intended to be of particular use to designers as they highlight predicted TSOT values for different combinations of breadth and depth for both structured and unstructured menus. They can also be used to compare a design solution against emerging acceptable/unacceptable cut off values. For instance, as noted in Section 2, JAMA [20] recommend a TSOT value of less than 7.5s for in-vehicle tasks. Using Fig. 8, this would indicate that a menu hierarchy with four options on a screen, where the location of an option can be anticipated (either due to familiarity on inherent structure), should contain no more than three levels of menu. When the location of an option cannot be anticipated, Fig. 13 highlights that there should be no more than two levels of menu, when four options are available on each screen. If a designer consents to a higher TSOT value (e.g. those recommended by NHTSA [23] or AAM [17]), then greater values for breadth/depth will be possible.

It is important to note that these specific predictions assume a menu navigation task similar to those used in this study. In reality, a wide range of other variables will impact on acquisition times, some relevant to the visual search (e.g. target terms, font sizes/types, colours) and some relevant to hand movements (e.g. button sizes/shapes/spacing). Nevertheless, according to previous research (e.g. [1]), these variables will only affect the constants used in acquisition time predictions, rather than fundamental relationships. Accordingly, it is possible to state the generic relationship existing for structured and unstructured menus, as follows:

@&#FUTURE WORK@&#

The approach taken by this paper has been to derive predictive models for user performance based on empirical data collected using the well-established occlusion protocol. As such, it has been possible to predict measures specific to the visual demand of in-vehicle user-interfaces. Menu navigation is an example of a user-interface mechanism commonly used for in-vehicle interfaces and has been the focus of this study. Nevertheless, several other mechanisms exist (e.g. list scrolling, reading, typing) and future work should consider how predictions could be made for visual demand in the wider range of cases. In particular, it is useful to note that list scrolling has many similarities with menu navigation (also noted by Cockburn and Gutwin [6]) as a user-interface mechanism. In both cases, users are required to navigate to an initially unseen target which can vary in ‘distance’ from the starting point. Whereas ‘distance’ in menu navigation is measured as depth, for a list it may be represented by the number of options to scroll through before reaching the target. Lists are commonly employed in vehicle interfaces (e.g. for music options, previous/stored destinations, contacts) and it will be important to verify in future research whether the relationships observed in this study hold for list scrolling. This will be particularly important to study given the evolving technologies being utilised for touchscreens (e.g. capacitive vs. resistive) and the range of gestures possible (e.g. momentum scrolling) which may create significant visual demand.

It is believed the results of this study are applicable to a broad range of design situations in which the visual demand of a user-interface is paramount – for instance, using a device in degraded visual conditions (e.g. firefighters, divers) or walking/running while interacting with a touchscreen device. The results are also particularly important given the prevalence of menu-structures in the now ubiquitous hand-held devices such as smart phones and tablets. For these applications, the outcome of an optimally designed interface is likely to result in increased customer satisfaction [36] in addition to any performance benefits. Future work should investigate these possibilities.

Finally, it is important to note that research must consider a wider range of menu designs under conditions of divided attention. It will then be possible to derive constants for equations which are robust and are applicable to a wide range of design possibilities. Such a situation has now been achieved with respect to Fitts Law, such that ‘rule of thumb’ constant values are well known and commonly used for making rapid predictions of movement time [33,6].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper reports on a study investigating the relationships between menu depth and breadth when considering the driving situation, where the visual demand of a user-interface is paramount. It is concluded that the breadth of a menu (number of options on a screen) is favoured over depth (number of screens to navigate through) for menus where a user can anticipate where a search term is located on a screen. If top-down processing cannot be used, there is no clear preference for breadth or depth in a menu hierarchy.

It is anticipated that the predictions offered by the preliminary equations given in this paper will be of assistance to designers considering the trade-offs associated with user-interface design in the driving context. Future work should consider a wider range of common user-interface mechanisms using the occlusion protocol, including list scrolling, reading and alphanumeric data entry and also investigate the applicability of results to a broader range of contexts in which visual demand measures are paramount.
