                  Two methods of reducing the risk of disruptions to distribution systems are (1) strategically locating facilities to mitigate against disruptions and (2) hardening facilities. These two activities have been treated separately in most of the academic literature. This article integrates facility location and facility hardening decisions by studying the minimax facility location and hardening problem (MFLHP), which seeks to minimize the maximum distance from a demand point to its closest located facility after facility disruptions. The formulation assumes that the decision maker is risk averse and thus interested in mitigating against the facility disruption scenario with the largest consequence, an objective that is appropriate for modeling facility interdiction. By taking advantage of the MFLHP’s structure, a natural three-stage formulation is reformulated as a single-stage mixed-integer program (MIP). Rather than solving the MIP directly, the MFLHP can be decomposed into sub-problems and solved using a binary search algorithm. This binary search algorithm is the basis for a multi-objective algorithm, which computes the Pareto-efficient set for the pre- and post-disruption maximum distance. The multi-objective algorithm is illustrated in a numerical example, and experimental results are presented that analyze the tradeoff between objectives.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This article addresses the problem of finding a set of facilities to locate and a set to protect in order to optimally mitigate against facility disruptions. In particular, the objective of the problem is to minimize the worst-case consequence incurred due to the disruption of facilities. Thus, this objective is appropriate for a situation in which facilities are subject to interdiction, i.e., attacks by an intelligent adversary. After a disruption occurs, a set of demand points are each assigned to their closest non-disrupted facility. Thus, the consequence of a disruption is measured as the maximum travel distance, i.e., the maximum distance from any demand point to its closest located and operating facility. We call this problem the minimax facility location-hardening problem (MFLHP). Further, this article also analyzes a bi-objective version of the MFLHP, simultaneously considering the maximum travel distance both with and without disruptions.

Distribution networks, such as power networks and supply chains, are ubiquitous throughout the world. These networks consist of a set of facilities (power sub-stations, ports, distribution centers, etc.) and set of customers that rely on the facilities. Because these facilities form the backbone of distribution networks, facility disruptions often result in severe consequences. One recent example is the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, which disrupted manufacturing facilities and caused several Japanese automakers to halt car production for up to six months (Kim, 2012). These severe consequences have forced decision-makers to consider the possibility of facility disruptions when they design their network of facilities. In addition, decision-makers also may choose to harden facilities to protect them from disruptions. Facility hardening, a special case of facility protection, involves allocating resources to a facility (e.g., additional security, retrofitting, etc.) to make it immune to failure (Scaparra & Church, 2008a, 2008b; Smith, 2011). This paper serves to help decision-makers make better facility location and hardening decisions by providing a mathematical model of these decisions and using this model to generate insights about these decisions.

This research focuses on the maximum distance objective, which is also used in the classic p-center problem (Hakimi, 1965). Since this objective is concerned with minimizing the worst service experienced by a demand point, it is appropriate for the public sector (Daskin, 2000). Researchers have cited numerous potential applications for the maximum distance objective such as locating emergency vehicles and facilities (Hochbaum & Pathria, 1997; Mladenovic, Labbe, & Hansen, 2003; Scaparra, Pallottino, & Scutella, 2004) and locating warning sirens (Suzuki & Drezner, 1996). This article also seeks to minimize the worst-case disruption, i.e., the worst-case risk measure. The worst-case risk measure is well-suited for risk-averse decision-makers, especially in critical infrastructure protection (Church & Scaparra, 2007; Salmeron, Wood, & Baldick, 2009; Scaparra & Church, 2008b).

A growing amount of research exists on locating facilities subject to disruptions and hardening facilities subject to disruptions. Several authors (Cui, Ouyang, & Shen, 2011; Drezner, 1987; O’Hanley, Paola Scaparra, & Garcia, 2013; Snyder & Daskin, 2005) have developed models for locating facilities subject to random disruptions. Other works have considered that located facilities are subject to interdiction, i.e., intentional and calculated attacks. O’Hanley and Church (2011) developed a bi-level model for the problem of locating facilities to minimize the post-interdiction total weighted covered demand. Drezner (1987) developed a method to minimize the post-interdiction maximum distance from a demand point to its closest located and operating facility. O’Hanley and Church (2011) optimized a weighted combination of the system performance before and after interdiction for a facility location problem.

Rather than locating facilities, others have examined the problem of hardening a set of existing facilities. O’Hanley, Church, and Gilless (2007b) and Li, Zeng, and Savachkin (2013) have presented models for hardening facilities subject to random failures. Church and Scaparra (2007) and Scaparra and Church (2008a, 2008b) have studied the problem of how to harden facilities in order to minimize the post-interdiction total weighted distance. O’Hanley, Church, and Gilless (2007a) presented a bi-level model to optimally harden facilities in order to minimize the post-interdiction total weighted covered demand.

Some researchers have developed models that include both facility location and facility hardening. Snyder and Daskin (2005) present extensions of the p-median and warehouse location models and include perfectly reliable, i.e., hardened, and unreliable facility locations in their model. Specifically, a facility is perfectly reliable if and only if it is located at a perfectly reliable location. Although their study focuses on location, it would be possible to integrate location and hardening decisions in their model if every geographical site had both a reliable and an unreliable location. However, it is unclear whether using their model in this way, which would double its size, would be computationally tractable. Lim, Daskin, Chopra, and Bassamboo (2010) were the first to explicitly include both location and hardening decisions in a single model. They present an extension of the warehouse location problem in which the decision maker chooses between locating unreliable facilities and locating perfectly reliable, i.e., hardened, backup facilities at a higher cost. The authors assume one layer of supplier backup. Thus, if a demand point’s primary facility fails, the demand point is then immediately assigned to its hardened backup without checking if there is a closer operating facility. This assumption simplifies the model and allows the authors to provide several useful analytical results. Li et al. (2013) extend the work of Lim et al. (2010) but still assume one layer of supplier backup. The research presented in this paper considers multiple layers of backup, allowing a demand point to be assigned to its closest operating facility after a disruption. Aksen, Aras, and Piyade (2013) study an extension of the p-median problem in which facilities are susceptible to interdiction. They present a tri-level version of the budget-constrained median location model in which a defender locates and hardens facilities and then an attacker destroys a number of unhardened facilities. Their works extends the work of Lim et al. (2010) by modeling multiple layers of backup. Aksen et al. (2013) study several methods for solving their problem including a tabu search algorithm and a two-phase heuristic. The research in this paper builds on the work of Aksen et al. (2013) by providing an exact procedure for solving the integrated location-hardening problem, rather than a heuristic procedure.

This article builds upon the facility location and facility hardening literatures by making the following main contributions. (1) A new model for integrating facility location and hardening decisions; in particular, a natural three-level formulation is converted to a single-level mixed-integer program (MIP) by taking advantage of the structure of the MFLHP. This model is accompanied by a binary search solution procedure along with a method for obtaining a lower bound. (2) This integrated model and solution method forms the basis of an algorithm that computes the complete Pareto-efficient set for the pre- and post-disruption maximum distances. This algorithm is based on a method from Medal, Rainwater, Pohl, and Rossetti (2013) that optimizes facility location decisions but does not model facility hardening. (3) A set of computational experiments provide results that should help decision-makers better understand the tradeoff between the pre- and post-disruption maximum distances when making the decision to locate and harden facilities subject to disruptions. Toward this end we present the following analyses: (i) an analysis of the Pareto-efficient set between the pre- and post-disruption maximum distances; (ii) an analysis of the penalty incurred for optimizing either the pre- or post-disruption radius in isolation; and (iii) an analysis of the benefit of considering facility hardening when locating facilities subject to disruptions.

The remainder of this article is as follows. In Section 2 the MFLHP is described and a three-level model of the problem is converted to a single-level MIP. In Section 3, two algorithms are presented for single- and bi-objective versions of the MFLHP. An example that demonstrates the bi-objective MFLHP is given in Section 4. Section 5 reports the results of computational experiments on the single- and bi-objective MFLHP. Section 5 concludes the article with a summary and a discussion of future work.

The purpose of the MFLHP model is to
                        
                           locate a set of facilities and harden a subset of the located facilities in order to minimize the worst system performance over all possible disruption scenarios consisting of the disruption of r facilities. The system performance for a disruption scenario is the maximum distance from a demand point to its closest located and operating facility.
                        
                     
                  

The MFLHP model is appropriate for two situations: (1) facilities are vulnerable to naturally-caused disruptions and the decision-maker wishes to mitigate against the worst-case consequence due to the loss of r facilities and (2) facilities are subject to a strategic attacker who seeks to attack up to r facilities in order to generate the largest consequence possible and the decision-maker wishes to mitigate against these attacks.

To understand the model, it may help to divide it into three stages: (1) the mitigation, (2) the disruption, and (3) the response. We use the generic term facility to refer to a physical entity that we are locating and hardening. The mitigation stage, which happens before the disruption occurs, involves actions taken to mitigate against the disruption. The mitigation decisions in our model concern where to locate facilities and which facilities to harden, and these decisions are made simultaneously. If a facility is hardened in our model, it is always available to serve demand points. In the disruption stage, the disruption causes exactly r facilities to fail. Thus, if p facilities are located, there are 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             p
                                          
                                       
                                       
                                          
                                             r
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                      combinations of facility disruptions. (Later, we show that we do not have to consider all combinations.) In the response stage, demand points are served by their closest located facility. Since the decision in this stage is so simple – find the closest facility to each demand point – this stage will be implicit in the model.

To understand the three-stage model, it is helpful to think of it as consisting of three players acting in sequence: a defender, an attacker, and an operator. In the first stage, the defender mitigates against the actions of the attacker by strategically locating and hardening facilities. The defender’s objective is to minimize the attacker’s objective. The attacker, knowing the location and hardening actions taken by the defender, then destroys r facilities. The objective of the attacker is to maximize the operator’s objective, i.e., maximize the post-disruption radius. The operator, observing the actions of the attacker, pairs each demand point with its closest available facility in order to minimize the post-disruption radius.

The following notation will be used to describe the problem. Let

                      is the set of located facilities that fail in a disruption; at most r facilities can fail in a disruption. A set of demand points is represented by the set 
                        
                           J
                        
                     . We measure how effectively a facility located at i can serve the demand point located at j using a measure ϕ
                     
                        ij
                     . The measure ϕ
                     
                        ij
                      could be the distance between i and j or a function of the distance between i and j. It could also represent the distance multiplied by the demand weight w
                     
                        j
                     . Let Φ be a map that holds the assignments of demand points to facilities; thus, Φ(j) is the facility assigned to demand point j.

Thus, the defender’s optimal objective value, U
                     (r)∗, is equal to the optimal value of the following three-level optimization problem:

                     . The interdictor can only destroy r facilities. The operator’s problem (1c) is to assign demand points to facilities. Since the operator’s problem is uncapacitated, it is optimal to assign every demand point to its closest facility. Thus, the operator’s problem can be represented by taking the maximum distance from any demand point to its closest non-disrupted facility.

Rather than trying to solve the three-stage formulation, the MFLHP’s structure can be exploited to formulate a single-stage model. In particular, because of the minimax distance objective of the integrated MFLHP model, the interdictor’s optimal solution can be described as a simple expression.

Because of the structure of the interdictor’s problem, we can determine exactly which facilities the interdictor would want to destroy to optimize his objective without having to solve an optimization problem. After the sets

                              . Since the interdictor is a maximizer and the problem has the bottleneck property (i.e., the interdictor’s objective value depends on only one demand point), he or she will focus on the demand point with the largest PDAD upper bound. □

The following corollary, following directly from Theorem 1, provides a simple expression of the interdictor’s optimal objective value, which will help simplify the three-level model.

The objective (6a) is to minimize the post-disruption radius, which is the defender’s objective. Constraints (6b) require that the interdictor’s objective is equal to the maximum of all of the PDAD upper bounds, obeying Proposition 1. Constraints (6c) ensure that the PDAD upper bound for a demand point j is equal to

                         in an optimal solution. Constraints (6d) require every demand point to have an upper bound. Constraints (6e), although not necessary because of the presence of Constraints (6c), tighten the LP relaxation. Constraints (6f) prevent non-located facilities from becoming hardened. Constraint (6g) is a budget on the location and hardening costs. Constraints (6h) and (6i) require that the variables be binary.

Constraints (7c) and (7d) are revised versions of Constraints (6e) and (6g), respectively. Preliminary tests showed that the alternate Model (7) solved faster than Model (6).

Model (6) can be solved using an off-the-shelf MIP optimizer such as CPLEX. However, preliminary experiments indicated that this approach would be computationally prohibitive. Because of the bottleneck structure of the integrated MFLHP model, we chose to use a binary search (BS) algorithm instead. Hochbaum and Shmoys (1986) showed that all bottleneck problems can be solved by solving a series of auxiliary problems within a binary search algorithm that searches over values in the set of all possible radii. These auxiliary problems can be thought of as inverses of their corresponding bottleneck problem. Specifically, this auxiliary problem takes a radius value as an input and outputs the cost of covering all objects within that radius.

Empirical evidence has shown that a binary search algorithm works well for the p-center problem, which is also a bottleneck problem (Elloumi, Labbé, & Pochet, 2004). The p-center problem is to find a set of p located facilities that minimize the radius. The auxiliary problem for the p-center problem is the set-cover problem with unitary costs, which is still an NP-hard problem (Johnson, 1974). If some radius δ is given as an input to the set-cover problem, the set-cover problem outputs how many facilities must be located, i.e., the cost, so that all demand points are covered within δ. Let U
                     (0)∗ be the optimal radius and p
                     ∗(δ) be the optimal number of facilities needed to cover all demand points within δ. If p
                     ∗(δ) is greater than or equal to p, then U
                     (0)∗ is at least δ and δ is a new lower bound. If p
                     ∗(δ) is less than p, then U
                     (0)∗ is at most δ and δ is a new upper bound. Thus, a binary search can be performed over all values of δ to find the optimal radius, U
                     (0)∗. Binary search has been shown to be an effective solution method for the p-center problem because the set-cover problem with unitary costs is easier to solve than the p-center problem itself.

Similar to the solution approach for the p-center problem, in this article we solve the integrated MFLHP using a binary search algorithm. However, we use an auxiliary problem that is tailored for the MFLHP along with new upper and lower bounds and a new heuristic.

To use a binary search algorithm for the integrated MFLHP, the auxiliary problem must first be described. Define U
                        (r) as the radius for the auxiliary problem. (Note that U
                        (r) is now a parameter and not a variable, as it was in Model (6).) To evaluate whether a particular U
                        (r) is above or below the optimal post-disruption radius, the set-cover problem with location and hardening (SCP-LH) is used:

The SCP-LH minimizes the cost required for every demand point to have a post-disruption assignment distance less than or equal to U
                        (r). The objective (8a) is to minimize the total cost of location and hardening. Constraints (8b) require that for each demand point j, either r
                        +1 facilities within U
                        (r) of j must be located or at least one facility within U
                        (r) of j must be hardened. Since the set-cover problem is a special case of SCP-LH(U
                        (r), r) (set r
                        =0 and set f

                        (r), r) is also NP-hard.

Note that an alternate version of SCP-LH can be constructed by redefining the X and Y variables as in Section 2.4. In this alternate model the objective (8a) changes to

                        , but Constraints (8b) remain unchanged. We refer to this alternate model as SCP-LH-Alt. Because SCP-LH-Alt outperformed SCP-LH in preliminary testing, we use SCP-LH-Alt throughout the rest of this paper.

The binary search algorithm for the integrated MFLHP is similar to the binary search algorithm for the p-center problem. In addition to the modified auxiliary problem, we also add a heuristic for the auxiliary problem and use a polynomial algorithm to obtain bounds for the integrated MFLHP. The binary search algorithm is described in Medal (2012).

Before starting the binary search, we attempt to find good upper and lower bounds for the integrated MFLHP to reduce the search space of the algorithm. In particular, we apply the binary search algorithm to the linear-programming relaxation of the auxiliary problem (8). Let the binary search algorithm that uses the linear-programming relaxation of the auxiliary problem be called the relaxed binary search algorithm. This idea was first employed by Elloumi et al. (2004) for the p-center problem.

We compute a binary search (BS) lower bound for the MFHLP by applying the relaxed binary search algorithm. The optimal radius returned by the relaxed binary search algorithm is a lower bound to the integrated MFHLP. We add the following step to the relaxed binary search algorithm so that it also returns an upper bound. Each iteration of the relaxed binary search algorithm produces a new midpoint index; let D
                        
                           index
                         be the distance corresponding to this index. To obtain a heuristic upper bound, solve SCP-LH-Alt (D
                        
                           index
                        ) using a greedy algorithm (see Medal, 2012). This greedy algorithm extends an algorithm by Balas and Ho (1980) for the set cover problem and sequentially adds facilities to be located and hardened based on their costs of location and hardening and how many additional demand points they can cover. If the total cost of this heuristic solution to SCP-LH-Alt (D
                        
                           index
                        ) is less than the budget (b), then D
                        
                           index
                         is a new incumbent lowest upper bound.

There are other ways to obtain bounds for the integrated MFLHP. A linear-programming lower bound (LP) can be obtained by solving the linear-programming relaxation of the MIP Model (6). A partial relaxation (PR) lower bound can be obtained by solving the MIP Model (6) with only X
                        
                           i
                         and Y
                        
                           i
                         relaxed for all i. In our experimentation, we found that the BS lower bound required much less run time than the PR lower bound and yet the BS lower bounds were reasonably close (16% relative error, on average) to the PR lower bounds.

Although the MFLHP optimizes the post-disruption radius (PostDR), decision-makers may also be concerned about the pre-disruption radius (PreDR), especially if disruptions are rare. Because these two objectives conflict, an effective solution approach is to generate a set of Pareto-efficient solutions, allowing a decision-maker to choose from among them based on his or her preferences.

Because the binary search algorithm presented in Section 3.2 efficiently computes the optimal solution to the MFLHP, it can also be used to efficiently compute the Pareto-efficient set for multiple objectives. To describe how to compute the Pareto-efficient set for the pre-disruption and post-disruption radii, let us introduce two new optimization problems. Let MFLHP(·, U
                        (r)) denote the problem “minimize the pre-disruption radius such that the post-disruption radius is no greater than U
                        (r), and MFLHP(U
                        (0), ·) denote the problem “minimize the post-disruption radius such that the pre-disruption radius is no greater than U
                        (0). Both of these problems can be solved using a modification of the binary search algorithm from Section 3.2. Specifically, a single-cover constraint is added to the SCP-LH(U
                        (r), r) auxiliary problem, resulting in the distance-constrained set-cover problem with location and hardening (DC-SCP-LH):

Given the problems MFLHP(·, U
                        (r)) and MFLHP(U
                        (0), ·), we can use the ∊-constraint method of multi-objective optimization (Cohon, 2004) to generate the Pareto-efficient set. The ∊-constraint method was used for the p-center problem with facility disruptions in Medal et al. (2013) and is modified in this article to include facility hardening. Specifically, the auxiliary problem DC-SCP-LH(U
                        (0), U
                        (r), r) is used in place of the auxiliary problem employed in Medal et al. (2013). Algorithm 1 describes this ∊-constraint method. On line 4, an upper bound is obtained by taking the maximum distance from a demand point j to its (r
                        +1)st closest facility site, denoted as

We will first demonstrate our research on a simplified example, using a dataset from Daskin (1995) that consists of 150 nodes representing the most populous cities in the United States. This example attempts to locate seven facilities to service each of the 150 demand points. To make solutions easier to visualize, each of the demand points are given a unit weight. Without considering facility disruptions, the design objective is to minimize the maximum distance from a demand point to its closest facility. Thus, this is the classic p-center problem (Hakimi, 1965). Because the p-center problem is known to produce many optimal solutions, we utilize the total distance as a secondary objective in all of the results presented in this section and the next. See Appendix A for a model that optimizes the total distance subject to constraints on the pre-disruption and post-disruption radii.


                     Fig. 1
                     (a) shows the optimal solution to this 7-center problem. Seven facilities are located in the optimal solution, and the (pre-disruption) radius for this solution is 420 miles. One limitation of the p-center model is that it may produce solutions that are vulnerable to facility disruptions. Fig. 1(b) shows how the solution is impacted by the worst-case facility disruption scenario consisting of the disruption of r
                     =3 facilities. Specifically, the demand points assigned to the facilities at Albequerque, NM; Boise City, ID; and Glendale, CA must be reassigned, causing the radius to increase. The new radius, the post-disruption radius, is 1624 miles which is a 286% increase over the pre-disruption radius.

A decision-maker is likely to be concerned about this 286% increase in the radius. To reduce the potential increase in the radius the MFLHP model can be used to locate and harden facilities. However, it is likely that the decision-maker is interested in both the pre-disruption and post-disruption radii. In many cases a decision-maker may not know his or her preferred tradeoff between the pre-disruption and post-disruption radii. Thus, it would be helpful if the decision-maker had a set of Pareto-efficient solutions to choose from. Fortunately, Algorithm 1 can be used to compute the Pareto-efficient set for the pre-disruption and post-disruption radii.


                     Fig. 2
                      shows the Pareto-efficient set for the pre-disruption and post-disruption radii. (For this example, we assume that the cost of hardening a facility is the same as the cost of locating a facility (e.g., g
                     
                        i
                     
                     =
                     f
                     
                        i
                     ).) The left and right endpoints of the Pareto set are obtained by optimizing the post-disruption and pre-disruption radii, respectively, in isolation. The Pareto set is relatively flat when the post-disruption radius is between 902 and 1381. This means the post-disruption radius can be decreased from 1381 to 902 (35% reduction) while only increasing the pre-disruption radius from 543 to 612 (13% increase). Overall, the slope of the curve is gradual, indicating that a large reduction in the post-disruption radius can be obtained with a modest increase in the pre-disruption radius. More analysis on the tradeoff between the pre-disruption and post-disruption radii is given in Section 5.1.


                     Fig. 3
                      shows three of the solutions corresponding to Pareto-efficient points in Fig. 2. Fig. 3a, c, and e shows the solutions and assignments without disruptions for solutions 6, 9, and 11 of the Pareto set in Fig. 2. Fig. 3b, d and f shows the post-disruption assignments. (Solution 1 is shown in Fig. 1.) As the Figures show, as the post-disruption radius receives more emphasis, less of the budget is spent on location and more is spent on hardening. A description of each of the solutions in Fig. 3(a)–(f) is given in the Supplemental material.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

This section reports the results of computational experimentation with the MFLHP. Section 5.1 analyzes the tradeoff between the pre-disruption radius and post-disruption radius. Section 5.2 analyzes the benefit of including facility hardening when locating facilities that are subject to disruptions.

All experiments were run on a compute node on the Arkansas High Performance Computing Cluster. The node has 2 Xeon X5670 Intel processors, which each have 6 cores and a clock speed of 2.93gigahertz. The total of 12 cores share 24gigabyte of memory. Computations were done on a 64-bit Linux operating system. All of the MIP and LP models, including the set-cover problems, were solved using CPLEX v12 Parallel MIP Optimizer with 12 parallel threads and default settings. The binary search algorithm was programmed in Java using CPLEX Concert technology.


                     Table 1
                      describes the datasets used in the experimentation. These datasets, taken from the facility location literature, vary in size (49–818 nodes), distance metric used (e.g., Euclidean, great circle, etc.), and whether demand weights and facility location costs are homogeneous or non-homogeneous. Column 2 shows the number of nodes in the dataset. Columns 3 and 4 indicate whether the demand weights and location costs are homogeneous (H) or non-homogeneous (NH). When a dataset has demand weights, then ϕ
                     
                        ij
                      is the weighted distance; otherwise it is the unweighted distance. Some of the datasets are based on geographical data and some are not. Column 6 indicates which distance metric is used: Euclidean, Great Circle, or road distances measured from real data.


                     Table 2
                      gives a list of all of the parameters that were varied in our experimentation. First, the budget (b) for a particular instance is a percentage of the cost of locating every facility. Therefore, letting B be the budget multiplier, the budget (b) equals

                     . Second, the cost of hardening a facility located at i is a multiple of the cost of locating a facility at i. That is, g
                     
                        i
                     
                     =
                     Hf
                     
                        i
                     , where H is the hardening cost multiplier. The number of facility disruptions, r, was also varied. To facilitate comparison across datasets, r
                     =1 and r
                     =2 were considered for all datasets. We also considered the number of disruptions to be a percentage of the number of facility locations.

As discussed in Section 3.3, a decision-maker may be interested in the tradeoff between the pre-disruption radius and the post-disruption radius. In this section, this tradeoff is analyzed from two perspectives. First, the Pareto-efficient set is displayed in Section 5.1.1. Second, Section 5.1.2 addresses the question: If the post-disruption radius is optimized in isolation, what is the effect on the pre-disruption radius, and vice versa? Finally, the computation time for the multi-objective algorithm is reported in Section 5.1.3.


                           Fig. 4
                            shows Pareto-efficient sets for the pre-disruption and post-disruption radii for several instances of the d49 and lon150 datasets with the cost of hardening a facility equal to the cost of locating a facility (e.g., g
                           
                              i
                           
                           =
                           f
                           
                              i
                           ). Each Pareto set was generated using Algorithm 1. The point in the southwest corner of the plot is the solution for zero interdictions; thus, the pre- and post-disruption radii are equal for this point.

Two main observations can be made from Fig. 4.
                              
                                 1.
                                 
                                    Tradeoff ratio. The plots become steeper as the post-disruption radius decreases in Fig. 4b, c, and d. This indicates that as the post-disruption decreases, the tradeoff ratio (i.e., the marginal increase in the pre-disruption radius per unit decrease in the post-disruption radius) increases. On the other hand, for larger values of the post-disruption radius, the tradeoff ratio is smaller. This indicates that significant decreases in the post-disruption radius can be attained with small increases in the pre-disruption radius, a result that is consistent with Snyder and Daskin (2005).


                                    Flat regions. Most of the plots with more interdictions (r
                                    =2, 3) have more flat regions in which the pre-disruption radius stays constant as the post-disruption radius decreases (e.g., d49, B
                                    =0.2, r
                                    =3). Thus, it is important for a decision-maker to be able to view the Pareto-efficient set, especially when the number of interdictions (r) is large (>2). For, if the decision-maker optimized the pre-disruption radius subject to an arbitrary constraint on the post-disruption radius, they may identify a non-Pareto solution, i.e., a solution on the flat region. Such a solution is undesirable because the post-disruption radius can be decreased without increasing the pre-disruption radius.

In this section we examine the penalty incurred for optimizing either the pre- or post-disruption radius in isolation, rather than using a multi-objective approach. For example, if the pre-disruption radius is optimized in isolation, the post-disruption radius may be much higher than its optimal value. We analyzed this penalty by recording the relative objective function increases for optimizing either of these two objectives in isolation.

For our analysis we used two models to solve various problem instances: the integrated MFLHP model and the b-center model, which is the budget-constrained version of the classic p-center problem (Hakimi, 1965) and minimizes the pre-disruption radius. For each model, we recorded two values: the post-disruption radius (PostDR) and the pre-disruption radius (PreDR). We then used these values to compute two types of relative objective function increases. The Type I relative objective function increase occurs when the decision-maker plans for a disruption to occur (e.g., optimizes the post-disruption radius) and yet no disruption occurs. Type II occurs when the decision-maker does not plan for a disruption and yet a disruption occurs. (These metrics are analogous to Type I and II errors in hypothesis testing.)

                           Table 3
                            shows the type I and type II relative objective function increases for instances of the d49 and sw55 datasets. The table shows that for the d49 dataset, the average Type I relative objective function increase was much lower than the average Type II relative objective function increase. Conversely, the opposite behavior occurred for the sw55 dataset. It is unclear why the behavior for the d49 dataset is different because two other datasets also had the same behavior as the sw55 dataset: lor100 (Avg. Type I=3.55, Avg. Type II=2.23) and lon150 (Avg. Type I=6.85, Avg. Type II=2.73).

The single-objective binary-search algorithm, described in Section 3.2, was tested over a set of datasets and problem instances, the largest being the rl1323 dataset. The results showed that the instances solved in a reasonable amount of time (see Appendix B). In fact, the run time of the algorithm for most of the rl1323 instances was between 412 and 3389seconds.

Experimental results also showed that the bi-objective instances solved in a reasonable amount of time for small- to medium-sized datasets (see Appendix C) even though the entire Pareto-efficient frontier must be computed. For problem instances with up to nodes, the run time was never more than 5.8hours. However, some instances of larger datasets (300–818 nodes) did not solve within 24hours.

In this section we measure the benefit of considering facility hardening when locating facilities subject to disruptions. We measure this benefit using two objectives: the pre-disrupti radius and the post-disruption radius. The most interesting finding in our results is that while considering facility hardening in a model did produce solutions that have a lower post-disruption radius, it did not affect the pre-disruption radius.

To measure the benefit of hardening, we compare the integrated MFLHP model, which includes facility hardening (MFLHP), with the location-only-with-disruptions (LOWD) problem, which does not include hardening. The LOWD problem locates facilities subject to a budget (b) in order to minimize the post-disruption radius. To solve the LOWD, a modification of the binary search algorithm for the MFLHP can be used; this modified algorithm uses the multi-level location set-covering model (Church & Gerrard, 2003) as its auxiliary sub-problem (see Medal et al. (2013)). The binary search algorithm for the LOWD can also be used to generate Pareto-efficient sets for the pre-disruption and post-disruption radii by using an algorithm similar to Algorithm 1 (see Medal et al. (2013)). In the remainder of this section we compare the MFLHP to the LOWD method based on the pre-disruption radius vs. post-disruption radius Pareto sets that they produce.


                        Fig. 5
                         displays the Pareto sets for the LOWD and MFLHP methods for the unweighted d49 dataset and the lon150 dataset with different values of the budget (b), number of interdictions (r), and hardening cost multiplier (H).

Several interesting observations can be made from Fig. 5.
                           
                              1.
                              The tradeoff ratio increases as the hardening cost multiplier (H) increases. This is because when hardening is cheap, the post-disruption radius can be reduced by hardening more facilities, which does not increase the pre-disruption radius. However, when the hardening cost is high, the budget does not allow more facilities to be hardened; thus, facilities must be located differently, which increases the pre-disruption radius.

The Pareto sets become further apart as the post-disruption radius (U
                                 (r)) decreases: when the post-disruption radius is large (because the pre-disruption radius is required to be small), hardening is not as beneficial, and the MFLHP solution will be similar to the LOWD solution. However, when the post-disruption radius is required to be small, hardening is more beneficial and the MFLHP will produce solutions with a lower post-disruption radius than the LOWD model.

As the hardening costs increase (especially when H
                                 >1), the MFLHP Pareto sets approach the LOWD sets. This indicates that the integrated location-hardening model is most likely to give a significantly better solution than a location-only model when the hardening costs are less than the location costs.


                        Table 4
                         shows the number of facilities located and hardened for each of the Pareto points for Fig. 5(a) and (b); the Pareto points are listed right to left. The results support observation 3 above: when the hardening costs increase the number of hardened facilities decreases. In addition, more facilities are hardened under high hardening costs (H
                        ⩾1) when there are more facility failures.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

In this article we studied the integration of facility location and hardening decisions. In order to perform our analysis, we developed an efficient method to model and solve the integrated minimax facility location-hardening problem (MFLHP) model and used our approach to discover new insights about location and hardening. To model the problem, we first demonstrated that, because of the problem’s structure, the three-stage location–interdiction–distribution problem can be modeled as a single-stage problem. We then formulated this single-stage problem as a mixed-integer program (MIP). Rather than solving the MIP directly, we decomposed it into set-cover-like auxiliary problems and used a binary search algorithm to solve it.

Experiments with the integrated MFLHP model provided interesting decision-making insights. The Pareto-efficient sets for the pre-disruption radius (PreDR) and post-disruption radius (PostDR) objectives showed that significant decreases in the post-disruption radius can be attained with small increases in the pre-disruption radius. Further experimental results showed that the average relative objective function increase for only optimizing the PreDR was higher than the relative increase for only optimizing the PostDR for all of the datasets used except one. Finally, the results in Section 5.2 indicated that an increased preference towards the PostDR objective should lead the decision-maker to harden more facilities when hardening cost is less than the location cost.

The experimental results also showed that the integrated method is attractive from a computational standpoint: the integrated model solved problems with up to 1323 nodes on a 12-core machine within 3389seconds. The bi-objective solution algorithm is able to solve small- to medium-sized datasets within a reasonable amount of time: problem instances with up to 200 nodes were solved to optimality within 5.8hours.

@&#FUTURE WORK@&#

Several assumptions in our model would be useful and interesting to relax. First, in our model a hardened facility cannot fail, and a facility is either hardened or not. In reality, a facility can never be completely immune to disruptions, and investing more protection resources into a facility makes it more resilient. Second, in our model the facilities are uncapacitated. This may be a good approximation in some contexts, but in others it may be important to model facility capacity. Third, we do not include the facility failure duration in our model. In reality, facilities may have different recovery times, which could affect the location and hardening decisions (see Losada, Scaparra, & O’Hanley, 2012).

The objective (A.1a) minimizes the sum of the distances between demand points and their assigned facilities. Every demand point must be assigned to one facility (A.1b) and that facility must be located (A.1c). Constraints (A.1d) and (A.1e) ensure that the pre-disruption and post-disruption radii are no more than U
                     (0) and U
                     (r), respectively. Finally, the model includes a budget Constraint (A.1f), a constraint allowing a variable to be hardened only if it is located (A.1g), and variable-type constraints ((A.1h) and (A.1i)).

When r
                     =1, the hardening variables, Y
                     
                        i
                     , are not needed and Constraints (A.1e) can be removed because they become identical to Constraints (A.1d).

Another important consideration in deciding whether the integrated method is preferred over other methods is the computation time required to solve problem instances. Specifically, it is important to consider these two questions: (1) is the integrated method able to solve problem instances that would be of interest to decision makers? and (2) is the integrated method able to solve these problem instances within an amount of time that is satisfactory to the decision makers? The experimental results in this section show that the answer to both of these two questions is yes.

To obtain the run times analyzed in this section, we solved the integrated MFLHP model for several problem instances of the rl1323 dataset, which is motivated by a circuit board drilling problem (Reinelt, 1991). The instances were obtained from the rl1323 dataset by varying the parameters b, g
                     
                        i
                     , and r. The instances were solved using the binary search algorithm described in Section 3.2.

In a preliminary set of experiments, the run time for the binary search algorithm was several orders of magnitude smaller than the run time for the MIP model. Thus, we do not report results for the MIP model.

Experimental results for the binary search algorithm computational performance are shown in Table 5
                     . Each row contains the results for an instance of the rl1323 dataset, the largest dataset for which the binary search algorithm was able to solve all instances to optimality. Columns (5)–(11) show the initial percentage gap between the lower (5) and upper bound (6) and the final optimal solution, the initial total proportional gap (7), the number of times the auxiliary problem is solved to optimality (8), the presolve run time in which the initial bounds are obtained (9), the run time of the binary search algorithm (10), and the total run time (11).


                     Table 5 indicates that the binary search algorithm can solve large problems in a reasonable amount of time. The lower bound percentage gaps are usually good, ranging from 2% to 26%. The heuristic and initial bounds are effective in reducing the number of times the auxiliary problem is solved to optimality. In the worst case performance of the binary search algorithm, 21 auxiliary problems must be solved to optimality; however, these results show that the auxiliary problem needed to be solved to optimality between 7 and 11 times. Most of the problems solve in a reasonable amount of time, from 412 to 3389seconds.

As Table 6
                      shows, the average run times over a set of problem instances for the remaining datasets used in this paper are mostly small, increasing with the number of nodes in the dataset. However, the lor818 dataset takes much longer than the others.


                     Table 7
                      contains run times for Algorithm 1 for various problem instances for the d49, sw55, d88, d150, and lon150 datasets. These run times include the time to optimize the total distance as a secondary objective for each point in the Pareto set. As the table shows, the main factors that influence run time are the number of nodes and the hardening cost multiplier.


                     Table 8
                      shows the run times for several larger problem instances. The run time is again influenced by the number of nodes and the hardening cost multiplier. The table also shows that the run time for these larger datasets is orders of magnitude larger than the run time of the smaller datasets shown in Table 7. Indeed, some of the instances did not complete within the 24hour time limit.
