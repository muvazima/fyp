                  The transitivity property of trust enables the propagation of a trust value through a chain of trusting users in social networks and then provides an expected trust value for another user. Logically, a user in social networks can assess a large number of other users, even if two users have not been directly connected previously. However, a large percentage of trust propagation efforts fail to find reliable trust paths from a source user to a target user because the web of trust in real-world online social networks is too sparse. The success (both quality and quantity) of a trust propagation algorithm strongly relies on the density of a web of trust. The more trust paths that are able to reach the given target user, the more reliable will be the trust estimates based on the trust path with the highest strength. In this paper, we propose an enriched trust propagation approach by combining a homophily-based trust network with an expertise-based trust network, which enhances the density of the trust network. We then evaluate the prediction accuracy and coverage of trust propagation based on various aggregation methods and highlight the most promising method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In social networks, users have incomplete knowledge of others, including those who have devious intentions [17]. Tracking trust is useful for predicting future behavior in a reliable manner and for deterring malicious users by encouraging good behavior and discouraging bad behavior. With the proliferation of Web-based social networks, users are allowed to directly express who they trust and how much they trust other users based on previous interactions. Given such information, trust transitivity enables us to propagate a trust value through a chain of trusting users and then provide an expected trust value for another user [4]. Logically, a user in social networks can assess a large number of users through trust propagation, even if two users were not directly connected previously.

However, trust propagation is not always successful for any two random users of social networks. If a web of trust (i.e. a network consisting of trust connections) is not dense enough to be propagated, it is difficult to find reliable and trustworthy paths from a source user to a target user [7]. Practically speaking, a significant percentage of trust propagation efforts fail to find reliable trust paths from a source to a target user in online social networks. Thus, the success (both quality and quantity) of trust propagation is strongly affected by the density of a web of trust. The more trust paths that are able to reach the given target user, the more likely it is to determine reliable trust estimates by choosing the trust path with the highest strength.

In recent years, considerable numbers of studies have been done on reliable trust propagation models in social networks. The main objective of these models is to discover reliable trust paths from a given source user to an unknown target user by mathematically combining recommendations from trusting users with minimum error, resulting in a trust prediction [8]. Few researchers have noted to the failure of trust propagation due to a sparse web of trust.

In order to reduce the sparsity problem in a web of trust, we adopt the property of homophily in social interactions. Homophily refers to the tendency of people to have non-negative ties with similar other users in social networks. In online social networks, homophily is a fundamental characteristic. In a trust effective community, users trust some people more than others, thus they are more influenced by them and share similar tastes. In addition, in a homophily effective community, similar users might share mutual trust, so the similarity of trust might induce trust among other people. Then trust and similarity will be influenced by each other [11].

A homophily property-based network is able to enlarge network connections over an entire network and help a user to find more trust paths and more trustworthy neighbors who know a target user. In the context of trust propagation, however, there are challenges to adopting homophily-based trust and combining it with a web of trust in which trust is directly issued by users. Compared to a homophily-based trust, this second web of trust, with connections directly given by users, is constructed by evaluating another user’s knowledge or expertise based on each user’s limited direct experiences. In this paper, we will call this web of trust an ‘expertise-based trust,’ as compared to a ‘homophily-based trust.’ We will discuss these definitions further in Section 2.

First, we face the issue of adjusting the level of two types of trust scores. Expertise-based trust is assessed by evaluating and analyzing the actions that a user performs over the domain content. Moreover, since this trust judgment is a very subjective opinion given by each user, there exists a trust subjectivity issue in an expertise-based trust network [5]. On the contrary, homophily-based trust is determined by evaluating the similarity between two users’ opinions. It is difficult to compare an expertise-based trust score of 0.9 and a homophily-based trust score of 0.8 without eliminating the distinction between them. In other words, the evaluation metric of a homophily-based trust is different from an expertise-based trust, so these two kinds of trust scores cannot be compared and propagated simultaneously into a raw score.

Second, aggregation is an important issue in simultaneously propagating two types of trust values. In current research, expertise-based trust is considered the most reliable source, since it is directly given by each user. However, no studies have evaluated the reliability of a homophily-based trust score as compared to an expertise-based trust score. Several aggregation methods are possible, including mean aggregation, max aggregation and priority aggregation. In summary, it is imperative to find an effective method to adjust and aggregate these two types of trust knowledge during trust propagation.

In this paper, we propose an enriched trust propagation approach by combining a homophily-based trust network and an expertise-based trust network, which enhances the density of the trust network. We normalize and transform both trust values so they can be compared with each other through a long chain, as well as through a single user. We then evaluate the prediction accuracy and coverage of trust propagation based on various aggregation methods and highlight the most promising method. In our experiments with the FilmTrust dataset, we discover that homophily-based trust is a more important metric than expertise-based trust in terms of trust propagation. Our proposed combined trust propagation approach could significantly outperform current proposed models, which rely only on expertise-based trust networks, for prediction accuracy and coverage.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the definition of trust in various perspectives and presents the previous studies on trust propagation. Section 3 discusses our proposed method, while Section 4 explains the details of our experiment results. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our work and provides directions for future work.

Ding et al. [1] insist that knowing ‘user A trusts user B in domain X’ does not fully capture the meaning of trust without considering the provenance and usage of trust knowledge [1,14,15]. They identified five types of trust and classified them into two categories, referral trust and associative trust. Referral trust represents trust in the other agent’s knowledge in a certain domain. For example, user A trusts user B’s knowledge in a movie domain. In most cases, this is estimated by an agent’s direct experiences of using the other agent’s knowledge. Associative trust reflects the similarity between two agents, such as their trust knowledge or domain knowledge. For example, this type of trust might be derived by measuring the similarity of user A’s and user B’s referral trust toward other users in common. As Ding et al. mention, referral trust and associative trust can both be used to propagate referral trust [1]. In this paper, expertise-based trust and homophily-based trust correspond to referral trust and associative trust, respectively.

In recent years, a few researchers have explored the interaction between trust and similarity [2,18,19]. They discovered a strong positive correlation between trust and profile similarity in online communities. The similarity of profile features, including overall ratings, has been found to induce a degree of trust. Matsuo and Yamamoto [11] measured the bidirectional effects of trust and profile attributes, such as ratings for movies. They empirically demonstrated that users made trust connections due to their ratings’ similarities. In addition, the rating of a user is influenced by the ratings of trusted users. This bidirectional effect influences community dynamics, including the evolution of trust relationships, thus increasing the density of the community.

Shakeri and Bafghi [14,15] employed the similarity of opinions between two users as a measure of confidence in the value of trust. They calculated the mean of absolute difference between two users’ opinions on the trust values of all users in common. Next, they proposed an approach for propagating trust with confidence and improved the accuracy of prediction. While their approach might reduce uncertainty through a chain of trust, it does not resolve the sparsity issue in a trust network.

Considerable numbers of studies have been done on trust propagation regarding the ways that trust is transferred, combined and then estimated in online social networks. The main objective of these models is to predict a level of trust from a certain user to distant others with high reliability. In order to achieve a credible estimation of trust, they worked to discover reliable paths and mathematically combined multiple recommendations from reliable users.

Golbeck [3] proposed a trust inference model called TidalTrust, which infers a trust value in continuous trust networks. However, the TidalTrust algorithm confines the search to the shortest paths with trust values higher than a threshold value to discover a reliable trust path from a source user to a target user. This model aggregates recommendations from users on the strongest trust paths. By contrast, the MoleTrust algorithm [10] discovers all paths within a given maximum-distance and aggregates all recommendations from all chains of users by calculating the weighted average. Lesani and Montazeri [9] selected the path with a maximal propagated trust value as the most trustworthy trust path. Kim and Song [8] questioned the accuracy of trust propagation as affected by the length of the trust paths and the different aggregation approaches. Their research evaluated four types of strategies: weighted mean aggregation among the shortest paths, min–max aggregation among the shortest paths, weighted mean aggregation among all paths, and min–max aggregation among all paths. In this paper, we adopt the best optimal strategy from their empirical results (refer to Section 3.3).

Eliminating the subjectivity of trust propensity is another issue related to increasing trust inference accuracy through trust propagation. Hasan et al. addressed the issue of propagating trust using subjective personal views, experiences or backgrounds [5]. Since the perception of trustworthiness is subjective, the meaning of a trust recommendation might be misinterpreted. Moreover, the inferred trust value gained from propagating a misinterpreted recommendation would be far from the true meaning of the initial trust recommendation. The authors eliminated trust subjectivity by converting an absolute trust value into its percentile value based on the disposition of the trust of each user. However, their experiments did not compare the effects of trust propagation with or without the elimination of subjectivity.

Although existing studies have proposed various algorithms for trust propagation, their main problem is finding the most trustworthy results for trust propagation using a possible path from a source to a target. In this paper, we consider the significance of sparseness of trust links and its effects on both the quality and quantity of a trust propagation approach. Thus, our objective is to construct a denser web of trust between any two random users connected through a chain of trusting users.

In this paper, we explore two kinds of trust: expertise-based trust and homophily-based trust. Expertise-based trust evaluates trust based on the users’ knowledge or expertise in a particular domain. In most online social networks, the web of trust is constructed with expertise-based trust, which is directly issued by users based on the quality of trustees’ knowledge or recommendations. In our approach, it is assumed that a web of trust is available, even if it is sparse.

Homophily-based trust includes associative trust, similar belief trust or similar trusting trust. It is defined as the value of similarity between two users’ ideas or trust knowledge. The more commonality between two users, the more they are likely to associate with and trust each other. Given a web of trust, homophily-based trust evaluates the similarity of two users’ trust knowledge, which is the similarity of user A’s and user B’s explicit trust in regard to other users within a particular domain [1,14,15].

Formula (1) is a Tanimoto coefficient which is an extension of the Jaccard similarity coefficient for a continuous value [13,16]. The Jaccard similarity coefficient index has been adapted in various studies to measure the similarity between two vectors filled with binary values due to its similarity in applying to each domain, as well as its good performance in measuring a similarity.

Due to the subjective nature of trustworthiness [5], the accurate meaning of a trust recommendation may not be conveyed through trust propagation. For example, it is possible that a user with a high disposition to trust is likely to assign a relatively high value of trust to another user, whereas a user with a lower disposition to trust is likely to assign a lower value of trust to the same user. In this case, it is not desirable to combine the two trust values given by the two users. Thus, it is necessary to eliminate the subjectivity of expertise-based trust which is evaluated based on each user’s direct and indirect experiences of the trustee.

We normalize each user’s expertise-based trust with the mean and standard deviation of his/her trust values as follows:

The function

                              )
                           
                         is designed to convert the z-normalized trust value to the range [0,1] [12].

Next, in order to simultaneously propagate two types of trust values, we need to adjust the different levels of trust scores derived by the evaluation metrics. Then, it is possible to compare a homophily-based trust score and an expertise-based trust score, as well as combine them into one accurate score.

For this reason, we also normalize a homophily-based trust value using z-normalization with a global mean and standard deviation as follows:

Since normalizing homophily-based trust does not eliminate subjectivity, we do not normalize it with the personal mean and standard deviation. Our objective is to obtain globally comparable values to identify whether each homophily-based trust value is sufficiently trustworthy compared to an expertise-based trust value.

In our proposed approach, we combine expertise-based trust and homophily-based trust in order to overcome the sparsity of a web of trust composed of expertise-based trust. The combined denser trust network will help us discover more reliable trust paths to a target user and then provide a higher chance of finding more evidence of trust. We ensure that when we aggregate trust values to estimate a trust value from a source user to a target user, we only take into account the first-hand recommendations of a target user. The first-hand recommendation is an expertise-based trust value obtained from a user who directly connects to a target user with previous direct experiences [6].

Thus, our trust propagation procedure is the following. Firstly, we combine a normalized expertise-based trust value and a normalized homophily-based trust value for simultaneous propagation. Secondly, we discover the most reliable trust paths from a source user to those who have direct expertise-based trust with a target user. Next, we aggregate all the expertise-based trust values of a target user given by users who have directly connected to this target user, based on the reliability of the trust paths.

In order to simultaneously propagate expertise-based trust and homophily-based trust, we showed how they are normalized in Section 3.3. Even though that process is completed, the strategy used to combine these two values is an important issue in predicting the precise level of trust through reliable trust paths. In our empirical results in Section 4, we will compare four strategies (see below) from the perspective of trust estimation accuracy and coverage. If only one of the trust values is achieved, we adopt the achieved trust value as a representative value (i.e. a combined trust value). The combination strategy only takes place when both types of trust values are available.

                           In strategy (a), priority is given to expertise-based trust. If an expertise-based trust value is available, we always take this first. If not, we use homophily-based trust. Strategy (a) assumes that first-hand information is the most reliable evidence since it is based on direct experiences with a user. Strategies (b), (c) and (d) are based on the fact that, while first-hand information (i.e. expertise-based trust) comes from the strongest paths, homophily-based trust can also convey valuable information in predicting trust over a distance. In strategy (b), priority is given to homophily-based trust. Since profile similarity is highly correlated with trust, the similarity-based measure might induce more reliable information on trust. In the case of strategy (c), priority is given to the stronger trust value in order to discover the more reliable trust path, regardless of its type. In strategy (d), the more evidence we use, the more likely it is to find reliable trust paths. Here, equal importance is given to both trust values, so both types of trust evidence are noted in every connection.

When determining a reliable trust path from a source user, we adopt the min–max aggregation method which is supported by Kim and Song’s comparison study [8].

The min–max aggregation method determines a minimum trust value among all trust values along a trust chain to signify the strength of a trust path. When multiple trust paths are discovered, it is natural to choose the trust path with the highest strength as the best path. In addition, since trust can be diluted through the propagation process, we discount a long distance trust path.

Thus, the strength of a trust path from a source user to each user

During the process of finding a reliable trust path, we set a minimum threshold for a trust value such as

                                 θ
                              
                           . The parameter of the threshold allows us to reduce the number of visited users, as well as to propagate a trust value derived from trustworthy users [8].

This process of computing the strength of a trust path ends when no more paths are available from a source user to users who are directly connected to a target user.

For each user j who has an expertise-based trust value with a target user, we determine the most reliable trust paths and the strength of those paths from a source user. Then, we aggregate the expertise-based trust values based on the strength of each trust path. The predicted trust value from a source user to a target user is computed as follows:

                            are mean and standard deviation of source user s’s all expertise-based trust values toward others.

Since subjectivity influences expertise-based trust values, we use formula (6) to aggregate normalized trust values from each user j to target user s in order to remove the subjective level of user j’s trust tendency. Then, we convert the normalized predictive trust value into a de-normalized value through formula (7). This formula is derived from the normalization function of formula (2). Now, the de-normalized predictive trust value is comparable to the expertise-based trust values that a source user has directly issued,

We applied our proposed method to the website FilmTrust (http://trust.mindswap.org/FilmTrust), an online social network where people share movie ratings and reviews. This social network allows users to evaluate how much a user trusts others’ opinions (i.e. reviews or ratings) on a scale from 1 (least trustworthy) to 10 (most trustworthy). FilmTrust also maintains a web of trust showing the degree of trust for users’ friends. Their dataset has 571 unique users, with 461 users trusted by at least 1 other user (i.e. trust-inlinks) and 389 users trusting at least 1 other user (i.e. trust-outlinks), with a total of 1289 trust connections among users, giving the web of trust a density of 0.4% ({1289/(571×570)}×100).

The proposed approach is based on the idea that homophily-based trust and expertise-based trust can be propagated together, which will enhance the quality and quantity of trust propagation by reducing the sparseness of trust networks. Thus, the experimental evaluation we conducted aims to assess the proposed approach with respect to its accuracy and its coverage for predicting a degree of trust.

In these experiments, we use leave-one-out cross validation which selects a single trust connection from the original sample as the validation data and uses the remaining trust connections for prediction. In FilmTrust, 255 of the 1289 trust connections do not have any inlink-trust values other than source user

                        . Since trust value is inferred by aggregating the direct inlink trust values (i.e. expertise-based trust value here) of a target user, trust connectivity cannot be predicted without at least 1 direct inlink trust value in addition to the validation value. Therefore, we conducted the following experiments with 1034 trust connections.

                         over 1034 trust connections.

In addition to accuracy, we also measure coverage, the percentage of trust connections for which a trust prediction can be made by finding a reliable path within the 1034 trust connections. The coverage prediction is highly dependent on the sparsity of a trust network, so it can be used to estimate the usefulness of a trust propagation algorithm in such an environment.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, we comprehensively describe the experimental results derived from the application of our proposed models to FilmTrust dataset. First, we explore the effects of one property of homophily on the network topology of an expertise-based trust network. Next, we validate the effect of normalizing trust values on the accuracy of the trust propagation. Finally, we compare our proposed trust propagation models in various combinations, as well as with well-known trust propagation models. To further evaluate the performance of the proposed models in a sparse network, the experiments are conducted with networks of various density.

In order to reduce the sparsity issue in a web of trust, we adopt the property of homophily in social interactions. Thus, we examine whether homophily-based trust can be complementary to expertise-based trust in a sparse network. Fig. 1
                            presents the relationship between the expertise-based trust values and the homophily-based trust values in FilmTrust. The expertise-based trust values are divided into five equal groups. In each group, the average and standard deviation of homophily-based trust are computed. Fig. 1 illustrates that as the expertise-based trust value strengthens between two users, the homophily-based trust value also increases. This seems to demonstrate that the more a user trusts other users’ knowledge, the more likely they are to share common trustees based on similar tastes.

As shown in Fig. 1, the average of homophily-based trust does not increase monotonically as the expertise-based trust value increases. For example, the average homophily-based trust in the 0.4–0.6 interval of expertise-based trust is slightly lower than that in the 0.2–0.4 interval. However, this phenomenon would not cause a serious problem in trust propagation, since only high trust values (e.g. higher than 0.7) are considered when finding reliable trust paths from a source to a target. As noted in Fig. 1, the homophily-based trust values are significantly correlated with the expertise-based trust values when the expertise-based trust value is higher than 0.7; this threshold is adopted for our experiments. This first result indicates that homophily-based trust and expertise-based trust seem to be complementary and can be combined without losing prediction accuracy.

Before we discuss the performance results of our trust propagation, we explore how one property of homophily affects the network topology of an expertise-based trust network. Table 1
                            shows the network topology features of three different types of trust networks. These networks are constructed with either expertise, homophily or combined trust link connections in which each trust score is higher than zero. The networks are directional and considered unweighted for this exploration. Thus, the combined network has the same values for its network features, regardless of the combination strategy. When compared to this expertise-based trust network, a homophily-based trust network has 56% fewer nodes and 5.7 times more links. The nodes in this homophily-based trust network are tightly knit, with 74% of the nodes reachable in a short-distance (i.e. 4.4 degrees/paths on average).

As we expected, the denser homophily-based network combined with the expertise-based trust network demonstrates enhanced density, connectivity and transitivity for the whole network. When we compare the expertise-based network to the combined trust network, the combined network topology features significantly increase, with the exception of the number of nodes.

Since trust can be propagated through a reliable chain of paths, we need to explore a network topology constructed with sufficient trustworthy link connections in order to determine how the combined trust network improves in terms of propagation. We set a minimum trust threshold of 0.7 in our experiments. During trust propagation, the program searches for neighbors that are trustworthy at or above the trust threshold. Table 2
                            shows the network topology features of trust networks satisfying the trust threshold of 0.7. Four types of combined trust networks met this criteria. When we consider various networks for trust propagation, we look for the sparseness of the trust network. All of the combined trust networks are denser than an expertise-based trust network, but no one type dominated in the context of trust propagation. The combined trust network with a max strategy is superior in terms of average in/out degrees, % of no paths between any two random users and network density. It is also tightly connected over the whole trust network, so it is expected to provide high coverage, but this does not guarantee high accuracy. We will discuss both coverage and accuracy in more detail later in relation to our combination strategy.

In this paper, we describe the necessity of trust value normalization before propagation over a long distance. Fig. 2
                           
                            presents the distribution of an expertise-based trust network before and after normalization. Before normalization, the distribution is negative-skewed (left-tailed), with an average trust score is 0.68 and a median of 0.7. These scores could be interpreted as meaning that people tend to issue more high trust scores than low trust scores in public. However, normalization of the personal mean and deviation reduces the skewedness, as shown in Fig. 2b.


                           Fig. 3
                           
                            represents the distribution of a homophily-based trust network before and after normalization. Before normalization, the distribution is extremely positive-skewed (right-tailed). Since the evaluation metric of homophily-based trust is different from expertise-based trust, it is difficult to compare two values in such a skewed distribution. After normalization, the distribution is still somewhat skewed, but its average and median moved from 0.15 and 0.1 to 0.48 and 0.42, respectively.

Before comparing our proposed models, which combine expertise-based trust and homophily-based trust, with existing trust propagation approaches, more exploration is needed on the effect of trust value normalization in terms of performance accuracy. We first compare expertise-based trust propagation and homophily-based trust propagation with and without normalization. These trust propagation experiments are conducted using the approaches described in Section 3. Table 3
                            represents the accuracy (i.e. the average of prediction error) of trust propagation by varying the trust threshold from 0.7 to 0.9. These results indicate that a trust propagation model with normalized values performs better than a model without normalization in both types of trust networks. The average prediction error in the homophily-based network decreases by 0.27 on average compared to the non-normalization approach, while the expertise-based trust error decreases by 0.23 on average. Since the skewedness of the non-normalized distribution of homophily-based trust is more significant than that of the expertise-based trust, the impact of trust value normalization on trust prediction accuracy is significantly strong.

In the following experiments, we will use normalized values for both expertise-based trust and homophily-based trust.

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

In this experiment, we compare our proposed approach with the TidalTrust [3] and MoleTrust [10] algorithms, which are well known for trust propagation with continuous trust data. Tables 4 and 5
                           
                            indicate the accuracy (i.e. the average of prediction error) and the coverage of trust propagation with various trust thresholds for the two well-known algorithms, along with an expertise-based trust network, a homophily-based trust network and four types of combined trust networks. These use our proposed approach with normalized trust values and propagate all possible trust paths with min–max aggregation. When comparing the prediction accuracy among trust networks, our proposed approach combining expertise-based trust and homophily-based trust achieve higher accuracy than TidalTrust and MoleTrust (see Table 4). In Table 5, we can also see that a homophily-based trust network has superior coverage compared to other single trust networks. This unexpected finding reveals that homophily-based trust is not just a complementary source for trust propagation; the property of homophily results in a significant change in trust network topology and the quality of trust propagation.

However, the combined trust networks show similar or better performance accuracy than a homophily-based trust network. As noted in Table 4, a combined trust network with a priority on homophily outperforms the other combination strategies. This result demonstrates that a homophily-based trust value provides a more accurate prediction in trust propagation than an expertise-based trust value. In terms of coverage, which is the focus of this paper, all of the combined networks are significantly improved, regardless of the combination strategy. Among them, a combined trust network which takes the maximum value between homophily- and expertise-based trust outperforms the networks using other combination strategies. The coverage in this combined network is improved by 66% over the single trust networks.

To further validate the performance of our proposed approach on sparse networks, we change the network density by randomly removing n% of trust links from an original web of trust provided by FilmTrust users. Tables 6 and 7
                           
                            show the results of trust propagation with various levels of sparse networks. Here, a 0% reduced network represents the full size of the FilmTrust network. In this experiment, we set a minimum trust value threshold of 0.7 for reliable trust paths. As shown in Table 6 and Fig. 4
                           , a combined trust network using an average combination strategy has higher prediction accuracy than the networks using other combination strategies, particularly when the network sparsity is greater. In comparison to TidalTrust and MoleTrust, the accuracy of the combined trust network, using an average strategy, increases from 49% to 78% as network sparisty increases from a full-size network to 60% of the links removed.

In terms of coverage (Table 7, Fig. 5
                           ), a combined trust network which takes the maximum value between homophily- and expertise-based trust achieves the best result at all sparsity levels. The increased ratio of coverage of combined trust networks compared to single trust networks is more significant as network sparsity increases. Again comparing these results to TidalTrust and MoleTrust, the coverage of the combined network using a maximum strategy improves from 66% to 175% as network sparsity increases from a full-size network to 60% of the links removed.

Based on our experiment results, the choice of most appropriate combined trust network to use is based on the most valued performance metric, whether accuracy or coverage. If the objective is to increase the coverage of propagation by slightly sacrificing the accuracy, a combined trust network using the maximum strategy is suggested. If accuracy is more important, the combined trust network employing the average strategy is suggested; additionally, this method also demonstrates greater coverage than the single trust networks.

When reviewing Table 6 and Fig. 4, our proposed combined trust networks interestingly indicate that they improve accuracy when the trust network is more sparse, whereas the accuracy of a single trust network, with the exception of a homophily-based network, continually decreases. In general, the sparser the trust network, the worse the performance of trust propagation is in terms of both accuracy and coverage. This phenomenon has also been noted in coverage, as shown in Table 7 and Fig. 5. In previous experiments, we randomly remove n% of links, so the experiments in Table 6 and Fig. 4 were conducted with 4 different sizes of network. Then, in order to compare the effect of network sparsity on accuracy, we compare the same set of trust link connections. Table 8
                            represents the results of this experiment. The results demonstrate that TidalTrust and MoleTrust show the expected tendency of decreasing accuracy. On the contrary, our proposed combined trust networks show similar or better performance as network sparseness increases. The experiment results in Tables 6–8 thus validate the robustness of this algorithm in an extremely sparse network, resulting in high coverage and accuracy compared to single networks.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Most current studies strongly rely on an expertise-based trust value, because it is directly issued by users based on their direct and indirect experiences. However, our empirical results show that the sparseness of trust networks affects the results of both accuracy and coverage in trust propagation. In this paper, we adopt the property of homophily in social interaction to derive a homophily-based trust network for a denser combined trust network and show the potential to increase coverage as well as accuracy in trust propagation. Our research addresses the challenge of combining different types of trust networks by proposing a method to adjust and aggregate these two types of trust knowledge. This method simultaneously propagates both trust values through a long chain of trusting users without the loss of accuracy. These empirical experiments with the FilmTrust dataset show that our proposed approach performs well in sparse social networks, while providing significant accuracy and coverage.

In future research, we will adopt other types of trust, such as reciprocity-based trust or distrust, in order to supplement a sparse trust network. Since our proposed approach shows the benefits of combining different types of trust networks, it may also be able to convey other types of valuable information when predicting trust over a distance.
