                  Geometric partial differential equations for curves and surfaces are used in many fields, such as computational geometry, image processing and computer graphics. In this paper, a few differential operators defined on space curves are introduced. Based on these operators, several second-order and fourth-order geometric flows for evolving space curves are constructed. Some properties of the changing rates of the arc-length of the evolved curves and areas swept by the curves are discussed. Short-term and long-term behaviors of the evolved curves are illustrated.

In many design and construction problems, such as reverse engineering, multi-component mesh optimization and industrial geometric design from a wireframe, smooth space curves need to be generated from noisy input data. This goal can be efficiently achieved by utilizing geometric flows to smooth the input data with shape preserved. The aim of this paper is to construct such geometric flows for space curves embedded in

For surfaces embedded in 
                        
                           
                              R

                     , many geometric flows have been constructed (see Xu, 2008 for references). These include second-order geometric flows (mean-curvature flow, averaged mean-curvature flow, weighted mean-curvature flow, Gaussian curvature flow, etc.), fourth-order flows (surface diffusion flow, quasi-surface flow, Willmore flow, etc.) and sixth-order flows (minimal variation of mean-curvature flow, quasi-minimal variation of mean-curvature flow, etc.). These flows are frequently used in surface modeling, surface denoising, image processing and computer graphics.

As one can imagine, all the plane curves in the xy-plane can be extended to the xyz-space by setting the z-direction as constants, obtaining three-dimensional (3D) cylindrical-type surfaces. Then, the mean curvature H of this surface is half of the signed curvature of the plane curve, and the Gaussian curvature K is zero. Then, all the geometric flows for surfaces have their counterparts for plane curves. For this reason, one may think that there is no need to study the construction of geometric flows for curves. However, for space curves in 
                        
                           
                              R

                     , reducing the surface flows to curves is not always valid, as explained below.

Since most of the curvature flows for surfaces embedded in 
                        
                           
                              R

                      describe the surface motion in the normal direction, we take the normal as an example to explain the difference. For a single-sided surface, the surface normal can be orientated, but the normal of the space curve cannot be orientated. For instance, a straight line in 3D, as a counterpart of the plane, cannot be orientated. Furthermore, the motion of the surface in the normal direction (the tangential motion does not change the surface shape) has one degree of freedom. However, for a space curve, the motion has two degrees of freedom. Hence, the situation for the space curve is rather different from that for the plane curve. In this paper, we consider the construction of geometric flows for space curves.

There has been much work on plane curve evolution (see Gage, 1983, 1984; Gage and Hamilton, 1986; Ma and Chen, 2007; Sapiro, 2001 for references). We only review a few of them. Most of the curve evolutions focus on the following curve-shortening flow (CSF)

                         is the signed curvature and N is the unit inward normal of a close plane curve x. CSF is also known as curvature flow or geometric heat flow, which is the counterpart of the mean-curvature flow for surfaces. In Chou (2001), some results on CSF are presented, including the properties of CSF, the anisotropic generalized CSF and the CSF in Klein geometry. In Andrews (1998), the behavior of convex curves driven by the curvature flow is considered. The long-term behavior of solutions and properties of limiting shapes are described. As shown in Gage and Hamilton (1986) and Grayson (1987), the curvature flow will shrink an embedding planar curve to a point, becoming round in the limit without developing singularities.

In Dziuk (1999), an anisotropic CSF is studied, and a numerical scheme for this flow is developed. Optimal error estimates for a semi-discrete scheme are provided. A weighted curvature flow for planar curves, a generalization of the curvature flow, is discussed in Chen et al. (2007). The convexity of the curve driven by the weighted curvature flow is studied.

The geometric curve evolution equations in a plane have been extended to surfaces and manifolds in Grayson (1989), Gage (1990), Spira and Kimmel (2007). Efficient numerical schemes for the implementation of the classical geodesic curve evolution equations on parametric manifolds are presented in Spira and Kimmel (2007). These flows are used on the scale space of images painted on manifolds and segmentation by an active contour model. Grayson (1989) and Gage (1990) generalized the study of curvature flow of closed curves in a plane to that in surfaces, and analyzed the long-term behavior of smooth curves immersed in a surface.

It is well known that geometric heat flow is the fastest way to shrink the length of a curve (Gage, 1986). A planar embedded curve that evolves according to this flow becomes more and more circular as t increases, and eventually shrinks to a point in finite time (Gage and Hamilton, 1986; Grayson, 1989). Such a shrinking effect is an undesirable feature in many applications, such as curve denoising, since the evolving curve will drift rapidly from the desired shape. In order to avoid the shrinking effect, Gage (1986) proposed two variations of the geometric heat flow. The first one is defined by

In Sapiro and Tannenbaum (1995), area-preserving multi-scale representations of planar curves are described. The representations are obtained by deforming the curve via geometric heat flows while simultaneously magnifying the plane for keeping the enclosed area constant. In Dolcetta et al. (2002), several models in phase separation theory are used to generate planar curve evolution without shrinkage. The theoretical validation of a level-set method to these models is discussed.

Space curve smoothing or denoising is often required in reverse engineering, CAD modeling, animation, computer vision, image registration and mesh optimization (Leng et al., 2011). To smooth a discrete space curve (a sequence of points) with noise, B-splines were used in Guziec and Ayache (1994) to approximate the discrete data. In Dierckx (1995), noisy scattered data were smoothed by minimizing a functional that combines a term that measures the deviation of the data points from the fit with another term that measures the non-smoothness of the fit.

An efficient fairing technique for a wireframe defined by two sets of space curves was presented in Liu et al. (2008). In the fairing process, the parameters are fixed and then released by an iterative gradient descent optimization method. In Cohen and Tekumalla (2005), a 3D curve-smoothing algorithm using the moving least squares (MLS) projection is proposed with the primary focus on smoothing boundaries of point clouds obtained during reverse engineering of laser scanned models. An algorithm for fairing of space curves with respect to spatial constraints based on a vector-valued curvature function is presented in Hildebrandt et al. (2005). It describes a curve-smoothing flow that satisfies strict spatial constraints and allows simultaneous control of both curvature functions. In Altschuler and Grayson (1992), the authors show how to use the curvature flow on space to define a natural continuation of the planar solution for the whole of the time.

Our attention is focused on constructing geometric flows for space curves. First, gradient, divergence and Laplace operators on space curves are introduced. Then several second-order geometric flows and fourth-order geometric flows for space curves are constructed. We consider second- and fourth-order flows for the following reasons. First, second-order flows are easier to solve and can be used to denoise efficiently. However, the second-order flows can only achieve

                         continuity, fourth-order flows are required. Second, for smoothing space curves with shape preservation, fourth-order flows are more desirable since the solution curves of the higher order flows are “softer” than those of the lower order flows. Some properties of the changing rates of the arc-length and areas are discussed. To describe the area changing rate for an evolving space curve, a notion of the area swept surface of the evolving curve is introduced.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some of the notation used and several differential operators on space curves, including the definitions of curvature, normal, gradient, divergence and Laplace operators. Some basic results for these operators are also presented. In Sections 3 and 4, we derive several geometric flows, including second-order and fourth-order flows. Some properties of these flows are discussed. Finally, we conclude the paper with a summary in Section 5.

                            is arbitrarily defined. We artificially define it as a zero vector. The curvature 
                              κ
                              =

                            is well defined. From (2.2), we can derive that 
                              n
                              (

                            does not depend on the re-parameterization of the curve. Hence, 
                              n
                              (

                              )
                            is uniquely defined. In addition to the curvature and normal, we define the curvature vector as
                              
                                 (2.3)

                               Note that if the space curve is not closed, the boundary term does not vanish. Hence (2.14) is not true. Equality (2.15) is a well known fact (see Dierckx, 1995, p. 38), we ignore its proof. □


                        
                           Remark 2.1
                           The arc-length formula (2.14) depends on 
                                 κ
                              , but is independent of the torsion of the curve.

The concept of area enclosed by a close curve is valid only for a close plane curve. For a space curve, the concept of area is not well defined. In the following, we replace the concept of the enclosed area by the concept of the area of the swept surface of the geometric flow.

                        . Without loss of generality, we assume that the curve does not contain straight line segment. If the curve contains straight line segments, we divide the curve into several pieces at the end points of the straight line segments, such that each piece is either a straight line or contains no straight line. If a piece of the curve is a straight line, then we say this curve piece is trivial. Otherwise, we say the curve piece is non-trivial. We consider only the non-trivial curves in the following.

In this section, we propose several second-order geometric flows. Some properties of these flows are discussed. These properties are illustrated by some graphical examples. For ease of illustration, all curves used, except for Fig. 3.1
                     , are planar. The figures presented are not schematic. They have been produced by real computation using the numerical method presented in Xu (2013).

Let 
                           x
                           (
                           u
                           )
                         be a given space curve with 
                           u
                           ∈
                           [
                           a
                           ,
                           b
                           ]
                        . Now we define a second order flow. As for the mean-curvature flow for surface, the curvature flow for curve is defined as

                         Here, the convex and concave curves are distinguished when the observer is located in the interior of the closed curve. From (3.2), we know that the curvature flow is shrinking in area.


                        Fig. 3.1 shows an example of the curvature flow, where the left column shows the initial space curve to be evolved. The middle column shows the evolved space curve family at the early stage. The right column shows the evolved space curve family at the later stage, where the curves become circular and shrink. The figures in the first row are the space curves observed in the z-direction

In this section, several fourth-order flows, including curve diffusion flow, quasi-curve diffusion flow, projective quasi-curve diffusion flow, minimal curvature flow and minimal squared-curvature flow, are presented. Weak forms of some these flows are also given. The illustrations provided are generated using the numerical method presented in Xu (2013).

To define a curve diffusion flow which is similar to surface diffusion flow, let us recall the surface diffusion flow (see Mullins, 1957):

                        , H and n denote the Laplace–Beltrami operator, mean curvature and surface normal, respectively. Note that mean curvature H depends on the orientation of the surface normal. Namely, if we take the opposite sign of the normal, then the mean curvature will change sign. Hence, the right-hand side of (4.1) is independent of the orientation of the surface normal. If we take directly the form of the surface diffusion flows as the curve diffusion flow, we obtain the following form for curve diffusion flow:

                        Fig. 4.1
                         shows an example of the curve diffusion flow, where an initial un-convex curve is evolved. The middle figure shows the evolved curve family at the early stage using the curve diffusion flow (4.3). The right figure shows the evolved curve family at the later stage.

For surface, we had introduced the following quasi-surface flow (see Xu, 2008)

                         Hence, the quasi-curve diffusion flow contains the motions in the tangent and binormal directions. Note that torsion is involved in this equation.

Using Green's formula (2.12), the weak form of the quasi-curve diffusion flow is written as

                         shows an example of the quasi-curve diffusion flow, where an initial non-convex curve is evolved. The middle figure shows the evolved curve family at the early stage using the quasi-curve diffusion flow. The right-hand figure shows the evolved curve family at the later stage. The curve will shrink with further evolution.

As we have mentioned before, the quasi-curve diffusion flow contains the motions in the tangent and binormal directions. To disable the tangential motion, we construct the following form flow:

                        Fig. 4.3
                         shows an example of the projective curve diffusion flow (4.6), where an initial non-convex curve is evolved. The middle figure of Fig. 4.3 shows a curve family at the early stage obtained by this flow. The right-hand figure shows a curve family at the later stage. The curve will shrink continuously for further evolution.

For surfaces, Willmore flow (see Willmore, 1993) is derived from minimizing the total squared mean-curvature. For curves in

                         shows an example of the minimal squared-curvature flow, where an initial non-convex curve, as shown in Fig. 4.2, is evolved. The left-hand figure shows an evolved curve family at the early stage of the evolution. It is easy to see that the curve is shortening. The middle figure shows a stage where the curve becomes a circle. The right-hand figure shows an evolved curve family at the later stage. The curve becomes a circle, and further evolution makes the circle larger and larger.

As we have seen, the minimal squared-curvature flow is arc-length lengthening for a circle. To obtain a flow that is not arc-length lengthening for a circle, we minimize the following energy:

Several second-order and fourth-order geometric flows have been constructed for space curves. Some properties of the changing rates of the arc-length and areas have been discussed. These properties show that the geometric flows constructed for space curves are different in nature from their counterparts of the plane curve case and surface case. Short-term and long-term behaviors of the evolved curves using the constructed flows have been illustrated by graphical examples. These behaviors show that each of the flows has its own distinct features.

As part of future work, we plan to study the applications of the geometric flows constructed. A direct application may be space curve denoising. All the flows with arc-length shortening property can be used for space curve denoising. However, if a flow is both arc-length shortening and area-preserving, then it would be more desirable, since it will better preserve the shape of the curve. Another application can be image restoration and image denoising. For instance, the 2D version of flow (4.5) can be used to accomplish the task with sharp feature of the objects in the image to be preserved. A third application area of the geometric flows can be geometric design. In many shape design problems, shapes are designed from a wireframe consisting of space curves. Each of the smooth space curves, say B-spline curves, is constructed from interpolating a few fixed control points. The remaining degrees of freedom (DOF) of the curve need to be determined. These DOF can be determined by the geometric flows constructed.

The space curves considered in this paper are expressed in parametric forms. If the curves are in the level-set form (intersections of two implicit form surfaces), how to reformulate these flows is an interesting problem that is worth further study.
