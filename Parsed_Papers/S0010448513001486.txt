@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Principal curvatures (or equivalently mean and Gaussian curvatures) and principal directions are fundamental differential invariants in differential geometry. They are often referred to as the tensor of curvature and can be used to characterize the local shape of a surface. In CAD and computer graphics, curvatures are frequently used for shape processing  [1], segmentation  [2] and surface interrogation  [3,4], and principal direction vectors are essential quantities for surface remeshing  [5], non-photorealistic rendering  [6,7] or texture mapping  [8]. In computer vision and medical image analysis, these differential invariants are extensively used for recognition, registration, and free-form shape analysis  [9,10]. Mathematically, the tensor of curvature is defined for twice differentiable surfaces. In practice geometric data are often available as polygonal (typically triangular) meshes. Therefore when we discuss the curvatures on triangular meshes, we mean the curvatures of smooth surfaces that the meshes represent. Since in general we do not have the analytic representation of the underlying smooth surfaces, the true surface curvature information cannot be computed directly. In this paper, we present a novel method for accurately estimating the tensor of curvature of a subjacent, unknown, smooth surface from a triangular mesh.

Many methods have been developed for estimating curvatures or curvature tensors on triangular meshes accurately or robustly. See for example Refs.  [11,12,9,13,14] and references therein. When both principal curvatures and principal directions are estimated, the known techniques can roughly be classified into three categories.

(1) The first category estimates principal curvatures and principal directions by first estimating normal curvatures along a few sampled curves or directions  [15–18]. By using Euler’s theorem and Meusnier’s theorem, a set of equations describing the relation between the principal curvatures and the pre-estimated normal curvatures is built. Then the principal curvatures and directions can be found by solving the equations using a least squares approach. The advantage of approaches of this category is efficiency and simplicity. However, the estimation accuracy is usually not very high and depends heavily on the sampling frequency, mesh resolution and mesh accuracy. The approaches may also suffer from robustness problems due to insufficient sampling rates.

(2) The second category is known as local surface fitting methods. The methods compute a simple analytical surface that locally approximates the mesh around a vertex and the principal curvatures and directions can then be computed by applying classic differential geometry methods to the obtained analytical surface[19–22]. Usually, 1, 2, or even 3-ring neighborhood of the mesh at a vertex is chosen as the local region and a lower order polynomial surface is typically used to fit to the points and/or normals of the chosen neighborhood. When the input data are accurate, local surface fitting often produces good estimation. However, surface fitting methods depend on which neighborhood to fit. This kind of method may suffer heavy computational cost or numerical stability problem because a linear system has to be solved for each vertex.

(3) The third category is discrete methods. Discrete methods attempt to calculate the curvature tensor directly from the local region of a mesh. Rusinkiewicz  [23] proposed to compute curvature tensors using finite difference and least squares fitting. Cohen-Steiner and Morvan  [24] proposed to compute average curvature tensor based on normal cycle theory. Another famous approach in this category is Taubin’s integral method that computes the curvature tensor via eigen-analysis of a

                           ×
                           3
                         symmetric matrix  [25]. The 3×3 symmetric matrix, which we call Taubin integral, is defined by an integral of a normal-curvature-weighted second order symmetric tangent tensor. Given a triangular mesh, the Taubin integral for each vertex is approximated by a weighted tensor sum over the neighborhood around the vertex. Some variants or extensions have also been proposed to compute the tensor matrix from the input data  [26–28]. In general, discrete methods are very efficient and somewhat robust. However, the accuracy of estimation is adversely affected by obtuse triangles in the mesh and valences other than four or six  [12].

The performance of a particular curvature estimation method may be affected by many factors such as the presence of noise, valences of the mesh, mesh resolution, and normal vectors  [12,9]. Nevertheless, the most important concerns about a curvature tensor estimation algorithm are its accuracy, robustness and efficiency. While many techniques have been developed to improve the robustness of curvature tensor estimation against data noise  [23,29,30], they may generate inaccurate or blurred curvatures for graphics application. In other applications such as visualization of geometric details, edge detection, surface interrogation, etc., the accuracy of curvature tensor estimation plays an important role.

Our work is inspired by Taubin’s integral method. Taubin’s method has a linear complexity, both in time and in space, as a function of the number of vertices of the mesh. All the computations are simple and direct with closed form expressions and the estimation results are reasonably accurate. However, it is noticed that in Taubin’s approach, the calculation of integral is discretized based on the vertex valence and approximated based on the geometry of a triangular mesh. Since the input triangular mesh is only a linear approximation of a subjacent, unknown, smooth surface, we believe that for a triangular mesh with normal vectors at vertices, each triangle can be replaced by a surface patch that can better approximate the underlying surface and the computation based on the appropriately chosen patch can yield more accurate curvature tensor estimation. This motivates us to estimate curvature tensors on triangular meshes by computing continuous Taubin integral and interpolating piecewise smooth surfaces to the meshes.

The main contributions of the paper are as follows.

                              A closed form expression is derived for the Taubin integral at the joint point of a set of parametric surface patches that may not be

                                  continuous but only have a common tangent plane at the point. The closed form Taubin integral at any point in a single surface patch is also obtained.

An explicit, local scheme is presented for constructing piecewise cubic triangular Bézier patches to interpolate vertices and vertex normals of a triangle mesh. The free coefficients for every Bézier patch are carefully estimated for achieving high accuracy estimation of curvature tensors at vertices.

A weighted sum of Taubin integrals is proposed, which leads to a robust scheme for curvature tensor estimation on meshes with data noise, and a unified algorithm is proposed to estimate curvature tensors for triangular meshes with accurate or noisy data.

@&#OVERVIEW@&#

Section  2 reviews pertinent background of surface curvatures. Section  3 derives a closed form formula for computing the Taubin integral at a point where the surface is formed by joining several parametric patches. Section  4 describes how to construct appropriate parametric surfaces interpolating triangles with given normal vectors at vertices. Section  5 outlines the algorithm steps for computing principal curvatures and principal directions for a given triangular mesh. The experimental examples and comparisons are given in Section  6. Section  7 concludes the paper.

Curvatures and the tensor of curvature are well studied in classical differential geometry (see for example Ref.  [31]). The curvature tensor is closely related to the surface normal and normal curvature evaluation.

                      surface patches and continuous normal patches for visually smooth rendering of surfaces. However, these methods may not be applicable for our purpose as they usually need a lot of computational costs or suffer low approximation accuracy for meshes sampled on a known surface. For an accurate and efficient curvature tensor estimation purpose, we interpolate surfaces to a triangular mesh satisfying the following requirements.
                        
                           (a)
                           The normal curvatures of any interpolating surface at mesh vertices should be as accurate as possible.

The interpolating surfaces should not deviate from the triangular mesh too much when the triangle vertices lie on some sharp edges.

Each surface patch should be constructed independently and explicitly just based on vertices and vertex normals of a triangle.

We follow the idea of the curved PN triangles method  [34] and construct a cubic triangular Bézier patch for each triangle with given corner normals. Cubic triangular Bézier patches are the lowest degree surface patches that permit inflections along boundary curves and interpolate vertices and normals of a given triangle. While the original curved PN triangles method mainly focuses on contour smoothing of a triangular mesh, it in general does not satisfy requirement (a) stated above. We propose a new cubic Bézier surface interpolation method that satisfies all the three requirements very well. Fig. 2
                      is an example showing different results of piecewise surface interpolation by the curved PN triangles method and our proposed method.

•  Center control point. For each boundary curve of a triangular patch, we specify a vector as an approximate normal of the patch at the midpoint of the curve. Similar to the curved PN triangles method, to capture possible inflection, we compute the vector that is the average of the two end-normals reflected across the plane perpendicular to the edge. While the curved PN triangles method uses this vector as the middle control point for the quadratic normal map, we use the vector directly as an approximate normal, which is shown to work better in our experiments. If we let

This section describes our algorithm for curvature tensor estimation on triangular meshes by piecewise surface interpolation. The algorithm estimates the curvature tensors at mesh vertices by the closed form Taubin integral given in Section  3 and the carefully constructed surfaces described in Section  4. This usually gives quite accurate curvature tensors when the sampled points and normals are accurate. However, the estimation may suffer from noise when the mesh vertices or normals are not accurate.

To enhance the robustness of estimation for a mesh containing noise, we propose to compute the curvature tensor at a vertex by incorporating the Taubin integrals at the center of triangular patches incident to the vertex. Specifically, as in Section  3, we assume that

compute the principal curvatures and principal directions from the Taubin integral using closed form expressions, just as Taubin’s approach  [25].

Note that the combination of the closed form Taubin integral and the curved PN triangles can also estimate curvature tensors for triangular meshes. Fig. 6
                     (a) shows a triangulated torus model with 1800 randomly sampled points and exact curvature tensors at the points. When we interpolate the torus using PN triangles and compute curvature tensors for every vertex by computing the Taubin integral, the average and maximum errors of mean curvatures are 0.099527 and 0.464881, respectively; see Fig. 6(b) for the plot of mean curvature errors. The mean and maximum deviations of principal directions by the PN triangles method are 0.749599 and 8.909531 degrees, respectively. By our proposed surface interpolation scheme, the average and maximum errors of mean curvatures reduce to 0.008991 and 0.083860 while the mean and maximum deviations of principal directions become 0.221218 and 1.741704 degrees, respectively; see Fig. 6(c) for the plot of mean curvature errors using this new surface interpolation scheme.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

This section evaluates our proposed algorithm with several models. We first test the accuracy of the proposed curvature tensor estimation method using two models generated from two analytical surfaces. Then we apply the proposed method to a subdivision surface and a denoised mesh to test its use in checking the smoothness of discrete models. Finally we apply the proposed method for visualizing the detail or estimating smooth curvatures of a real scan-reconstructed mesh.

We compare the proposed method with several state-of-the-art methods which use continuous surface patches or discrete techniques for curvature tensor estimation in CAD or graphics. The vertex normal (VN) triangle based method  [14] is the latest one that computes curvatures using curved triangles. The cubic fitting algorithm  [19] is a representative for analytic fitting methods, which can achieve very high accuracy. The discrete methods which are widely used in graphics include Taubin’s method  [25], the finite difference method proposed by Rusinkiewicz  [23] and the tensor averaging method  [24]. They are very competitive in speed for curvature tensor estimation. All these algorithms were implemented using C++ on a PC with Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU, T9900@3.06 GHz 3.07 GHz and 4G RAM.

The two analytical surfaces are defined as follows. The first surface is a ring-shaped surface:

                     . These two surfaces serve as the ground truth. Both are free of umbilics and thus the principal curvature and principal directions can be computed accurately for each point on the surfaces. We tessellate each surface into a low resolution mesh and a high resolution mesh with different numbers of sampled points on the surface. Meanwhile, the exact curvature tensors of the surface at all sampled points are evaluated for comparison. Fig. 7
                     (a) illustrates two meshes tessellated from the ring-shaped surface, and the two meshes have 1800 or 7200 vertices, respectively. Fig. 7(b) illustrates the two meshes of the G&I surface which have 2550 and 10100 vertices, respectively.

We test the accuracy of our proposed algorithm and other five methods using low resolution tessellated meshes and high resolution tessellated meshes shown in Fig. 7 with exact sampled points and normals. To test the robustness of these methods, we add noise to the four meshes by moving each vertex along its normal direction by a random distance within 2% and 5% of the mean edge length. The vertex normals for the noisy meshes are then computed as the weighted sum of the 1-ring facet normals using the method presented in  [38]. The accuracy of the estimated curvature tensors by each method is measured by the root mean square (RMS) error, which is the square root of the average of square errors of all major and minor curvatures against the ground truth.

From Tables 1 and 2
                     
                      we can see that our proposed method with 
                        ρ
                        =
                        0
                      can achieve the highest accuracy for the two surfaces among all the six methods. Moreover, similar to the cubic fitting method, the finite difference method and the VN triangle method, our method with either 
                        ρ
                        =
                        0
                      or 
                        ρ
                        =
                        1
                      can raise the accuracy when the mesh resolution increases. However, our method with 
                        ρ
                        =
                        0
                      is sensitive to noise. This is not surprising because a surface mesh with noisy vertices or disturbed normals may represent a different underlying surface. An accurate method should then be sensitive to the change of the vertices or the normals of the mesh. On the other hand, the cubic fitting method, the finite difference method and our method with 
                        ρ
                        =
                        1
                      are robust against noise due to the use of the least squares fitting or averaging strategy though the accuracy of the results may not be the highest.

We next show the use of the proposed method for smoothness check of surfaces. We apply the curvature tensor estimation methods to a Doo–Sabin subdivision mesh (see Fig. 8
                     (a)). An initial polygonal mesh is subdivided six times by Doo–Sabin subdivision, and then each face in the refined mesh is split into triangles such that the vertices have random valences. Note that this triangulated mesh is very close to the limit surface of Doo–Sabin subdivision though the vertices of the mesh do not necessarily lie on the limit surface. Thus accurately estimated curvature tensors of the triangulated mesh are assumed to have similar behavior as those of the limit surface. A Doo–Sabin subdivision surface is a generalized biquadratic B-spline surface, and it is composed of a set of parametric surface patches which have tangent plane continuity across the joint edges or the extraordinary points  [39]. Fig. 9
                     (a) and (b) display the mean curvatures and the Gaussian curvatures estimated by our proposed method with 
                        ρ
                        =
                        0
                     , respectively. In these two figures, the joint lines and individual surface patches are clearly visible. Fig. 9(h) shows that the Gaussian curvatures estimated by Taubin’s method are also sensitive to the boundaries of surface patches. However, the accuracy of Taubin’s method is influenced by vertex valences. Fig. 9(d), (e), (f), (g) and (c) show the plots of Gaussian curvatures estimated by the VN triangle method, the cubic fitting method, the finite difference method, the tensor averaging method and our method with 
                        ρ
                        =
                        1
                     , where the curvatures around the patch edges are seen to be blurred due to the process of the least squares fitting or averaging.


                     Fig. 8(b) is another visually smooth surface mesh obtained by bilateral mesh denoising  [40]. To check the smoothness of the denoised mesh, we compute the mean curvature and Gaussian curvature of the mesh by our proposed method with 
                        ρ
                        =
                        0
                     . From the curvature plots in Fig. 10
                     (a) and (b) we learn that the mesh is not as smooth as it looks. It still contains some stairs or artifacts even after bilateral denoising. The curvatures estimated by the proposed method with 
                        ρ
                        =
                        1
                     , the VN triangle method, the cubic fitting method, the finite difference method all look smooth; see Fig. 10(c)–(f), respectively. These methods have hidden the artifacts of the surface mesh. The plots of the mean curvatures estimated by the tensor averaging approach and Taubin’s method are given in Fig. 10(g) and (h), which illustrate some curvature discontinuity of the denoised surface. However, the artifacts are not clear enough due to the limited accuracy of curvature estimation by these methods.

Our proposed curvature tensor estimation algorithm provides a tradeoff between accuracy and robustness, which is controlled by parameter 
                        ρ
                     . A small value of 
                        ρ
                      yields accurate but noise sensitive curvature tensors while a large value of 
                        ρ
                      helps to estimate curvature tensors robustly against noise. Fig. 11
                     (a) illustrates a triangular mesh reconstructed from real scanned data. From the figure we can see that the original surface contains low magnitude noise. The accurate mean curvature plot in Fig. 11(b) corresponding to 
                        ρ
                        =
                        0
                      clearly depicts the noise distribution on the surface. When the parameter value is changed to 
                        ρ
                        =
                        0.5
                      and 
                        ρ
                        =
                        1.0
                     , the curvature plots become smoother and smoother; see Fig. 11(c) and (d) for the results. It is also observed that the principal directions become smoother when the value of parameter 
                        ρ
                      increases.

Finally, we compare the computational efficiency of our proposed algorithm and all other methods by reporting the running time for all the test models in Table 3
                     . From the table, it can be seen that Taubin’s method is the fastest and the cubic fitting algorithm is the slowest. Our proposed method has similar time cost as the finite difference algorithm. Due to its high accuracy and considerable efficiency, our proposed method can be used for curvature tensor computation for triangular meshes that have a large number of vertices.

This paper has derived the closed form Taubin integral for piecewise smooth surfaces or a single parametric surface, which leads to a new way for curvature tensor estimation for triangular meshes. The paper has also presented an improved local surface interpolation scheme for triangular meshes. Compared to other surface fitting methods, the proposed surface interpolation scheme does not need to solve any linear systems. Our proposed curvature tensor estimation method usually generates more accurate results for general surface meshes than the state-of-the-art methods. Also by using weighted sums of Taubin integrals, the proposed algorithm can robustly estimate curvature tensors for noisy meshes. The tradeoff between accuracy and robustness of curvature tensor estimation is controlled using a single parameter.

Accurate curvature tensor estimation can be applied when the input vertices or normals are accurate or have low magnitude noise. Our proposed method can be used to visualize the joint lines between surface patches or the distribution of noise. Although the paper only discusses triangular meshes, the extension of the proposed method to general polygonal meshes is straightforward. One can replace piecewise triangular Bézier surface interpolation to other types of surface interpolation, and the curvature tensors at selected points can be computed by the closed form Taubin integral and the consequent eigen-analysis of the integral matrix.
