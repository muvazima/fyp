                  In view of the fact that objects with different natures usually respond differently to the same external stimulus, this paper proposes a no-reference image quality assessment based on gradient histogram response (GHR). GHR is the gradient histogram variation of an image object under a local transform. In the metric, through preprocessing, a test image is transformed to a noise image and a blur image, which are taken as two image objects. Each image object is exerted with a local transform as an object input, and its GHR as an object output is extracted in multiscale space. The two GHRs compose a global feature vector and are mapped to an image quality score. Experiments show that GHR outperforms state-of-the-art no-reference metrics statistically in the condition that test images are degraded by different types of distortions. Especially, the metric is feasible for the quality assessment of the images degraded by mixed distortions though the types of these images are not included in the training database.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Image quality assessment (IQA) is widely used in the fields of image preprocessing, fusion, transmission, etc. IQA metrics can be roughly categorized into two groups: subjective metrics and objective metrics. Subjective metrics are simple, intuitive and accurate. But they cannot work without human’s participation. They are infeasible in the condition that there are masses of images to be assessed. Therefore, it is indispensable to attach importance to objective metrics. Objective metrics are further categorized into full-reference (FR) metrics, reduced-reference (RR) metrics and no-reference (NR) metrics. FR metrics are based on the following assumption: the reference image is an available image with the highest quality. With FR metrics, the perceptual quality of a test image is assessed by calculating the similarity between the test image and its reference image [1,2]. RR metrics access partial reference information instead of the full reference image. With RR metrics, the similarity or difference between the test image and its reference image also need to be calculated when assessing the quality of a test image [3,4]. Thus, if the access to any reference information is unavailable, FR and RR metrics cannot work. Compared with FR and RR metrics, NR metrics can assess image quality based on the test image itself, so the reference image is unnecessary [5–18]. In terms of application, NR metrics have more promising prospects. Hence, the research of NR metrics has become the study focus both at home and abroad.

According to their feasibilities for specific types of distortions, NR metrics follow two approaches: distortion-specific NR metrics and general (distortion-unspecific) NR metrics. Distortion-specific NR metrics are only applicable to one or more specific types of distortions, such as blocking [7], noise [8], blur [9], etc. They probe into the mechanism of a special type of distortion, and assess image quality only if the distortion type is known in advance. However, in most practical applications, the distortion type is unknown, which limits the applications of the metrics. It is desirable to design a general NR metric which performs well for various types of distortions even without the prior knowledge of distortion type.

An ideal general NR metric should perform well for various common types of distortions. As is known, any metric is to be implemented with two phases: feature extraction and quality assessment. Feature extraction is vital to IQA, but it is difficult to choose the types of features which are the most useful to depict image quality. Quality assessment maps the features to a quality score through intelligent algorithms. Statistical models based on natural scene statistics (NSS) are common feature extraction approaches [1,2,10–17]. They assume that natural scenes possess certain statistical properties, and distortion affects these properties. Generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) statistical model and asymmetric generalized Gaussian distribution statistical (AGGD) model are often used to depict image signal distributions, and reveal the marginal statistics of image signals [10–12,14–17]. The parameters of the estimated models can be used as features to be mapped to quality scores through support vector regression (SVR) [10,12], deep learning [17], etc. Codebook-based model is another common feature extraction approach for NR metrics [13,18]. A codebook is constructed from the local features extracted from labelled training images, and is used for feature space quantization. Local features extracted from the test image are encoded as a vector through quantization. Image quality is assessed by mapping the vector to a quality score using SVR [13,18], example-based method [18], etc. But efforts should still be made to reduce the gaps between subjective scores and objective predicted scores to meet the requirements of actual applications. The present NR metrics work well mainly in the condition that images are degraded by one type of distortion. In the conditions that the images are degraded by different types of distortions or mixed distortions, there is great improvement space in accuracy and stability for NR metrics.

This paper proposes a new NR metric—gradient histogram response (GHR). GHR refers to the gradient histogram variation between an image and its counterpart under a local image transform. GHR is extracted in multiscale space to improve the metric’s performance. The metric is irrelevant to the distortion type and the image content. To keep the metric adaptable to different types of distortions, a test image is transformed to a noise image and a blur image through preprocessing. Each of the two images is taken as an unknown image object, and its corresponding local image transform and GHR are taken as its input and output respectively. The two GHRs of the two image objects compose a global feature vector, and are mapped to an image quality score. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 establishes an IQA framework, which exerts an image input to the test image, and assesses image quality based on its image response output. Section 3 introduces gradient histogram. Section 4 introduces GHR and feature descriptions. Section 5 investigates the relationship between GHR and noise/blur distortion in detail. Further, Section 6 adjusts the gradient definition and puts forward a NR metric based on GHR. In Section 7, experiments are carried out to verify GHR’s assessment performance. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 8.

Objects with different natures often response differently to the same stimulus input. For an unknown object, its essential nature can be acquired by analyzing the object’s response outputs. In the real world, the assessment (investigation) of an unknown object is a commonly-confronted problem. In control field, a controlled object is an unknown object when its transfer function is measured; in software design field, a new software is an unknown object when its reliability and stability are assessed; in medical field, a patient is an unknown object when his pathologies are diagnosed. In the above fields, to acquire the essential nature of an unknown object, an external stimulus as an input is exerted to the unknown object, and its response output is then analyzed to probe into its intrinsic essential nature [19–21]. A test image to be assessed can be taken as an unknown object, which lays the very foundation for a new IQA framework as shown in Fig. 1
                     . With the test image taken as an unknown object, an external image input is exerted to the object, and then the quality of the object is assessed based on its response output. Here, the image’s external stimulus input is a local image transform (with which an original test image changes into a transformed image); its response output is the corresponding feature variation between the original test image and the transformed image.

There are many ways to classify distortions. According to their producing mechanism, they can be classified into JPEG2000, JPEG, WN, GBLUR, FF (Fast Fading), etc. [22]. According to their effects on the local correlation of neighboring pixels, they can be classified into three groups: noise distortion, blur distortion, and noise–blur distortion. Noise distortion such as Gaussian noise distortion weakens the correlation of image neighboring pixels. Blur distortion such as Gaussian-smoothing distortion reinforces the correlation of neighboring pixels. JPEG2000 distortion mainly makes image blur, and also belongs to blur distortion. Noise–blur distortion indicates that the distortion has both noise effects and blur effects. Noise–blur distortion may be shown in many forms. For example, an image can be degraded by noise distortion and blur distortion successively. Then the distortion produced from multiple types of distortions is defined as mixed distortion, which is a common form of noise–blur distortion. JPEG and FF distortions also belong to noise–blur distortion. The edges of the blocks in a JPEG image destroy the correlation of neighboring pixels, while the inner parts of the blocks reinforce the correlation. FF distortion is produced through different proportions of bit errors on JPEG2000 image bitstream. JPEG2000 distortion causes image blur, and bit errors on image bitstream can be seen as random noise. In this section and Sections 4–6, the latter classification approach is adopted to probe into the relationship between gradient histogram response and image quality.

An ideal metric should be feasible to assess different types of distortions without the knowledge of distortion type. There are many metrics feasible for blur images and noise images [12–15]. But it is difficult to assess noise–blur images because the effects of noise and blur are converse. In other words, they mutually interfere with each other from visual perception. Image enhancement preprocessing can be used to eliminate blur distortion and enhance noise distortion. Through proper enhancement preprocessing, the effect of blur in the noise–blur image can be approximately eliminated, and the noise–blur image can be considered to be mainly degraded by noise distortion; the effect of noise in the noise image is enhanced, and the IQA sensitivity of noise distortion is improved; the effect of blur in the blur image is degraded, and the IQA sensitivity of blur distortion is slightly deteriorated. On the other hand, image smoothing preprocessing can be used to eliminate noise distortion and enhance blur distortion. Through proper smoothing preprocessing, the noise–blur image can be considered to be mainly degraded by blur distortion; the IQA sensitivity of noise distortion in the noise image is slightly deteriorated; the IQA sensitivity of blur distortion in the blur image is improved. According to the above discussions, the image quality of the noise–blur image can be assessed through noise assessment and blur assessment. The assessments for noise (blur) distortion under image smoothing and image enhancement are complementary. The image quality of the noise (blur) image can also be assessed through noise assessment and blur assessment. Thus, the IQA framework can be further implemented as in Fig. 2
                     . The quality of the test image is assessed based on blur assessment and noise assessment. The test image is preprocessed through enhancement and smoothing to produce a noise image and a blur image. The two images are taken as two unknown image objects. Each image object is exerted with a local transform as an object input, and its GHR is extracted as an object output. Their response features are combined as a global feature vector and mapped to an image quality score. In the framework, the noise image is produced through enhancement preprocessing. In fact, it may not really be a noise image. Similarly, the blur image is produced through smoothing preprocessing and also may not really be a blur image.

Gradient histogram is a kind of local feature description, which describes the appearance and shape of a local block image. It counts the gradient vote in gradient orientations across the local block image [23], and has been widely used in image recognition, image quality assessment, image registration, etc. [23–25]. In its extraction, a test image I(x, y) is divided into a series of block images with size of N × N. For a random pixel (x, y) in a block image, its horizontal gradient Gx
                     (x, y) and vertical gradient Gy
                     (x, y) are calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2). Then gradient magnitude M(x, y) and orientation θ(x, y) are calculated by Eqs. (3) and (4).

In Section 2, image enhancement is exerted to a test image to produce a noise image, and image smoothing is exerted to the test image to produce a blur image. Image enhancement weakens the correlation among neighboring pixels while image smoothing reinforces the correlation among neighboring pixels. Suppose that a test image and its corresponding image object are I(x, y) and Io
                        , and then image enhancement (image smoothing) can be achieved with Eqs. (6)–(8).

                         is taken as an image object for further investigation in the following sections. The Laplacian operator is a second-derivative neighborhood operator and sensitive to isolated points and thin lines, which is often adopted to sharpen images. When λ is greater than zero, Eq. (8) plays a role of image enhancement; when λ is less than zero, Eq. (8) plays a role of image smoothing. To distinguish different roles, the constants are labelled as λn
                         and λb
                         in image enhancement and image smoothing respectively.

Gradient histogram is a statistical result of the gradients across a local block image. So it is directly related to horizontal gradient Gx

                        (x, y), which are calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2). Here, the image input Li

                         respectively. In [14], NR BLIIDS-II metric chooses the features, including generalized Gaussian model shape parameter, frequency variation coefficient, energy subband ratio measure and orientation model-based feature, to describe the coefficients in DCT domain, and it has high performance. In the metric proposed in this paper, five features are chosen to describe GHR: gradient histogram distance, generalized Gaussian model shape parameter, variation coefficient, energy subband ratio measure and orientation model-based feature. Among the features, the latter four are based on similar ideas as in BLIIDS-II.

Gradient histogram distance (GHD) is defined as

                              
                                 (12)
                                 
                                    
                                       ψ
                                       =
                                       norm
                                       (
                                       R
                                       )
                                    
                                 
                              
                           It is a Euclidean distance between H and H′, intuitively depicting the difference between the two feature vectors. The histogram distance ψ is pooled in two ways: by computing the highest 10th percentile average and the 100th percentile average of the block scores across the image object. It has been verified that this “percentile pooling” approach can reinforce the correlations with subjective perception of image quality [14]. It is motivated by the fact that subjective perception is heavily influenced by the “worst” distortion in an image. 10th percentile and 100th percentile pooling help inform the predictor whether the distortion is partly severe or uniformly irritating over the whole image.

Generalized Gaussian model is often used to depict data distribution [10–13]. This paper adopts the model to describe the distribution of gradient histogram response R in gradient orientation. Let x be a random variable, representing an item of R, and then the univariate generalized Gaussian density is given by

                           where μ, γ, α and β denote the mean, the shape parameter, the normalizing parameter and the scaling parameter of the distribution respectively. The shape parameter γ denotes the decay rate: the smaller the γ is, the more peaked the probability distribution function (PDF) model is; the larger the γ is, the flatter the PDF is. A variety of parameter estimation methods have been proposed for this model. This paper adopts the method given in [14,26] to estimate the parameters of the model. γ is computed for all blocks across the image object. The feature is pooled by averaging over the highest 10th percentile and over the 100th percentile of the block shape parameters across the image object. The motivation behind the percentile pooling strategy is similar to that behind the percentile pooling of GHD.

Let x be a random variable, representing an item of the histogram response vector R as in the above paragraph, and then histogram response variation coefficient is defined as follows [14]:

                           |x| and σ
                           |x| are the mean and standard deviation of x respectively. The denominator μ
                           |x| measures the center of x magnitude distribution while the numerator σ
                           |x| measures the spread or energy of x magnitudes. Variation coefficient is pooled by the highest 10th percentile average and the 100th percentile average of the local block scores across the image object. The motivation behind the percentile pooling strategy is also similar to that behind the pooling strategy of GHD.

The items of R are sorted into 3 equal bands in the ascending order. Then the average energy in band n is defined as the variance

                            is effective on the ground that n is greater than 1. A large ratio corresponds to a large disparity between the energy in the nth band and the average energy in the lower bands. The mean of χ
                           2 and χ
                           3 is computed as the final energy subband ratio. The feature is also pooled by the highest 10th percentile average and the 100th percentile average of the block scores across the image object.

Image distortion will affect local orientation energy, which can be reflected in the variation of gradient orientation energy. According to gradient orientation bins, gradient histogram R is modelled in three orientations: [
                              −
                           π
                              −
                           2/3π), [
                              −
                           2/3π 1/3π), [1/3π π). Orientation variation is obtained as in Eq. (14) for each orientation. The variance of orientation variations across the three orientations, labelled as ϕ, is the final orientation feature. The feature is also pooled by averaging over the highest 10th percentile and over the 100th percentile of all the block scores across the image object.

Image analysis in multiscale space is a study focus [27]. Successful IQA metrics have been investigated based on multiscale features [14,27]. Multiscale features can generally improve the performance of the metrics. In the similar way, GHR is detected in multiscale space. The multiscale image space is set up through low-pass filtering the image and subsampling it by a factor of 2. The process is repeated twice. The filter is a rotationally symmetric discrete Gaussian filter with its size equal to 3 × 3, mean equal to 0 and variance equal to 0.5. The features in multiscale space form a multiscale feature vector.

Gradient histogram response (GHR) is the variation of gradient histogram under an image input. From a micro perspective, it is related to the variation of each pixel’s gradient. From a macro perspective, it is related to the distribution of gradient histogram. Surely, GHR results from a comprehensive function of multiple factors. In the following discussion, the focus is placed upon the key influence factors.

First, gradient variation with distortion on GHR from a micro perspective. For a random pixel, its gradient variation can be described by the variations of Gx
                        (x, y) and Gy
                        (x, y) (M(x, y) and θ(x, y)). It is supposed that neither absolute Gx
                        (x, y) nor absolute Gy
                        (x, y) is equal to zero. The relative horizontal gradient variation Δrx
                        (x, y) and the relative vertical gradient variation Δry
                        (x, y) are represented in Eqs. (16) and 17 respectively.

                        (x, y) (Gy
                        (x, y)) is close to zeros, is unstable because a small disturbance will cause a great relative gradient variation. Therefore, it cannot represent the gradient variation tendency of most pixels. Furthermore, the gradient variation tendency of most pixels is also small under a small image input. Hence are chosen the pixels whose absolute horizontal gradients (vertical gradients) are larger than zero and Δrx
                        (x, y) (Δry
                        (x, y)) are less than a predefined threshold. Here, the threshold is set to 50.

According to Eqs. (1)–(5) and (11), GHR is related to horizontal gradient, vertical gradient, and horizontal-vertical gradient correlation. Δrx
                        (x, y) and Δry
                        (x, y) are mutually independent (which has been verified as in Fig. 5 in the latter paragraphs), and their correlation 
                           
                              ρ

                         tends to zero. Therefore, the effects of Δrx
                        (x, y) and Δry
                        (x, y) can be independently discussed. As shown in Fig. 3
                        , the shaded block is supposed to be a possible relative variation scope. G and G′ are the abbreviations of G(x, y) and G′(x, y), referring to the gradients of the test image and the output image respectively. From a statistical view, each variation is a random value. Although the precise distributions of Δrx
                        (x, y) and Δry
                        (x, y) remain unknown, it is obvious that the wider their scopes are, the larger the variations in gradient magnitude and orientation are.

For Δrx
                        (x, y), its distribution is related to ΔGx

Because the gradient magnitudes in each orientation bin and gradient histogram are all statistical results, the effects of pure gradient magnitude variation will be greatly restrained as in Eq. (5). It means that the variation in gradient histogram has a decreasing tendency as

Second, gradient histogram distribution on GHR from a macro perspective. As shown in Fig. 4
                        
                        , Fig. 4(a) and (c) are two block images, respectively partitioned from a WN image and a GBLUR image with DMOS 65.6539 and 80.0819 respectively. And the WN image and the GLBUR image are both produced from the Rapids image in the LIVE database [22]. The blocks are of 40 × 40 size, corresponding to the same region ([321:360 301:340]) in the Rapids image. DMOS is on a scale of 0–100 with a large DMOS indicating poor visual quality. The main orientation of gradient histogram refers to the orientation of the peak in gradient histogram [23]. Fig. 4(b) and (d) are the corresponding gradient histograms of Fig. 4(a) and (c). For a noise block image, the main orientation of its gradient histogram is not obvious. In contrast, for a blur block image, the main orientation of its gradient histogram is obvious. The gradient orientations of the pixels in the noise region are approximately random, and gradient magnitudes in all the bins are statistically equal. Therefore, its gradient histogram has no obvious main orientation. Conversely, the gradient histogram of the blur image has an obvious main orientation. Variation in gradient magnitude and orientation will lead to a perturbation of gradient histogram. As discussed in the above paragraph, the effects of pure gradient magnitude are greatly restrained due to gradient histogram normalization. In other words, the variation in gradient orientation plays a vital role. The gradient votes in one bin are supposed to be obviously greater than those in its neighboring bins. More gradient votes may shift to its neighboring bins under the same relative pixel gradient variation, which leads to a stronger response. For the noise histogram, it is stable due to unobvious gradient vote differences among neighboring bins; for the blur histogram, it is unstable due to obvious gradient vote differences among neighboring bins.

Based on the above discussion, GHR for noise and blur distortions is investigated. GHR is detected over 40 × 40 blocks, which are partitioned from an image object at an interval of 40 pixels along horizontal and vertical axes. Because gradient histogram distance (GHD) ψ can intuitively represent GHR, the following discussion uses its average over all of the block scores across the image object to roughly describe GHR.

Since the producing mechanisms of horizontal gradient variation and vertical gradient variation are similar, this paper probes into their producing mechanisms by sampling of horizontal gradient variation. As discussed in Section 5.1, the main influence factors of relative horizontal gradient variation Δrx

In Eqs. (19) and (24), η is a constant, so ΔGx
                        (x, y) has the same variation tendency with Ex
                        (x, y). Ex
                        (x, y) is obtained in a way that can be approximately seen as a first-derivative operator on the horizontal gradient image of the image object. Therefore, Ex
                        (x, y) is more sensitive to image neighboring gray difference compared with Gx
                        (x, y).

                        For a pure noise image, its gradient correlation ρ among direct-neighboring pixels is close to zero; for a large-scale smoothed image, its gradient correlation ρ among direct-neighboring pixels is close to 1. Therefore, ρ is within the scope of [0 1]. Within the scope, the value of Eq. (27) is less than zero, which means that

Test noise images are the corresponding noise images of a reference image in the LIVE database. Large DMOS indicates large noise, low ρ, and large gray differences among neighboring pixels. Since the results of all the experiments are similar, the noise images of a reference image Rapids are chosen to describe the general result. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 5(a)–(d).

                        ) will weaken the variation in gradient histogram. From a macro perspective, the histogram of a noise block image is stable to external interference. As the noise increases, the gradient votes in all the bins tend to be equal, and gradient histogram is stable through normalization. The final tendency of GHR is the result of comprehensive effects. GHD falls with DMOS ψ increasing as shown in Fig. 5(d), which means that the declining effects play a vital role in this case. It can be approximately inferred that GHR also falls as DMOS increases.

The analysis of gradient histogram response for blur distortion is similar to that of gradient histogram response for noise distortion. Because the experimental results also tend to be similar, the blur images of a reference image Rapids are chosen to describe the general result with an example as in the above subsection. Test blur images are the corresponding blur images of a reference image (Rapids) in the LIVE database. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 5(e)–(h). For a blur image, large DMOS indicates large-scale blur, large ρ, and small gray differences among neighboring pixels. According to Fig. 5(e)–(g), both the variance ratio

                        ) decreases as DMOS increases, as shown in Fig. 5(g). Fig. 5(h) shows that GHD overall decreases as DMOS increases, which means that the declining factors play a vital role. However, for the image degraded by large-scale blur distortion, its GHD ψ may increase sharply, which is because that its horizontal (vertical) gradient is close to 0, and a small disturbance may lead to a large relative variation in horizontal (vertical) gradient. According to the tendency of GHD, it can be approximately inferred that GHR generally falls as DMOS increases. But GHR may be abnormal for large-scale blur distortion.

As discussed in Section 5, GHR decreases as noise and blur distortions increase. But when the gradient magnitude is close to 0, GHR is unstable. Especially for a pixel in a large-scale smoothed image, its gradient magnitude is likely to be small. A small disturbance will lead to a large relative variation, as shown in Fig. 5 (h). Therefore, a constant is added to Gx

                        ) is statistically small, and so is GHR. For most pixels in a large-scale noise image, τis relatively small compared with the original horizontal (vertical) gradient, and can be ignored. Therefore, GHR is also small, similar to that shown in Fig. 5(e). For a small-scale smoothed (blur) image and a small-scale noise image, they are in the transitional stage from blur distortion to noise distortion. It is difficult to precisely decide the tendency of GHR, which is related to image preprocessing, image input and gradient adjustment. But fine performance can be achieved through parameter optimization. To distinguish the constants in the noise image object and the blur image object, they are labelled as τn
                         and τb
                         respectively.

The assessment mechanisms of noise distortion and blur distortion are different. When the two distortions coexist, they will interact with each other, leading to the deterioration of the IQA metric’s performance. Noise distortion will reduce the correlation among neighboring pixels and affect blur distortion assessment. Similarly, blur distortion will reinforce the correlation among neighboring pixels and affect noise distortion assessment. To make GHR work without the knowledge of distortion type, a test image is transformed to a noise image and a blur image through preprocessing. The two images are taken as objects. The quality of the test image is assessed based on the responses of the two objects.

In Section 5, the relationships between GHD ψ and DMOS for noise and blur distortions have been shown. But a great amount of information is lost in the process from GHR to GHD. To achieve better performance, it is necessary to extract more features from GHR. Here, five features are chosen as GHR features: gradient histogram distance ψ, generalized Gaussian model shape parameter γ, histogram response variation coefficient ζ, energy subband ratio χ and orientation feature ϕ. The response features of the noise image object (the blur image object) form a vector

To guarantee the superior performance of GHR, the metric should choose proper parameters, including λn, ηn, τn
                         in noise image assessment and λb, ηb, τb
                         in blur image assessment. The coefficients are determined by experimental performance. In each experiment, 90% of the LIVE images are chosen for training, and the remaining LIVE images for testing. A support vector regression (SVR) [28] is adopted to map feature vectors to DMOSs. After training, the metric is applied to assess image quality of test images, providing predicted DMOSs. The correlation SROCC (Spearson rank order correlation coefficient) between DMOSs and predicted DMOSs of the test images is calculated. Large SROCC indicates high performance. For each group of coefficients, 60 experiments are carried out, and the average of 60 experimental SROCCs is used as a performance criterion to determine coefficients.

Based on the coefficient optimization for blur and noise distortions, the response features of both the noise image object and the blur image object, which are produced from the same test image, are combined to form a global vector

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

This section covers the experiments which are carried out to evaluate the performance of GHR. The chosen metrics include FR metrics (PSNR and SSIM [1]) and NR metrics (NIQE [11], BIQI [15], CurveletQA [16], Cornia[13], BLIIDS-II [14] and GHR). As discussed in Section 2, distortions have different classification approaches. Different from the local-correlation-effect classification approach as in Sections 3–6, the distortion-producing-mechanism classification approach is employed in this section, due to its wide applications in the real world.

The LIVE database contains 29 high-resolution 24bits/pixel RGB color images as reference images and five types of corresponding distorted images: JPEG2000, JPEG, White Noisy (WN), Gaussian blurred (GBLUR) and Fast-Fading (FF) Rayleigh channel noisy images [22]. Subjective quality scores are given in terms of the difference mean opinion score (DMOS) on a scale of 0–100 with a large DMOS indicating poor visual quality. In order to train and test GHR, the database is divided into two subsets, where there is no overlap. The training subset consists of 90% images, randomly chosen from the LIVE database. The testing subset covers the rest 10%.

The Spearson rank order correlation coefficient (SROCC) is employed as a criterion for comparison. SROCC has been widely used in the performance assessment of IQA metrics [1,10–12,14–16]. The parameters, including λn, ηn, τn
                         in noise image assessment and λb, ηb, τb
                         in blur image assessment, are determined as in Section 6.2. The experimental results are the averages of the scores across 60 train-test experiments, illustrated in Table 3
                        . Experiments are carried out in two cases: in one case, only one type of distorted images is chosen for training and testing; in the other case, five types of distorted images are chosen for training and testing, which means that all the distorted images are chosen. According to the first five rows of Table 3, GHR apparently outperforms PSNR, NIQE and BIQI in the first case. And GHR is slightly inferior to SSIM, CurveletQA, Cornia and BLIIDS-II for some types of distortions. According to the last row of Table 3, GHR performs best among all the eight metrics in the latter case. The table indicates that the metric works well without the knowledge of the distortion type and keeps relatively good performance in the condition that the images are degraded by the same type of distortion.

Furthermore, the standard deviation of the SROCCs is reported on the 60 experiments for each algorithm in Table 4
                         in the latter case. The performance is better when the average SROCC is larger and the standard deviation is lower. The table shows that all the metrics are not significantly different in standard deviation, so the averages of the SROCCs can depict the performance of the metrics.

An image database is built, where 29 images are taken from MorgueFile Free Photo Archive [29], as shown in Fig. 6
                        . The 29 images are resized to half of original sizes through bicubic interpolation to produce reference images. In this way, noise and blur are approximately eliminated. Therefore, the reference images are of the highest quality. The images degraded by JPEG2000, JPEG, WN, GBLUR and FF are produced in the same way as those in the LIVE database. Experimental results are also the averages of the scores across 60 train-test experiments. In each experiment, the 29 reference images randomly match with the 29 reference images in the LIVE database one by one. Due to the same producing approaches, the subjective quality score of each distorted image for a reference image in the self-built image database is approximately assumed as the score of the corresponding distorted image for the matching reference image in the LIVE database. Therefore, in each experiment, the number of images in the self-built image database is equal to that of images in the LIVE database.

The experiments are also carried out in the same way in the LIVE database. The experimental results are shown in Tables 5
                         and 6
                        . Obviously, the performance of all the metrics weakens compared with that in Table 3, which is partly because that the subjective quality score of each distorted image in the self-built image database is approximately assumed. From Table 5, it can be inferred that GHR has the best performance among the eight metrics in the condition that all the five types of distorted images are chosen. When one type of distorted images is chosen, GHR keeps relatively better performance, and there is a narrower gap between GHR and other metrics compared with that in the above subsection. For example, GHR outperforms BLIIDS-II for JPEG2000, JPEG and FF. And the performance gaps between GHR and BLIIDS-II for WN and GBLUR become smaller compared with those in the LIVE database. Because the features of GHR are statistical features across all the blocks, adequate blocks can keep GHR more consistent with subjective judgments. All the images in the self-built database can be partitioned into more blocks for they are of resolutions more than 700 × 700, larger than those in the LIVE database.

Furthermore, the standard deviation of the SROCCs is reported on the 60 experiments for each algorithm in Table 6 in the condition that all the five types of distorted images are chosen. The table also shows that all the metrics are not significantly different in standard deviation from a statistical view, so the averages of the SROCCs can depict the performance of the metrics.

The existing NR metrics mainly focus on the assessments of the images degraded by one type of distortion, which are also the main components of the existing public database. The related distortions may be different, but one image is only degraded by one type of distortion. In the real world, an image may be simultaneously degraded by multiple types of distortions. For instance, an image is degraded by Gaussian noise and Gaussian blur successively. If a new type of distortion is produced from several types of distortions, the new distortion is called mixed distortion in this subsection. In such a case, the existing IQA metrics do not work well. In the condition that the images are degraded by JPEG2000, JPEG, WN, GBLUR and FF as in Section 7.1, GHR is trained and applied to provide predicted scores DMOSp
                         in this experiment. The training database does not include the images degraded by mixed distortions. Mixed-distortion images are produced from the images in the LIVE database as follows:

                           
                              (1)
                              Exert a Gaussian noise to JPEG2000, JPEG, GBLUR and FF images.

Exert a Gaussian smoothing to JPEG2000, JPEG, WN and FF images.

Exert a Gaussian noise and a smoothing to reference images successively.

Exert a Gaussian smoothing and a noise to reference images successively.

There are 29 reference images and 982 distorted images in the LIVE database. If all the images are chosen to produce mixed-distortion images, there will be 2022 images in total. In fact, there are many approaches to produce mixed distortions, and all the distortions are multi-levelled. It is an arduous task to accomplish the subjective assessments of all the images degraded by mixed distortions. Therefore, only a small number of mixed distortions with limited levels are produced to preliminarily verify the performance of GHR for mixed distortions. To be exact, 10 reference images and their corresponding distorted images are chosen to produce mixed-distortion images. The chosen reference images include Buildings, Studentsculpture, Rapids, Dancers, Churchandcapitol, Ocean, House, Stream, Cemetry and Woman. The chosen distorted images in the LIVE database and the produced mixed-distortion images compose a trial database. In the experiment, the Gaussian noise distortion is a Gaussian noise with its mean equal to 0 and variance equal to 0.01, and the Gaussian smoothing distortion is a Gaussian filter with its size equal to 5 × 5 and variance equal to 0.5. Ten students are invited to assess each image, giving scores on a scale of 0–100 with a large score indicating high visual quality. The final subjective score of each image is calculated by averaging the ten scores. New DMOS is calculated as follows:

                        where Scored
                         and Scorer
                         are the subjective scores of a distorted image and its corresponding reference image. The SROCC between DMOSp
                         (predicted score) and DMOSn
                         is chosen as a criterion for comparison. The SROCC is the average of the scores on 60 experiments. Accurate SROCC should be calculated in the condition of balanced data where the samples are enough to cover most of the possible value scope and are approximately evenly distributed across the possible value scope. Most of the produced mixed-distortion images are of low quality, with DMOSn
                         greater than 45. The trial database consists of two parts: the distorted images from the LIVE database and the produced mixed-distortion images. In each experiment, a subset is chosen from the trial database to calculate SROCC. The images chosen from the first part are the images whose DMOSn
                        s are less than 45. The mixed-distortion images are chosen from the second part according to the reference images and the types of mixed distortions. For example, through exerting a noise to JPEG2000, JPEG, GBLUR, FF images, four types of mixed distortions are obtained: noise-JPEG2000, noise-JPEG, noise-GBLUR, noise-FF. Therefore, there are totally 10 (4+4+1+1) types of mixed-distortions according to the mixed-distortion producing approaches. Regarding to a reference image, one image is chosen for each type of distortion. If one reference image is chosen, 10 mixed-distortion images should be chosen correspondingly. By the first two approaches, a type of more than one mixed-distortion image is produced for each type of mixed distortion because there are several levels of distortions. In such case, one image is randomly chosen. At the same time, the experiments based on the first part in the trial database are also carried out to calculate the SROCC between DMOSp
                         (predicted score) and DMOSn
                        . The SROCCs in this case are labelled as original SROCCs. And the SROCCs in the experiments with mixed distortions are labelled as present SROCCs. The changes between experimental results in the two cases can reflect the performance of the metrics for mixed distortions.

From Table 7
                        , it can be seen that the performance of all the metrics for mixed distortions weakens, compared with that of all the metrics calculated in the condition that mixed-distortion images are not included. Although the performance of each metric has more or less degradation, it can be found that GHR is the most stable metric among the NR metrics: NIQI, BIQI, CurveletQA, Cornia, BLIIDS-II and GHR. PSNR and SSIM (FR metrics) are superior to all the NR metrics, which actually indicates the necessity of further NR metric study. The noise and smoothing mutually interfere, and may weaken the performance of some metrics. For example, BLIIDS-II has superior performance in the condition that the test image is degraded by one type of distortion (different test images may be degraded by different types of distortions). But it does not work well for mixed distortion. When an image is distorted by a large-scale noise and a large-scale smoothing successively, its predicted score for BLIIDS-II may be near to that of its corresponding reference image, which indicates high quality. In this case, there is a great gap between the predicted DMOS and the subjective DMOSn
                        . GHR metric is based on a noise image and a blur image. The approach can effectively eliminate the mutual interference between noise distortion and blur distortion, and improve the performance of the metric.

GHR is trained in the LIVE database and then applied to the CSIQ database [30]. There is no overlap between the two databases. The CSIQ database involves 30 original reference color images. Each reference image is degraded using six different types of distortions at four to five different levels of distortion. Subjective quality scores are provided in terms of DMOS on a scale of 0–1. Among the six types of distortions, GHR is tested on JPEG2000, JPEG, additive white noise (WN) and Gaussian blur (GBLUR), which are also included in the LIVE database. The sizes of the images in the CSIQ database are all 512 × 512, smaller than those of the images in the LIVE database. The third-scale images are of 128 × 128 size. For GHR, gradients are calculated over the blocks with 40 × 40 size, which is partitioned from an image object every 40 pixels along horizontal and vertical axes. In a third-scale image, there are 9 blocks, 10 percent of which are near to one block. In this case, the number of blocks is inadequate, and cannot keep the statistical GHR features consistent with subjective judgments. Therefore, GHR features are extracted in two-scale space in this subsection. The SROCCs between the predicted quality assessment and DMOS is presented in Table 8
                        . Obviously, FR metrics (PSNR and SSIM) outperform NR metrics (NIQI, BIQI, CurveletQA, Cornia, BLIIDS-II and GHR), which further indicates the necessity of NR metric study. Compared with the performance in the LIVE database, the performance of all the NR metrics present a slight degrading tendency. When images are degraded by four types of distortions, of which all the distorted images are included, GHR still performs best in terms of the correlation with human perception of image quality among the six NR metrics. And it can keep relatively good performance when the images are degraded by one type of distortion.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

GHR, as a no-reference (NR) IQA metric, has superior performance in the condition that test images are degraded by different types of distortions, which means that it can work well in complex conditions without the prior knowledge of distortion types. Especially, it works well for mixed distortions though the types of these images are not included in the training database. Simultaneously, it has relatively good performance when test images are degraded by one type of distortion compared with state-of-the-art NR metrics. Additionally, we think further efforts should be made in the following fields:

                        
                           (1)
                           Application of IQA framework The paper puts forward an IQA framework. In the framework, image quality is assessed based on image object responses. Further efforts can be made to investigate whether the framework can also be used in state-of-the-art metrics, such as PSNR and SSIM, to improve their performance.

Image input GHR is a response output under an image input. It is necessary to investigate more proper image inputs to improve GHR’s performance.

Response features Response features are vital to image quality assessment. GHR does not work well when the size of the test image is small. It is because the partitioned blocks in the second-scale and third-scale space are not enough to statistically keep GHR features consistent with subjective judgments. Proper response features can further improve the performance of NR metric.
