                  Protein methylation is a kind of post-translational modification (PTM), and typically takes place on lysine and arginine amino acid residues. Protein methylation is involved in many important biological processes, and most recent studies focused on lysine methylation of histones due to its critical roles in regulating transcriptional repression and activation. Histones possess highly conserved sequences and are homologous in most species. However, there is much less sequence conservation among non-histone proteins. Therefore, mechanisms for identifying lysine-methylated sites may greatly differ between histones and non-histone proteins. Nevertheless, this point of view was not considered in previous studies. Here we constructed two support vector machine (SVM) models by using lysine-methylated data from histones and non-histone proteins for predictions of lysine-methylated sites. Numerous features, such as the amino acid composition (AAC) and accessible surface area (ASA), were used in the SVM models, and the predictive performance was evaluated using five-fold cross-validations. For histones, the predictive sensitivity was 85.62% and specificity was 80.32%. For non-histone proteins, the predictive sensitivity was 69.1% and specificity was 88.72%. Results showed that our model significantly improved the predictive accuracy of histones compared to previous approaches. In addition, features of the flanking region of lysine-methylated sites on histones and non-histone proteins were also characterized and are discussed. A gene ontology functional analysis of lysine-methylated proteins and correlations of lysine-methylated sites with other PTMs in histones were also analyzed in detail. Finally, a web server, MethyK, was constructed to identify lysine-methylated sites. MethK now is available at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/MethK/.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are chemical modifications that occur after a protein has been translated from RNA. It is one of the latter steps in the biosynthesis of many proteins. The cellular regulation of PTMs plays a critical role in many biological processes, which influence the structural and functional diversity of proteomes and determine cellular plasticity and dynamics. Protein methylation is one type of reversible PTM (Paik and Kim, 1967), and it has not been as widely studied as other types of PTM, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. Studies over the last few years identified protein methylation as being involved in many important biological processes including transcription, protein–protein interactions, signal transduction, and regulation of gene expressions (Lee et al., 2005; Springer et al., 1979; Stallcup, 2001). Protein methylation reactions can occur either on nitrogen atoms in the N-terminus or on side-chains of lysine (K), arginine (R), histidine (H), proline (P), alanine (A), and glutamine (Q) residues (Clarke, 1993). Among these, lysine and arginine are the most frequently observed amino acids (AAs) methylated. Lysine methylation can be catalyzed by many kinds of transferase enzymes, which are called protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs). Lysine residues can attach one, two, or three methyl groups onto an AA's ɛ-amine group by replacing one, two, or three hydrogen atoms, to respectively yield mono-, di-, or tri-methyllysine (Zhang and Bruice, 2008). Most recent research focused on histones because lysine methylation of histone regulates critical roles in many biological processes. The methylated histones, H3K4 and H3K36, have positive control of gene activity (Pokholok et al., 2005), and H3K27 and H4K20 are associated with repressive modifications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Cao et al., 2002; Schotta et al., 2004). Additionally, several lysine methylation sites on non-histone proteins were discovered to impact protein stability, activity, and functions. For example, p53 was found at K370, K372, and K382 to activate or repress p53 activity (Huang and Berger, 2008). A transcription factor, TAF10, at lysine 189 (K189) is involved in transcriptional regulation of the TAF10 target gene (Kouskouti et al., 2004).

Conventional biological experimental methods for identifying methylation sites on proteins are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, in silico computational methods are widely used to obtain potential methylation sites for further analysis. As shown in Table 1
                     , different approaches were proposed to identify protein methylation sites. Daily et al. (2005) developed an approach for predicting methylated arginine and lysine based on the biological hypothesis that PTMs preferentially occur in intrinsically disordered regions using a support vector machine (SVM). Sequence are encoded by a set of features including AA frequencies, aromatic content, a flexibility scalar, the net charge, hydrophobic moment, beta entropy, disorder information, and PSI-BLAST profiles. Chen et al. (2006) provided a web server, MeMo, to predict protein methylation of lysine and arginine using an SVM with features from AA information. Experimentally verified methylated sites from UniProtKB/SwissProt (vers. 48) and literature surveys were used as the positive dataset. Shien et al. (2009) presented a method named MASA to identify lysine-, arginine-, glutamate-, and asparagine-methylated sites using combined structural characteristics, including AAs, the accessible surface area (ASA), and a positional weighted matrix. Experimentally confirmed methylation sites were taken from MeMo and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (vers. 53), and an SVM was adopted as a learning classifier. Shiu et al. (2009) constructed a prediction server called BPB-PPMS that combines the SVM with feature extraction through Bi-profile Bayes to identify protein methylation sites of arginine and lysine. Experiment data were collected from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (vers. 56.1). Using this method, feature vectors were encoded in a bi-profile manner containing attributes from positive and negative position-specific profiles. These profiles were generated in order to calculate frequencies of occurrence of each AA at each position of the peptide sequence in the positive and negative datasets. Most recently, Shi et al. (2012) studied lysine residues with two major modifications, methylation and acetylation. They presented a method called PLMLA that incorporates protein sequence information, secondary structures, and AA properties to predict methylation and acetylation sites on lysine residues. The training and testing dataset were extracted from PhosphoSitePlus (vers. 2011_09) and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (vers. 2011_09).

Lysine methylation datasets used in previous studies contained two kinds of proteins, histones and non-histone proteins. Histones possess highly conserved sequences, but there is much less sequence conservation among non-histone proteins. Therefore, mechanisms to identify lysine-methylated sites may greatly differ between histones and non-histone proteins. However, this point of view was not considered in previous studies. Herein, we present an approach to identify lysine-methylated sties on histones and non-histone proteins using SVM models with numerous features, such as the AA composition (AAC), ASA, etc. Features of the flanking region of lysine-methylated sites on histones and non-histone protein were also characterized and discussed. In addition, a gene ontology (GO) functional analysis of lysine-methylated proteins and correlations of lysine-methylated sites with other PTMs in histones were also analyzed in detail.

The UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Database (Magrane and Consortium, 2011) is a high-quality manually annotated and reviewed section of the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB). It is a non-redundant protein sequence database with information extracted from the literature and a curator-evaluated computational analysis. Each entry contains the AA sequence, protein name or description, taxonomic data, and citation information. Release 2012_01 of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot contained 534,242 sequence entries, comprising 189,454,791 AAs abstracted from 206,707 references. PhosphoSitePlus (Hornbeck et al., 2012) is an online systems biology resource that provides comprehensive information and tools for studying experimentally observed protein PTMs and is comprised of over 130,000 non-redundant modification sites that are primarily of human and mouse proteins. The Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (Keshava Prasad et al., 2009) is a resource for experimentally derived information about the human proteome including protein–protein interactions, PTMs, enzyme–substrate relationships, and disease associations.

The positive training data were collected from PhosphoSitePlus (release 2012_04), which contains 2756 proteins with 6535 experimentally confirmed methylation sites. We filtered out methylation sites which were not on lysine (K). Since mono-, di-, and tri-methyllysine sites sometimes occur alternately at the same position, we only collected a site once in our dataset. Finally, 44 histones containing 133 lysine-methylated sites and 878 non-histone proteins containing 1306 lysine-methylated sites were collected as respective positive training data for histone and non-histone model training.

Additionally, methylated lysine sites were also collected from the HPRD (release 9) and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (release 2010_11), and identical data in training dataset were filtered out from the independent dataset. In UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, 3023 methylation sites within 1150 proteins were annotated as “methylated lysine” or “methyllysine”. Only experimentally verified data were collected, and therefore, lysine-methylated sites with the annotation of “similarity”, “potential”, or “probable” were removed. The procedure of data collection from the HPRD was the same as that for PhosphoSitePlus. Ultimately, 49 histones containing 153 lysine-methylated sites and 118 non-histone proteins containing 194 lysine-methylated sites were respectively used as the independent data for histone and non-histone model testing.

Non-methylated lysine sites were also collected from the databases mentioned above as the negative dataset. Since the negative training data were much larger than the positive training data, this unbalanced characteristic usually leads to a skewed classification of negative sets. Therefore, we applied the data collection procedure proposed in our previous study, MASA (Shien et al., 2009), to generate representative negative training data with a 5-fold greater amount of positive training data using the k-means clustering method (Hartigan et al., 1979). In addition, a 15-mer window length of the region flanking each lysine was adopted for SVM feature extraction to obtain better predictive performance. Thus, fragment sequences in the positive and negative datasets were specified with a window length of 15 centered on the lysine. Of two identical fragment sequences, only one was kept to generate a non-redundant dataset. Finally, numbers of positive and negative datasets for histone and non-histone model training and testing are shown in Table 2
                     .

@&#METHODS@&#

An SVM was applied to develop the prediction models to identify lysine-methylated sites on both histones and non-histone proteins. Seven features were taken into consideration in the SVM models for a fragment sequence, including AAs, the AA composition (AAC), AA pair composition (AAPC), ASA, position specific scoring matrix (PSSM), AA index, and protein disorder region (PDR). AAs are the most popular coding method and use an orthogonal binary coding scheme to transform each AA into a 20-dimensional binary vector. Herein, we added a vector to represent other specific AA codes (e.g., B, Z, and X). So the number of the feature vector was 21*L, where L is the window length of the fragment sequence. The AAC converts a protein sequence into a 20-dimensional feature vector, and each vector consists of the frequency composition of each of the 20 AAs. The AAPC converts a protein sequence from the frequency of AA pairs. Each AA is coordinated with its adjacent residue, and therefore it can be transformed as a vector with 400 (20×20) dimensions. The ASA is the surface area of a biomolecule that is accessible to a solvent, as a way of quantifying hydrophobic burial. The results of our previous study, MASA (Shien et al., 2009), indicated that ASA values around methylation sites in the protein tertiary structure can improve the accuracy of prediction. According to the above study, we used RVP-Net (Ahmad et al., 2003) to compute the ASA value based on the protein sequence. The computed ASA value is the percentage of the accessible surface area of each residue in the protein sequence.

The PSSM is a matrix of score values generated from PSI-BLAST, which represent multiple sequence alignments of proteins. Scores are positive or negative integers, and large positive scores often indicate critical functional residues, which may be active site residues or residues required for other intermolecular interactions. The AA index (Kawashima et al., 2008) was used to obtain numerical values representing AA properties, which consisted of many kinds of AA physicochemical and biological properties and mutation matrices collected from other research papers. Regions in a protein that cannot form stable secondary structures are regarded as “disordered regions”. PDRs are often dynamic, different, and flexible in solution. A recent study indicated that disordered regions play critical roles in protein biological functions, including cell regulation, cell signaling, and ligand binding. Here we used DISOPRED (Ward et al., 2004) to obtain a probability estimate of each residue in a sequence being disordered.

The SVM is a very useful model for classifying proteins with diverse sequences and has been widely adopted as the predictor. Herein, we applied the LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) to implement the prediction model to discriminate methylated and non-methylated lysine sites. A radio basis function (RBF) was adopted as the kernel function. Gamma determines the RBF kernel function, and costs control the hyperplane softness. The gamma parameter, which determines the RBF kernel function, and the cost parameter, which controls the hyperplane softness, were tuned to yield the best performance.

The performances of SVM models were evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation. The specificity (SP), sensitivity (SN), precision (PRE), accuracy (ACC), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) were utilized to evaluate the classification performance. They were defined as SN=TP/(TP+FN); SP=TN/(TN+FP); PRE=TP/(TP+FP); ACC=(TP+TN)/(TP+FP+TN+FN); and

A sequence logo is a graphical representation of the sequence conservation of proteins. Different residues at the same position are scaled according to their frequency. To investigate the substrate specificity of lysine-methylated sites, WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004) was applied to generate the sequence logo of the positive training dataset, which was respectively composed of 72 and 1187 15-mer flanking sequences of lysine-methylated sites in histones and non-histone proteins. As shown in Fig. 1A, there was no significant sequence conservation in any of the positive training data. However, Fig. 1B shows significant sequence conservation in histones, such as serine (S) at position +1; threonine (T) at −5, −3, −1, and +2; arginine (R) at −1, +3, and +4; lysine (K) at −5, −4, +4, and +5; and glycine (G) at −3, +6, and +7. The analytical results corresponded to recent studies which indicated that methylated lysine residues on histones often occur adjacent to a serine (S) or threonine (T) residue (Yap and Zhou, 2011; Cheung and Lau, 2005). Karl et al. (Agger et al., 2008) suggested that methylated arginine (R) is often localized near lysine-methylated sites and cross-talks with it. Polar AAs, such as arginine (R) at position −1, serine (S) at +1, and threonine (T) at +2, are enriched around lysine-methylated sites. Interestingly, the hydrophobic AA, alanine (A) is present at each position beside position +5. Fig. 1C shows that there was no significant sequence conservation among non-histone proteins. In addition, the Two-Sample Logo (TSL) (Schneider and Stephens, 1990) was used to display different AA compositions around lysine-methylated sites between histones and non-histone proteins. As presented in Fig. 2
                        , hydrophobic AAs, such as alanine (A) and proline (P), and polar AAs, such as serine (S), threonine (T), arginine (R), lysine (K), and glycine (G), were more abundant in histones, while negatively charged AAs, such as aspartate (D) and glutamate (E), were more abundant in non-histone proteins. Results showed that different patterns surrounding lysine-methylated sites existed between histones and non-histone proteins, and this information may be helpful in identifying lysine-methylated sites. Therefore, we constructed different prediction models for histone and non-histone proteins.

Two prediction models, the histone model and non-histone model, were developed using histones and non-histone proteins. Various SVM models were built with different features (AA, AAC, AAPC, PSSM, AA index, and PDR) and their combinations. SVM models were evaluated by 30 runs of 5-fold cross-validation, and the best-performing model was adopted as the final prediction model. Supplementary Table S1 presents the performances of SVM models for histones. In single-feature models, the Kerr constants of AAs (AA index ID: KHAG800101) had the best performance, and achieved an accuracy of 75.9% and MCC of 0.385. The model trained with the AAC and ASA outperformed the other models, and achieved an accuracy of 77.72% and MCC of 0.472 (also shown in Table 3
                        ). For non-histone proteins (Supplementary Table S2), the best single-feature performance was the AAPC, which achieved an accuracy of 75.22% and MCC of 0.3469. The best performance model was trained with features of AAs and AAPC, and achieved an accuracy of 76.41% and MCC of 0.3914 (also shown in Table 3).

In addition to the histone model and non-histone model, a mixed model was also generated using both histones and non-histone proteins. As shown in Supplementary Table S3, the best-performing model was trained with the AAC and PDR, and achieved an accuracy of 73.1% and MCC of 0.36 (also shown in Table 3). The performances of the histone model and non-histone model were higher than the mixed model, which demonstrates that our method is helpful and effective in identifying lysine-methylated sites by classifying proteins into histone and non-histone ones. Performances of the histone, non-histone, and mixed models with the best-performing features are given in Table 3.

The independent datasets generated from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and HPRD were used to evaluate our prediction models. As shown in Table 4
                        , for histones, our approach (MethK) performed with a sensitivity of 85.62% and a specificity of 80.32%, which were slightly better than the 5-fold cross-validation, which had a sensitivity of 78.26% and a specificity of 76.09%. For non-histone proteins, the sensitivity dropped slightly from 70.85% to 69.1%, and the specificity rose from 77.52% to 88.72%. Overall, the performance of independent testing was similar to the 5-fold cross-validation. This indicates that our models also performed well with an independent dataset.

An independent dataset was also employed to evaluate previous approaches. We compared MethK with MASA, BPB-PPMS, and PLMLA, all of which provide web applications for methylation predictions. As shown in Table 4, for histones, the performance of MethK achieved a sensitivity of 85.62% and a specificity of 80.32%, which outperformed the other approaches. This demonstrates that the features, AAC and ASA, used in our histone model significantly improved the predictive ability for histones. For non-histone proteins, MethK achieved a sensitivity of 69.1% and a specificity of 88.72%, which were lower than those of MASA and BPB-PPMS. Notably, some of our independent data were used in the comparison approaches to train their models, and that could have greatly enhanced their predictive performance. For example, MASA only achieved a specificity of 82.7% and an ACC of 80.8% using their independent dataset, but achieved a specificity of 97.95% and an ACC of 95.86% using our independent dataset. Overall, our method provides reliable predictions for both histones and non-histone proteins.

A web server, MethK, was constructed to identify lysine-methylated sites on histones and non-histone proteins. The AAC and ASA features were utilized in the histone model, and AA and AAPC features were employed in the non-histone model. As shown in Fig. 3
                        , the MethK web server provides a user-friendly interface and predictive results. Users can submit a protein sequence in FASTA format and select the protein type to identify potential lysine-methylated sites. The independent testing dataset used in our study is also provided at the website. The web server is available at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/MethK/.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

To examine the identification specificity of the histone and non-histone models, cross-testing employing histone-independent data to test the non-histone model and employing non-histone-independent data to test the histone model was performed. As shown in Table 5
                        , the sensitivity and specificity of cross-testing of the histone model were respectively 0% and 100%. This demonstrates that the features (AAC and ASA) used in histone model were useful in distinguishing between lysine methylation and non-methylation sites on histones, and also helpful in differentiating lysine sites between histones and non-histone proteins. It shows that the histone model can provide high identification specificity for histones. The sensitivity and specificity of cross-testing of the non-histone model were 29.41% and 60.16%, respectively. This shows that the features (AA and AAPC) used in the non-histone model were also present in some histones. Therefore, to increase the identification specificity of the non-histone model, more-effective and -specific features of non-histone proteins should be taken into consideration.

The GO Database (Ashburner et al., 2000) is a database unifying the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species, and provides the ontology of defined terms covering three domains, including cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. We used QuickGO (Dimmer et al., 2012) to investigate and estimate the functions of lysine-methylated proteins. Total numbers of 93 and 896 lysine-methylated histones and non-histone proteins were respectively collected for the GO analysis. Table 6
                         lists the most often present GO annotations on lysine-methylated proteins, and detailed results of histones and non-histone proteins are respectively listed in Supplementary Table S4 and Table S5. For molecular functions, both lysine-methylated histones and non-histone proteins were involved in binding mechanisms. All lysine-methylated histones were involved in DNA binding. Protein binding, metal ion binding, nucleotide binding, and ATP binding were enriched in lysine-methylated non-histone proteins. For cellular components, lysine-methylated histones were significantly enriched in chromosomes, nuclei, and nucleosomes. Lysine-methylated non-histone proteins were enriched in the cytoplasm, nuclei, and membranes. For biological processes, nucleosome assembly was the major component in histones, and that corresponded to the known mechanism of histones, i.e., assembling to form octameric nucleosome core particles in the chromatin. Most of the lysine-methylated non-histone proteins were involved in transcriptional DNA-dependent transport and signal transduction. This implies that these proteins may be involved in regulatory mechanisms through altering the methylation status of lysine residues.

Recent studies indicated that lysine methylation of histones is implicated in transcription and DNA repair, and it may provide positive or negative influences over such modifications, especially of phosphorylation and acetylation (Kouzarides, 2007). To investigate these correlations, we annotated the experimental phosphorylation sites and acetylation sites on the histones used in our dataset. Finally, 140 phosphorylation sites and 294 acetylation sites were extracted from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot release 2012_01, and their nearest distances to lysine-methylated sites were calculated and are respectively depicted in Figs. 4A and 5A
                        
                        .

As shown in Fig. 4A, phosphorylation sites with a distance of 1 were most abundant. Interestingly, we found that these modification sites belonged to H3 and H4 proteins. In previous studies, phosphorylation of H3/S11 and H1.4/S27 was observed to affect the binding to methylated H3/K10 and H1.4/K26 (Daujat et al., 2005; Fischle et al., 2005), and other phosphorylation sites on H3, T4, and S29 were suggested to regulate methylation sites of K5 and K28 (Fischle et al., 2003). Furthermore, we constructed a sequence logo to investigate the sequence conservation of these proteins. As shown in Fig. 4B, high sequence conservation existed among these proteins, which abundantly had a serine at position +1, arginine at −1 and −7, threonine at +2, and alanine at −3.

Specific lysine residues in histone tails are selectively either methylated or acetylated (Rice and Allis, 2001), and may have antagonistic or cooperative biological effects. As shown in Fig. 5A, acetylation sites with a distance of 0 were most abundant, which means that lysine residues can be alternatively methylated or acetylated. Fig. 5B shows that high sequence conservation also exists among these proteins, which abundantly had a serine at position +1; alanine at +2, −2, and −3; threonine at +2 and −1; and arginine at +4 and −1. The switching mechanism between methylation and acetylation on lysine residues is still unknown and remains to be deciphered in the future.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This is the first study which classifies proteins into histone and non-histone ones to identify potential lysine modification sites. We not only demonstrated that the histone and non-histone models had better predictive performances than the mixed model, but also showed that our models significantly improved the prediction accuracy of histones compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, a web server, MethK, was developed using the SVM models with AAC and ASA features for the histone model, and AA and AAPC features for the non-histone model.

We analyzed AACs of flanking regions of lysine methylation sites, and found that high sequence conservation existed among histones and they were significantly enriched with polar AAs around lysine-methylated sites, which greatly differed from non-histone proteins. A Two-Sample Logo was constructed to display compositional biases between histones and non-histone proteins. Cross-testing results showed the histone model had high identification specificity. The GO analysis results showed that lysine-methylated histones and non-histone proteins were enriched in different GO terms, and lysine-methylated non-histone proteins might be involved in regulatory mechanisms through altering the methylation status of lysine residues.

Finally, we analyzed correlations of lysine-methylated sites with phosphorylation sites and acetylation sites in histones. The investigation showed that a major proportion of lysine-methylated sites had phosphorylation at a distance of 1, and a major proportion of lysine residues could be alternatively methylated or acetylated. In addition, the sequence logo demonstrated that high sequence conservation existed in these regions. In this study, we provide reliable predictions of both histones and non-histone proteins, and also characterized the various features of these sites and proteins. Therefore, we believe that our method will be helpful in identifying lysine methylation, and could be extended to identify lysine-methylated sites on other residues, such as arginine and glutamate, in the future.
