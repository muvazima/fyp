                  Collaboration between mobile nodes is significant in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). The great challenges of MANETs are their vulnerabilities to various security attacks. Because of the lack of centralized administration, secure routing is challenging in MANETs. Effective secure routing is quite essential to protect nodes from anonymous behaviours. Game theory is currently employed as a tool to analyse, formulate and solve selfishness issues in MANETs. This work uses a Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game to analyse strategy profiles for regular and malicious nodes. We calculate the Payoff to nodes for motivating the particular nodes involved in misbehaviour. Regular nodes monitor continuously to evaluate their neighbours by using the belief evaluation and belief updating system of the Bayes rule. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme could significantly minimize the misbehaving activities of malicious nodes and thereby enhance secure routing.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The characteristics of MANETs pose great challenges with respect to security design because of their dynamic network topologies, lack of centralized control and self organizing character. Collaboration between MANET nodes is the most problematic issue for forwarding packets among nodes. Each node can forward data packets for other nodes. This makes it difficult to design secure routing. Secure routing plays a vital role in forwarding packets in critical applications. Node mobility creates more opportunities for various security attacks in any network; because of node mobility, cooperation between nodes is more challenging in MANETs. Therefore it is essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the nodes from anonymous behaviours. In general, malicious nodes do not want to forward a neighbour’s packets in networks that degrade the network performance. Existing schemes are not suitable for enhancing MANET security because of routing overhead and vulnerabilities. To minimize the activities of malicious nodes, they should be monitored continuously and not allowed to participate in routing. Game theory approaches ([1]) provide effective solutions to security problems in MANETs; they prevent conflict in cooperation among the mobile nodes. They apply to a variety of disciplines including computer networks, economics, behavioural biology and political science as well. A Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game allows a player with a number of possible actions to have a clear strategy for making an effective decision. In each message set, the sender with a strategy must have a belief as to which node should receive it to ensure secure MANET routing.

Various methods have been described for preventing nodes from attacks. Daojing et al. [2] proposed a Secure and Distributed Reprogramming Protocol (SDRP). It used an identity based cryptography mechanism to enhance security for reprogramming in wireless sensor networks. It did not provide confidentiality against message interception. Feng Li et al. [3] proposed a Game Theoretic Based Analysis (GTBA) of cooperation between regular (normal) and malicious nodes in MANETs. In this approach, selfish nodes are motivated by building a reputation system. GTBA does not take multiple attacks into consideration. Ze Li and Haiying Shen [4] used game theoretic approaches to analyse cooperation incentives for nodes provided by reputation systems and price-based systems. They addressed the issues of enforcing cooperation among selfish nodes and discriminating malicious nodes from regular nodes. This scheme does not sufficiently address security problems such as compromised cooperative nodes.

We propose a protocol, enhancing secure routing for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, that uses a Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game model (SRPDBG); its goal is to analyse the strategy profile for regular and malicious nodes. Differently from the above methods, this work reveals the best actions of individual strategy for each node. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
                        
                           •
                           First, we formulate a two player Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game for the sender and receiver.

To find the best outcome of the strategic interaction between sender and receiver, three Nash Equilibrium strategies are analysed: Pure Strategy with Nash Equilibrium, Mixed Strategy with Nash Equilibrium and PBE with Bayesian Nash Equilibrium.

We then calculate the payoff for nodes for motivating the particular nodes that are misbehaving.

A belief update of each node is determined based on the Bayes rule in terms of action chosen, message sent and strategy chosen based on the probability of the node’s type.

We design an algorithm for finding belief-strategy pairs for the PBE strategy and the best response strategy for players.

Through extensive simulation results, we evaluate the performance of the proposed SRPDBG. The results show that the SRPDBG outperforms other strategies in analysing the malicious node’s behaviour and also in evaluating the strategies of regular and malicious nodes.

The remainder of the paper contains eight sections. Section 2 summarizes related work and highlights the differences between it and our work. Section 3 describes our Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game in MANETs in terms of payoff formulation and analysis of three Nash Equilibrium Strategies: the Pure Strategy with Nash Equilibrium, the Mixed Strategy with Nash Equilibrium and the PBE with Bayesian Nash Equilibrium and payoff calculation. Section 4 presents the Belief update mechanism based on the Bayes rule. Section 5 describes our algorithm for finding the Belief strategy pairs for the PBE strategy and finds the best response strategy for players. Section 6 presents our simulation results and a relevant performance analysis. Finally, Sections 7 and 8 presents our conclusions and discusses future direction.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

Security in MANETs is a challenge for several applications. Game theory plays significant role in providing security in MANETs. Roy et al. [5] surveyed the impact of the game theoretic approaches and their applications to network security. They presented a taxonomy of game theoretic solutions to various security problems. Manshaei et al. [6] addressed the various research approaches in applying game theoretic methods to MANET network security. Several such approaches have been developed, such as providing a Certainty Oriented Reputation System [7], preventing Selfish and Tariff Free nodes [8], analysing the cooperation incentives for individual nodes [9], detecting misbehaving nodes [10], investigating the interactions between nodes and providing incentives for good behaviour [11] and using a reputation system to enforce node cooperation. Buchegger et al. [12] presented reputation systems to reveal the truth about other nodes based on reputation ratings and trust ratings.

Mohammed et al. [13] proposed a mechanism design theory to provide incentives for encouraging nodes to participate honestly in a cluster process. The incentives are based on the Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves technique that ensures that truth-telling is the dominant strategy for any node in the clusters. It causes routing overhead as the cluster size increases. Nabil El-Kadhi and Hazem El-Gendy [14] proposed a bidirectional authentication scheme in which authentication is considered to be a non-cooperative non-zero sum bi-matrix game for Bluetooth devices. This mechanism alerts trusted Bluetooth devices of possible threats and malicious devices. This scheme is suitable only for short-range communication devices and not scalable to long-range devices. Nguyen et al. [15] introduced a secure many-to-many routing protocol for wireless sensor and actuator networks for providing both security and power efficiency. Security is achieved by using authenticated broadcast for task registration and secure multicast for data transmission. Power efficiency drives from multicast nature of the communication. Lin et al. [16] proposed a Role-Based Privacy Aware secure routing protocol to ensure privacy of information in Wireless Mesh Networks. It combines a dynamic reputation scheme with role based multilevel security and a hierarchical key-management protocol to protect the nodes against internal attacks. The dynamic reputation scheme can not always encourage nodes to be cooperative. Dingde et al. [17] described a scheme for detecting traffic anomalies including network faults, abuse and network attacks. They took network topology information into consideration and transformed domain analysis for finding abnormal components. Zhu et al. [18] described a collaborative Intrusion Detection System to analyse an incentive based resource allocation problem. It needs enough credits to detect malicious nodes, otherwise it drops the packets. Markus [19] studied an infinitely repeated discounted game in which a player perfectly observes any other player’s action choice with a fixed and finite delay. This game has no pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. Marcin [20] introduced a procedural value for cooperative games to determine the sharing marginal contributions to coalitions that formed by players joining in random order. It allows false data injection into networks by compromised insiders eavesdropping data transmission. Rafsanjani et al. [21] presented reputation schemes to perform fast misbehaviour detection. This scheme does not perform well at finding a selfish node in high traffic.

Jiang and Tay [22] proposed a Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) that divides the nodes into a number of disjoint clusters in networks. A cluster head is elected for each cluster to maintain the cluster membership information. Inter-cluster routes are dynamically discovered using cluster membership information. CBRP is suitable for a small network. Kumar et al. [23] analysed the performance of the Ad-Hoc on-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and CBRP. AODV discovers a route through network wide broadcasting to provide reliable data transmission. The source host starts a route discovery by broadcasting a route request to its neighbours until it reaches the destination. In the route-request phase, there is a requested destination sequence number that is essential for the routing loop-problem. AODV causes high packet overhead to form a routing path because of the larger flooding range and it needs more time to recover false paths and to discover the new paths. CBRP and AODV are not considered secure in preventing nodes from attacks.

Our work is similar to that of Daojing et al. [2] and Feng Li et al. [3]. We will compare our work with theirs in the following section. Compared to related work [4,3,13,20,19,6,18,7,22,23], our work is distinguished by the type of game. We have formulated two players, sender and receiver, for a Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game. The goal of this scheme is to enhance secure routing by analysing the strategies of nodes. It evaluates the PBE strategy for the sender and receiver to reduce the utility of a malicious node and increase that of a regular node. In addition, because our approach is different from those of related work, we think that it is essential to calculate the Payoff and the belief update to motivate particular nodes: those that are misbehaving. As a result, we derive different analyses of node strategies to seek the best outcome of the game. As a new contribution, this is the first work to employ a Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game model for finding malicious behaviours in MANETs.

The proposed SRPDBG assumes that a few nodes are not cooperating with the others and degrade the routing performance. Anonymous behaviour of nodes results in a packet-dropping attack. In this work, malicious behaviour of a node is determined by applying a Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game to reveal the best actions for an individual strategy. The game is also used to achieve secure and reliable communication that results in effective cooperation among nodes.

In this approach, two players, a sender (S) and a receiver (R), participate in the Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game; each player is of a type, regular or malicious. The sender chooses to send a message from a set of possible messages

                      based on its own type. The receiver observes the message from the sender without knowing the type of the sender. The receiver then chooses a feasible action from a set of actions in the space

                      means that a node forwards packets to a neighbour. Two players receive a payoff dependent on the type of sender.

PBE is a strategy in a Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game that assumes a scenario such as the following: the sender of type

                      represents the probabilities of the node’s type

                      that may take any of the messages from M. The receiver takes an action from the action space, either C or D, based on observing the message and the probability distributions.

In addition, the node’s strategy is determined by using the payoff calculation and belief update mechanism. A Node’s strategy may be pure or mixed or PBE. A Pure strategy is one in which a node’s type should not be changed in any situation; a mixed strategy is one in which a node’s type may be changed. The Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium provides a strategy profile and beliefs for each player as to the types of the other players. It maximizes the expected payoff for each player given their beliefs about other player’s types.

The PBE strategy payoff and belief update are used to determine a node’s type. A Pure strategy is used to choose an action based on maximum payoff, while a mixed strategy is used to update beliefs about other nodes. In this work, some relay nodes and sender nodes are determined to be malicious; this is reported by disseminating information to neighbour nodes. The following algorithm chooses the optimal action for players.

                         is determined to be regular and it always behaves normally. This approach is the mixed strategy for the neighbour. A node may perform two actions to a stranger: { Doubt, Trust }. When in doubt, it may ask for its neighbour’s help to determine the trustworthiness of the stranger, or it may request the stranger to identify itself.

Payoffs define the outcome of the players. A payoff measures the player’s outcome, called its utility. The generalized procedure for payoff formulation is as follows.

                              If the stranger is a regular node, the target will get an amount of payoff if its trusts, where 
                                    
                                       a
                                       >
                                       1
                                    
                                 .

If the stranger is malicious and attacks the target successfully, it will cause an amount of harm to the target.

If the target node doubts the stranger, it will cost 1.

If the doubt is deserved, the target node will receive amount b in a feedback message, where 
                                    
                                       0
                                       <
                                       b
                                       <
                                       1
                                    
                                 .

If the trust is not valued, the target will lose amount b of payoff.

If the stranger is a malicious node but pretends to be normal node.
                                    
                                       –
                                       It will cost the target more to doubt than to trust, but the doubt will induce the stranger to get a payoff of 
                                             
                                                -
                                                1
                                             
                                           in the current run.

The target may threaten the stranger by doubting more frequently in a long run game.

Regard the stranger as sender and the target as receiver.

Payoffs evaluate a player’s strategy. In the Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game, to decline is a strategy that dominates cooperation. Strategy D of a stranger dominates C because if the target node chooses trust, then the stranger’s payoff is 3 for choosing D and 2 for choosing C. If the target node chooses doubt, then the stranger receives 1 for D and 0 for C. Hence, choosing D gives the best outcome. Similarly, the target node should choose the doubt strategy that dominates trust.

Nash Equilibrium is a solution concept in game theory to analyse the outcome of the strategic interaction of a sender and receiver. Each player chooses their part of the Nash Equilibrium strategy, and then no player has a reason for deviating to another strategy. In the pure strategy, the players choose unique actions from a set of available actions. If the strategy is 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       Attack
                                       ,
                                       Doubt
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                         and the sender is malicious node, the best response of the receiver is to doubt. However, if the receiver doubts, the best response of the sender is to behave normally. If the strategy is 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       Normal
                                       ,
                                       Trust
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        , the sender behaves normally; then the best response of the receiver is to trust. However, if the receiver trusts, the best response of the sender is to attack.

In the mixed strategy, the player chooses an action randomly from among several actions. Its choice follows a probability distribution over the set of actions from action space.
                           Definition 1
                           A mixed strategy of player i is a probability distribution over its set of available actions. If player i has m actions available, a mixed strategy is an m dimensional vector

PBE is applied to refine the equilibrium generated by the perfect Bayesian Nash sub-game. It demands that subsequent play be optimal. However, it puts a player’s belief on the decision nodes that enable moves in non-singleton information sets that play more satisfactorily.

                        That is, if s is decreased, the payoff of the receiver will decrease. From the above solution, a threshold value is obtained that can be applied to design a secure routing protocol in MANETs. If a node’s decision about another node exceeds a threshold, it will exchange decisions with its neighbours to get a more trustworthy value.

In a Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game, payoffs motivate the players who misbehave to seek the best outcome. They may be cardinal payoffs or ordinal payoffs. A payoff matrix is used for calculating payoff. The decision maker observes the best alternative that predicts unique outcomes. Two players participate in the game: a Sender and a Receiver. The Sender chooses an action from action space for sending a message to the receiver. The receiver observes this message and responds to it by choosing an action from its action space. The receiver has no private information if it is a single type. The receiver has some prior belief about the sender’s type. After the receiver takes an action, each player is allocated payoffs that depend on the message from the sender. The receiver takes an action and chooses a node type for responding to the sender. The expected payoff incorporates the player’s attitude towards risk. Each player receives a payoff that depends on its own action and its neighbour’s actions. The payoffs of regular and malicious nodes are listed in Table 1
                        .

Here, PS – Prefer to send and SM – Signalling Malicious. The expected payoff is calculated as the product of the probability of each type and the payoff of each action chosen. If the expected payoff is a maximum, the corresponding actions are chosen as the sender and receiver actions. The sender’s expected utility is a combination of its payoffs and the actions chosen by the receiver. The sender chooses an action, either cooperate or decline, based on the receiver’s type. Because the receiver is assumed to be regular, the possible actions are co-operating, decline and report. Decline that means a node simply rejects participation, while cooperate means that a node makes itself available for communication. The sender can conduct a simple packet-dropping attack, which is in the same form as the decline strategy of regular nodes. Sender nodes get a payoff from the attack, while regular nodes receive no gain from a decline. If a receiver chooses Report, it receives a gain SM if the sender is a malicious node. Regular nodes gain PS from a successful cooperate, where 
                           
                              SM
                              ,
                              PS
                           
                         are gains for report and cooperate, respectively. Nodes could also choose Decline, which incurs zero gain and no cost even if the opponent chooses Attack. There are two Nash equilibria for PBE:

                        , the sender does not intend to offer to forward the message and choose to decline. Conversely, the receiver rejects the sender’s message and reports to neighbouring nodes whether the sender’s information is regular or malicious. The receiver chooses the decline action based on the PBE strategy profile. In

                        , the sender intends to offer to forward the message to the receiver. The receiver responds to the sender’s offered message with either the cooperate or decline action. However, the receiver’s best response is to accept a message irrespective of the node type offering it. This information is not captured in the action profile 
                           
                              (

                         because the receiver’s information set is never reached along this path.

In MANETs, nodes connect and communicate directly. Malicious nodes may damage and raise the overhead in the network when they communicate with another node. To avoid this problem, a node needs to update its belief. Bayes rule is consistent for a given strategy profile if and only if the probability is assigned by the system to every node. It is computed as the probability of the node being reached, given the strategy profile, and determines the node type. We used the Bayes rule for updating the node’s belief in terms of the action chosen, message sent, and strategy chosen based on the probability of the node’s type, as given by Eq.

                      is the probability of the node’s type, σ denotes the action chosen, m is the message of a sender to be sent. This allows each node to have substantiation to verify future recommendations. A node’s general behaviour can also be deducted from its past actions. This reduces uncertainty. Fig. 1
                      shows the general decision process of regular and malicious nodes. Trust opinion is calculated using the Bayes rule. A packet can be forwarded through a link only when the nodes on both sides of the link choose to cooperate. The regular node obtains feedback from its neighbour’s monitoring and evaluates the belief and sufficiency of evidence toward the opponent based on belief. It follows a threshold policy T to decide whether to report. T should be calculated as a condition that makes

                     . If the threshold is reached, the regular node reports the node as malicious to all neighbour nodes. If not, the regular node chooses C with a probability p that is calculated based on its belief. Expected payoffs from each PBE strategy for the sender and receiver are given by Eqs. (14) and (15).

                     Fig. 1 describes the belief update process that determines whether a node is malicious or regular. It reports the node’s type to its neighbour, then chooses the appropriate action, either cooperate or decline.

The following algorithm describes finding belief strategy pairs for the PBE strategy and finds the best response strategies for players.

We assume that two players are involved in a Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game; a sender (S) and a receiver (R). Each player is a particular type

                        , based on its own type. The payoffs of the sender and receiver are evaluated based on the messages, types and actions. Then, the strategy profiles of the sender and receiver are determined using the belief update mechanism. The belief updates of the sender and receiver arise from the Bayes rule. The result yields the PBE strategy profile. The PBE strategy provides a feasible solution such as the types of sender and receiver, actions of sender and receiver and belief value. Furthermore, the belief value is used as threshold to perform secure routing.

Best outcomes of the players are found based on their beliefs, whether ordinal beliefs or cardinal beliefs. This strategy provides the best response for a player when compared to strategies of other players. A sender’s best response strategy is estimated by Eq.

                      is the payoff for an action chosen with a type and message; a is the action chosen and θ is the node’s type with a message . A receiver’s pure strategy will be the best response to the sender’s behaviour strategy if and only if it maximizes the receiver’s expected utility over all possible pure receiver strategies.

The proposed scheme has been implemented in network simulator (NS2). The main objective of the simulation was to enhance security in the presence of compromised nodes. 100 nodes were randomly deployed in a 500m×500m area of interest. The transmission range was 20m. Nodes followed the Random Way point Model [24] that finds the availability of connection paths in an Ad-Hoc network. The Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game model analysed the effectiveness of the malicious node’s behaviours. The proposed scheme also evaluated the regular and malicious node’s strategies such as the pure, mixed and PBE strategies. The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated by comparing it with the related SDRP and GTBA schemes in terms of propagation delay and also to AODV and CBRP in terms of the packet delivery ratio, Routing overhead and Routing Latency. The simulation results were studied by varying the network size from 50 to 100. The experiment was tested with 0–50 malicious nodes that may each prevent the packet forwarding. SDRP and GTBA schemes are aimed to enhance security by using cryptography mechanism and reputation system, respectively. We have integrated the PBE strategy together with a belief updating system to update a node’s belief for reducing a malicious nodes utility and increase a regular nodes utility. With the objective of comparing routing performance with related approaches, we have modelled a Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game in terms of functionality for secure routing.

While in our previous work [25] only attacker identification and classification was able to be achieved, utilizing the Byzantine agreement based cooperative technique, currently we are providing a Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game model for regular and malicious nodes to reduce the misbehaving activities. Both schemes aimed to enhance secure routing and motivate effective cooperation among nodes in MANETs.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the propagation delays of SRPDBG, GTBA and SDRP measured from the simulation. The propagation delay is the time required to run the code in all of the nodes in the network. As the algorithm code size increases, the propagation delays of all schemes increase. Fig. 3 shows that the identification of malicious nodes by SRPDBG has less propagation delay than related schemes; this is because analysis of malicious behaviour takes place between two nodes such as a sender and receiver. Malicious behaviour is then reported to neighbour nodes.

The utility is the actual average payoff to players as calculated by the expected payoff in the payoff matrix. The expected payoff incorporates a player’s attitude towards risk. The expected payoffs of a sender and receiver are evaluated as the products of the probability of a type from Eqs. (14) and (15) and the payoff of each action chosen. In any situation, at least one player is able to maximize the expected payoff through anticipating the responses to its actions. This work considered three strategies: pure, mixed and PBE. Strategies were chosen by the nodes; they provide all of the actions of the players. A pure strategy determines the action of the player in every possible situation in a game. In mixed strategies, such actions arise from a probability distribution of possible actions. A PBE is a strategy profile together with a belief system in which the strategies of every information set are optimal for its given beliefs. The utilities of nodes are determined using the strategies chosen. Comparisons of node’s utilities for each strategy are shown in Figs. 4 and 5

                        Fig. 4 shows that a regular node’s utility is high when it follows the PBE strategy. This is because regular nodes receive all of the opportunities to cooperate with other regular nodes and a small number of malicious nodes. However, it ensures no stimulation of the malicious nodes to attack. As shown in Fig. 5, the utility of malicious nodes is high. When regular nodes can choose the mixed strategy or pure strategy, it reduces a malicious node’s payoff and drops their utility dramatically. The curve in Fig. 5 shows that the utilities for malicious nodes are higher than those of regular nodes, even though the regular nodes follow the PBE strategy to reduce the malicious node utilities and so improve network throughput. The PBE strategy performs better than others when malicious nodes exploit a pure strategy or mixed strategy. Fig. 4 shows the variation of a regular node’s belief. It is more deceptive when the malicious node exploits the mixed and pure strategy. The average utility of the malicious node is lowest because it cannot choose a route to forward packets for others. In the PBE strategy, the regular node has a chance to report the malicious type to others. Finally, the performance analysis concludes that the PBE strategy is the best strategy for regular nodes to reduce malicious nodes utilities.

In this simulation, we evaluated the impact of malicious nodes by varying the malicious nodes in the network while measuring the PDR. Each node was assigned a trust value randomly chosen from [0, 1]. 10 nodes were randomly selected as source nodes to send packets to randomly chosen neighbours. If the neighbour’s trust value was lower than the threshold, it dropped the packet; otherwise it forwarded the packets. The simulation time for each test was 1000s. The nodes were punished only when their trust values fell below the threshold value. They cooperated in packet forwarding when the node’s trust values fell between 0.3 and 0.7, avoiding the node being punished. The other two approaches have no effective mechanism to encourage the nodes to be cooperative. The fraction of misbehaving nodes are varied from 0% to 50%. Fig. 6
                         illustrates that SRPDBG continuously maintained a higher PDR of approximately 95% when 40% of nodes misbehaved. CBRP and AODV have a smaller PDR because they have no secure routing mechanism to detect misbehaving nodes. When the number of malicious node increases, it becomes harder to find malice-free routes from the source to destination. SRPDBG detected misbehaving nodes and performed secure packet forwarding even though the network topology was continuously changing.

In this simulation, the routing overhead was evaluated for SRPDBG, AODV and CBRP while varying the malicious nodes with different stages. Fig. 7
                         shows that the routing overhead caused by SRPDBG is less than that of the other two protocols. CBRP is also reduced network traffic because of its cluster based architecture and limited exchange of routing control message among the nodes for the route discovery phase. On the other hand, when the RREQ of AODV originated from the source, it flooded throughout the network until the destination was reached. It caused the routing overhead. In addition, when the number of malicious node increased, the overhead also increased because the malicious nodes did not forward the packets for others. They simply dropped the packets. SRPDBG had a minimum routing overhead of approximately 68% when 50% of the nodes were malicious because it did not allow the malicious nodes to be involved in the routing phase. Fig. 7 shows that a malicious node drops more packets and forwards fewer packets while keeping its trust value below threshold value.


                        Fig. 8
                         shows the routing latency for three protocols when the number of nodes varied. Routing latency is defined as the time taken to deliver packets to a destination to determine an efficient route. It was determined that the performance of the proposed scheme is more efficient than the related CBRP and AODV schemes. It was observed that the routing latency of the proposed SRPDBG is 9ms with 10% malicious nodes in the network and 12ms and 13ms for CBRP, AODV, respectively. When simulating a network with 40% malicious nodes, the time taken by the proposed SRPDBG was 27ms. The related CBRP and AODV schemes took more time to forward packets to their destination. The delays in both schemes are because of link failures and more exchanges of control messages to form clusters routing path. SRPDBG uses the PBE strategy in the Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game model to find whether a node is either normal or an attacker. Only then does it allow nodes to send packets to their neighbours with minimal overhead. In this model, malicious nodes are not allowed to forward packets for others to prevent packet-dropping attacks. Therefore, it provides secure routing and enhances the performance of MANETs. Similarities in the packet delivery ratio and routing latency may be found in our previous work [25] and proposed solution because of enhanced the security in MANETs.


                        Table 2
                         compares five performance metrics with approximately 40% of nodes malicious.

In this analysis, SRPDBG has a better packet delivery ratio (90%) and routing latency (94%) than the other two protocols. SRPDBG causes minimal routing overhead compared to CBRP and AODV because it prevents routing in the presence of malicious nodes.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have used a Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game model to reveal the best actions of individual strategy to minimize the utilities of malicious nodes in MANETs. If a node is malicious, it cooperates less and may degrade MANET performance. A novel scheme of payoff formulation is developed for senders and receivers. Payoffs are used to motivate the misbehaving players. Each player is allocated payoffs that depend on its actions and its neighbours actions. A receiver takes an action and a node type for responding to the sender. We used a belief-updating system to update a node’s belief in terms of action chosen, message sent, and strategy chosen. A regular node in the network periodically follows the belief-update process for its private information; it then chooses a probability to cooperate with its neighbouring node. A packet can be forwarded through a path when the nodes choose to cooperate action, preventing a packet-dropping attack. This is a novel way to enhance secure routing and motivate effective cooperation among nodes. A regular node obtains feedback from neighbour monitoring and evaluates its belief. It follows a PBE decision rule to reports its node type to neighbours. This game model also analysed the equilibrium strategy profiles for senders and receivers based on its payoffs and belief updates. It emphasizes reducing a malicious node’s utility and increase a regular node’s utility when it follows the PBE strategy. Simulation results show that the PBE strategies for senders and receivers are better than pure or mixed strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses the Dynamic Bayesian Signalling Game model for enhancing secure routing in MANETs.

Future work may focus on preventing various attacks in networks. This model will extend several aspects such as a long-running game, that will be helpful to design a secure routing protocol.
