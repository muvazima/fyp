                  This paper studies a manufacturer marketing a product through a dual-channel supply chain, comprised of an online channel and a brick-and-mortar retail channel. In particular, we consider the pricing and channel priority strategies of dual-channel supply chain in the presence of supply shortage caused by random yields. To this end, we develop game theoretic models to investigate the price decisions and the channel priority strategy, as well as examine the impacts of channel coordination and the time sequence of decisions, i.e., ex-ante and ex-post production yield, on the channel priority strategy. While encountered with a potential supply shortage, the manufacturer has two channel-allocation priority strategies: direct channel priority and retail channel priority. Our study shows that: (i) coordination of the dual-channel supply chain can alleviate the retailer's complaint of insufficient supply; (ii) counter-intuitively, the retail channel priority is adopted only when the total surplus in the retail channel is low in the decentralized setting; and (iii) the effect of the unit cost of sales of the direct channel on the motivation to use retail channel priority depends on the effect of channel priority on the demand. In addition, we find that the main results of pricing and channel priority strategies remain robust to the time sequence of channel priority decision (yield ex-ante or ex-post).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

E-commerce, such as an online channel (referred to as a direct channel), provides a plausible platform to attract potential consumers and thus opens another door to increase manufacturer's revenue. Therefore, more and more manufacturers such as Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Nike, and Sony are marketing their products not only through a brick-and-mortar retailer (referred to as a retail channel), but also through a direct channel, i.e., leveraging dual channels composed of a direct online channel and an indirect retail channel (Cai, 2010; Pinkerton, 2006; Teimoury, Mirzahosseinian, & Kaboli, 2008). When a manufacturer produces its products, its yield may be random due to such controllable or uncontrollable reasons as defective units, machine breakdowns, damage or shrinkage occurred during transshipment, and random components allocation from suppliers (Tang & Yin, 2007; Yano & Lee, 1995). In the presence of yield uncertainty, the manufacturer may be inevitably exposed to the risk of supply shortage. Unfortunately, many companies do not have an established, formal and cross-functional process to manage the allocation of insufficient inventory to mitigate the impact on customers and shareholders, cf. Uskert, Davis, and Lord (2011). How to manage this uncertainty is an imperative and timely issue for the manufacturer to maintain its competitive advantage and secure its profit.

With a potential supply shortage, a manufacturer with dual channels is typically faced with assigning priority issue given two channel strategies: satisfy the direct channel first, or satisfy the retail channel first. Throughout the paper, we adopt the term direct channel priority (denoted as DCP) to signify that the manufacturer's chosen priority is to satisfy the direct channel demand first, while the term retail channel priority (denoted as RCP) refers to the opposite. Both cases have been widely observed in practice. For example, the brick-and-mortar retailers of Apple, Sony, and Panasonic often complain that the manufacturers reserve their hot-selling products for the direct channel, while the retailers must wait for product allocations under supply shortage (Pinkerton, 2006). Right after Apple introduced the iPhone 5s in late 2013, because of limited supply, consumers could only buy online because there was no guarantee any retail store would have the device available in stock (Lee, 2013). For an example of RCP, when the Air Jordan 2011 shoe was first introduced, it was only available at third-party retail stores for several months before Nike officially put the quality-performance footwear on its own website (Business Wire, 2011). As another example of RCP application, the demand for the highly popular Sony PS4 (debuted in November 2013) had far exceeded its supply. In late March 2014, consumers could only buy the game console at some Best Buy stores, while Sony's online store showed no units available (Johnson, 2014).

Given the observations that both DCP and RCP are commonly applied in a variety of marketplaces, one natural question for the manufacturer is which strategy is preferable over the other. Intuitively, under the RCP policy, retail channel snatches consumers away from the direct channel, which consequently decreases the manufacturer's profit from the direct channel. However, the leverage of the DCP policy leads the retail channel to lose consumers. In each case, the channel priority intensifies the conflict between the manufacturer and the retailer. Moreover, channel priority influences the manufacturer's profit from the retail channel because it affects the retail price as well as the unit wholesale price. Thus, the manufacturer needs to make a trade-off between the two channel priority strategies.

The decentralization of channel structure is commonly understood as a reason to decrease supply chain efficiency due to its inherent double marginalization effect (Spengler, 1950). To mitigate the negative effect of decentralization, some effective contracts have been designed and implemented to coordinate the pricing behavior of retailers (Chen, Zhang, & Sun, 2012; Jeuland & Shugan, 1983). The coordination of the retail channel alleviates the conflict between the dual-channel manufacturer and the retailer, and affects both the demand and the manufacturer's profit in both channels (especially under supply shortage), which in turn influences the manufacturer's channel priority strategy. However, the extant literature does not investigate how to coordinate supply chain to deal with potential supply shortage. It is one of our goals to explore how decentralization (coordination) of the retail channel affects the manufacturer's channel priority strategy.

To address these aforementioned questions, we develop game theoretic models of a one-manufacturer and one-retailer supply chain in the presence of random yields, through which we investigate the optimal price decisions and channel priority strategy, and explore the effects of decentralization of the supply chain on the channel priority strategy. In terms of the decision timeline of the channel priority strategy, we consider two types of models: the yield ex-ante model in which the channel priority decision is decided before the yield uncertainty is resolved; and the yield ex-post model in which it is determined after the yield is realized. In each model, we systematically study the system under two different settings: the centralized (coordinated) setting and the decentralized setting. For each setting, we investigate the channel priority strategy by comparing the performances of RCP and DCP in terms of their expected profits. We find that channel coordination can alleviate the retailers’ complaints about supply shortage, and also that the manufacturer has an incentive to select RCP rather than DCP in the centralized setting. However, in contrast to the centralized setting, the decentralized manufacturer uses RCP only when the total surplus for the retail channel is not too high. In addition, under DCP, the manufacturer may offer a direct channel price higher than the consumer's reservation price such that only the retail channel is active; however, such phenomenon does not happen under RCP.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

This paper is related to the literature of dual-channel supply chain and supply/yield uncertainty. In the literature on dual channels, some typical studies concerning the manufacturer's channel structure strategy include but are not limited to Chiang, Chhajed, and Hess (2003), Liu and Zhang (2006), Yoo and Lee (2011), and Xiao, Choi, and Cheng (2014), all of which consider deterministic models; except for Chen, Kaya, and Özer (2008) that adopts stochastic models. The other major focus is to study the optimal decisions pertaining to the dual-channel supply chain. For example, Cattani, Gilland, Heese, and Swaminathan (2006) explain the popularity of equal pricing strategy; Teimoury et al. (2008) develop a dual-channel inventory model where stock is carried by both the manufacturer and the retailer, and consumer demand are lost when both the retail store and manufacturer warehouse are simultaneously out of stock. Dumrongsiri, Fan, Jain, and Moinzadeh (2008) develop a newsvendor model to study the dual-channel strategy of a manufacturer. Additionally, Huang and Swaminathan (2009) investigate the effects of the channel structure on the optimal pricing strategies. In contrast, our study focuses on the management of the dual-channel supply chain under supply uncertainty. Supply chain coordination can improve the profitability of the decentralized channel by reducing the double marginalization effect. Various contracts are designed to coordinate the supply chain since Jeuland and Shugan (1983). Tsay and Agrawal (2004), study how to coordinate the sales effort of a dual channel supply chain via generalized wholesale pricing contract. Cao (2014) studies how to coordinate a dual channel supply chain under demand disruptions. Cai (2010) investigates the effects of channel structures and channel coordination on the players of a dual-channel supply chain. In this paper, we consider both the centralized supply chain and the decentralized supply chain. Unlike the literature on supply chain coordination, we examine the effect of coordination of the dual-channel supply chain on the channel priority strategy.

The random yield literature includes two streams of models. The first stream assumes that supply/yield is random but market demand is deterministic, in order to explore issues such as inventory decisions (Güllu, Önol, & Erkip, 1997), pricing strategies (Tang & Yin, 2007), the value of supply chain centralization (Fang & Shou, 2015), component procurement strategies (Pan & So, 2016). The other assumes yield uncertainty and demand uncertainty simultaneously, e.g., Fu et al. (2015), Gallego and Moon (1993), Güler (2015), Güler and Bilgic (2009), Mukhopadhyay and Ma (2009), Xia, Ramachandran, and Gurnani (2011), Xiao, Chen, and Lee (2010), Yin and Ma (2015) among many others. Interested readers are referred to Yano and Lee (1995) for a detailed review. Yield uncertainty is likely to result in supply shortage. As pointed out earlier, under supply shortage, the channel priority strategy of the manufacturer with dual channels becomes an important issue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address such issue.

This paper is also related to the literature on allocation of limited capacity. For example, Cachon and Lariviere (1999) study how to allocate limited capacity when the retailers’ optimal stocking levels are private information. Cachon (2004) studies the allocation of inventory risk under demand uncertainty. Plambeck and Taylor (2007) explore how to renegotiate the supply contracts under information update. Hall and Liu (2010) develop cooperative game models to study the capacity allocation of a manufacturer with multiple products. The above literature discusses the case where the capacity is deterministic and supply shortage is caused by downstream uncertain demand/order. In contrast, we focus on the case where supply shortage is caused by its upstream supplier side (e.g., random capacity) rather than the downstream demand side. Since the yield is random, it is difficult for one to allocate its supply via following a specific rule. Moreover, the traditional capacity allocation models study how the supplier or manufacturer allocates its capacity between the retailers after observing the total order quantity. However, we study the channel allocation priority strategy of the manufacturer under supply uncertainty, i.e., while facing potential supply shortage, the manufacturer needs to decide whether to first meet the retailer or its direct channel before supply uncertainty is resolved. In addition, we also consider the case where the channel priority decision is decided after the yield is realized.

This paper contributes to the literature by considering the pricing and channel priority strategy of a dual-channel supply chain facing potential supply shortage caused by yield uncertainty. In contrast to the extant dual-channel literature, we consider supply shortage caused by yield uncertainty and examine channel priority strategy. Further, we examine the effect of coordination of the supply chain on the channel priority strategy by comparing the decentralized setting with the corresponding centralized (coordinated) setting. In addition, we examine the impacts of the time sequence of channel priority decision (yield ex-ante and ex-post) on the optimal price and channel priority decisions.

Consider a single-product supply chain where one manufacturer produces and markets the product through two variant channels to the end consumers: a direct (online store) channel and an indirect (brick-and-mortar retailer store) channel. The manufacturer's production process is not perfect and its yield is random, thus a supply shortage is likely to occur. We assume that the market demand is deterministic, see Güllu et al. (1997), Tang and Yin (2007), among others. Such deterministic demand assumption allows us to focus on the effect of random yield on equilibrium outcome. For ease of exposition, we assume that the manufacturer's yield R is random and uniformly distributed on the support [0, 2], which implies that the density of R ∈ [0, 2] is 1/2. Our analysis can be straightforwardly extended to the case with an arbitrary range of yield 
                        
                           [
                           0
                           ,
                           
                              R
                              ¯
                           
                           ]
                        
                     , 
                        
                           
                              R
                              ¯
                           
                           ≥
                           1
                        
                     . Because of the randomness of the yield R, the manufacturer may not be always able to satisfy market demand even if the demand size is deterministic. In other words, supply shortage is inevitable. While considering potential supply shortage, the manufacturer usually has two channel priority strategies to allocate supply to channels: DCP and RCP. As pointed out in the introduction, in case of supply shortage, DCP literally means that the direct channel has a priority over the retail channel, while RCP means that supply is provided to retail stores at a higher priority. Intuitively, the rational manufacturer always gives its high priority of supply to the channel yielding a high profit.

Since the two channels are selling the same product manufactured by the same manufacturer, the unit production costs of the products sold through the two channels are identical and denoted by c. Denote the retail price at the retail channel by p and that at the direct channel by pd
                     . The unit cost of sales for the retailer is cr
                     , covering labor, merchandizing, and shelving costs; that of the direct channel is cd
                     , including the costs of maintaining its websites and distribution systems, and labor cost. The advertising cost (if any) can be included as a part of the production cost c. The unit wholesale price w is charged by the manufacturer.

In the context of multiple–channel supply chain, the consumer's behavior to select channel plays an important role on the firm's sales, thus the consumer's behavior has been extensively considered when the firm makes the decision about its supply chain management (cf. Muthitcharoen, Palvia, & Grover, 2011). In this paper, we model market demand by considering potential consumer's rational behavior. In particular, each consumer has a reservation price in mind for the product and he/she will not make a purchase through a channel if its selling price is above the reservation price. The consumer's reservation price (valuation) for the product varies across different channels due to some factors such as preference for/aversion to the direct channel (e.g., the retailer store allows consumers to physically “touch and feel” the product or have a face-to-face conversation with a sales person, while the direct online store lacks such advantage), and lead times and waiting time (Chiang et al., 2003; Xiao et al., 2014). Specifically, let the consumer's reservation price (valuation) for a product bought from the retail channel be r and that from the direct channel be rd
                     . Considering the consumer's behavior to purchase through the retailer, following some literature, e.g., Ofek, Katona, and Sarvary (2011) and Xiao et al. (2014), we assume that consumers are uniformly distributed over a unit interval [0, 1], the retailer lies at the midpoint of the line segment (see Fig. 1
                     ), and a consumer with a distance 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/2 away from the retailer (either on the left or right side of the retailer) will obtain a utility 
                        
                           U
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           =
                           r
                           −
                           t
                           x
                           −
                           p
                        
                     , where the constant t is referred to as the trip cost (disutility) per unit distance, and a big value of t means a high disutility. From the retailer's perspective, to attain a positive demand, she/he should offer a rational selling price such that p < r. In the sequel, we shall assume that each consumer behaviors rationally and at most selects one unit product from the channel where she/he can obtain the maximal positive utility. Without loss of generality, we normalize the total market scale to be one unit. To avoid triviality, we further assume that the consumer's reservation price for the retail channel satisfies 
                        
                           r
                           >
                           c
                           +
                           
                              c
                              r
                           
                           +
                           t
                           /
                           2
                        
                      throughout this paper, which eliminates the situation that the retail channel offers a retail price below the channel cost 
                        
                           c
                           +
                           
                              c
                              r
                           
                        
                      per unit of the product. Otherwise, the retail channel will lose its competiveness and become trivially irrelevant due to non-profitability.

If a consumer selects to purchase a unit of the product through the direct channel, she/he realizes a utility as 
                        
                           
                              U
                              d
                           
                           =
                           
                              r
                              d
                           
                           −
                           
                              p
                              d
                           
                        
                     . Therefore, the consumer decides to buy the product from the direct channel only when pd
                      ≤ rd
                     . Here, to avoid any triviality, we assume that the consumer's reservation price rd

                     ; otherwise, the manufacturer will not implement the direct channel because of zero profit/demand. Furthermore, if the channel's total surpluses satisfy

To avoid such triviality, throughout this paper we consider the case where the retail channel has a higher total surplus than the direct channel, i.e.,

                     . Eq. (3) provides the range of the retailer's selling price p such that the market demand can be proportionally shared by both channels. Further, it implies that lowering the retail price p (or raising the selling price pd
                      of the direct channel) will increase the demand for the retail channel while cannibalizing that for the direct channel. This is consistent with the conventional wisdom and practical observation.

                     , the dual-channel setting is then degenerated to a sole retail channel since there is no consumer ordering through the direct channel. For such degenerated sole retail channel, solving

Note that the manufacturer has a knowledge of the total demand for both channels is 1 and she/he can observe the produced quantity timely before making channel allocation decision. In case of the supply shortage, i.e., R < 1, the total allocated supply to the two channels is the total yield R. Although the manufacturer can technically choose to increase supply by expanding capacity, this requires an urgent operational call incurring a potential cost and might delay consumers’ fulfillment, which is beyond the scope of this study. On the other hand, if R > 1, then the manufacturer only produces quantity 1 to avoid the excessive production and supply. In this case, the manufacturer would cease the production once it has produced a quantity equal to the order quantity. Such operational assumption is consistent with the extant literature on supply uncertainty. For both cases, the total realized supply can be expressed in general as min {R, 1}. Similarly, under the sole retail channel setting, the realized supply can be expressed as 
                        
                           min
                           {
                           R
                           ,
                           
                              q
                              r
                              S
                           
                           }
                        
                     .

It is commonly seen in practice that the manufacturer makes the channel priority decision prior to that the yield uncertainty is resolved. We refer to such phenomenon as yield ex-ante model and it is treated in Section 4. Differently, in Section 5, we shall consider the case where the manufacturer chooses the channel priority strategy after the yield is realized, which is referred to as yield ex-post model.

In the yield ex-ante model, the sequence of events is described as follows:

                        
                           (i)
                           
                              The manufacturer determines wholesale price w, the selling price pd for the direct channel, and selects a channel priority strategy: DCP or RCP;
                           


                              The retailer decides the retail price p for the retail channel, which further reveals the demand quantity;
                           


                              The production yield is resolved and the yielded products are allocated to each channel according to the predesignated channel priority strategy.
                           

Here the manufacturer first makes the price decisions for the two channels simultaneously, and then the retailer announces the retail price (Chiang et al., 2003). The channel priority, DCP or RCP, is predetermined prior to observing the yield. Such yield ex-ante phenomenon is typically observed in practice where the manufacturer is usually committed to a long-term contractual agreement with the retailer, such that the preselected channel priority decision performs as a long-term strategy; cf. Simchi-Levi, Wang, and Wei (2014). For example, to ensure a smooth launch, manufacturers typically sign contract with retailers regarding supply allocation before production yield for a new product introduction (NPI) process, e.g., the new innovative product Apple Watch, new generates of iPhone and iPad; cf. Uskert et al. (2011). If the manufacturer chooses strategy RCP, then the manufacturer typically writes the channel priority power into the contract agreement with the retailer; otherwise, the manufacturer will not hint the allocation preference into the contract; cf. 
                        EX-10.13, Apple Inc. Master Development and Supply Agreement
                     .

We first analyze the equilibrium outcome under DCP and RCP, and then examine the channel priority strategy by comparing the manufacturer's profits under the two strategies. For notational convenience, we use superscript “D” and “R” to characterize DCP and RCP, respectively.

Note that in the case of pd
                            ≤ rd
                           , we have 
                              
                                 
                                    q
                                    d
                                 
                                 =
                                 1
                                 −

                                    r
                                 
                              
                           . In this case, the consumer demand is fractionally fulfilled by those two channels. In the occurrence of a supply shortage, those consumers who select to purchase from the indirect channel will not buy from the direct channel because a trip cost has been involved, as a part of the utility values.

Under DCP, consumers in the direct channel obtain products with a priority. Thus, if the demand for the direct channel qd
                            is lower than the realized yield min {R, 1}, then its demand is fully satisfied, i.e., the fulfilled demand is qd
                           ; otherwise, the manufacturer can only provide min {R, 1} for the direct channel because of the limited yield constraint. Specifically, the fulfilled demand of the direct channel is

                           , i.e., all consumers buy from the retail channel. Proposition 1 shows that under DCP, the manufacturer has an incentive to exclude the direct channel when the net surplus of the direct channel

                            is sufficiently small and the consumer's reservation price r for the retailer is not too high. This can be explained as follows: Although using the direct channel can raise market demand, it increases the supply shortage risk for the retail channel. When the net surplus of the direct channel is very low, the loss of supply shortage risk is dominant. In Proposition 1, the optimal retail price for the retail channel is higher than the channel cost

                            to extract consumer surplus. Here the demand for the direct channel is positive if 
                              
                                 r

                           . Intuitively, increasing the direct channel price can relax price competition between the two channels but does not affect the total demand, which leads to a higher profit for the manufacturer. Thus, the manufacturer offers the highest price rd
                            for the direct channel. If the consumer's reservation price for the retail channel is sufficiently low (

                           Proposition 2 implies that under RCP, the centralized supply chain has no incentive to offer a direct channel price higher than the consumer's reservation price for the direct channel because this loses the revenue source from the direct channel and keeps the revenue from the retail channel unchanged. However, under DCP, in view of Proposition 1, we know that the optimal retail price for the direct channel may be higher than the consumer's reservation price rd
                           . Therefore, the allocation priority strategy plays an important role in the optimal price decisions. Consequently, substituting

It is of our interest to examine whether the centralized decision-maker has an incentive to leverage the DCP strategy. Proposition 3 summarizes the channel priority strategy of the centralized decision making.


                           
                              Proposition 3
                              
                                 In a centralized supply chain, the manufacturer will leverage RCP other than DCP to maximize the total expected channel profit.
                              


                           Proposition 3 implies that the centralized system can obtain a higher total expected profit under RCP than under DCP, i.e., the centralized system has an incentive to satisfy the retailer's order quantity with a priority. Intuitively, if the retail channel has a higher total surplus than the direct channel, then the manufacturer can better extract consumer surplus through the retail channel and hence it is strategically better off via endowing the retail channel with a priority.

Under the decentralized system, each manufacturer and retailer perform individually to maximize their own profit. In the sequel, we solve the Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) by the backward induction technique.

The manufacturer determines (pd, w) to maximize Eq. (9) under the constraint w ≤ pd
                            (Chiang et al., 2003; Xiao et al., 2014). If w > pd
                           , then the retailer will order products from the direct channel such that the manufacturer at most charges the retailer with a unit wholesale price

                           Lemma 2 implies that for the decentralized supply chain under RCP, the manufacturer would offer the retail price equal to the consumer's reservation price rd
                           , which is consistent with that of the centralized system.

In view of Lemmas 1 and 2, we derive Proposition 4 that summarizes the effect of the unit cost of sales for the direct channel on the channel priority strategy.

                            holds when the effect of channel priority on the retailer's demand is not too large and the retailer's demand is not too close to the extreme point 0 or 1. Intuitively, given these conditions, when the unit cost of sales cd
                            of the direct channel increases, the unit profit of the direct channel for the manufacturer decreases such that the relative profitability (the profit difference) of the retail channel over the direct channel increases, which raises the manufacturer's incentive to leverage RCP. Thus, the manufacturer will adopt RCP when the unit cost of sales cd
                            is sufficiently high.

                           . Similarly, we can examine the effects of r and t on the pricing decisions and quantity; we omit them to save space.


                           Figs. 2–4 imply that under DCP, both the unit wholesale price and the retail price for the retail channel are lower than those under RCP while the quantity for the retail channel is higher than that under RCP. That is, the effect of double marginalization under DCP is relatively lower than that under RCP. In addition, we find that when the unit cost of sales for the retail channel is not too low, a higher unit cost of sales cr
                            decreases the effects of the channel priority strategy on the pricing decisions and quantity for the retail channel.

In view of Fig. 5, we see that the manufacturer uses RCP if the unit cost of sales for the retail channel is sufficiently high; otherwise, the manufacturer uses DCP. 
                           Fig. 5 is counter intuitive as one would expect that a lower total surplus of the retail channel moderates the motivation to use RCP. However, under DCP, the retailer can strategically offer a retail price lower than that under RCP to snatch more consumers from the direct channel. In this case, the manufacturer allocates more supply to the retail channel but ultimately reaps a lower unit profit from the retail channel than under RCP due to a lower wholesale price. Moreover, a higher unit cost of sales cr
                            decreases the effect of channel priority on the demand for the retailer (

                            becomes smaller). As a result, the equilibrium channel priority strategy is RCP when the unit cost of sales cr
                            is sufficiently large.


                           Fig. 6
                            illustrates that the manufacturer adopts RCP if the consumer’s reservation price for the retailer is sufficiently low; otherwise, the manufacturer adopts DCP. Intuitively, the consumer's reservation price r has an effect on the channel priority strategy in a contrary way to that of the unit cost of sales cr
                            because they have a contrary effect on the total channel surplus of the retail channel. In short, Figs. 5 and 6 depict that the decentralized manufacturer uses RCP only when the total channel surplus for the retail channel is not too high.
                        


                           Fig. 7
                            shows that the decentralized manufacturer chooses RCP when the consumer's trip cost is sufficiently high. Intuitively, when the trip cost increases, the market demand for the retailer decreases, which further decreases the effect of channel priority strategy on the demand. Similar to the effect of the unit cost of sales cr
                            on the channel priority strategy, we can find that RCP is used if the trip cost is not too low.

Different from the yield ex-ante setting studied in Section 4, the channel priority decision can be made after the manufacturer has observed the production yield. This typically happens when the manufacturer has a short-term agreement with retailers, the demand is sensitive to the change of channel, and the supply is dynamically allocated to different channels; cf. Uskert et al. (2011). Observing the supply shortage, the manufacturer needs to determine how to allocate the inadequate supply to different channels. This section studies the yield ex-post model. In what follows, we shall use 
                        
                           a
                           ˜
                        
                      for the yield ex-post allocation model to denote its counterpart a of the ex-ante allocation model. When R ≥ 1, the demands of both channels can be satisfied, i.e., supply shortage becomes irrelevant. Thus, we only need to consider the case with R < 1 in this section.

                        Lemma 3 implies that when there exists a supply shortage, the centralized system endows channel priority to the channel with a higher unit profit given the retail prices. Intuitively, transferring a unit product from the channel with a lower unit profit to the channel with a higher unit profit can increase the marginal profit of the centralized system.

Comparing Proposition 5 with Proposition 3, we find that the channel priority and price decisions of the centralized system are identical in the two models. That is, the decision time of channel priority (before or after the yield is resolved) does not affect the optimal decisions of the centralized system. Specifically, for any given price pair, the centralized manufacturer always first allocates the product to the channel with higher unit profit. The supply uncertainty does not change the relative profitability of the two channels such that the channel priority strategy is unchanged by the decision time of channel priority. As a result, the optimal price decisions under the two settings are identical.

Similar to the centralized setting, the decentralized manufacturer endows channel priority to the channel with a higher unit profit. Observing the price decisions of the manufacturer (so the unit profit for each channel), the retailer can infer which channel priority strategy will be used by the manufacturer. Expecting the channel priority strategy, the retailer determines the retail price to maximize its expected profit under this strategy. Proposition 6 implies that the manufacturer offers a direct channel price equal to the consumer's reservation price, rd

Experiencing the growing innovation and development of e-commerce, more and more manufacturers start to market their products through dual channels: a retail channel and a direct channel. The channel priority strategy under supply uncertainty influences the pricing and sales quantity, and thus consequently affects the respective profitability of the two channels. Taking these factors into consideration, this paper has studied channel priority strategies in the presence of random yield, in both the centralized setting and the decentralized setting. We have also examined the effects of coordination of the supply chain on the channel priority strategy. In addition, we have investigated how the time sequence of the channel priority decision affects equilibrium outcome.

In the yield ex-ante model, we have assumed that the channel priority decision is decided before the yield uncertainty is resolved. We first considered the channel priority strategy in the centralized setting and then in the decentralized setting. It is of practical interest that, in the centralized setting, the manufacturer has an incentive to leverage RCP. In the decentralized setting, we identify the condition under which a higher unit cost of sales of the direct channel strengthens the motivation to use RCP. We have shown that the manufacturer may leverage RCP under a low total surplus of the retail channel, while apply DCP under a high total surplus in the decentralized setting. This contrasts to the centralized setting wherein the motivation of using RCP comes from a higher total surplus for the retail channel. In this sense, decentralization of the dual-channel supply chain may inverse the effect of the total surplus of the retail channel on channel priority strategy. In other words, decentralization of the supply chain plays an important role in determining the channel priority strategy. In the yield ex-post model, after observing the supply yield, the manufacturer determines the channel priority strategy. By comparing the two models, we found that the decision timeline of channel priority (yield ex-ante or yield ex-post) does not change the main results about channel priority strategies or pricing decisions.

There are several directions spawning future investigations. First, this paper only considers two channel priority cases when the manufacturer faces supply shortage. It is of interest to consider the case with a general allocation rule and study the optimal or suboptimal allocation rule of the manufacturer after observing the supply shortage (if the optimal rule is intractable to find). One can refer to Cachon and Lariviere (1999) and Hall and Liu (2010) for allocation rules of capacity. Second, instead of uniform distribution for the yield, one can consider the random yield following a general distribution and examine the effect of distribution variation on equilibrium outcomes. We mention that such a model is analytically cumbersome or intractable and one might have to illustrate those economic phenomena in a numerical way. We consider the case where the two channels offer different selling prices. To avoid price discrimination charged by different channels, it is also of interest to assume that channels charge the same selling price. This case can be analyzed by simplifying our model with restricting the retail price to be the same as the direct channel's selling price. In this line, one relevant research question encountered by the retailer will be an inventory ordering decision, i.e., how many to order from the manufacturer while considering the channel priority strategies. Finally, we have assumed that the market demand is deterministic. One can extend the analysis to the case with random yield and demand. However, it is outrageously complex and challenging such that numerical examples are largely used to the analysis.
