                  The present work uses mean value coordinates to construct the shape functions of a hybrid ‘FE-Meshfree’ quadrilateral element, which is named as Quad4-MVC. This Quad4-MVC can be regarded as the development of the ‘FE-Meshfree’ quadrilateral element with radial-polynomial point interpolation (Quad4-RPIM). Similar to Quad4-RPIM, Quad4-MVC has Kronecker delta property on the boundaries of computational domain, so essential boundary conditions can be enforced as conveniently as in the finite element method (FEM). The novelty of the present work is to construct nodal approximations using mean value coordinates, instead of radial basis functions which are used in Quad4-RPIM. Compared to the radial basis functions, mean value coordinates does not utilize any uncertain parameters, which enhances stability of numerical results. Numerical tests in this paper show that the performance of Quad4-RPIM becomes even worse than four-node iso-parametric element (Quad4) when the parameters of radial basis functions are not chosen properly. However, the performance of Quad4-MVC is stably better than Quad4.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The finite element method (FEM) [65] has been successfully used in very diverse fields, ranging from surgery simulations [3] to the impact-induced rock fragmentation in mining engineering [53,52]. However, it is well known that four-node iso-parametric quadrilateral element (Quad4) has been proved to be sensitive to mesh quality [27]. The sensitivity to the mesh quality becomes a severe limitation for FEM, especially for the problems related to fracture propagation [41,54], large deformation [44] and tracking fluid surfaces [13].

To overcome the difficulty of FEM, a group of meshfree methods is developed during the past several decades. The first meshfree method was proposed in 1970s [36,23], which was utilized to simulate astronomic phenomena and is named as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Then, moving least square approximations was introduced in the context of Galerkin method to construct the meshfree approximations, including Diffuse Element Method (DEM) [37] and Element-Free Galerkin (EFG) method [5,6]. By eliminating the limitation of meshes, meshfree method provides an effective approach to solve the problems associated with large deformation [14], fracture propagation simulation [42,8] and impact-induced failure [45]. Other developments of meshfree methods can be found in the references associated with Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM) [34], Meshfree Local Petrov–Galerkin (MLPG) method [1], stable particle methods [43], smoothed point interpolation methods [16] and meshless local natural neighbor interpolation method [17,18,11]. Furthermore, recently a family of smoothed finite element methods (S-FEMs) [31,39], which relied on strain smoothing technique [15], has been developed for a wide range of practical problems. There are four ways of constructing the smoothing domains to establish different S-FEM models: cell-based S-FEM (CS-FEM) [30], node-based S-FEM (NS-FEM) [40], edge-based S-FEM (ES-FEM) [33,7], and face-based S-FEM (FS-FEM) [38]. Thai-Hoang et al. [56] used a discrete shear gap technique to develop an alpha finite element method, which significantly improves the accuracy of FEM solution. Since SFEM is able to provide an upper bound solution for solid mechanics problems [39], it can be complementary to the FEM.

However, meshfree methods bring some new difficulties, such as the lack of Kronecker delta property in some of meshfree methods, in which extra operation is required to treat the essential boundary conditions [63,32]. To capture essential boundary conditions, many methods are developed to improve meshfree methods, including Lagrange multiplier method [35], penalty method [64], modified variational principles [5], and perturbed Lagrange [19]. Point interpolation method (PIM) [29] is an available approach to ensure Kronecker-delta property in the context of meshfree method. However, because of the limitation of polynomial basis functions, PIM suffers from the singular problem of constructing nodal approximation when the distribution of nodes is special [32]. Therefore, Liu [29] utilizes radial basis functions to replace polynomial basis functions and proposed radial point interpolation method (RPIM). Radial basis function interpolation is invertible for arbitrary scattered nodes, which eliminates the singular problem of constructing nodal approximation in RPIM.

Alternatively, to make full use of the advantages of both FEM and meshfree method, a set of hybrid finite element and meshfree methods are developed using the concepts of partition of unity [48,47,10,12,9]. A hybrid ‘FE-Meshfree’ quadrilateral element, which was developed by [44], encompasses Kronecker-delta property [59] and is able to reduce the sensitivity to mesh distortion. This hybrid ‘FE-Meshfree’ quadrilateral element utilizes polynomial basis functions to construct nodal approximations and its stress is not continuous at nodes [61], therefore in this paper it is names as Quad4-DNS (Quad4 with discontinuous nodal stress). To improve Quad4-DNS, the ‘FE-Meshfree’ quadrilateral element with continuous nodal stress was developed by Tang [55], which is named as Quad4-CNS in this paper. Similar to RPIM [29], Rajendran also utilizes the radial-polynomial basis functions to replace polynomial basis functions in Quad4-DNS and developed a ‘FE-Meshfree’ quadrilateral element with radial-polynomial basis functions (QUAD4-RPIM) [59].

In RPIM and QUAD4-RPIM, radial basis functions are successfully used to avoid singular problem of constructing approximations. However, some uncertain parameters are utilized in radial basis functions which include multi-quadrics (MQ) [24,25], reciprocal multi-quadrics (RMQ) [24,25,21], Gaussians (Exp) [60,22], and thin-plate splines (TPS) [22]. Liu and his co-workers have discussed the influence of these uncertain parameters on RPIM [28,29] and empirically advised some appropriate parameters. Similar technique is also used in Quad4-RPIM [62].

In this paper, mean value coordinates is introduced to replace radial-polynomial basis functions in the context of hybrid ‘FE-Meshfree’ method and proposed a novel hybrid ‘FE-Meshfree’ method with mean value coordinates (Quad4-MVC). This mean value coordinates does not use any uncertain parameters, which ensures the stability of simulation. In fact, mean value coordinates has been successfully used to construct polygonal finite element methods (PFEM) for many years [49–51]. In this paper, the numerical results of Quad4-MVC are compared to Quad4-RPIM, which show that Quad4-MVC is more stable than Quad4-RPIM.

The principle of partition of unity method (PUM) [2,4] provides a convenient approach to construct higher order global approximations without adding external nodes, thereby achieving higher accuracy and convergence rate. In this section, the generalized form of PUM is briefly introduced. Consider a bounded domain in two dimensions, V. The PUM is based on a set of non-negative weight functions,

                      is the nodal approximation associated with node i. The choice of weight functions and nodal functions is flexible in PUM. The nodal approximation can be constructed using many approaches, such as least-squares method [44] and radius functions [28]. In the present work, the mean value coordinates (MVC) is utilized to construct nodal approximation.

Mean value coordinates (MVC) [20,26] offers a choice to construct approximation that is not limited to triangular of quadrilateral elements, and in fact well-defined for arbitrary planar polygons, including convex and concave polygons. Here the formula of MVC is introduced and is then used to construct nodal approximations in Section 4.2.

                      are the weight function and the nodal approximation associated with node 
                        i
                     , respectively.

First, let us define the node patch of a node 
                        i
                      and denote it by 
                        
                           
                              Ω
                           
                           
                              i
                           
                        
                      as shown in Fig. 2
                     . Here, node 
                        i
                      is called the central node, and other nodes in domain 
                        
                           
                              Ω
                           
                           
                              i
                           
                        
                      are called the satellite node. In Fig. 2(a), the central nodal is inner the interpolant domain. In Fig. 2(b), the central nodal is on the boundary of the interpolant domain. It is noticed that the algorithms to construction nodal approximations on inner central nodal and on boundary central node are slightly different, which is introduced in Section 4.2.

According to Eq. (1), the weight functions are required to construct shape functions of Quad4-MVC. Similar to Quad4-RPIM [59], the formulas for the shape functions of Quad4 are used to construct the weight functions of Quad4-MVC. The weight function

The formula of mean value coordinates (see Eq. (5)) is used to construct the nodal approximations of Quad4-MVC. As shown in Fig. 2, the node patch of a node i is a polygonal domain. The nodes on the boundary of domain

                         are used to construct nodal approximations. It is noticed that, when central node is within the computational domain, only the satellite nodes in domain

                         are used to generate this polygon (see Fig. 2(a)) and are used to construct nodal approximations. When central node is on the boundary of the interpolation domain, both central node and satellite nodes are used to generate a polygon and are used to construct nodal approximations (see Fig. 2(b)).

The present Quad4-MVC is lack of Kronecker-delta property at the nodes locating within the computational domain, however Quad4-MVC ensures the Kronecker-delta property at the nodes on the boundaries of computational domain, that is important in the imposing of essential boundary conditions. In the following, the detailed proof of this Kronecker-delta property is shown.

In this section, numerical tests are carried out to validate the performance of Quad4-MVC. The Quad4-MVC is compared to four-node iso-parametric quadrilateral element (Quad4), and other three hybrid ‘FE-Meshfree’ methods, including Quad4-DNS [44], Quad4-CNS [55] and Quad4-RPIM [59]. Quad4-DNS and Quad4-CNS use polynomial basis functions to construct nodal approximations. Quad4-RPIM utilize radial-polynomial basis functions to construct nodal approximations. To be consistent with reference [59], Multi-Quadrics (MQ) [24,25] with parameters c and q is used to construct radial-polynomial interpolation.

The physical units used in the present work are based on the international standard unit system. Here, n defines the total number of the nodes in the computational model. To assess accuracy and convergence, the relative

For a numerical method, patch test is a useful test for correct implementation. As shown in Fig. 4
                        , a square computational domain is discretized into a uniform grid and four distorted grids. The material parameters of this patch test include Young׳s modulus E=1 and Poisson׳s ratio v=0.3. The displacements on all outside boundaries are prescribed by the following linear functions:

                         error for Quad4-MVC in the displacement norm is found to be

                           ×

                        , which means that Quad4-MVC has the ability to reproduce a linear field for solid mechanic problems.

A known problem of PUM is the linear dependence problem, which leads to the singularity of global (stiffness) matrices [57]. Nevertheless, the Quad4-MVC seems to be free from this problem. The material parameters in this test are listed as Young׳s modulus E=1.0 and Poisson׳s ratio 
                           ν
                           =
                           0.25
                        , and the plane stress condition is assumed. The geometry sketch is shown in Fig. 5
                         . According to the results of numerical tests, without applying boundary conditions, a total of three zero eigenvalues are found on all the meshes for Quad4-MVC. Moreover, after applying boundary conditions, there are no zero eigenvalues that can be observed.


                        Fig. 6
                        (a) represents the infinite plate with a central hole subjected to a tensile traction P. Due to its symmetry, only the upper right quadrant of the plate is modeled, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The analytical stress in this infinite plate can be found in the polar coordinate [58]. The parameters in this problem are taken as a=1, b=5, and P=1, and plane stain state is assumed. The material used is linear elastic with Young׳s modulus 
                           E
                           =

                        , Poisson׳s ratio v=0.3, and the unit thickness. Analytical traction solutions are enforced on the boundaries at x=5.0 and y=5.0.

Three different relative regular grids are used to investigate the convergence property of Quad4-MVC, as shown in Fig. 7
                           . As shown in Fig. 8
                           , the convergence rate of Quad4-MVC is −1.84 in the displacement norm. The convergence rates of Quad4, Quad4-CNS and Quad4-DNS are −1.66, −2.28 and −2.34, respectively. The convergence rate of Quad4-MVC is −0.95 in the energy norm. The convergence rates of Quad4, Quad4-CNS and Quad4-DNS are −0.90, −1.11 and −1.17, respectively.

Additionally, the relative errors of Quad4-MVC in the displacement norm and the energy norm are compared to those of Quad4 and Quad4-RPIM with different parameters of radial basis interpolation, q. The relative errors of three methods are plotted in Fig. 9
                           . It is seen that the performance of Quad4-MVC is stably better than Quad4. Meanwhile, the performance of Quad4-RPIM becomes worse than Quad4 when inappropriate parameters are chosen.

The hybrid FEM-meshfree methods, including Quad4-MVC, are expected to be insensitive to the mesh distortion. As shown in Fig. 10
                           , a distorted mesh is used to examine the influence of mesh quality on the numerical accuracy of Quad4, Quad4-MVC and Quad4-RPIM. Similarly, the relative errors of Quad4-MVC are compared to those of Quad4 and Quad4-RPIM with different parameters of radial basis functions, which is shown in Fig. 11
                           . The performance of Quad4-MVC is much better than the performance of Quad4. However, Quad-RPIM becomes much worse than Quad4-MVC and Quad4 when inappropriate parameters of radial basis functions are chosen.

A disk with an internal radius a, an external radius b, and a unit thickness is considered as another typical problem to validate the Quad4-MVC. As shown in Fig. 12
                        , the uniform pressure p=1 is applied to the inner surface (r=a), while the outer surface (r=b) is free from traction. Due to the symmetry of the problem, only one-quarter of the disk is modeled. The analytical solution is available in reference [46]. In the numerical computations, the following parameters are chosen: a=1, b=5, and p=1, and the plane stress condition is assumed. The material used is linear elastic with Young׳s modulus 
                           E
                           =
                           1
                           ×

                                 3
                              
                           
                         and v=0.25.

Four different regular grids are used to investigate the convergence property of Quad4-MVC, as shown in Fig. 13
                           . The convergence curves are plotted in Fig. 14
                           . The convergence rate of Quad4-MVC is −2.36 in the displacement norm. The convergence rates of Quad4, Quad4-CNS and Quad4-DNS in the displacement norm are −2.06, −2.26 and −2.20, respectively. Meanwhile, the convergence rate of Quad4-MVC is −1.35 in the energy norm. The convergence rates of Quad4, Quad4-CNS and Quad4-DNS in the energy norm are −1.03, −1.25 and −1.24, respectively.

Additionally, the relative errors of Quad4-MVC in the displacement norm and energy norm are compared to those of Quad4 and Quad4-RPIM with different values of parameter q. The relative errors of three methods are plotted in Fig. 15
                           . It is seen that the performance of Quad4-MVC is stably much better than Quad4 and Quad4-RPIM. However, the performance of Quad-RPIM is instable, which is worse than Quad4 when inappropriate parameters of radial basis functions are chosen.

As shown in Fig. 16
                           , a distorted mesh is used to examine the influence of mesh quality on the numerical accuracy of Quad4 and Quad4-RPIM. Similarly, the relative errors of Quad4-MVC are compared to those of Quad4 and Quad4-RPIM with different parameters of radial basis functions. As shown in Fig. 17
                           , the performance of Quad4-MVC is always better than Quad-RPIM. Meanwhile, the performance of Quad-RPIM becomes even worse than Quad4 when the parameters of radial basis functions are not chosen properly.

Compared to Quad4 on the same mesh, Quad4-MVC is able to improve accuracy, however, it meanwhile increases computational time because of the increasing of the bandwidth of global stiffness matrix. It is critical to find a right balance between simulation speed and accuracy. The relative errors in energy norm versus the corresponding solution times for both Quad4 and Quad4-MVC are shown in Fig. 18
                           . The convergence rate of Quad4-MVC is −0.58 in the energy norm, which is better than the convergence rate of Quad4 (−0.50). Quad4-MVC yields more accurate results than Quad4 under the same solution time. Thus, the present Quad4-MVC is seen to be more computationally efficient compared to Quad4.

Natural pre-existing fractures are widely observed in rock material, which have significant impact on the mechanical property of rock material. It is difficult to avoid distorted meshes in mesh generation when multiple cracks are considered. In this test, the deformation of a rock with multiple cracks, as shown in Fig. 19
                        , is investigated using Quad4-MVC. The material parameters of this sample are Young׳s modulus

                        , and the plane strain conditions are assumed. The computational domain is discretized into 334 quadrilateral elements with 397 nodes, as shown in Fig. 20
                        . Due to the lack of theoretical solution, Quad4 is utilized to obtain a reference solution on fined mesh which has 11,860 elements and 12,418 nodes. The displacements in the 
                           x
                        -direction and the 
                           y
                        -direction obtained by Quad4-MVC and Quad4 at point A and point B are compared to the reference solution (see Fig. 19). The comparison of Quad4, Quad4-MVC, Quad4-DNS and Quad4-CNS is shown in Table 1
                        . Quad4-MVC is better than Quad4 and other two hybrid ‘FE-Meshfree’ methods, Quad4-DNS and Quad4-CNS.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper presents a novel hybrid ‘FE-Meshfree’ method, which is a development of hybrid ‘FE-Meshfree’ quadrilateral element with radial-polynomial point interpolation (Quad4-RPIM) [59]. The novelty of the present method is introducing mean value coordinates to construct nodal approximations, which leads to more stable numerical results. The following conclusions can be drawn:
                        
                           •
                           Even though Quad4-MVC does not have Kronecker-delta property at inner nodes, Quad4-MVC is able to ensure Kronecker-delta property at the nodes on the boundary of computational domain, which allows us to apply correct boundary condition directly.

Quad4-MVC is free from the linear dependence problem which is the main drawback of methods based on partition of unity.

Compared to four-node iso-parametric element (Quad4), Quad4-MVC presents significantly higher convergence rates and better accuracy. Furthermore, Quad4-MVC seems to be insensitive to mesh distortion. The Quad4-RPIM even becomes worse than Quad4, when the parameters of radial basis functions are not chosen properly.

By inheriting advantages of hybrid FE-Meshless elements, Quad4-MVC provides an alternative approach to improve accuracy of FEM without increasing the number of nodes, meanwhile, it increases the bandwidth of the global stiffness matrix and increases the computational time. However, an assessment of computational efficiency (in Fig. 18) shows that the present element seems to be more efficient than the classical Quad4 element. Moreover, Quad4-MVC is able to obtain accurate results under distorted meshes, and it has the potential to simulate large deformation and fracture propagation problems.
