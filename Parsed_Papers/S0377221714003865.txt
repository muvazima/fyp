                  Supply chain partnerships exhibit varying degrees of power distribution among the agents. This has implications for pricing and operational decisions in the channel and eventually influences the end customers. To understand how different power schemes affect the supply chain partners’ performance and consumer surplus, we study channel structures with a dominant manufacturer, a dominant retailer, and no single-agent dominance. Under random and price sensitive demand, channel dominance is interpreted in our setting as exerting power to determine the retail and wholesale prices as well as to transfer the inventory risk to the weaker party. We analyze all problems in a game-theory based framework and characterize the equilibrium retail price, wholesale price, and order/production quantity. We show that the manufacturer-dominated channel structure leads to the highest production quantity, the lowest retail price, and the largest expected surplus for an individual buyer; on the other hand, the entire channel profit and the total consumer surplus are highest when the retailer holds the channel dominance. While both the manufacturer and the retailer are better off when they become a power agent individually, channel dominance does not always guarantee higher share of channel profits, as we show under the manufacturer-dominated structure. Further insights are derived analytically and numerically from comparisons of the manufacturer/retailer dominance schemes with the no single-agent dominance structure and integrated channel. We also study extensions to investigate the effect of demand model and risk sharing, and we address industry settings with alternative schemes of holding cost, shortage penalty and salvage value.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Supply chains have different structures based on the relative power distribution among the members. In some cases, agents have comparable power, hence no definite channel dominance is present; in other cases, there is power imbalance which may give rise to a dominant agent in the channel. For example, companies such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Home Depot, Amazon.com, and Tesco, which are referred to as “power retailers,” are mentioned to pursue a dominance strategy in some of their channel partnerships. In a similar way, the term “power manufacturer” may be used for companies such as Apple, Caterpillar, and designer goods manufacturers. Although in most cases channel dominance is achieved together with market dominance, it is also possible that market-dominating companies not simultaneously adopt a channel dominance strategy (Jerath, Hoch, & Zhang, 2007), as for example in the partnership between Wal-Mart and Proctor & Gamble, which can motivate a balanced or distributed power structure. The purpose of this work is to investigate the effects of such dominance structures on supply chain performance and consumer surplus. Focusing on a single product, we measure the supply chain performance by the sales quantity, retail price, and the profits of the agents and the entire channel; while the consumer surplus is measured as the sum of differences between individual buyers’ willingness to pay for the product and its retail price.

It is natural to expect that the particular power distribution will influence the channel dynamics. Practice offers insights on how retailers and manufacturers execute their channel power. For example, industry reports mention that power retailers use their dominant position to extract concessions from manufacturers in the form of trade deals and slotting allowances (Bloom & Perry, 2001). Bowman (1997) reports that many suppliers feel their profits are squeezed due to demands of power retailers for lowered prices, accelerated delivery times, or extra inventory storage. One example is Wal-Mart’s strict response to RubberMaid’s price increase of its products which eventually drove the company to a merger with Newell in 1999. Other sources report similar examples of Wal-Mart’s influence on its suppliers’ pricing decisions, for example, USA Today cites that “Big food companies including Kraft, which gets 10% of its revenue from Wal-Mart, have not been able to raise prices as quickly as they once did because of Wal-Mart’s demands.” Krishnan and Soni (1997) mention examples from Europe where retailers with significant market power are reportedly “demanding guarantees of margins from the manufacturers.” Power retailers’ influence may even extend to decisions on inventory ownership or product quality (Dukes, Geylani, & Liu, 2014). In consignment-sales contracts, such as those offered by Amazon.com, the retailer does not typically take ownership of the goods and “charges the manufacturers a predetermined percentage of the selling price on each unit of their products actually sold” (Wang, 2006). Amazon.com can also collect advance demand information through customers’ preorders based on which the firm places own orders to suppliers; hence practices “order postponement” (Granot & Yin, 2005).

Power manufacturers engage in some practices that may impose similar restrictions on the channel partners. For example, in the electronics industry, Apple preannounces the retail price of its products long time before demand realization and is reported to offer retailers a discount that is only a small percentage lower than the announced price (Hiner, 2011). This leaves little flexibility for the retailers to make discounts or set their own prices. Munson, Rosenblatt, and Rosenblatt (1999) explain that power manufacturers try to “influence the final price to better manage consumer demand, respond to competition, and send the appropriate quality signal.” Some industry practices such as “minimum (advertised) pricing” and “resale price maintenance” in which the manufacturer restricts retailers from offering discounts and/or enforces that all retailers sell the product at a certain price allow power manufacturers to control or determine the selling price of their products. These applications contrast with the practices in retailer-dominated channels where the retailer holds considerable pricing power in determining the final selling price. Consequently, different power structures introduce alternative retail pricing schemes which have direct impact on customers.

All of these examples illustrate that a power agent might exert its influence in the supply chain to shape or dictate other partners’ decisions, such as in pricing and stocking. This raises some questions from the perspective of the entire channel, its independent members, and the customers. For example, would we expect lower or higher retail prices in the presence of a dominant retailer or a dominant manufacturer? Would the consumers be better off, based on measures such as service level and expected surplus, in a manufacturer or retailer-dominated channel? These questions relate to the impact of different power structures on channel performance and consumer surplus, which is the main motivation for our research. While the supply chain management literature has extensively studied the agents’ independent decision-making and the development of incentives to improve channel performance, there has not been much focus on comparing the different types of power structures and addressing their impact on retail pricing and stocking decisions. In the economics and marketing areas, some papers study power issues in distribution channels and the effects of manufacturer’s price setting on retail competition and consumer surplus; however, they do not address operational decisions such as inventory ordering under different risk allocation mechanisms or inventory fill rate. In our paper, we propose models that explicitly incorporate the power structure into retail pricing and timing of inventory order commitment, and we aim to contribute to the literature by offering insights on the impact of channel power structure from the operations perspective with consideration of pricing decisions.

More specifically, we consider channel structures with a single dominant agent; manufacturer or retailer, and one without sole-agent dominance in which power is distributed to the manufacturer and the retailer. Our analysis is built on the framework of a price-setting newsvendor who faces random and price-dependent demand for a single product which is procured from the manufacturer after a relatively long production lead time and sold during a single selling season. To operationalize the notion of power, we adopt a viewpoint by El-Ansary and Stern (1972) and Wilkinson (1974), which defines it as the ability to control the decisions of another member in the channel. In our setting, the dominant manufacturer determines the retailer’s gross profit margin rate, while the dominant retailer effectively sets the wholesale price of the manufacturer by remitting a certain percentage of the retail price. As a result of this transfer-pricing scheme, the dominant agent becomes responsible for determining the selling price to the customers. Furthermore, the dominant agent is able to eliminate the risk of having any excessive inventory at the end of season by shifting it to the weaker party in the channel. When there is no single-agent dominance, the wholesale price and gross profit margin rate are determined individually by the manufacturer and the retailer, and inventory risk is shared.

We model the interactions between the channel partners in a game-theory based framework and analyze the equilibrium prices, order quantities and profits under different dominance structures. In the base model, demand is iso-elastic with multiplicative randomness factor and no holding/shortage costs or salvage value are applicable. We find that the equilibrium retail price is the lowest and the total production quantity is the largest in the manufacturer-dominated channel, which implies that for an individual customer the greatest expected surplus is possible when the manufacturer holds the channel dominance. On the other hand, this channel structure leads to the lowest inventory fill rate as measured by the fraction of expected demand satisfied by the available stock in the long run, which implies that customers face a higher probability of encountering a stock-out. Consequently, when we consider total consumer surplus from the entire market perspective, we find that the channel under retailer dominance has the best performance. Comparing the equilibrium profits of the channel agents, we derive the following results. Both the manufacturer and the retailer achieve profit advantages when they gain channel dominance. However, it is also possible that the weaker agent command a larger share of the total profits. We find this observation in the manufacturer-dominated setting and derive the conditions based on the demand parameters. Overall, the retailer-dominated channel leads to a higher system profit than the channels under manufacturer dominance or where the agents have distributed pricing power. When the agents additionally implement inventory risk sharing, profit comparison results for the retailer-dominated and no single-agent-dominated channels are mixed, but both outperform the manufacturer-dominated structure. We also find that the total system profit and consumer surplus are affected by the demand variance and customers’ price sensitivity.

Our findings in the base model extend to the case in which holding/shortage costs and salvage value are relevant. Further, we observe that increasing shortage cost intensifies the power agent’s profit gains in the channel while the effects of holding cost and salvage value are mixed with respect to whether the retailer or the manufacturer is the dominant agent. Another extension in which the demand is linear with multiplicative randomness factor reveals that some results regarding the comparison of supply chain performance and consumer surplus may be reversed. These findings help us understand the impact of demand curve mode.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review. In Section 3, we describe the main model setting and the different dominance structures; we also discuss model assumptions and present some preliminary results. Our analysis is presented in Section 4, where we establish the equilibrium results for the manufacturer-dominated channel (Section 4.1), retailer-dominated channel (Section 4.2), channel with no single-agent dominance (Section 4.3) and integrated channel (Section 4.4). Section 5 contains results from the comparison of the different models and Section 6 presents the analysis of the extended models including the scenarios with holding/shortage cost and salvage value (Section 6.1), linear multiplicative demand (Section 6.2), and inventory risk sharing (Section 6.3). We summarize our findings and discuss future research ideas in Section 7. All of the proofs and findings omitted from the main body are available in the online appendix.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The issue of power distribution between manufacturers and retailers has been studied in the marketing, supply chain, and operations literature. In the empirical stream, recent works have investigated whether there is evidence of a power shift from manufacturers to retailers. Although many industry reports and trade articles mention such a trend (e.g., Schiller & Zellner, 1992), the literature offers mixed results. For example, Messinger and Narasimhan (1995) and Farris and Ailawadi (1992) do not find support for shift of power to retailers based on relative profitability; whereas, in a more recent study, Kadiyali, Chintagunta, and Vilcassim (2000) find evidence for retailers’ increased pricing power in the channel. Papers in this stream implicitly associate channel dominance with the proportion of channel profits earned by the members. These findings suggest that channel structures with either the manufacturer or the retailer dominance are observed in practice, therefore it is of interest to study alternative power schemes.

In the theoretical stream, power issues are frequently addressed in the interactions among the channel players and power asymmetry is incorporated into the order of decision-making in game theory settings. Choi (1991) analyzes Stackelberg games between two power-balanced manufacturers and a common retailer where the leaders in the game are assumed to hold channel dominance. Edirisinghe, Bichescua, and Shi (2011) extend this structure by considering configurations with full range of power distribution and show that power imbalance hurts the channel performance and stability. Granot and Yin (2007) investigate the effects of retailer’s and supplier’s sequential commitment to buyback contract parameters on channel performance. The sequence may be thought as a bargaining process with the supplier and the retailer alternating in leading the interactions. Wang, Shou, and Wang (2013) focus on a supply chain with a dominant retailer who faces a price and effort dependent demand. Channel dominance allows the retailer to lead the interactions by declaring a required retail markup, and different scenarios exist depending on the markup structure and timing of effort exertion. Works that consider channel power issues in combination with operational and/or contracting decisions include Bichescu and Fry (2009), Lau, Lau, and Wang (2007) and Lau, Lau, and Zhou (2007) among others.

All of the preceding papers assume the dominant agent exercises its power by merely leading the sequence of decisions in interactions, which implies that the weaker agent responds to the already declared decisions. In contrast, we define power in a more explicit way and express it as the ability of the dominant party to dictate certain decisions of the weaker party. This interpretation is consistent with the definitions of power set forth by El-Ansary and Stern (1972) and Wilkinson (1974). (Alternative views are discussed in a review paper by Gaski, 1984). In this regard, our paper is related to the works by Geylani, Dukes, and Srinivasan (2007), Pan, Lai, Leung, and Xiao (2010), and Tsay (2002). Geylani et al. (2007) study a manufacturer’s response to a dominant retailer when the channel also includes a weak retailer. The dominant retailer has the ability to dictate the wholesale price, however, the weak retailer takes it as given. In Pan et al. (2010), dominant agent is assumed to have the right to choose the contract type, either wholesale price or revenue sharing, and results are provided as to when revenue sharing is more beneficial. Tsay (2002) studies the impact of risk sensitivity in return policies and considers a scenario where the channel leader (manufacturer or retailer) selects the contract parameters including the wholesale price. In our setting, the dominant agent effectively makes the pricing decisions in the channel and is able to shift the inventory/production risk to the weaker agent.


                     Chen, Ding, and Ou (2014) and Shi, Zhang, and Ru (2013) are two recently appeared papers which concentrate on the comparison of different channel structures based on power distribution among the agents. Chen et al. (2014) study assembly supply chains with two firms supplying an assembly firm. The treatment of power in their study is based on pricing decision authority and inventory risk elimination, which is very similar to ours. However, Chen et al. (2014) consider the wholesale pricing decision among the trading partners and assume that end-customer demand is independent of retail price, whereas we model price-sensitive demand. Shi et al. (2013) analyze the impacts of power structure when demand is uncertain and price-sensitive with different forms according to the expected demand and demand shock components. For the linear demand, they show that firms become better off when they gain channel power, which is similar to a finding in our study. Other results on supply chain performance and consumer surplus largely depend on the particular demand form, and some of their findings are different from our comparison results mainly due to differences in modeling “power”, e.g., they do not consider unified pricing authority for the powerful agent.

Since we consider scenarios in which the final selling price is determined by the manufacturer or the retailer, the literature on alternative retail pricing mechanisms in channels is also relevant. In many applications, the retailer sets the selling price such as by adding a markup over marginal cost; however, practices in which the manufacturer directly controls the retail prices are also observed, for example, in the form of resale price maintenance (RPM) and maximum/minimum RPM, despite their controversial legal status. The research in this area has originated in the economics literature and led to some findings suggesting that maximum RPM alleviates double marginalization effect (Tirole, 1988), minimum RPM may induce competing retailers to order larger inventories and lead higher profits for the manufacturer (Deneckere, Marvel, & Perk, 1996), and that RPM may reduce strategic gaming issues such as free riding and limit double marginalization, but may also hurt competition (Mathewson & Winter, 1984; Rey & Tirole, 1986). A review of this literature is provided in Krishnan and Winter (2007) and Vergé (2008).

In the supply chain contracting literature, the use of RPM has been analyzed for channel coordination while also incorporating the retailer’s effort and system-parameter uncertainties (Gurnani & Xu, 2006; Lau, Lau, & Wang, 2010). In our setting, RPM is relevant in the manufacturer-dominated structure but our aim is not to investigate channel coordination or consider horizontal competition but rather to compare the schemes where the manufacturer or the retailer has the decision right to determine the retail price and inventory risk allocation. Similar to Deneckere et al. (1996), we find that the total order quantity is largest when the manufacturer determines the retail price. In a related paper, Tsetlin, Rudi, and Padmanabhan (2010) investigate the question of who prices in the channel. Utilizing a setting with a single supplier and multiple competing retailers, they find that the degree of demand uncertainty plays an important role in the supply chain parties’ preference of retail pricing structure. Our model in the manufacturer-dominated channel is closely related to theirs; however, they use a market clearing mechanism for the retailers’ competitive pricing decisions, whereas we use a transfer-pricing scheme based on gross profit margin rate and consider a single retailer.

Another relevant area concerns inventory risk allocation and order postponement in supply chains. For instance, push and pull contracts (e.g., Cachon, 2004; Dong & Zhu, 2007; Lariviere & Porteus, 2001; Wang, Niu, & Guo, 2014), respectively, have resemblance to the interactions in our manufacturer and retailer-dominated channel structures. One common theme in this area is the assumption of exogenous retail price, which is endogenized in our paper. Studying order postponement along with price postponement, Granot and Yin (2008) show either postponement type can improve channel efficiency. In a study of consignment contracts, Ru and Wang (2010) find that delegating the inventory decision to the supplier is a win–win situation for the channel parties. Different from these papers, we consider order postponement as a consequence of channel power. We find in our base model that shifting the inventory risk to the upstream party yields a better channel performance and also improves the total consumer surplus.

Our model is built on a price-setting newsvendor problem under stochastic and price-dependent demand. Petruzzi and Dada (1999) review and provide extensions for newsvendor problems with pricing decisions and consider alternative demand forms. In the base case, we model iso-elastic demand curve and introduce demand uncertainty in multiplicative form which is common in the literature (e.g., Caliskan-Demirag, Chen, & Li, 2011; Chen, Xu, & Zhang, 2009; Granot & Yin, 2005; Wang, Jiang, & Shen, 2004; Wang, 2006; Xu, Chen, & Xu, 2010; Zabel, 1970). We also study the extension of linear demand to address the effects of demand curve mode.

We consider a supply chain with one manufacturer (she) and one retailer (he). The manufacturer produces items at unit cost c and offers them at the wholesale price w. The retailer purchases q units of products which are then sold to the customers at the unit retail price p. We assume the production lead time is relatively long and products are sold during a shorter single selling season, which is plausible for products with short life-cycle or are perishable, such as in fashion/apparel retail and consumer electronics industries.

Demand is unknown before the selling season, and it is price sensitive. We assume that the market is composed of heterogenous customers whose willingness to pay for the product, 
                        
                           ξ

Demand is more sensitive to changes in retail price when b is high and the multiplicative form implies that the coefficient of variation of demand is constant with changes in price while its variance is decreasing in price and price elasticity parameter.

                     . With this model, we aim to capture the pricing practices of power manufacturers and power retailers such as in resale price maintenance and consignment-sales with revenue sharing contracts. Kostamis and Duenyas (2009) develop a similar transfer-pricing model but they take 
                        
                           α
                        
                      as exogenous, representing the outcome of a negotiating process. Since 
                        
                           α
                        
                      is determined by the dominant agent in our setting, the two models are similar in that 
                        
                           α
                        
                      reflects the relative power distribution in the channel.

We model three different power schemes between the manufacturer and the retailer. In the first model, the manufacturer has channel dominance and determines the retailer’s gross profit margin rate 
                        
                           α
                        
                      along with her wholesale price decision w. Once the values of w and 
                        
                           α
                        
                      are determined, the retail price p is set via the equation 
                        
                           p
                           =
                           w
                           /
                           (
                           1
                           -
                           α
                           )
                        
                     . This represents the situation in which a power manufacturer has the ability to enforce the retailer’s gross profit margin, or equivalently the selling price. In the second model, the retailer is the dominant party in the channel and selects the values of 
                        
                           α
                        
                      and the selling price p, which in turn determine the wholesale price w. In this case, the power retailer is in a position to dictate the wholesale price to the manufacturer. In both models, the interaction between the manufacturer and the retailer is modeled in a Stackelberg game framework. The third model imposes no single-agent dominance, and we assume agents engage in a Nash game in which the manufacturer determines w and the retailer determines 
                        
                           α
                        
                      simultaneously.

In addition to the prices, the production/inventory order quantity must be chosen in advance of the selling season, which is a decision that carries risk due to demand uncertainty. Essentially, the channel may suffer from having end-of-season leftover inventory or unsatisfied demand, and hence is exposed to inventory risk and stock-out risk, respectively. We assume that the existing power structure has implications on who bears the inventory risk. When the retailer has channel dominance, he exercises “order postponement”, that is, he is able to postpone his order placement until after the demand uncertainty is resolved. In the manufacturer-dominated channel, retailer does not have such capability and must place his inventory order before observing demand, which eliminates inventory risk for the manufacturer. When no single-agent dominance exists in the channel, we assume that the inventory risk is shared via a buyback contract in which the retailer pays the wholesale price but is compensated by the manufacturer for any unsold item at a unit buyback price.

Our setting, which consists of a production period preceding a single selling season, lends itself into a two-period decision framework. In all models, wholesale price, retail margin rate and production/order quantity decisions are made in the first period under demand uncertainty. In the second period, demand becomes known and the market clears where any unmet demand is assumed lost. In the base model, we assume that leftover items have no salvage value, and no holding cost or shortage penalty is incurred. These assumptions can be reasonable for perishable or short life-cycle products (Wang et al., 2004). We later extend the base model to address the effects of these parameters. The channel partners face newsvendor-type problems, therefore we use some existing results from the newsvendor model literature. In formulating the problems, we use the transformation of the order quantity decision into the stocking factor decision z such that 
                        
                           z
                           =

We start our analysis by studying the equilibrium decisions under channel structures with dominant manufacturer or dominant retailer. Next, we study the case where neither party has channel dominance which we address with two different models: distributed pricing power scheme and distributed pricing power scheme with buyback option. In the last part, we analyze the integrated channel as a benchmark to gain insights from an entire channel perspective. We denote the equilibrium decisions for the integrated channel by the superscript I, and for the channels under manufacturer dominance, retailer dominance, and no sole-agent dominance under distributed pricing power with and without the buyback option by

In this setting, the manufacturer is solely responsible for the pricing decisions while the retailer determines the order quantity q. Due to being in a weaker position of power, the retailer bears all of the inventory risk by placing the order before demand realization. Channel interactions represent a Stackelberg game with the sequence of events given in (A1)–(A3).

The retailer determines its quantity commitment q and announces it to the manufacturer. The manufacturer builds capacity of q units.

The selling season starts and the customer demand is observed. The retailer satisfies the customer demand using the available inventory q.

                         are decreasing in the price elasticity parameter b, implying that the stocking factor and prices tend to be lower for highly price elastic products. One question of interest is how the equilibrium profits are split between the channel parties. More specifically, can the manufacturer leverage her channel dominance to obtain a higher share of channel profits? Recall that the order quantity in equilibrium is given by

                        Corollary 1 shows that the division of equilibrium profits may not always favor the power manufacturer. (See Example 1 for a numerical illustration.) This observation is seemingly contrary to what one may expect, and does not support the view which assumes higher profitability as an indicator of channel power (e.g., Ailawadi, 2001; Choi, 1991; Kadiyali et al., 2000). On the other hand, the condition that allocates the manufacturer a lower share of the profits is rather restrictive; for example, in most cases, the distributions that have the IGFR property such as uniform, exponential, power, gamma and Weibull with the shape parameter greater than

                               due to Corollary 1; therefore the retailer earns a larger proportion of the total channel profit than the manufacturer.

In this setting, the retailer holds channel dominance and makes the pricing decisions, while the manufacturer bears the inventory risk; representing a contrast to the decision structure in the manufacturer-dominated channel. The retail price and the wholesale price are again related through the equation 
                           
                              p
                              =
                              w
                              /
                              (
                              1
                              -
                              α
                              )
                           
                        . The retailer implements order postponement and places an at-once order (equal to the demand) after demand uncertainty is resolved. The manufacturer is responsible for choosing the order quantity, q, and must produce those items before demand realization. Therefore, the inventory risk is completely transferred to the manufacturer and she is put in a relatively “weaker” position because her production costs are sunk. This observation has been mentioned in the works of Cachon (2004), Li and Scheller-Wolf (2011) and Wang et al. (2014) to motivate the retailer’s increased power as opposed to the manufacturer when equipped with order postponement strategy, which is consistent with our model assumption.

The retailer now takes the leader position in the Stackelberg game and the order of decisions is as follows:
                           
                              (B1)
                              The retailer determines and announces the retail price p and the gross margin rate 
                                    
                                       α
                                    
                                 , through which wholesale price w is set.

The manufacturer builds its capacity and produces quantity q in anticipation of the retailer’s order.

The selling season starts and the customer demand is observed. The retailer satisfies the customer demand using the available inventory q.

To derive the equilibrium decisions, we start with the manufacturer’s problem of determining the optimal production quantity q, which can be formulated under the notation 
                           
                              z

Using Proposition 2, we can show that the optimal decisions are decreasing in the price elasticity. Therefore, independent of the channel power structure, the wholesale and retail prices tend to be lower for products with highly elastic demand and is largely consistent with observations in practice as those products typically have many substitutes which drive prices down. To investigate the division of profits, we rewrite the profit functions of the manufacturer and retailer in equilibrium:

                              , that is, the retailer obtains a greater share of the channel profits.
                           

As implied by Corollaries 1 and 2, channel dominance does not necessarily indicate a greater share of profits for the manufacturer, but profit leadership is guaranteed for the dominant retailer. In the channel under manufacturer dominance, the manufacturer’s profit is deterministic while the retailer is faced with demand uncertainty; see the profit equations in (2) and (3). In contrast, under the retailer-dominated structure, both the manufacturer and the retailer are exposed to demand uncertainty in their profits through the term 
                           
                              S
                              (
                              z
                              )
                           
                        ; see (4) and (5). This increases the influence of the retailer in the manufacturer-dominated channel when determining z compared to the manufacturer in the retailer-dominated channel and leads to the situation that the retailer, when he is the less powerful agent, has a chance of earning a greater share of channel profits while the less powerful manufacturer does not. We can also verify that the dominant retailer’s profit is higher than the dominant manufacturer’s profit.

So far, we have focused on channels with one dominant agent who has the ability to set prices and shift the inventory risk to the other party. We next consider the case in which there is no power asymmetry and therefore agents cannot make these decisions individually. In particular, the manufacturer now determines the wholesale price w and the retailer selects his gross margin rate 
                           
                              α
                           
                        , leading to the retail price 
                           
                              p
                              =
                              w
                              /
                              (
                              1
                              -
                              α
                              )
                           
                        . Additionally, in the models with a dominant agent, notice that the channel power distribution has been implicitly reflected in the sequence of decisions; that is, the powerful agent led the interactions in steps (A1)–(A3) and (B1)–(B3). When such a dominance structure is not present, agents can be expected to make their decisions simultaneously, which suggests a Nash pricing game between the manufacturer and retailer. After the pricing decisions are made, the channel’s stocking quantity is determined under demand uncertainty.

We address the inventory risk under the no single-agent dominance case by considering two scenarios. In the first (general) scenario, we assume that no single party bears the inventory risk entirely; rather, both agents share the responsibility of leftover units. We model this with a buyback type of contract which stipulates that the retailer makes the ordering decision, q and purchases the items at the regular wholesale price but is paid by the manufacturer a buyback price for each unit of unsold inventory (e.g., Cachon, 2003, chap. 6; Song, Ray, & Li, 1998; Song et al., 2008). As the compensation value may not exceed the purchase price, we model the buyback price as k fraction of w. We assume that k is constant and exogenously given, which can be thought of as the outcome of a negotiation process between the manufacturer and the retailer, with equal power represented as 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                        . Overall, the general scenario reflects distributed pricing power and shared inventory risk in the channel. However, this model does not facilitate analytical results for the comparison of different dominance structures. While we investigate such results numerically, we consider another scenario in which agents have distributed pricing power but do not implement buyback scheme, i.e., the special case with 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              0
                           
                        . (This model is consistent with that studied by Shi et al. (2013) for “balanced power structure” in their paper.) Although the retailer commits to the order quantity before demand realization and hence carries the inventory risk in this scenario, we find that the resulting outcomes are the same when he adopts order postponement; therefore the results are not dependent on who bears the inventory risk. The sequence of decisions in the described scenarios is given in (C1)–(C3).

                              The manufacturer determines the unit wholesale price w and the retailer determines the gross margin ratio 
                                    
                                       α

                                 , and, in the scenario with buyback contract, k, the retailer determines the order quantity q and places the order with the manufacturer. The manufacturer produces q units.

The selling season starts and the customer demand is observed. The retailer satisfies the customer demand using the available inventory q. In the scenario with buyback contract, the retailer returns the unsold inventory to the manufacturer at the per-unit buyback price kw.

Notice that the profits in the no single-agent dominance case satisfy the relation

                        , which is decreasing in b. As the demand for the product becomes less price elastic, the profit ratio becomes more significant and hence the retailer’s profit advantage becomes more pronounced.

Our results are useful to understand the impact of gaining channel dominance on agents’ profitability. When neither of the supply chain agents has dominance, the retailer is able to obtain a strictly larger share of channel profits. If the retailer gains channel power, he continues to be the profit leader. If the manufacturer becomes the dominant agent, she may become a profit leader in the channel; however, there are situations in which the retailer maintains his profit leadership even in the presence of a dominant manufacturer. In Sections 5 and 6, we provide further comparisons on the performance of the supply chain partners, including the scenario with the buyback contract, and we also illustrate the impact on consumer surplus.

In the previous sections, the problem has involved finding the optimal wholesale price w, the retailer’s gross margin rate 
                           
                              α
                           
                         and the production quantity q (or equivalently, the stocking factor z), and the selling price p was obtained from w and 
                           
                              α
                           
                         according to the transfer-pricing model. In the integrated channel, w and 
                           
                              α
                           
                         are both internal variables, therefore we need to analyze the optimal values of p and z only. Using these variables, the expected profit of the channel can be written as:

Since transfer-pricing model is irrelevant and only p and z variables are considered, Proposition 4 is consistent with the existing results in the literature that have been established for the integrated channels under iso-elastic demand with multiplicative randomness (e.g., Granot & Yin, 2005; Wang et al., 2004).

Our analysis has shown that the division of channel profits is influenced by the partners’ position of dominance. In this section, we provide comparisons on other performance measures such as the stocking factor, retail price, total channel profits, and consumer surplus. Since we seek to establish analytical results, we use the scenario of distributed pricing power under the no single-agent dominance structure (Sections 5.1 and 5.2). The numerical analysis of the no single-agent dominance structure under the scenario of buyback contract is presented in Section 6.3.

Note that the decision of whether an agent should pursue dominance is not endogenous to our models; instead, we take the dominance structure and the corresponding sequence of decisions as given, and we compare the cases of manufacturer dominance, retailer dominance, and no channel dominance. In the comparisons, we show the results analytically when tractable solutions are possible for general demand distributions; otherwise, we illustrate results with numerical examples using specific demand distributions.

Our first result shows the order relationships for the equilibrium stocking factor z, retail price p, and order quantity q under the manufacturer-dominated, retailer-dominated, and no-single-party-dominated channels.

The channel under manufacturer dominance leads to the lowest retail price. Furthermore, the order/production quantity is highest and the stocking factor is lowest when the manufacturer is the dominant agent. We provide the following intuitive explanation for this result. The manufacturer’s pricing power enables her to impose a low retail price, which also increases expected demand. At the same time, she charges a higher wholesale price (i.e.,

                         holds) and this decreases the retailer’s profit margin rate from sales. Then, given the reduced profit margin, ample demand, and high demand variance due to the low retail price, it is not in the retailer’s best interest to maintain a high stocking factor. The rank orders established in Proposition 5 are dependent on the specific demand form, as we discuss in the extensions section.

Given the more abundant supply and lower retail price, one may wonder whether the channel will obtain higher profits under the manufacturer-dominated structure compared to the retailer-dominated structure. To investigate this, we compare the channel profits in Proposition 6, where

Parts (a) and (b) of the proposition state a rather intuitive result: Both the manufacturer and the retailer earn the greatest profits when they hold the channel dominance individually, whereas their profitability is the lowest when they are the chain’s weaker agent. This finding, which suggests that the supply chain member’s profit increases when it gains more power in the channel, is consistent with the result in Shi et al. (2013). Part (c) shows that the retailer-dominated channel outperforms the manufacturer-dominated channel based on total profits. This result is somewhat surprising and can be explained as follows. First, notice the similarities between the pull and push contracts studied by Cachon (2004) and our retailer and manufacturer-dominated channels, respectively. In particular, the ordering structure and inventory risk allocation are identical in pull contract (push contract) and retailer-dominated (manufacturer-dominated) model. One main difference is that the retail price is assumed exogenous in Cachon (2004) while it is endogenous to our models. Cachon (2004) finds that a pull contract is more efficient than a push contract. Our results show that this result continues to hold in our setting, although the mechanism by which this happens is different. In Cachon (2004), the inventory in supply chain is higher under pull mode, which leads to higher channel profits than the push mode. In our case, while the retailer-dominated structure does not lead to higher inventory than the manufacturer-dominated channel, the retailer’s pricing power facilitates a higher retail price. Then, the reduced supply in the channel is more than offset by the increased revenue due to higher price and stocking factor, leading to the result in part (c). We also mention the observation from Corollaries 1 and 2: The channels under retailer and manufacturer dominance differ with respect to how demand uncertainty appears in the profit functions. Since both of the agents are faced with demand uncertainty in the retailer-dominated channel, there is more incentive to consider the benefit of the entire channel, hence this results in a better performance in this channel than the manufacturer-dominated channel.


                        Proposition 6 compares the channel profits in manufacturer-dominated and retailer-dominated structures but no analytical results are provided for the distributed pricing power scheme, which we tackle numerically. Our analysis is summarized in Example 2. It shows that the retailer-dominated structure continues to attain the best channel performance. On the other hand, results for the channels with manufacturer dominance and distributed pricing power are mixed: Lower values of price elasticity typically imply better channel performance when there is no single-agent dominance versus when there is a dominant manufacturer. More specifically, there is a threshold value of the price sensitivity parameter b below which the total channel profit is higher when pricing power is distributed to the channel members. Furthermore, instances with normally distributed demand factor show that this threshold value increases when the demand uncertainty as measured by the coefficient of variation (cv) increases. Therefore, the manufacturer-dominated channel is more likely to underperform for products with low price elasticity (where demand variance is high due to low price elasticity) and for those with high demand uncertainty. In these instances, the retailer-dominated channel consistently has the best performance and leads to most significant gains under low demand uncertainty.

It is of interest to investigate the channel efficiency compared to the integrated channel. We do this numerically. Fig. 2
                         shows that the channel profit loss is smallest when the retailer takes the dominant position, but the profit loss increases as the price sensitivity parameter gets larger. For the manufacturer-dominated channel, we observe an opposite trend, which leads to a channel performance similar to that of the retailer-dominated channel for highly elastic goods. In that range of price sensitivity, both dominance structures outperform the one that distributes the pricing power to the channel members which is partly due to double marginalization effect. As we later illustrate, this effect is alleviated with the use of buyback contract, leading to situations where the no single-agent dominance structure becomes the most profitable.

Our goal in this section is to understand how consumers are affected by the presence of a dominant agent in the channel. To this end, we utilize some measures that relate to the customer service and consumer surplus. First, we use the concept of expected fill rate by Petruzzi, Wee, and Dada (2009) which is defined as the long-run fraction of total expected demand satisfied from inventory. Formally, the fill rate

It follows from Proposition 5 that the fill rate is the highest when neither of the parties has any dominance over another. On the other hand, the manufacturer-dominated channel results in the lowest fill rate, which is a consequence of the retail price. Reduced retail price in this channel increases the expected demand; while the quantity is also high, the effect of retail price on the stocking factor outweighs that of the quantity, leading to the lowest fill rate value. From the customer’s perspective, this implies that the probability of finding the product in stock is the lowest in this channel. Note also that the integrated channel and distributed pricing power channel provide the same fill rate. (See Propositions 3 and 4.)

Second measure we consider is consumer surplus. We start with the perspective of an individual customer. Recall that the expected surplus of an individual buyer is given by

                                    a
                                 
                                 
                                    b
                                    -
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                                 
                                    -
                                    b
                                    +
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                        . Since 
                           
                              b
                              >
                              1
                           
                        , this expression is decreasing in p, which is intuitive. We have shown in Proposition 5 that the manufacturer-dominated structure leads to the lowest equilibrium retail price. Therefore, an individual consumer obtains the greater expected surplus in the channel structure with manufacturer dominance.

Next, we derive the expected surplus from the total consumer perspective by considering two possible cases according to whether a shortage occurs. As the market size is represented with 
                           
                              ∊
                           
                        , when the retailer’s order quantity q is higher than the market demand, all of the demand requests are fulfilled and the realized total consumer surplus is 
                           
                              ∊
                              
                                 
                                    a
                                 
                                 
                                    b
                                    -
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                                 
                                    -
                                    b
                                    +
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                        . This expression can also be derived directly from the demand function: Let x be a variable that measures the difference between the actual retail price p and the consumer’s willingness to pay, 
                           
                              p
                              +
                              x
                           
                        . Then, total surplus among the buyers of the product is given by

                        .

In the second case, retailer’s order quantity q is less than the market demand, and we assume the available quantity is rationed to all customers whose valuations are higher than the retail price p. Combining these two cases, the total expected consumer surplus can be written as

Under the assumption that a channel dominance structure is in place, if we focus only on a single, solely price-oriented customer, then the optimal choice for that individual customer is to have the manufacturer dominate the channel; whereas, if the total consumer surplus is the main focus, then the retailer-dominated channel provides the best outcome. The manufacturer-dominated channel is favorable to an individual customer due to the low retail price, however, total consumers do not only care about the price but they also consider the inventory fill rate. As the fill rate is the smallest under manufacturer dominance, this leads to high stock-out risk and makes this channel structure undesirable from total consumer perspective. The retailer-dominated structure achieves a better balance between retail price and inventory fill rate.

We next compare the structures under manufacturer and retailer dominance with the case of distributed pricing power. Our analysis is summarized in Example 3. In part (a), we assume a uniformly distributed demand factor and show that a threshold value of the price sensitivity parameter exists which determines whether the manufacturer-dominated channel or the channel with distributed pricing power leads to higher consumer surplus. Results show that manufacturer dominance arises as the optimal outcome for total customers when the price sensitivity parameter is sufficiently large. Some examples of price elastic products include automobiles, luxury items, music products, furniture, and professional services. In part (b), we represent the random demand factor with normal distribution. We see that the results in part (a) extend to this scenario, and the retailer-dominated channel structure remains the best choice in terms of total consumer surplus. Moreover, consumer surplus exhibits the same pattern as in the channel performance case: Surplus is higher when the channel has a dominant agent in the cases of low demand uncertainty and high price sensitivity. In other words, presence of a dominant agent not only improves the total channel profits but it also generates higher consumer surplus for such products. We note however that the results concerning the channel profit depend on the chosen demand curve, as we illustrate in the extension with linear demand.

                                        shows the results for varying coefficient of variation values.

To complete the analysis with respect to total consumer surplus, we numerically compare the consumer surplus achieved under the three dominance structures with respect to the integrated channel which can be shown to provide the upper bound on the total surplus. Fig. 4
                         illustrates the results. Consistent with the channel efficiency behavior, when the price sensitivity is low, the retailer-dominated channel leads to the smallest loss of consumer surplus hence results in the best outcome, and consumers enjoy greater total surplus when the pricing power is balanced as opposed to the manufacturer’s dominance. At the higher values of price elasticity, retailer and manufacturer dominated channels result in almost equal total surplus, and overall, consumers benefit from the presence of a power agent independent of who dominates the channel. This observation appears robust with respect to the choice of demand form.

We extend our analysis to generate further managerial insights and test the sensitivity of main results to model assumptions. We first modify the base model to consider settings where shortage cost, holding cost, and/or salvage value apply in case of a mismatch between demand and supply (Section 6.1). In Section 6.2, we study linear demand curve with multiplicative randomness. Finally, in Section 6.3, we present insights on the impact of inventory risk sharing by studying the no single-agent dominance case under buyback option.

We assume that unit shortage cost, s, is incurred in case of insufficient supply. We let

                        , the holding cost parameter can be viewed as the salvage value of the product. We make the assumption that the shortage cost is less than the production cost, i.e., 
                           
                              s
                              ⩽
                              c
                           
                        , because, otherwise, the production quantity would be as large as possible for given retail price, or the price would be set as high as possible to eliminate demand.

These results establish the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium for the manufacturer and retailer-dominated channels. When there is no single-agent dominance, we are not able to obtain such equilibrium results in the Nash game as we cannot obtain analytical structure for the stocking factor variable. (In the proof of Proposition 8, we give the conditions that

In the following, we discuss the main observations from the numerical study. We focus on the effects of parameters

                        : As the per-unit holding cost increases, order quantity decreases and retail price increases across all models. Intuitively, higher holding cost discourages the agents from keeping high inventory levels. At those lower quantities, agents increase the retail price so as to reduce demand and hence obtain a better match with the available supply. Increasing holding cost makes an adverse effect on both the supply chain performance and consumer surplus. In the supply chain, a lower inventory level is maintained to save carrying costs, but at the same time a higher retail price is selected to decrease demand. Revenue loss due to reduced demand outweighs the benefits of lower holding costs, therefore the supply chain becomes worse off at high

                         values. From consumers’ perspective, negative effects are twofold. Higher retail price increases the cost to buyers and lower inventory or stocking factor level increases the probability that customers encounter a stock out. Taken together, they lead to reduced consumer surplus.


                        Effect of s: As the per-unit shortage cost increases, order quantity typically increases. This can be explained by the channel members’ desire to avoid costly stock-out situations. On the other hand, the retail price decreases in the shortage cost when the manufacturer or the retailer has dominance. The agents tend to decrease the retail price as it facilities demand stimulation which helps the supply chain clear the increased inventory levels. When there is no single-agent dominance, no systematic pattern is visible for the retail price as a result of two effects. On one hand, lower prices can help the channel match demand and supply; on the other hand, agents may tend to increase the prices as a means to compensate for higher stock-out costs. From the perspective of entire channel and consumers, the effect of shortage cost acts in opposite directions: While supply chain performance worsens, consumers generally benefit from increased shortage costs. Essentially, consumers take advantage of more abundant supply that is available at lower prices, but the supply chain suffers from supply–demand mismatch which is more intense under high shortage costs.


                        Effect of b: As the price sensitivity of customers increases, channel members tend to set lower retail prices and make lower quantities available for sale. The resulting impact is detrimental to the supply chain performance and consumer surplus, and it is mainly driven by increased stock-out risks due to insufficient supply. Reduced retail prices induce high demand, but lower inventory levels cannot match such high demand, leading to lower profit generation in the channel and decrease in consumer surplus.


                        Comparison with the base-model results: Key results related with the comparison of different power structures (Propositions 5–7) continue to hold when holding/shortage cost and salvage value are applicable. Holding/shortage cost and salvage value affect the dominant agent’s profit share in different ways. As the shortage cost increases, the dominant agent’s profit share in the channel improves. This holds true for both manufacturer and retailer dominated channels and occurs because the agent bearing the shortage cost increases the production/order quantity which intensifies the gains enjoyed by the dominant agent in the channel. Similar pattern is observed for the dominant manufacturer with respect to the effect of holding cost parameter. As 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                                 
                                    h
                                 
                              
                           
                         increases, the order quantity decreases but the increase in retail price generates larger net gains in the dominant manufacturer’s profit share which is also in part due to reduced demand variance at high retail price. Interestingly, the effect of holding cost parameter is reversed when the retailer has channel dominance, that is, the dominant retailer’s profit share decreases while the manufacturer’s share increases. At high holding costs, the manufacturer is conservative in capacity level decision, which in turn hurts the retailer and weakens the gains enabled by his powerful position in the channel. The effect of salvage value works in an opposite direction to the holding cost: Dominant retailer’s profit share improves while the dominant manufacturer’s profit share worsens as the salvage value increases. Given the behavior with respect to the effect of holding cost, this observation is expected as the two parameters apply in opposite situations regarding the leftover inventory.

This comparison analysis also sheds light on how much (inventory) risk shifting is affecting the performance of the powerful agent and the supply chain.

                        ), we make the following observations, which are parallel to the those in the preceding discussion and can be explained in a similar way. When positive holding cost is introduced, power manufacturer becomes better off by securing a greater share of the channel profit, while the weaker retailer becomes worse off. At the same time, the supply chain performance deteriorates under manufacturer dominance. In contrast, in the retailer-dominated channel, the retailer becomes worse off but the manufacturer becomes better off. (The supply chain performance demonstrated mixed results at different b values.) Finally, we note that the observation in Corollary 1 is possible in this extended model, that is, the retailer may earn a higher profit share than a more powerful manufacturer in the channel and we have observed that this is more likely to happen at low shortage cost values and high salvage values.

We investigate whether our main qualitative insights are affected by the specific form of demand curve. For this purpose, we modify the iso-elastic demand curve of the base model into linear form, that is, 
                           
                              D
                              (
                              p
                              ,
                              ∊
                              )
                              =
                              (
                              a
                              -
                              bp
                              )
                              ∊
                           
                        , where a represents the market potential and b is the price sensitivity parameter. The multiplicative linear demand form is also widely used in the operations literature. To rule out the trivial cases, we assume that 
                           
                              a
                              -
                              bc
                              >
                              0
                           
                        . We also assume that the random factor 
                           
                              ∊
                           
                         satisfies IGFR property, similar to the base model.

Underlying the demand model is a market composed of heterogenous customers whose willingness to pay for the product,

Although we are able to characterize the equilibrium outcomes, it is generally hard to derive analytical results for the comparison of three channel power structures. Therefore, we conduct numerical studies and report some representative examples (Table 3
                        ). To understand the demand curve effect, we compare the observations from these examples with the results under the iso-elastic demand case (Propositions 5–7).

The comparison results for the stocking factor and price remain the same under linear demand but the quantity becomes the lowest in the manufacturer-dominated channel. This change arises due to the differences in the demand models with respect to the price elasticity of expected demand. Let

                         continues to be the lowest under the linear demand model, it does not stimulate as large an increase in expected demand as in the iso-elastic case due to low elasticity of demand at lower retail prices, and consequently order quantity need not be as high. Overall, these lead to poor performance for the manufacturer-dominated channel. Recall that in the base model the retailer-dominated channel outperforms other channel structures in terms of total profit and also leads to highest expected consumer surplus. When demand is linear, consumers continue to enjoy the greatest surplus in the retailer-dominated channel, but total channel profit becomes the highest in the channel with distributed pricing power, albeit with a small margin over the retailer-dominated channel. Compared to the manufacturer-dominated channel, these two structures are able to attain higher order quantities at higher retail prices. As such, they achieve a better balance between system revenue and production cost, generating profit advantages. Similar to the iso-elastic case, both the retailer and the manufacturer earn greater profits in channels where they hold dominance.

                        . The rank orders for the stocking factor, price, and quantity are identical to those under linear multiplicative demand, so these decisions are affected by the demand curve but not the randomness mode. On the other hand, we have observed that the comparison results for the total profit and consumer surplus are sensitive to both of these demand components. In the linear additive demand case, the highest consumer surplus is obtained under manufacturer dominance; and the retailer-dominated channel has the best performance at small values of price sensitivity, b, whereas the distributed pricing power case generates the highest profit when b is large, both of which outperform the manufacturer-dominated channel. Overall, the particular demand form makes a significant effect on comparison of the different power schemes in supply chains, therefore it is essential to develop the best demand model by carefully evaluating the market characteristics.

The channel structure with no single-agent dominance is addressed in two scenarios according to whether inventory risk is shared among the agents. The models and equilibrium results for this case are provided in Section 4.3 where the buyback contract is used as a mechanism to facilitate inventory sharing. In this section, we investigate the impact of inventory sharing on the comparison of different power structures.

We draw our insights from numerical analysis and illustrate some representative examples in Fig. 5
                        . In these instances, we set 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                         to reflect equal inventory-risk sharing and vary the price elasticity and demand variance (as measured by the coefficient of variation). First, we observe that the performance of the channel under no single-agent dominance improves with the buyback contract. For example, while the retailer-dominated channel has yielded the best performance in Section 5.1, the channel with no single-agent dominance outperforms the retailer-dominated channel when the price sensitivity parameter is sufficiently high. The structure with no single-agent dominance has a better channel performance than the manufacturer-dominated structure as well, except when demand variance and price sensitivity are both small. In all of the instances, the retailer-dominated channel generates higher profits than the manufacturer-dominated channel, which is consistent with our finding in Corollary 2. The improved performance of the no single-agent dominance structure arises as the channel benefits from better alignment of members’ objectives due to shared inventory risk, and additional numerical examples have shown that it becomes more significant as k increases. Furthermore, the no single-agent dominance structure is more likely to perform better than the other two structures when the demand variance is large. This is intuitive, as the gains due to inventory sharing becomes more pronounced when demand is more variable. On the other hand, we find that the consumer surplus is typically the lowest in the channel with no single-agent dominance, hence the gains in channel profits under no single-agent dominance is obtained to the expense of the consumer surplus. We have conducted additional numerical tests by using a linear demand curve with multiplicative randomness. Similar to the observations in iso-elastic demand case, the no single-agent dominance structure continued to have the best channel performance under equal inventory-risk sharing, followed by the retailer-dominated channel, and it led to the lowest consumer surplus.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Supply chain management has emerged as an important business trend in recent years and is now recognized to be an essential strategy for companies to better serve their customers and achieve success. Potential conflict between the channel’s independent and self-interested parties is often identified as one challenge in attaining effective management of supply chains. In addition to such misalignment of objectives, it is also possible that asymmetrical power relationships exist among the agents, imposing certain implications for channel parties’ decision-making, for example, in determining the prices and timing of the production/inventory order commitments. It is therefore important to have an in-depth look at the different power structures in supply chains and their effects on the chain members and customers.

We study three different types of power schemes in a single retailer, single manufacturer supply chain where the retailer sells a product with random and price-sensitive demand. In the first two models, we assume that a single agent, either manufacturer or retailer, has higher power than the other agent; but in the third model, no sole-agent dominance is present. Motivated by some observations in practice, we assume that holding the dominant position in the channel gives the associated party the right to determine the weaker agent’s pricing decision as well as the timing of production/order quantity commitment. Specifically, the dominant manufacturer determines the retail price and enforces the retailer to commit to an order quantity in advance of selling season, whereas the dominant retailer sets the manufacturer’s wholesale price through the transfer price mechanism and is able to implement order postponement. As such, the presence or absence of order postponement is an inventory risk-shifting mechanism utilized by the powerful party in the channel. The third model is concerned with the case when neither party has channel dominance. In addition, we study the integrated channel to obtain the overall benchmark performance.

Our analysis is based on game theory models and reveals several interesting results. In the base model with iso-elastic multiplicative demand form, we find that the equilibrium retail price is the lowest and the production quantity is the largest in the manufacturer-dominated channel; therefore, an individual buyer can obtain the highest expected surplus when the manufacturer is dominant. But it does not mean that the channel performance under this power structure is the best; in fact, it is the retailer-dominated structure which yields the highest channel profit. Although the system capacity is largest under the manufacturer’s dominance, the stock-out risk is also high because low retail price stimulates high customer demand, which leads to lower inventory fill rate. The retailer-dominated channel balances this tradeoff best and thus it is also the most preferable structure from the perspective of total consumer surplus. These observations imply that the retailer would benefit more by gaining channel dominance. This is also evident in our result which shows that under certain conditions of the demand distribution parameters, the retailer is able to capture a greater share of the total channel profit even under manufacturer dominance. In an extended analysis, we consider linear multiplicative demand and inventory risk sharing, and we find that some of these comparison results are sensitive to the chosen demand function. On the other hand, results are robust when holding/shortage costs and salvage value are incorporated into the main problem setting.

There are some limitations of our work which lead to several directions for future research. First, we assume a one-manufacturer/one-retailer supply chain setting. This assumption filters out market competition and helps us focus on the effect of power differential within a channel. It also facilitates derivation of analytical results. Nevertheless, introducing competition via consideration of multiple agents and/or additional echelons is a meaningful research extension. Such an extended study would however need major modeling changes, for example, in the form of demand function and game designs, which would require significant further analysis and is therefore worthy of pursuing as a separate research project. Second, we assume common knowledge of all problem parameters but in practice there may be information asymmetry between the channel partners. Although the structures with a sole-agent dominance may mitigate the information asymmetry by exercising various tools such as demand forecast sharing, this case can still provide interesting insights as to whether the consumers benefit from such schemes. Other simplifying assumptions in our analysis include risk-neutral decision makers and linear production costs. In the presence of power asymmetry, alternative risk attitudes may be of interest. For example, the dominant agent may demonstrate risk-seeking behavior while the agent in a weaker position may demonstrate risk-averse behavior. Overall, this would exacerbate the misalignment of objectives in the channel and thus would decrease the efficiency of the supply chain. On the other hand, since the effect is expected to be seen in all models, we speculate that the qualitative results obtained by the comparison of the different power structures will still hold under the mentioned alternative risk behaviors of the agents. The linear cost structure can be generalized into quadratic or piecewise linear forms to address a wider variety of industry settings. While such generalizations will surely change the structural results, main qualitative insights can be expected to extend to those settings.
