                  Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is an adaptive decomposition method, which is widely used in time-frequency analysis. As a bidimensional extension of EMD, bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) presents many useful applications in image processing and computer vision. In this paper, we define the mean points in BEMD ‘sifting’ processing as centroid point of neighbour extrema points in Delaunay triangulation and propose using mean approximation instead of envelope mean in ‘sifting’. The proposed method improves the decomposition result and reduces average computation time of ‘sifting’ processing. Furthermore, a BEMD-based image fusion approach is presented in this paper. Experimental results show our method can achieve more orthogonal and physical meaningful components and more effective result in image fusion application.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a data driven processing algorithm, which employs no predetermined filter. EMD decomposes signal based on the local characteristics scale and presents time-frequency-energy distribution of data, which is suited to analyse nonlinear and nonstationary signals [1]. Due to the data-driven property, EMD has been found many successful applications in variant areas, such as biological, medical sciences, astronomy, engineering and others [12]. Recently, EMD based data-driven sparse representation over a highly redundant time-frequency dictionary method [3] has been proposed and used to detect intrinsic pattern or physical information from data, where traditional methods decompose signal to artificial harmonics components.

For two-dimensional signals, bidimensional EMD (BEMD) is developed as a two-dimensional version of EMD. There are many applications of EMD/BEMD reported in the literatures for image analysis and processing. Some different approaches to extend EMD to two-dimensional are reported [2,12,16]. EMD/BEMD is widely used in image compression [6], multi-media coding [23], face preprocessing [24], image fusion [26], etc.

Ensemble EMD (EEMD) [15], which was firstly proposed by Wu et al. to reduce the mode mixing problem, has been extended to multi-dimensional ensemble EMD (M-EEMD) [16]. Bidimensional statistical empirical mode decomposition (BSEMD) [28] termed a smoothing procedure instead of 2D interpolation by constructing envelopes coupling with a new extrema identification method. Dragomiretskiy et al. [18,19] created an entirely non-recursive 2D variational mode decomposition (VMD) model, where the modes are detected concurrently. VMD decomposed an image into a given number of modes such that each individual mode has limited bandwidth [19].

‘Sifting’ process is the main procedure in EMD/BEMD, which generates the upper and lower envelope by interpolation method. In 2D condition, envelope generation methods require high computation time with interpolation approaches, such as radial basis function [4] or thin-plate splines [6]. Some other envelope generation algorithms are also proposed, such as finite elements based on Delaunay triangulation [13], spatial domain order-statistics filter [11], oblique-extrema-based approach [22]. These approaches have improved computation speed and decomposition result of EMD/BEMD, but more efficient and effective methods still need further research.

In this paper, we proposed an effective and efficient BEMD method. The proposed method utilizes a mean approximation based generation approach. By defining the mean points in two dimensions, we build a mean approximation instead of envelope mean by Delaunay triangular mesh. Our experiments show that the proposed method decomposes images to more orthogonal components and consumes less computational time. In the following, we will introduce the basic concept and algorithm of BEMD in Section 2. Section 3 describes the proposed mean approximation based BEMD method. Some decomposition result and discussion are shown in Section 4. Further, a fusion image method based on the proposed mean approximation based BEMD method is described in Section 5. Section 6 gives a conclusion of this paper.

Nonstationary signals have statistical properties that vary as a function of time and should be analysed differently from stationary data. Rather than assuming that a signal is a linear combination of predetermined basis functions, in EMD, the data is instead thought of as a superposition of fast oscillations onto slow oscillations [14]. EMD is designed to decompose those oscillations which intrinsically present in the signal.

EMD decomposes signal into components called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) satisfying the following two conditions [1]: (a) The numbers of extrema and zero-crossings must be either equal or differ at most by one; (b) At any point, the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope by the local minima is zero.

Huang [1] also proposed an algorithm called ‘sifting’ to extract IMFs

The EMD is originally developed for one-dimensional (1D) data. Nunes [4] firstly extended it to two-dimensional BEMD, and decomposed images to bidimensional IMFs (BIMFs). The Bidimensional EMD (BEMD) process is conceptually the same as the one dimension EMD. The main process of the BEMD can be described as:


                     Step 1 Find the location of local extrema (both maxima and minima) of the image 
                        I
                        (
                        i
                        ,
                        j
                        )
                     ;


                     Step 2 Generate envelopes by maximum points (respectively, minima points) using 2D interpolation methods. Compute the local mean m as the average of upper and lower envelope;


                     Step 3 Subtract the mean from the image to obtain a proto-BIMF 
                        r
                        =
                        I
                        −
                        m
                      and judge whether r is a BIMF. If it is, go to Step 4. Otherwise, repeat Step 1 and Step 2 using the proto-BIMF r as input, until the latest proto-BIMF turns to be a BIMF;

Huang proposed the Cauchy standard deviation (SD) criterion to judge a BIMF in his original paper [1], for the two-dimensional case, the SD criterion is:

                              r

                      represents the lowest frequency of I. The principle of BEMD is to extract variations from the data by separating the fluctuation from the mean [10].

In our previous work [20], to reduce the overshooting problem of cubic interpolation in one dimensional EMD, we proposed using mean points to build the extrema mean approximation instead of building average of upper and lower envelope. For two-dimensional signal images, mean approximation is built with careful mean point definition in this paper and we further discuss the mean approximation generating method for two-dimensional in this section.

The first step in ‘sifting’ is to find the local extrema points in image. Following the method in [11], neighbour location method is used to detect the local maxima or minima points. A point 
                        u
                        (
                        i
                        ,
                        j
                        )
                      is considered as a local maximum (or local minimum) if its value is strictly larger (or lower) than the value of u at the nearest 8-neighbours of points 
                        (
                        i
                        ,
                        j
                        )
                      
                     [11].

In previous BEMD methods, RBF based [5] or Delaunay based method [7] etc. is used to build the upper and lower envelopes from the maximum and minimum points. These methods, which first generate upper and lower envelopes and then compute the mean of these envelopes, can be denoted as ‘envelope mean’ methods. Different from these ‘envelope mean’ methods, we propose a ‘mean approximation’ method in this section.

In two-dimensional, mean point is defined as a centroid of the triangle which triangle vertices are extrema points built by Delaunay triangular mesh in our discussion.

In our method, the all extrema points (maximum or minimum) treated as the same. A point 
                           u
                           ∈

                         is called extrema point if it is either maximum point or minimum point. As illustrated in Fig. 1
                        , we divide the spatial domain into triangular meshes which vertices are the extrema points. This can be built by Delaunay triangulation method [7,13]. In such a triangular mesh, any triangle does not overlap with any other triangles in the mesh and a vertex of a triangle is not in the interior of an edge of another triangle in the mesh [13]. As in [13], symmetric extension is employed to mirror the image boundary parts to extended parts. For more discussion about the triangular mesh by Delaunay method, one can find it in [7,9,13].

Our method firstly generates the mean points by Delaunay triangulation and then uses these mean points as new triangular mesh vertices to generate the 2D approximation. As illustrated in Fig. 2

                         is a centroid of the triangle whose vertices are extrema points. In our definition, mean points represent the location information of extrema points (centroid) and the amplitude information of extrema points (centroid or distance based weigh). In the next step, we build triangular meshes with vertices being the mean points by Delaunay method, and then cubic interpolation on triangles.

The method of generating a mean approximation in two-dimensional signal (2-Dimensional Mean Approximation Empirical Mode Decomposition, denoted as 2D-MAEMD) can be described as:

                         is considered as a local maximum (or local minimum) if its value is strictly larger (or lower) than the value of u at the nearest 8-neighbours of points

                        Step 2-2 Compute the mean points as the centroid of triangles in Delaunay triangular mesh. These mean points form a new mean points set

                         by equation (6) to (10).


                        Step 2-3 Generate the 2D approximation by connecting mean points set

                         using surface interpolation. Delaunay triangulation and then cubic interpolation on triangles are used in our work.


                        Step 3 Subtract the mean from the image to obtain a proto-BIMF 
                           r
                           =
                           I
                           −
                           m
                         and judge whether r is a BIMF. If it is, go to Step 4. Otherwise, repeat Step 1 and Step 2 using the proto-BIMF r as input, until the latest proto-BIMF turns to be a BIMF.


                        Step 4 Input the proto-BIMF r to the loop from Step 1 to Step 3 to get the next remained BIMF until it cannot be decomposed further.

In 2D-MAEMD method, the mean approximation is computed directly from mean points of extrema points instead of the average of upper and lower envelope. Our method reduces the computation complex by generating the 2D approximation at one time instead of two times which generates upper and lower envelopes. To simplify the discussion, we just consider the computation time of building envelopes mean and mean approximation in the following.

In this section, we examine the image decomposition result effectiveness of proposed 2D-MAEMD. The BIMFs decomposed from the proposed method are compared with the results produced by other two BEMD-based methods (Damerval method [7] and Nunes method [5]), a multi-dimension based method fasted multi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (FM-EEMD) [16,17] and an optimal based method Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) [18,19]. VMD method used an optimal method to decompose the frequency components, we followed the parameters suggested in [19].

The synthetic image decomposition results by 2D-MAEMD and compared methods are shown in Figs. 4–9
                     
                     
                     . As the figures showed, the proposed methods present better result than other methods. Lower frequency components (BIMF2 and residue) are not correctly decomposed by FM-EEMD and VMD method. VMD used an optimal method to decompose the frequency components, in this case, component

                      is decomposed as BIMF1. Other more suitable parameters may improve the VMD decomposition result. FM-EEMD method is a noise ensemble method, the decomposed noisy BIMF1 influences the last residue component, but the BIMF2 and BIMF3 by FM-EEMD are good approximations for

                     . In synthetic image case, we use BIMF2, BIMF3 and residue by FM-EEMD to compare with other methods. Additionally, for this synthetic texture image, decomposition results that are more similar to the original components are better. The proposed method can achieve better approximate components than compared methods.
                     
                     
                  


                     Table 1
                      shows the performance of synthetic image decomposition comparison. The computation time shown in Table 1 is in seconds. In synthetic image case, the orthogonality index of our methods is smaller than other compared methods, but the IEC measurement is larger than others. This is because the BIMFs by proposed method are more similar to original components. In fact, the orthogonality index of original components is

The MSE between BIMFs and original signal components are presented in Fig. 10
                     . Our methods achieve lower values of MSE and are more similar results to original synthetic components than other methods. The BIMF2 and BIMF3 of VMD are added as one component to compute the MSE with

In BEMD processing, a total CPU time of EMD is dependent on the number of extrema points, the size of image, the amount times of ‘sifting’ decomposed and other system set-up expenses. In this case, as showed in Table 1, the sifting times of compared BEMD methods and our methods are the same, total time and average ‘sifting’ process computation of 2D-MAEMD are faster than other two BEMD-based methods. And the proposed method is much faster than the fast multi-EEMD [17] and optimal based VMD [18,19].

The experiment in this section further examines the proposed and compared methods' performance on standard test images ‘Lena’ and ‘Elaine’. The original images are shown in Fig. 11
                     . The ‘Lena’ image decomposition results are shown in Figs. 12–17
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     . The ‘Elaine’ image decomposition results are shown in Figs. 18–23
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     , respectively. Table 2
                      and Table 3
                      show the decomposition performance. The computation time showed in Table 2 and Table 3 is in seconds.

We can see that the proposed approaches indeed give comparable results than other BEMD methods for orthogonality index and computation time. In mean points' detection processing, the values of detected mean points are averaged or weight averaged of maximum and minimum points. The value and position of mean points are decided by neighbour maximum and minimum points and represent more ‘local’ information than the average of upper and lower envelop. This may help the proto-BIMF represent more ‘local’ frequency and improve the decomposition result. At the same time, though the amount ‘sifting’ times of 2D-MAEMD is larger than other two BEMD-based methods, the total consuming time is still smaller than those two. The average ‘sifting’ process consuming time of 2D-MAEMD is much faster than other two BEMD-based methods and saves about 
                        40
                        %
                      of consuming time in each ‘sifting’ processing. Multi-EEMD and VMD consumed more time, but we can find the IEC of multi-EEMD give better result.


                     Table 4
                      lists the computation time of average ‘sifting’ processing of ‘Lena’ image in different sizes by the BEMD-based methods. With the size of image growing, the performance of the proposed methods become more faster than other two BEMD-based methods. When the size of the testing image growing, the number of pixels in a image with size 
                        M
                        ×
                        N
                      is growing faster than the number of extrema points P in the image. So the increasing of consuming time of envelop generation (
                        
                           
                              T

                     ) is larger than the increasing of consuming time of mean points generation (
                        
                           
                              T
                           
                           
                              
                                 mean
                              
                              
                              
                                 points
                              
                           
                        
                     ). At the same time, as we have discussed before, the number of extrema points P is also reduced approximately by half though the BIMF decomposition and further reduces the computation time [21,17]. According to Table 4, computation time of average ‘sifting’ processing of proposed methods only took about 
                        52
                        %
                        ∼
                        60
                        %
                      of compared methods.

In the last decades, image fusion has became an important and useful technique for image analysis and computer vision. Image fusion is to combine information from two or more images which present the same scene with difference sharp in different parts and present a clearer image than any original images [25]. As real world images are typically nonlinear and nonstationary, an adaptive approach will be more effective for image fusion [27]. Based on the proposed 2D-MAEMD, we further propose an image fusion scheme with BIMF components and a weight fusion rule, which further presents the effectiveness of the proposed 2D-MAEMD method.

Based on the BEMD method, our fusion algorithm firstly uses 2D-MAEMD to decompose the input images to BIMFs components. Secondly, a standard deviation based fusion rule is used to fuse the BIMFs components. Lastly, the fusion image is obtained with simple composite.

Suppose there are two input images A and B with size 
                           M
                           ×
                           N
                        . The fused image denotes as F. Images A and B are decomposed into a series of BIMFs and residual by use of 2D-MAEMD method as:

The same level BIMFs from images A and B are fused with their corresponding components by a weighting factor in our method. If the difference between the BIMFs in the same level is negligible (
                           κ
                           =
                           0.01
                        ), an average weigh factor (1/2) is used to fuse the BIMFs; otherwise, a standard deviation weigh factor is used to fuse the BIMFs. Standard deviation describes the distributing of point value in the image/BIMFs, bigger standard deviation denotes a clearer image [25,26].

The fused component is achieved at the corresponding level BIMF by [25]:

In this section, simulation result of the proposed 2D-MAEMD based fusion method are described. Experiments are performed on two groups of images and compare the proposed fusion method with other fusion methods such as wavelet-based scheme and PCA-based scheme [31].

For wavelet-based scheme, the discrete stationary wavelet transform (DSWT) is first employed to input images to obtain their multi-scale components. And then the same level corresponding wavelet coefficients from different input images are fused by maximum rule and then composed back to the fused image using inverse wavelet transform [31]. The ‘sym2’ wavelet, together with a decomposition level of 2, is used in the DSWT-based methods. For PCA-based scheme, the input images are arranged in two column vectors and their means are subtracted. The eigenvector and eigenvalues of these vectors are computed and the eigenvectors corresponding to larger eigenvalue obtained to compute the normalized components [31].

Two performances measurements are used for comparison. One is quality metric

The two groups of multi-focus images are: ‘clock’ and ‘Octec2’. The original multi-focus images are shown in Fig. 24
                        . Fusion images by the proposed methods and compared methods are shown in Fig. 25
                         and Fig. 26
                        . Proposed 2D-MAEMD based schemes present clearer result than compared methods. Table 5
                         shows the performance of fusion result. Our methods improved the fusion result compared with wavelet-based scheme [31], PCA-based scheme [31]. The adaptive decomposition BEMD methods present more effective than wavelet-based scheme in image fusion.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper proposes a new ‘mean approximation’ approach for BEMD, which uses mean points approximation instead of using average of upper and lower envelopes, and presents its effective decomposition result. For envelope generation, the proposed 2D-MAEMD method uses the centroid point of neighbour extrema points to generate mean points and directly generate mean approximation replacing upper and lower envelopes. The decomposition results show that the performance of proposed methods are better than other BEMD methods, multi-EEMD and VMD. The 2D-MAEMD method reduces the time complexity of ‘sifting’ processing in BEMD. This paper also presents a BEMD-based image fusion scheme via proposed 2D-MAEMD method, which further compare and confirm the effectiveness of proposed 2D-MAEMD method.
