                  Mahalanobis distance may be used as a measure of the disparity between an individual’s profile of scores and the average profile of a population of controls. The degree to which the individual’s profile is unusual can then be equated to the proportion of the population who would have a larger Mahalanobis distance than the individual. Several estimators of this proportion are examined. These include plug-in maximum likelihood estimators, medians, the posterior mean from a Bayesian probability matching prior, an estimator derived from a Taylor expansion, and two forms of polynomial approximation, one based on Bernstein polynomial and one on a quadrature method. Simulations show that some estimators, including the commonly-used plug-in maximum likelihood estimators, can have substantial bias for small or moderate sample sizes. The polynomial approximations yield estimators that have low bias, with the quadrature method marginally to be preferred over Bernstein polynomials. However, the polynomial estimators sometimes yield infeasible estimates that are outside the 0–1 range. While none of the estimators are perfectly unbiased, the median estimators match their definition; in simulations their estimates of the proportion have a median error close to zero. The standard median estimator can give unrealistically small estimates (including 0) and an adjustment is proposed that ensures estimates are always credible. This latter estimator has much to recommend it when unbiasedness is not of paramount importance, while the quadrature method is recommended when bias is the dominant issue.

The Mahalanobis distance is frequently used in multivariate analysis as a statistical measure of distance between a vector of scores for a single case and the mean vector of the underlying population or a sample of data. It was developed by Mahalanobis (1936) as a distance measure that incorporates the correlation between different scores. See also DasGupta (1993).

We were initially motivated by the need to estimate the abnormality of a single patient’s profile in neuropsychology. The problem arises, for example, when psychologists need to assess how a patient with some brain disorder or a head injury is different from the general population or some particular subpopulation. This assessment is usually based on the patient’s scores in a set of tests that measure different traits or abilities. The abnormality of the case’s profile of scores can then be expressed in terms of the Mahalanobis index between this profile and the mean of the normative population or normative sample. The degree of abnormality is measured by

                     -value from the Hotelling’s

                      test provides an obvious point estimator of 
                        P
                     , but it is biased. Indeed, the problem of finding an unbiased estimator of 
                        P
                      has not been resolved.

Here we consider a number of obvious estimators of 
                        P
                      and propose some new, less obvious estimators. The bias and mean square error of all the estimators are compared in extensive simulations. No estimator is uniformly better than all alternatives, but a small selection of the estimators is clearly to be preferred. As well as bias and mean square error, other criteria and desirable qualities in an estimator are also considered. In this paper, no distributional assumptions are made about the source of

                     , other than when testing whether

The need to estimate the value of 
                        P
                      for Mahalanobis distances does not only arise in psychology. In the literature, the commonly used estimates of 
                        P
                      are the 
                        p
                     -value computed from the chi-square distribution of the sample Mahalanobis index, or the 
                        p
                     -value from the central 
                        F
                      distribution associated with Hotelling’s 
                        
                           
                              T
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      test. For example, in remote sensing image analysis, Foody (2006) was interested in measuring the closeness of an image pixel to a single class centroid. For that, he used the Mahalanobis distance and converted the calculated Mahalanobis distance, of a particular image pixel from a specified class centroid, to its associated 
                        p
                     -value from the chi-square distribution. He then interpreted the 
                        p
                     -value as the probability of obtaining a Mahalanobis distance as extreme as that observed for a particular pixel with respect to a specified class, thus effectively equating the 
                        p
                     -value to 
                        P
                     .

In environmental and health science, Liu and Weng (2012) used Mahalanobis distance in public health studies to enhance the resolution of satellite imagery. They conducted a spatial–temporal analysis of West Nile Virus outbreak in Los Angeles in 2007 using sensing variables and infective mosquito surveillance records. Mahalanobis distance was used to identify and map the risk areas where habitat was suitable for infective mosquitoes. Liu and Weng (2012) calculated the distance between a vector of environmental variables and the mean vector of environmental factors at the closest locations of mosquito infections. Locations with smaller values of Mahalanobis distances indicated a more favorable habitat for the mosquitoes and hence an area of higher risk. They assumed that Mahalanobis distance follows a chi-square distribution, from which 
                        P
                      was calculated for each map pixel. Pixels with 
                        P
                      between 0.6 and 0.9 (0.9 and 1.0) were considered moderate risk (high risk) areas and then a risk map was produced.

In analytical chemistry, Shah and Gemperline (1990) were interested in analyzing the near-infrared reflectance spectra of raw materials. They used Mahalanobis distance as a classification technique for pattern recognition to classify new samples by comparing them to measurements of predetermined classes. Each sample was classified according to the 
                        p
                     -value associated with its Mahalanobis distance from the class centroids. Shah and Gemperline (1990) needed to estimate the 
                        p
                     -value for each new sample and used the chi-square distribution to estimate these probabilities. They considered samples with probability levels between (0–0.01), (0.01–0.05) or (0.05–1.0) to be nonmembers, outliers or members, respectively.

A sample Mahalanobis distance has an exact 
                        F
                      distribution. Hence, unsurprisingly, the 
                        F
                      distribution has also been frequently used to quantify the rarity/commonness of a Mahalanobis distance. For example, Lu et al. (2005) used the two groups Hotelling’s

                      test for detecting differential expressions in genetic microarrays. They conducted a microarray experiment in which samples from a disease group and from a normal group were obtained. They based their test for gene differential expression on the scaled 
                        F
                      distribution of the Hotelling’s

However, some methodological researches in causal inference argue that Mahalanobis distances do not work very well when the dimension,

                        P

                        P
                     . We propose some alternative estimators of

                      and compare them in terms of their bias and root mean square error in the simulation study. Some of the proposed estimates have much lower biases than the estimators derived from the 
                        F
                      and chi-square distributions.

Three of the alternative point estimators of 
                        P
                      are based on its confidence intervals. The first uses the frequentist median of the non-centrality parameter, and is denoted by

                     . The second proposed estimator uses the Bayesian median of the non-centrality parameter or its frequentist median, whichever is greater. We call it the modified median estimator and denote it by

The paper is organized as follows. In Section  2, we briefly discuss the two frequently used point estimators of 
                        P
                     . The new twelve proposed point estimators of 
                        P
                      are detailed in Section  3. All the fourteen point estimators are then compared in Section  4, where we present and discuss the results of the simulation study. In Section  5, we examine the behavior of each estimator at different observed values of the Mahalanobis index. We also briefly consider the median error of the estimators (rather than average error) and mean absolute error. Concluding comments are given in Section  6.

We aim to derive an unbiased estimate of

                      is the proportion of the population that has a profile more extreme than the case. A minimum variance unbiased estimator of

                      is much harder.

Thus when a patient’s estimated Mahalanobis index is 0.4, then 0.51% is the estimate of the proportion of the normal population with a smaller true Mahalanobis index than the case. However, if 0.4 were the true Mahalanobis distance of the case, then the actual proportion of the normal population with a smaller Mahalanobis distance than the case is calculated at 1.75% (

                            confidence intervals if the Bayesian intervals are based on uninformative prior distributions. Indeed, there has been substantial interest in probability matching priors  (Datta and Mukerjee, 2004), which are designed to give credible intervals that match confidence intervals. To construct our next estimate of 
                              P
                           , we suppose a prior distribution has been found that gives posterior credible intervals which match the confidence intervals specified in Eq. (11). Treating the confidence intervals as exact credible intervals, they determine a posterior distribution for the proportion 
                              P
                           . We use a sufficiently large number, say 
                              R
                           , of one-sided credible interval limits to construct the posterior distribution. The posterior mean is then used as a point estimate, say

                            is a badly biased estimate of 
                              P
                           . This result illustrates an important fact: while posterior distributions obtained from exact probability matching priors will (by design) give interval estimates with good frequentist properties, the posterior mean may be far from meeting the frequentist definition of unbiasedness.

                        . This motivates another set of point estimators that are approximately unbiased uniformly for all 
                           P
                        . Using polynomial approximations, we aim to base the proposed estimator of 
                           P
                         in this section on a good global estimate of the non-centrality parameter 
                           λ
                        . This means that in searching for an approximately unbiased estimate of 
                           P
                        , we cover wide areas of the chi-square cdf and do not locally search around some estimate of 
                           λ
                        , as was proposed in Section  3.3 when using the Taylor expansion. In principle, estimates based on global approximation of the cdf should prove better, in terms of bias, than an estimate based on a local approximation.

We introduce a set of unbiased estimates of 
                           P
                        , denoted for now by 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       P
                                    
                                    
                                       ̂
                                    
                                 
                              
                              
                                 P
                              
                           
                        , which are based on approximating the probability 
                           P
                         in (5) as a polynomial function of degree 
                           r
                         in 
                           λ
                        . From Weierstrass’s Theorem, any function of a variable, 
                           λ
                         say, can be approximated by a polynomial of 
                           λ
                        , provided the function satisfies weak regularity conditions. Now

Although this computer algebraic system does not give explicit symbolic formulas for the raw moments of a non-central 
                           F
                         distribution without using special functions, it can efficiently give simple explicit forms of the raw moments of a non-central chi-square distribution up to any required order 
                           r
                        . The former can then be obtained from the latter by using the following straightforward relationship between the corresponding raw moments of the two distributions (Bain, 1969):

Now, to apply the approach outlined in Eqs. (31)–(33), it remains to find a suitable polynomial approximation to be used in (31). We use two different approximations, the first is based on Bernstein polynomials while the second is a quadrature polynomial approximation.

                            can be approximated by a polynomial function. See, for example, Lorentz (1986). In 1912, Bernstein gave a simple probabilistic constructive proof for Weierstrass’s Theorem by introducing the Bernstein polynomials

                            partition the interval [0, 1] into 
                              r
                            equal segments. The polynomial function

                            can then be easily integrated over any sub-interval in [0, 1]. It has been shown empirically that the approximation has good accuracy even when 
                              r
                            is small. For example, it was used by Richard et al. (2010) to obtain an efficient polynomial approximation of degree 9 to the normal distribution function and its inverse function.

Here, we apply the quadrature formula to approximate the density function of a chi-square distribution on

                                    1
                                 
                              
                            degrees of freedom with a polynomial of degree 
                              r
                              −
                              1
                           , which then yields the approximation in (31) after a straightforward symbolic integration of the polynomial.

To work on the [0, 1] interval, we adopt the approach discussed in Section  3.4.1 for choosing the two end-points

                           , neither polynomial approximation of degree 7 is expected to attain good accuracy. This can be seen in Fig. 4, where

                              =

                           . For the same extreme value of

                              =
                              30
                           , if 
                              a
                            is above the mode of this chi-square distribution (i.e.  
                              a
                              >
                              2
                           ), remarkably better accuracy is obtained, especially for the quadrature approximation. This is shown in Fig. 5, where 
                              a
                              =
                              4
                            and 
                              b
                              =
                              30
                           . This argument motivates our choice of 
                              a
                            and 
                              b
                            that was discussed in Section  3.4.1, as the behavior of both polynomial approximations tends to be the same for all values of

                           . As seen in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5, the Bernstein polynomial approximation can be more accurate than the quadrature polynomial approximation for values near 
                              b
                           , but the quadrature approximation overall attains better accuracy over the whole interval 
                              
                                 [

The simulations in Section  4 show that the estimators based on polynomial approximations performed well, in that they had the minimum bias among the reported estimators. However, this does not mean that the estimates they produce are always sensible. Specifically, when

                         is very small they can give estimates of the proportion that are greater than 100%, and when

                         is very big they can give estimates that are less than zero. This problem comes to light by studying the behavior of the proposed estimators at different values in the domain of

The task that motivated this paper seemed straightforward: find a good point estimator of the abnormality of a Mahalanobis index. The answer is less straightforward, as the best choice of estimator will depend on the purpose for which the estimator is required. The following summarizes our findings.

                           The most common criteria used to choose an estimator are bias and mean square error; the minimum variance unbiased estimator is often the preferred estimator if such an estimator can be found. Under these criteria the best estimators are those based on a quadrature polynomial approximation,

Sometimes, an estimate of

                               is to be used as an input into further analysis. Commonly though, an estimate of 
                                 P
                               is to be communicated to others (perhaps in a journal paper or a technical report) and then a good descriptive statistic is required. In that context, the best estimator would seem to be the modified median estimator,

It should be referred to as the median estimator as that is accurate: it is designed to give low median bias rather than low average bias and, indeed, its median bias is very low. It is preferable to the median estimate (

This work is part of an on-going project that develops statistical methods for analyzing single patient data, and these recommendations are implemented in software for making inferences from Mahalanobis distance about the abnormality of an individual’s test score profile. Previous methods that we have developed are well-used by neuropsychologists (see, for example, papers that cite Crawford and Garthwaite, 2002, 2005, 2007) so it is likely that the recommendations will influence practice. The work in this paper makes these recommendations well-informed.
