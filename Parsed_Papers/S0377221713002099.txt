                  This paper clarifies the relation between decisions of a risk-averse decision maker, based on expected utility theory on the one hand, and spectral risk measures on the other.
                  We first demonstrate that recent approaches to this problem generally do not provide strongly consistent results, i.e. they fail to induce identical preference orders simultaneously with both concepts. Then we detail the relation between risk-averse decisions under the dual theory of choice and spectral risk measures. This relation is identified as the fundamental reason why it is not in general possible to establish a simple one-to-one mapping between expected utility theory and spectral risk measures.
                  We are nonetheless able to use spectral risk measures to model decisions obtained using expected utility theory. Interestingly, this implies that a given utility function corresponds to a whole family of risk spectra.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The introduction of the concept of coherent risk measures in the financial literature (Artzner et al., 1997; Artzner et al., 1999) was a milestone in constructing risk measures, which are feasible both from an academic and a practitioners point of view, to overcome the well known shortcomings of Value-at-Risk (Jorion, 2006; Vozian, 2010; Krause, 2003). Among the possible classes of coherent risk measures, the class of spectral risk measures introduced by Acerbi (Acerbi, 2002; Acerbi, 2004), whose most prominent member is the Expected Shortfall (Tasche, 2002; Acerbi and Tasche, 2002; Rockafellar and Uryasev, 2002), has attracted considerable attention in the financial literature. Its general properties (Acerbi, 2002; Acerbi, 2004; Acerbi, 2007; Cherny, 2006; Dowd et al., 2008), estimation procedures (Acerbi, 2002; Giannopoulos and Tunaru, 2005; Cotter and Dowd, 2006; Cotter and Dowd, 2007a; Cotter and Dowd, 2007b) and its versatility in portfolio optimization (Rockafellar and Uryasev, 2000; Acerbi and Simonetti, in press; Adam et al., 2008; Strepparava, 2009; Deng et al., 2009; Brandtner, in press) have been studied extensively. In the context of portfolio optimization, the question of how to incorporate spectral risk measures into the framework of established theories of choice, is a particularly interesting and important one. This paper focuses on the problem of modeling rational behavior of a risk-averse decision maker, using spectral risk measures. For the dual theory of choice (Yaari, 1986; Yaari, 1987), this was already accomplished by Wang (1996), Wang (2000), Denuit et al. (2006), Gzyl and Mayoral (2006), using the equivalence of spectral risk measures and distortion risk measures. Recent research (Sriboonchitta et al., 2010; Tao et al., 2009; Dowd et al., 2008) tried to construct a similar connection between the classical theory of expected utility (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1947; Föllmer and Schied, 2002) and spectral risk measures. Different approaches to this problem were proposed, but failed so far to provide a consistent theoretical framework.

This papers provides a conclusive answer to that question by elaborating a scheme, to consistently model the behavior of an expected-utility-maximizer within the class of spectral risk measures. Furthermore, the earlier approaches (Sriboonchitta et al., 2010; Tao et al., 2009; Dowd et al., 2008) and the connection to the dual theory of choice are discussed to provide a complete and self-contained picture. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces spectral risk measures and their general relation to decision theories. Section 3 provides a brief review of recent attempts to establish a link between spectral risk measures and expected utility theory. Section 4 details the process and the implications of modeling risk averse behavior with spectral risk measures under the dual theory of choice. In Section 5, we provide a method for linking spectral risk measures and expected utility theory with the help of an auxiliary probability measure. This method is a close relative to the idea of changing probability measures in derivative pricing. We extend this approach to a general procedure in Section 6, and provide sufficient conditions for the link to be well defined and unique. We summarize and discuss our findings in Section 7.

                     . This relationship implies that the rational behavior of a decision maker, described by the theory of choice at hand, can be modeled by spectral risk measures. In particular, the key concept of risk aversion can then be operationalized consistently within the framework of spectral risk measures.

At this point one might ask, why should one be interested in modeling rational behavior with spectral risk measures? The answer is strongly related to a critical property of expected utility theory, namely risk preferences are strictly associated to the utility function, independent of the respective P&L-distribution. On the other hand, risk is a concept closely related to uncertainty, and hence to the P&L-distribution. Thus, modeling rational behavior with spectral risk measures is the attempt to map the pure risk preference of a decision maker. If there is a unique connection in the sense of (4) between SRMs and expected utility theory, it might be possible to separate risk and utility preferences after all.

Several recent research papers deal with a relationship between spectral measures of risk and expected utility theory. The works of Dowd et al. (2008) and Tao et al. (2009) consider particular types of utility functions and simply translate them into risk spectra of a corresponding functional form. Dowd et al. (2008) conclude correctly that this ad hoc assignment of a risk spectrum, with respect to a given utility function, can lead to inconsistent results. Unfortunately, they attribute these problems to the general properties of spectral risk measures. We will show that these inconsistencies arise because of an inappropriate construction of the link between the utility function and the risk spectrum and not for more fundamental reasons. An arbitrary choice of such functions and subsequent interpretation of their parameters cannot be expected to yield consistent results.

In a recent publication Sriboonchitta et al. (2010) develop a calculation scheme for the systematic construction of a risk spectrum φ from a given utility function u. They define the buying price p
                     
                        B
                     (X) of a random future P&L X, according to expected utility theory, such that E

                     p
                     
                        B
                     )=0 holds. Using results from robust statistics (e.g. Huber, 1981), they subsequently derive a scheme to construct a risk spectrum φ from a given utility function u, such that

                     holds. This identification is the central hypothesis of Sriboonchitta et al. (2010). The procedure is exercised only in the trivial case of a linear utility function u(x)=
                     x, in which case φ(p)=1 follows immediately. This leads to the fully consistent result ρ

                     >0 was considered too involved for a direct computation by the authors. We provide this calculation in Appendix A. Based on this result, a closer investigation of the central hypothesis (7) reveals inconsistencies on a very fundamental level.

Summarizing these results, neither the ad hoc construction of Dowd et al. (2008) and Tao et al. (2009), nor the robust method of Sriboonchitta et al. (2010) succeeded in establishing a consistent relationship between expected utility theory and spectral risk measures.

In this section, we motivate our approach from the somewhat different perspective of the premium principle, originated in the actuarial literature. The premium principle is introduced in Section 4.1 and its application to expected utility theory is shown to support the results of Section 3. In Section 4.2 Yaari’s dual theory of choice (Yaari, 1987) is reviewed and contrasted to expected utility theory. The application of the premium principle to the dual theory of choice serves as vehicle for the consistent modeling of risk aversion with spectral risk measures in Section 4.3.

Suppose a preference relation like (3) is represented by a function U. What fee or premium must be received by an insurer in order to make a specific risk, denoted by P&L X, acceptable to take? The premium principle states that the premium to be received has to obey an indifference relation of the kind

As a first example, consider expected utility theory and its representation U(X)=E
                           u
                        [X] with utility function u, satisfying u(0)=0. Within this representation, the premium principle (11) reads U(X
                        +
                        π)=E
                           u
                        [X
                        +
                        π]=0. This so-called “zero-utility premium principle” (cf. Bühlmann, 2005) introduces a risk measure, which is not coherent (Tsanakas and Desli, 2003). To see this, note that the definition of the buying price E
                           u
                        [X
                        −
                        p
                        
                           B
                        ]=0 of Section 3 yields p
                        
                           B
                        
                        =−π, and thus ρ(X)=−p
                        
                           B
                        , which is identical to the hypothesis of Sriboonchitta et al. (2010), Eq. (7).

Motivated by empirical and theoretical criticism on the independence-axiom of expected utility theory (Puppe, 1991; Yaari, 1987), alternative decision theories have been derived by modifying this axiom (Puppe, 1991). Of particular importance for the matter at hand is the dual theory of choice, which replaces the original independence-axiom by a dual independence-axiom (DIA).

                        −1)−1 for distribution functions F and G is called the harmonic convex combination by Yaari (1987), and F
                        −1 and G
                        −1 are the generalized inverse functions of F and G. Therefore, the terms in brackets in DIA are the distribution functions of the random variables λX
                        +(1−
                        λ)Z and λY
                        +(1−
                        λ)Z, respectively. Thus, not the independence of the convex combinations of the distributions, but the independence of the convex combinations of the random variables themselves is postulated.

The harmonic convex combination has an obvious resemblance to the concept of copulas. And indeed, the dual independence DIA is directly related to the property of comonotonicity, which is a distribution-free analogue of perfect correlation. This is of paramount importance in rational decision making, because comonotonic random variables cannot be used as mutual hedge. This entails further consequences, explored and proved in (Yaari, 1987, Section 3).

Unlike expected utility theory, which focuses on the expected value of a transformed future P&L of some position, the dual theory of choice considers the expected value of the proper P&L with respect to a transformed distribution, which corresponds to a change of the probability measure.

                        naturally holds for h(p) given by (18). Any spectral risk measure uniquely reflects some preference relation, encoded in h(p), which is consistent with the dual theory of choice. Furthermore, by (18) any risk spectrum corresponds to a concave distortion function, and thus spectral risk measures reflect the decision maker’s risk aversion. Finally, any risk averse behavior of a decision maker, whose preference relation is consistent with the dual theory of choice, can be encoded in a risk spectrum, and finally be expressed in terms of a spectral risk measure.

This correspondence (17) between distortion function h(p) and risk spectrum φ(p) enables the definition of a local measure for the risk aversion, encoded in a given risk spectrum. Putting (17) into the modified Pratt-Arrow-coefficient r

We conclude this section with three examples referring to former discussions.
                           Example 1
                           The constant risk spectrum φ(p)=1 corresponds to the linear distortion function h

                              p and has r

                              SPA(p)=0. This implies risk-neutral behavior of the decision maker. Note that this also implies that the expected shortfall, which is the spectral risk measure defined by the risk spectrum

The previous section detailed the intimate connection between spectral risk measures (SRMs) and the dual theory of choice. This close relation is the major obstacle in linking expected utility to SRMs, because the two decision systems are incongruent. In this section we show that it is nevertheless possible to construct a bijective map between expected utility and SRMs in a number of cases, using the popular and powerful quantitative finance tool of risk neutral probability measures.

First we should state more precisely what we mean by (risk neutral) auxiliary probability measure. For a risk neutral agent, the utility function is linear, and thus by the freedom of linear transformation we can choose the identity function

                            may serve as auxiliary probability measure to construct the desired link between EU and SRMs.

The relation described above clearly depends on the choice of the auxiliary measure Q and is thus somewhat arbitrary. This corresponds to the situation in finance, where in incomplete markets there is usually a continuum of arbitrage-free pricing measures. On the other hand, in complete markets there is a special and unique risk neutral measure, singled out by the no arbitrage condition. So the natural question arises: are there situations in which a preferred measure in the process of linking EU and SRMs exists?

It turns out that there is such a preferred measure embedded in a more general set of conditions under which a one-to-one mapping between expected utility and spectral risk measures can be established.

In this section, we derive more general conditions and a mechanism for the linking process between EU and SRMs, provided that these conditions hold. In order to motivate our approach, we built on the idea of a preferred equivalent probability measure, discussed in the last section.

In order to induce an admissible risk spectrum, ψ(x) has to be non-negative and monotonically decreasing. The first four Inada-conditions are (i) u(0)=0, (ii) u is continuously differentiable, (iii) u is strictly increasing in x, and (iv) u is strictly concave. We first prove that ψ(x) is strictly monotonic, and subsequently that it is non-negative and decreasing.

In order to be strictly monotonic, the derivative ψ′(x) must not have finite roots. We proof the absence of finite roots by contradiction. Assume there is at least one finite root, then the equality

These results are indeed very powerful, because one need no longer choose an auxiliary probability measure. Instead this measure is induced by the utility and distribution function under P. Furthermore, the family of functions satisfying the first four Inada-conditions is fairly large. All classical utility functions with exception of the quadratic utility are represented in this class. We finally give a sufficient condition for E

As a consequence of the last proposition, one only has to ensure that the domain of the utility function contains all possible realizations x of X. If additionally u(x) is a continuously differentiable, risk averse utility function obeying the Inada-conditions, then a unique one-to-one mapping between EU and SRMs exist.

                           1.
                           Check that the co-domain of X is a subset of the domain of u, and ensure that the utility function is continuously differentiable and strictly concave.

We conclude this section by illustrating the entire procedure in the following example:
                        Example 1
                        We stick to the setup of Example 2 of Section 5, u(x)=
                           x
                           
                              γ

                           ∼Exp(μ), because the exponential distribution has an analytic quantile function.
                              
                                 1.
                                 For exponentially distributed X, the co-domain is

                                    . Furthermore, u(x)=
                                    x

                                     is continuously differentiable and strictly concave for 0<
                                    γ
                                    <1. Its natural domain is 
                                       
                                          D
                                          =
                                          
                                             
                                                R
                                             
                                             
                                                +
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                     and thus 
                                       
                                          S
                                          ⊆
                                          D
                                       
                                     holds.

Obviously u(0)=0 and therefore b
                                    =0 holds. Consequently v(x)=
                                    u(x).

As expected, the spectral risk measure depends on both the utility function and the respective probability distribution in terms of their parameters γ and μ.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The relation between expected utility theory, the dual theory of choice, and spectral risk measures has thoroughly been investigated. Using the premium principle and the results from actuarial literature, regarding the intimate relationship between spectral risk measures and so called distortion risk measures, it was shown that spectral risk measures can be used to model any risk averse behavior of a decision maker, whose preference relation is consistent with the dual theory of choice. Based on this result, a local measure for the risk aversion encoded in the risk spectrum of the spectral risk measure was defined and several examples were provided. This relationship between the dual theory of choice and spectral risk measures is the fundamental reason, why it is generally not possible to construct a one-to-one-mapping between expected utility theory and spectral risk measures.

However, it was demonstrated that a one-to-one mapping between any given expected utility functional and a spectral risk measure can be established by a transformation of the respective probability measure. The necessary tools originated in mathematical finance. The resulting SRM usually contains the parameters of the utility function, as well as those from the involved P&L-distribution. The consequence is that the frequently criticized merging of utility function and risk preferences in EU-theory is projected onto the resulting SRM. Our findings make it possible, under fairly weak conditions, to construct a unique spectral risk measure given utility and P&L distribution families. Inside these families the mapping is one-to-one and order preserving. Across different P&L-distributions, the order preserving property of this link is lost, because expected utility and the dual theory of choice are incongruent decision systems.

In this appendix, the calculation for the exponential utility function, used for example in the discussion of the method of Sriboonchitta et al. (2010) in Section 4 is presented.

Throughout the financial literature both possible sign conventions for measuring losses may be found: either losses are described as negative numbers, implying that, say, an outcome of −100$ means that a loss of 100$ is realized or losses are described as positive numbers, implying that an outcome of 100$ means that a loss of 100$ is realized. In this appendix, the transformation from one convention to the other in the context of spectral risk measures is presented to enhance the comprehensibility of the discussions in the main text.

First, consider a financial position with random P&L-variable X and assume that losses are described by negative numbers. Consider some spectral risk measure
