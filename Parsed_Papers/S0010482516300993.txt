                  Few studies have reported analyses of neuropsychiatric impairment (NPI) data from HIV patients, in a real world clinical setting with the aim of establishing association between anti-retroviral drug concentrations and NPI development and resolution. No study has modeled the effect of efavirenz exposure beyond the pre-steady state period on the frequency and duration of NPI. The data used consists of 196 HIV patients whose efavirenz pharmacokinetic parameters were previously determined. Neuropsychiatric evaluation was done at baseline, week 2 and week 12. Patients were classified into NORMAL and NPI states. The duration of NPI was further classified as transient (NPI at week 2 but not at week 12), persistent (NPI at week 2 and 12) and delayed (NPI at week 12 but not at week 2). The proportion of patients in each duration category out of the total NPI patients was calculated. A continuous time Markov model was developed in NONMEM 7.3 and used to describe the relationship between efavirenz exposure and the duration of NPI. Monte Carlo simulations with the model were used to describe the effect of efavirenz dose reduction from 600mg to 400mg on the duration of NPI. The model adequately described the data. The influence of efavirenz exposure on the rate of development of NPI decayed with a half-life of 8.4 days. Efavirenz dose reduction to 400mg significantly reduces the duration of NPI, but has no impact on delayed NPI symptoms or efficacy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Neurological and psychiatric disorders are among the most prevalent comorbidities in patients undergoing treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leading to significant impairment of functional capacity, quality of life and survival [1,2]. The etiology of these disorders is highly varied, ranging from substance abuse, preexisting psychiatric disease, toxicity of certain regimens of the anti-retroviral therapy, opportunistic infection of the central nervous system (CNS) or HIV infection itself [3–5]. In most cases there is more than one cause at a time in an individual. In order to address these neuropsychiatric complications, it is important to establish the etiology. Unfortunately, CNS side effects of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and neurological complications of HIV infections overlap significantly in terms of symptoms, thus complicating diagnosis and subsequent management.

The ART regimen, efavirenz is widely reported to cause CNS toxicity [6]. This toxicity presents with mild and transient symptoms but severe and persistent episodes have been reported. The incidence of NPI is higher in patients with a history of psychiatric impairment [7,8].

Few studies have reported analyses of neuropsychiatric impairment (NPI) data from HIV aimed at establishing association between as anti-retroviral drug such an efavirenz concentrations and NPI [9–11]. These studies aimed at establishing statistical associations between risk of NPI and efavirenz concentration cutoffs among HIV patients who did not have NPI at baseline. However, these do not reflect reality in that the inclusion and exclusion criteria eliminate potential causes of NPIs and, therefore, interaction between different etiological factors is not considered. A pragmatic approach to obtaining data that reflects real world clinical setting is to relax entry criteria to include subjects with some history of NPI and subsequently in the analysis of the data collected. To date, not many studies have analyzed NPIs in such a study setting. Mukonzo and colleagues used descriptive and summary statistics to describe the association between frequency of NPI symptoms and genetic, demographic and pharmacokinetic factors [12]. Whereas they sought to establish a link between efavirenz pharmacokinetics and the NPI symptoms observed during therapy, the approach used in the analysis did not take into consideration the baseline NPI status and therefore presents a risk of bias in the analysis. In addition, the approach did not characterize the exposure response relationship adequately. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling is a more suitable method for characterizing exposure–response relationship so as to maximize the amount of knowledge obtained from an experiment and enable prediction beyond conditions that have been studied [13]. This is particularly important if the outcome of interest is an adverse effect (AE) like NPI for which the design of dose-response studies may not be practical.

Patients with NPI symptoms at baseline may experience persistence or resolution of the symptoms upon initiation of efavirenz. Likewise, those without symptoms at baseline may or may not develop NPI symptoms. A Markov process can be used to characterize the probability of development or resolution of NPI symptoms upon initiation of efavirenz therapy, and the factors influencing these probabilities. Thus, this investigation was undertaken to characterize the development and resolution of NPI symptoms during HIV therapy with efavirenz in order to gain an understanding of the process and the factors that modulate it.

@&#METHODS@&#

A sequence of discrete valued random variables is said to be a Markov chain, if only the present value of a random variable is needed to determine the immediate future value of the random variable. The discrete values are referred to as states and occupy a finite space. The transition between states is a random process itself and can be modeled with a discrete time Markov model [14]. Thus a discrete time Markov model is primarily characterized by “states” and “transition probabilities”. The covariate dependence of transition probabilities can be analyzed using logistic functions [15]. We previously utilized a discrete time Markov model to characterize NPIs in the efavirenz pre-steady state period of treatment [16]. Only two observations time points were utilized and the description of outcomes was limited to only the frequency of NPI. However, it is important to describe NPI across the entire treatment period and also characterize the impact of treatment on the duration and time of onset of NPI. When an adverse effect (AE) such as NPI occurs during drug therapy, understanding the AE process over the duration of drug therapy is important. Dividing the process into pre-steady state and steady state in an attempt to provide a quantitative understanding of the adverse effect process may result in information loss and yields only fragmented knowledge. The intent of understanding the full course of the AE such as NPI should inform the type of transition model developed, discrete versus continuous transition time model. In addition, a discrete time Markov modeling method would require uniform observation intervals, yet most clinical data, even with in a research setting often has non-uniform intervals between observations.

A continuous time Markov model can solve these limitations. For a continuous time Markov process, both the future state and the time left in the current state depend on the current state. The states are still discrete and are finite in number. However, state occupancy time occupies continuous space. The probability of staying in a particular state decays exponentially and is directly proportional to the rate (intensity) of transition from that state. Covariate factors, including drug exposure, can affect the transition intensities [17]. A continuous time Markov model is capable of utilizing data with non-uniform observation intervals because time variation is built into the model via transition intensities. Here, we utilize a continuous time Markov model to describe NPI beyond pre-steady state using observations that are not equally spaced. First, we describe in this section the data used in this investigation, followed by a description of the pharmacokinetic model, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model development, model validation (predictive performance), and the application of the model.

The data was collected in 2008 to 2009 and consists of newly diagnosed anti-retroviral therapy (ART) naïve HIV patients with (n=138) and without (n=58) tuberculosis co-infection attending the HIV/TB or HIV clinic at Mulago and Butabika National referral Hospitals in Kampala, Uganda. At baseline, the participants had a mean age of 33.8 with standard deviation (SD) of 7.2 years, mean weight of 53.6 (SD=10.1)kg, mean CD4 of 97.2 (SD=77.4), and mean log10 viral load of 4.95 (SD=0.71).

The participants were initiated on ART containing efavirenz 600mg daily in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine. Blood samples for genotyping were collected at baseline while those for the pharmacokinetic analysis were collected between 11 and 18h post efavirenz-dosing at baseline and on subsequent visits for 6 months. Neuropsychological evaluation for sleep disorders (insomnia, vivid dreams, and sleep-walking) and hallucinations (visual, auditory, and tactile) was performed at baseline week 2 and week 12. The study was approved by institutional review boards of Mulago and Butabika hospitals and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology [12].

Participants could experience none, one or more than one neuropsychiatric symptoms. At each evaluation, the patients were classified as NPI (coded as 1) if a participant reported at least one of the symptoms, or NORMAL (coded as 0) if the participant did not report any symptom. The assessment was carried out using an interviewer administered questionnaire. Insomnia was categorized as mild (failure to sleep within 15min), moderate (failure to sleep in 1h), and severe (failure to sleep for more than 1h). Other sleep disorders and hallucinations were assessed as “yes” or “no” as declared by the participants. A summary of the symptoms at the different observation times is shown in 
                        Table 1. The duration of NPI after initiation of ART was further categorized as transient (NPI only at week 2), persistent (NPI at both week 2 and 12) and delayed (NPI only at week 12). The proportion of patients in each duration category was calculated. The neuropsychiatric assessment was administered by a trained psychiatric nurse under the supervision of a physician. Details about the procedure and methods of data collection were reported elsewhere [12].

A previously developed full covariate one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination was used to describe efavirenz pharmacokinetic (PK). Absorption rate constant (KA), apparent clearance (CL/F), relative bioavailability (F1) and apparent distribution volume (V/F), were estimated. Covariates relationships included TB disease status on KA, CYP2B6*6 and CYP2B6*11 genotypes on CL/F, and ABCB1 c.4046
                        A>G on F1. The PK analysis was done in NONMEM version 7.2.0 software [17,18] with the aid of Perl speaks NONMEM (PsN 3.4.2) [19]. The detailed procedure and results of the PK modeling are reported elsewhere [16].

A continuous time Markov model was developed to characterize the transition between the two defined neuropsychological states. The Markov model was parameterized by its transition intensities obtained by solving the system of Kolmogorov's (forward–backward) differential equations [20]. Let u and v denote the intensities of transition from NORMAL to NPI and from NPI to NORMAL, respectively. The transition probabilities over a time interval t are given by Eqs. (1) and (2), which are also each individual's contribution to the likelihood function per observation interval.

The sequential PK–PD modeling approach was used. The PK parameters were used to derive the cumulative area under the concentration time curve (AUC) per observation interval. If C is the plasma concentration of efavirenz, and each individual has n observations such that t

The influence of AUC on rate constant of acquisition of NPI (u) and on the rate of resolution of NPI (v) were modeled using an alternative parameterization Emax
                         model suggested by Schoemaker et al. [21] and a slope relationship respectively as shown in Eqs. (4) to (6). The Schoemaker et al. [21] 
                        Emax
                         model was used because of the ethical constraints surrounding the nature of the outcome investigated. In practice it is not possible to investigate the dose or exposure that gives the maximum response when the outcome is a toxic effect like NPI. The effect of efavirenz exposure on the intensity of acquisition of NPI was assumed to decay exponentially and its half-life was estimated. Thus:

                        2. Parameter estimation was done using the Laplacian algorithm in NONMEM 7.3. The reliability and predictive performance of the model were assessed using diagnostic plots and non-parametric bootstrap.

Model evaluation was performed with simulation-based diagnostics, of which the mirror plot is an example, and bootstrap parameter reliability testing. All simulations were done in R 3.1.1 statistical software [22]. The reduced model, given the data, was used to simulate 1000 new datasets containing 196 individuals each. These datasets were used to create diagnostic mirror plots as follows. For each simulated dataset, each category (transient, persistent and delayed) was calculated as a proportion of the total simulated NPI. For each category, the mean of all the simulated datasets was calculated. Stacked bar plots showing the three categories were created for both the observed and simulated datasets and compared for similarity.

The reliability of parameter estimates was determined via the non-parametric bootstrap. The final, irreducible, model, given the data, was fitted to 1000 bootstrap data sets, created by resampling with replacement from the original data set and model parameters estimated. Summary statistics (mean, median, 2.5th percentile, 97.5th percentile, minimum and maximum) for the distribution of each model parameter were obtained. The reduced model parameter estimates were compared to the mean and percentile 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the non-parametric bootstrap replicates as described by Ette et al. [23].

The predictive performance of the model was determined using visual predictive check. One thousand replicates of datasets containing the same number of individuals (196) as the original dataset were simulated and compared with the observed data. For each simulated dataset, the proportion of neuropsychological impairment outcomes at baseline, week 2 and week 12 was computed. The median, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the simulated proportions at each time point were obtained and plotted. The observed proportions (red dots) at each time point were superimposed in the plot. Best model performance was achieved if the observed proportions lay between the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the simulated proportions at all time points.

The PK–PD model was used to simulate 1000 datasets of 196 patients each, with the same CYP2B6 and ABCB1 c.4046
                        
                        A>G genotype frequency as the original dataset. Fixed and random model effects parameters were set equal to the reduced (final) PK–PD model, given the data. The frequency of NPI at week 2 and week 12, given efavirenz doses of 400mg and 600mg, were simulated for the study population. The proportions of the different duration categories (transient, persistent and delayed) in the neuropsychologically impaired population were also simulated for the two doses. The pair-wise Student's t-test was used to compare the duration categories between the 400mg and 600mg doses.

Although our objective was the characterization of the exposure-NPI relationship, exposure of EFV from the two regimens was also compared since drug effect is driven by exposure. This was to ascertain that a possible reduction in EFV by 200mg from 600 to 400mg would not result in EFV concentrations below the 1 to 4mg/L efficacious target range. Thus, 95% confidence intervals of EFV concentration from 600mg and 400mg qd regimens were compared.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The estimated intensity of transition from NORMAL state to NPI state was 0.125h−1 (RSE=61%) while the intensity of transition from NPI state to NORMAL state was 0.16h−1 (RSE=62%). Incorporation of drug effect on both intensities significantly improved the fit as per the likelihood ratio test (p<0.0001) with the of intensity of transition from NORMAL state to NPI state estimated to be −9.46h−
                     1 (RSE=5.7%), and that from NPI state to NORMAL state estimated to be −4.74h−
                     1 (RSE=24.2%). The parameter for Change in intensity of resolution of NPI per unit increase in the log of AUC was fixed to prior estimated values during bootstrapping, which enabled precise estimation of other treatment related parameters.

The final parsimonious model (see 
                     Table 2 for parameter estimates) adequately described the data as shown in the simulation-based diagnostic plots (
                     Fig. 1). The confidence intervals of the estimated parameters did not include zeros. In addition, median bootstrap parameter estimates lay within ±15% of the reduced model parameter estimates, indicating that the estimates are reliable. The effect of efavirenz exposure on the intensity development of NPI wears off with a half-life of about 8.4 days. The probability of retention of NPI declines much faster than the increase in probability of acquisition of NPI (
                     Fig. 2).

Simulations for the 400mg dose revealed significant (p<0.0001) reduction in NPI proportions at both week 2 (10%) and week 12 (5%). The dose reduction also resulted in a 4% reduction in persistent NPI and a similar increase in transient NPI proportions indicating a reduction in the duration of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Upon dose reduction, the simulated proportion of delayed NPI category increased by 1%.The changes were all statistically significant (p<0.0001).The simulation results together are reported with the observed NPI proportions for comparison, in 
                        Table 3. In addition, dose reduction from 600 to 400mg maintains plasma concentrations and exposure within the efficacious target range of 1 to 4mg/L (see 
                        Fig. 3).

The modeling of NPIs provides a more quantitative and semi-mechanistic description of the relationship between drug (efavirenz) exposure and the probability of NPI, which allows for exploration of the impact of therapeutic interventions such as dose modification on the different aspects of NPI such as frequency and duration. The results indicate that dose reduction of efavirenz from 600mg to 400mg would result in a decrease in the frequency of NPI symptoms reported throughout the treatment period. The duration of NPIs among those who get impaired is also reduced. However, it appears that the delayed NPI is not altered by dose modification.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The longitudinal nature of the data and the dependence of observation at each time on those from previous time points make transition modeling the method of choice for modeling neuropsychological impairment in HIV patients. The development or resolution of NPI in HIV patients on ART occurs in a continuous time manner with non-uniform durations spent within states. This knowledge, therefore, informed the choice and use of a continuous time Markov model to describe the longitudinal data. This was further affirmed through the model evaluation and validation process.

The model was used in this investigation to quantify differences in the rates of development and resolution of NPI and, thereby, provide insight into the nature of the underlying mechanism and duration of NPI. Efavirenz exposure significantly affected the intensity of acquisition of NPI. The effect of efavirenz treatment on the intensity of acquisition of NPI was modeled using the Shoemaker modification of the Emax
                      model because it is practically impossible to attain concentrations that produce maximal effect for this type of outcome [21]. At steady state, the effect of efavirenz on the intensity of development of NPI is short lived. Therefore, this effect was assumed to decay exponentially. The slope relationship was used to model treatment effect on the intensity of resolution of NPI for the sake of parsimony, and it significantly improved the fit. In addition, the bootstrap 95% confidence intervals show that the parameter estimates were precise and reliable.

As observed from the diagnostic plots (Fig. 1) the simulated outcomes from the model are in agreement with the observed outcomes at all observation time points, indicating model adequacy. Thus, the model has good predictive performance, and it is, therefore, generalizable.

Efavirenz exposure significantly affects the rate of acquisition of NPI. This effect decays with a half-life of 8.4 days. This, therefore, results in the transience of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Indeed, the probability of resolution of NPI once acquired increases much faster than the probability of acquisition of NPI during efavirenz exposure (Fig. 2). Reduction of the dose of efavirenz, leads to reduced exposure to efavirenz, as expected. The result is a reduction in the rate of acquisition and retention of NPI hence a reduction in duration of NPI as observed from the simulations for the 400mg dose (Table 2 and Fig. 1).

However, the late emergent or delayed NPI as a proportion of the total NPI population increases following dose reduction to 400mg. A closer look at the data shows that in terms of absolute magnitude, this category of NPI is not affected by dose reduction. This is in agreement with previous clinical trial reports that late emergent NPI is not due to efavirenz CNS toxicity [24,25]. The dose reduction from 600mg to 400mg qd will not affect efficacy because the distributions of exposure from the two doses lay within the efficacious range of 1–4mg/ml.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A continuous time Markov model was used to describe NPI following efavirenz exposure during steady state. The effect of efavirenz exposure on the intensity of acquisition of NPI decays exponentially. Simulations using the model revealed a reduction in the duration of efavirenz associated NPI following dose reduction to 400mg. Delayed NPI is not associated with efavirenz exposure and therefore may not be ameliorated by dose reduction. The reduction in efavirenz dose from 600 to 400mg will not have a deleterious effect on drug efficacy.
