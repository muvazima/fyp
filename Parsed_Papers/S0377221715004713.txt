                  When cheap fossil energy is polluting and pollutant no longer absorbed beyond a certain concentration, there is a moment when the introduction of a cleaner renewable energy, although onerous, is optimal with respect to inter-temporal utility. The cleaner technology is adopted either instantaneously or gradually at a controlled rate. The problem of optimum under viability constraints is 6-dimensional under a continuous-discrete dynamic controlled by energy consumption and investment into production of renewable energy. Viable optima are obtained either with gradual or with instantaneous adoption. A longer time horizon increases the probability of adoption of renewable energy and the time for starting this adoption. It also increases maximal utility and the probability to cross the threshold of irreversible pollution. Exploiting a renewable energy starts sooner when adoption is gradual rather than instantaneous. The shorter the period remaining after adoption until the time horizon, the higher the investment into renewable energy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     Nordhaus (1973), Nordhaus (1991), Nordhaus (1992) pioneered equilibrium models of climate and economy. He linked global warming to carbon emissions and called for a transition to clean energy. Chakravorty, Moreaux, and Tidball (2008) and van der Ploeg and Withagen (2012) modelled what such a transition might be, with the characteristic that people would resort to renewable energy only when fossil resources were exhausted. In contrast, taking capital accumulation into account through capacity constraints and adjustment costs, both of which must be factored into the construction of renewable energy plants, Amigues, Ayong Le Kama, Chakravorty, and Moreaux (2013) and Lecuyer and Vogt-Schilb (2014) showed that optimal investment in renewable energy is independent of existing fossil resources. They also showed that it is better to start the transition as early as possible and to distribute investment over time rather than to wait and then be obliged to invest heavily over a short period.

We address the question of the best energy transition where a social planner takes the social cost of pollution into account, in contrast to what is done in the above-cited equilibrium models, where technological decisions are made by firms. We shall feature optimal transitions rather than mere equilibria, and tackle the difficulty of optimal timing: when should energy be switched from fossil to renewable? Our perspective resembles that of Tahvonen and Withagen (1996), Tahvonen (1997), Valente (2011), Prieur, Tidball, and Withagen (2013), and Boucekkine, Pommeret, and Prieur (2013a), Boucekkine, Pommeret, and Prieur (2013b).


                     Amigues et al. (2013) identified the various optimal regimes, paying considerable attention to state constraints, but ignoring timing controls. We do consider timing controls and the possibility that adoption of renewable energy is gradual rather than instantaneous. Boucekkine et al. (2013a) used timing controls in multi-stage optimal control; Bonneuil and Saint-Pierre (2008) introduced timing controls in the economic theory of the life cycle. Our original way of involving timing controls in a set-valued dynamic under state and control constraints allows us to avoid the algebraic complexity associated with the consideration of state constraints on capital. The problem of energy transition has also been addressed in operation research, through multi-criteria analysis (Georgopoulou, Sarafidis, Mirasgedis, Zaimi, & Lalas, 2003; Kowalski, Stagl, Madlener, & Omann, 2009). When uncertainty is at stake, Lukas and Welling (2014) took the real option set-up. Our handling of explicit timing controls and optimal regime switching is closer to the impulse control technique, as in Hainaut (2014), who studies pension funds in a regime switching economy. We differ from this author in our use of set-valued analysis, which allows us to deal with uncertainty, state constraints, and impulse controls. We also differ from him by the fact that we develop an econometric part to test the implications and the robustness of the results.

With regard to energy, the share of renewable energy in French electricity production, for example, is forecast to grow from 22.9% in 2013 to 35% in 2020.

                      We propose to determine not only when the transition to a renewable energy should start, but also at what rate it should replace existing forms of energy. The proportion of clean but expensive energy can then be adjusted over time.

We consider pollution as possibly irreversible, as Tahvonen and Withagen (1996) and Prieur (2009) did. The non-renewable resource, say fossil fuels, is extracted and consumed, causing emissions of pollutant. Beyond a critical concentration, pollutant is no longer absorbed, as it is the case for carbon dioxide by the oceans. The choice is to adopt a renewable but expensive technology, say wind power, or not. Prieur et al. (2013) searched for the optimal management of exhaustible resources under irreversible pollution but ignored the adoption of the new technology. In Boucekkine et al. (2013b), the timing of adoption is endogenous but not the size of the investment in the technology of renewable energy. This assumption follows Valente (2011): when adoption starts, the share of renewable energy is set to a constant, reflecting the maximal level of the renewable energy allowed by the technological capacity of the country. We refer to this type of adoption as “instantaneous adoption.” We relax the view of instantaneous adoption, which is mathematically convenient but restrictive, and suggest to endogenize the investment into the renewable energy, within the possibilities left by the technology. We refer to this type of adoption as “gradual adoption.”


                     Boucekkine et al. (2013b), using Pontryagin, had to check all possible candidates to optimality (inner solutions, corner solutions, solutions with adoption of renewable energy and those without, solutions with reversibility of pollution and those without), computing the associated value functions for each set of parameters and for each set of initial conditions, to finally select the maximal value. In contrast, viability theory yields optima in a necessary and sufficient way, allowing a systematic exploration of the state space. Our method here allows one to solve the problem without the round-about of Pontryagin or Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman, without having to compute each candidate solution to select the best one thereafter. Our econometric analysis, as in Bonneuil and Boucekkine (2014), shall capture the main features of viable optimal decisions and help us interpret them. Varying the production unit cost, the maximal investment into renewable energy, and the threshold of irreversible pollution allows us to test robustness on the parameters setting. Besides, thanks to Bonneuil’s 2006 viability algorithm, the technique is flexible enough to add state dimensions, here gradual versus instantaneous adoption, avoiding to derive first-order conditions each time. The technique works with continuous-discrete time dynamics. The link with optimal solutions, which economists are fond of, was established theoretically (Bonneuil, 2012). It finds here a practical application.

Around the plausible parameters values used by Prieur et al. (2013), we shall determine the factors favoring adoption or not. We shall notably find the importance of initial fossil resource and initial level of pollution in the maximal inter-temporal utility. This is consistent with Boucekkine et al. (2013b), who use a different analysis. In addition, we shall also examine the role of the time horizon and the capacity to afford a gradual adoption. We shall also find that a longer time horizon increases the probability of adoption of renewable energy and the time for this adoption. It also increases maximal utility and the probability to cross the threshold of irreversible pollution. We shall find that the time for starting exploiting a renewable energy decreases when adoption is gradual, compared with instantaneous adoption: the shorter the time remaining after adoption until the time horizon, the more quickly renewable energy is adopted. Then the theory of optimal regime switching is completed by the realistic feature of gradual adoption, a key component of energy policies.

After posing the problem as a maximization under four differential equations, we shall present viability theory and the procedure to obtain a maximum under viability constraints, with its associated algorithm. The problem becomes a viability problem with six dimensions. An example of trajectories with gradual or with instantaneous adoption will helps us situate the dynamic. Then we shall proceed to the econometric analysis of 600 simulations, so as to highlight the determinants of adoption and its mode.

The quantity of fossil resource is x
                     1(t) at time t. People are to solve the trade-off between cheap polluting energy against expensive cleaner energy, through maximizing the discounted stream of utilities from energy consumption and disutilities associated with pollution and the cost of investing into renewable energy:

There exists a maximal domain containing all others, and called viability kernel. A capture domain is a set of states x from which there exists at least one solution to (F, R) starting from x and reaching a given set Ω, playing the role of a target. By adding time as a state variable, this target may include a fixed time, at which to hit the target. The capture-viability kernel Capt(F, R)(K, Ω) is the largest set of states x from which there exists at least one solution governed by the dynamic (F, R), remaining in K for all t ∈ [0, T], and reaching the target Ω.

If a closed set K is not viable under (F, R), Aubin (1999) proved that when F is Marchaud (its graph and its domain are not empty, the values F(x) are convex, and

The capture-viability kernel of the augmented dynamic (13) has six state variables: x
                        1, x
                        2, x
                        3, x
                        4, w, and π, and three controls: v
                        1, v
                        2, and ts
                        . The variable x
                        4 is time, which is now a state variable, in contrast to System (4–7).


                        Bonneuil (2006) addressed the computation of viable states and of the capture-viability kernel in large state dimension, based on stochastic optimization (to handle the large dimension of the discretized control trajectory). The idea is to minimize the distance to the set of constraints of solutions starting from a given state, and to assess the viability status of this state whether or not the minimization of the distance leads to at least one trajectory remaining in the set of constraints. The search for viable states is also achieved by the minimization of a distance to the set of constraints, so that the procedure relies on a double stochastic optimization: one where the initial state under examination is fixed, so as to decide whether it is viable or not, and one where this initial state is varied. We shall use this algorithm later on.

The addition of the auxiliary variable π participates in the elegant procedure leading to locate the viable maximum on the boundary in direction of high π of the capture-viability kernel associated with the augmented dynamic (Bonneuil, 2012). A variant of Bonneuil’s 2006 algorithm allows us to compute the boundary of the capture viability basin in the direction of high π without the knowledge of the whole capture-viability kernel, which is very memory-consuming. First, a viable state is found for the auxiliary dynamic; second π is maximized for the same x. For each new attempt (x, π), stochastic optimization allows us to find one trajectory remaining in K and reaching the target at time T. For T infinite, an approximation and extrapolation of “reaching the target” is used, a task here made easy by the discounting term

                         for the instantaneous transition does correspond with an upward inflexion of fossil energy, together with a downward inflexion of the quantity of pollutant. This onset taking place later for gradual transition, both inflexions are lower. Before the first onset, all curves are very close to each other, although simulated independently. This holds true for all simulated trajectories, which again confirms the accuracy of the viability algorithm.

A case where renewable energy is not adopted is qualitatively similar from Fig. 1, except that the variable x
                        3 remains null.

Viable states are distributed over the whole plane (x
                        1, x
                        2), because from any state (x
                        1, x
                        2, 0, 0, 0), there exists a trajectory leading to a maximal utility. This is confirmed by computation. The point is whether or not this trajectory requires adoption.

                         delineate the boundary of the capture-viability kernel, with some width due to the numerical approximation. The width does not exceed 4 percent in π, at least for low values of pollution x
                        2. This boundary is the set of viable maxima π(0), with varying initial values.

                        20, π(0)), obtained by fitting a penalized spline through the scattered points obtained by the viability algorithm. The surface increases in x

                           s are iid, “P” stands for “probability”, the tilde over a variable denotes the mean value of this variable over the time interval [0, T], the significant coefficients at the 5% level are marked by a star, the standard deviations are put in parentheses below the coefficients, and “instantaneous adoption” is taken as reference for adoption of renewable energy.

The logit equation of the probability of adoption of a renewable energy in (14) shows that adoption is more likely to occur with a longer time horizon, whatever the couple of initial values x
                           10 and x
                           20. Adoption is also more likely when the maximal possibility to consume is lower (coefficient 
                              
                                 −
                                 0.87
                              
                            of max v
                           1). The time discount in the objective function could lead us to believe that the influence of the time horizon T vanishes exponentially. However, when T increases, the stock of resources declines, which favors the transition to renewable energy. Our significant estimate of the role of T then comes from the fact that the initial source of energy is not renewable. It cannot be taken for granted in discounted optimal adoption problems.

Consistently with this latter result, the maximal utility π(0) does not depend on adoption and its mode (non-significant coefficients for non-adoption and for gradual adoption). As expected, this maximal utility is higher with initial abundant fossil resources (coefficient 0.05), which allow more consumption and lower pollution (coefficient 
                              
                                 −
                                 0.04
                              
                           ), consistently with (1) (and consistently with Boucekkine et al. (2013b)). A higher possibility to consume logically increases the maximal utility (coefficient 0.52). A longer time horizon (term 0.014) increases π(0), because, from the first equation of (14), it is associated with adoption of renewable energy, which itself relieves the disutility brought by pollution. The more abundant the fossil resource, the later the renewable energy is adopted (coefficient 2.55 in the regression of ts
                           ), because more initial fossil resource leaves more flexibility, or conversely, because shortage of fossil resource hastens adoption of a renewable energy.

If this adoption is gradual, the new technology is implemented sooner (coefficient 
                              
                                 −

                            in the regression of ts
                           ) than if adoption is instantaneous, as expected. Then, gradual adoption requires foresight, in order to be competitive in terms of utility, compared with instantaneous adoption. Both the positive effect of the initial fossil resource and the fact that gradual adoption starts sooner than instantaneous adoption still hold true for the fraction ts
                           /T (coefficients 0.05 and

                            in the regression of ts
                           /T). The time ts
                           , at which to start exploiting renewable energy, is also postponed when the time horizon is longer (coefficient 0.92 in the regression of ts
                            and 0.03 in the regression of ts
                           /T). This time ts
                            increases more quickly than T (positive coefficient of T in the equation of ts
                           /T of (14)). Exceeding the no return pollution threshold is more likely when fossil resources are abundant (coefficient

                           ): the scarcity of fossil resource drives people to limit their pollution, and low initial pollution helps people from reaching irreversible pollution. Adoption or not of a renewable energy plays no role in the reversibility of pollution. The solutions having crossed the irreversibility threshold are associated with adoption, because, over the threshold, it is optimal to attenuate the lack of natural self-cleaning by a cleaner technology, a result also found by Boucekkine et al. (2013b).

In System (14), x

                           20, adoption and its type are the primary variables of interest, while T, c, max v
                           1, and 
                              x
                            
                           2 are parameters. Robustness is obtained through the additive structure of System (14), which allows effects to be estimated after controlling for the variation of the parameters. We varied the values of these parameters in the simulations, randomly from a uniform distribution within a range of plus or minus 30% around those given by Prieur et al. (2013) (while, as a reminder, values taken by the variables x
                           10, x
                           20, and timing of adoption are determined from the construction of the viability kernel).

Apart from the time horizon T, whose influence we discussed above, robustness with regard to parameters is further ensured, after the additive structure of the additive model (14), by the absence of significant effects of c. This is due to the fact that c is multiplied by the quantity of renewable energy x
                           3 in Eq. (1), but x
                           3 remains small with respect to total energy consumption v
                           1 and even to pollution x
                           2. The variation of c thus yields a second order effect on the variation of the quantities of interest in System (14).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Our extension of the possibility of adoption to gradual adoption rather than only instantaneous confirms the role of initial conditions in the decision to adopt a renewable energy. A longer time horizon increases the probability of adoption of renewable energy and the time for starting this adoption. It also increases maximal utility and the probability to cross the threshold of irreversible pollution. Exploiting a renewable energy starts sooner when adoption is gradual rather than instantaneous. The shorter the period remaining after adoption until the time horizon, the higher the investment into renewable energy.
