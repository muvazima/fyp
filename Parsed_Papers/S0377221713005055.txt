                  We consider a deterministic n-job, single machine scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) of job completion times about a common due date (d). The MSD measure is non-regular and its value can decrease when one or more completion times increases. MSD problem is connected with the Completion Time Variance (CTV) problem and has been proved to be NP-hard. This problem finds application in situations where uniformity of service is important. We present an exact algorithm of pseudo-polynomial complexity, using ideas from branch and bound and dynamic programming. We propose a dominance rule and also develop a lower bound on MSD. The dominance rule and lower bound are effectively combined and used in the development of the proposed algorithm. The search space is explored using the breadth first branching strategy. The asymptotic space complexity of the algorithm is O(nd). Irrespective of the version of the problem – tightly constrained, constrained or unconstrained – the proposed algorithm provides optimal solutions for problem instances up to 1000 jobs size under different due date settings.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Non-regular performance measures in scheduling research have gained considerable importance in recent times. A regular measure is a function of job completion times which is to be minimized and its value can increase only when at least one of the completion times increases. Some of these include mean tardiness, number of tardy jobs, and mean flow time. They do not impose any penalties for jobs completing early and do consider only the tardiness penalties. Earliness costs are relevant where uniformity in service is needed and non-regular performance measures consider both earliness and tardiness penalties. The value of a non-regular performance measure can decrease when one or more completion times increases. They are consistent with just-in-time philosophy. Completion Time Variance (CTV) and Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) are two important non-regular performance measures. Optimization of CTV and MSD ensures the jobs completion as close as possible to each other and to the common due date respectively.


                     Kanet (1981a) introduced the problem of minimizing Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of job completion times about a common due date (d) and presented an algorithm to determine an optimal schedule under a restrictive assumption on the due date. Sundararaghavan and Ahmed (1984) extend Kanet’s work to identical parallel machines and proposed an algorithm which can provide all optimal schedules. Bagchi, Sullivan, and Chang (1986) addressed the MAD problem over a large range of due dates. Later several researchers like Hall (1986), Emmons (1987), and Szwarc (1989) worked on the MAD problem. However the MAD objective penalizes both earliness and tardiness costs linearly. As larger deviations of job completion times from the due date are undesirable, MSD is found to be an appropriate measure. The MSD measure penalizes larger deviations at a higher rate.


                     Bagchi, Sullivan, and Chang (1987) introduced the problem of scheduling n jobs on a single machine to minimize the Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) of job completion times about a common due date. When the due date does not constrain the attainment of the minimum MSD value, the problem is said to be unconstrained. Bagchi et al. (1987) showed that the unconstrained MSD problem is equivalent to the CTV problem. The CTV problem has been extensively studied in literature. If C

                     The non-preemptive single machine scheduling problem to minimize the completion time variance was first addressed by Merten and Muller (1972). They showed that the variance of job completion times remains the same, when the order of the last (n
                     −1) jobs in a sequence is reversed. Schrage (1975) proved that the longest job should be the first in an optimal sequence; and stated that in an optimal sequence the second longest job should be the second and the third longest job should be the last. This conjecture was later proved by Hall and Kubiak (1991). Eilon and Chowdhury (1977) proved that the variance minimizing schedule must be V-shaped. A schedule is V-shaped when all jobs preceding the shortest job are in descending order of processing times and all jobs succeeding the shortest job are in ascending order of processing times. Many researchers investigated the CTV problem using this V-shaped property of an optimal schedule. Kanet (1981b) showed the equivalence between total squared differences in completion times (TSDC) and CTV, and proposed a heuristic procedure to solve the CTV problem. Kubiak (1993) proved that the CTV minimization problem is NP-hard. De et al. (1992) developed a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to solve this problem and obtained optimal solutions up to 100 job size. Viswanathkumar and Srinivasan (2003) proposed a branch and bound algorithm to solve the problem. Srirangacharyulu and Srinivasan (2010) proposed some heuristics for CTV minimization in single machine and multimachine (identical parallel machines) systems. They also presented an analysis of the worst case performance of their heuristic for the single machine problem.

The problem of scheduling jobs to minimize the MSD on a single machine is more complicated than the CTV problem. The MSD plot against different values of d, for a given schedule, has the minimum MSD at a value of d which is equal to the mean completion time of that schedule. This minimum may be referred to as the local minimum. Thus each schedule has its own MSD profile plotted against the due date and has its minimum at a specific value of d. If a schedule is assumed to start at time zero, an n job scheduling problem has n! possible schedules and hence the same number of local minima. The best among all these may be referred to as the global minimum. The local minimum of a schedule (sequence) corresponds to its mean completion time, and the mean completion time of any schedule, that starts at time zero, may not coincide with the given due date. Hence it is apparent that the schedule that starts at time zero and gives the minimum value of MSD at this given due date is the optimum. However, this is not true. An optimum may be obtained by delaying the start time of a schedule. This is referred to as the translation of a schedule. This point has been addressed in De et al. (1989). Among all the schedules that have their mean completion times less than the given due date d, delaying the schedule that has the best local minimum such that its mean completion time coincides with the given due date may lead to an optimal schedule.

Define d
                     ∗∗ such that, when d
                     ⩽
                     d
                     ∗∗, no schedule exists with its mean completion time less than d, and hence an optimum cannot be obtained by the translation of a schedule. The schedule (sequence) that gives the minimum MSD is the optimal schedule. If d
                     ⩽
                     d
                     ∗∗ then the problem is said to be tightly constrained. Define d
                     ∗ such that, when d
                     ⩾
                     d
                     ∗ a global minimum can be obtained. If d
                     ⩾
                     d
                     ∗ then the problem is said to be unconstrained. The unconstrained MSD problem is equivalent to the CTV problem. If d
                     ⩾
                     d
                     ∗, an optimum can be obtained by the translation of a schedule that gives the global minimum such that it’s mean completion time is equal to the due date. For any due date between d
                     ∗∗ and d
                     ∗, an optimum may be obtained by the translation of a schedule. If d
                     ∗∗
                     <
                     d
                     <
                     d
                     ∗ then the problem is said to be constrained. The given common due date may fall into one of these three regions and accordingly a problem instance may be tightly constrained, constrained or unconstrained. De, Ghosh, and Wells (1989) proposed bounds on d
                     ∗∗ and d
                     ∗ that represent the minimum value of the due date at which a local minimum and the global minimum can be attained respectively.


                     Bagchi et al. (1987) proposed a branching procedure to solve the MSD problem using several dominance properties and this procedure was found to be inadequate for solving large problems (n
                     ⩾20). De et al. (1989) showed that the branching procedure of Bagchi et al. (1987) does not guarantee optimal solution when the problem is constrained. They showed that an optimal solution may be obtained by the translation of a schedule (delaying the start of the schedule) in the constrained region. They proved that the schedule that minimizes MSD is V-about-d. A schedule is said to be V-about-d, when all jobs completing on or before the due date are in descending order of processing times and all jobs starting on or after the due date are in ascending order of processing times.


                     De et al. (1990) proposed a branch and bound algorithm using a recursive approach to solve all the versions of the MSD problem and reported results up to 40 jobs. Weng and Ventura (1996) presented a pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to solve the tightly constrained version of the MSD problem and reported results up to 100 jobs. They showed that for certain instances of the MSD problem the constrained version does not exist at all. Mondal (2002) proposed a unified pseudo-polynomial DP algorithm (hereafter referred to as SMDP), which can solve all the three versions of the problem. They obtained optimal solutions up to 600 jobs for tightly constrained instances generated by setting d
                     =
                     MS/3 where MS is the sum of processing times of all the n jobs, and up to 80 jobs for general instances.

The unconstrained MSD problem can be solved as if it is a CTV problem. When the MSD problem is constrained or tightly constrained, it cannot be solved as a CTV problem and a different approach is needed to solve the problem. Thus the problem version depends on the value of due date given and there is no efficient method available to determine apriori the values of d
                     ∗∗ and d
                     ∗ so that the problem version can be identified. In this paper we propose a solution methodology based on dynamic programming and branch and bound concepts to solve all the versions of the MSD problem.

The MSD problem is described as follows: A set N
                     ={1,2,…,
                     n} of independent jobs are to be scheduled on a single machine in order to minimize the mean squared deviation of job completion times about a common due date d. The jobs are simultaneously available for processing at time zero. The processing times of jobs are known and deterministic. Job preemption is not allowed. The machine is continuously available. The job processing times and the due date are assumed to be integers.

Let λ represents an arbitrary sequence of jobs and Λ represents the set of all sequences. A sequence is a permutation of the first n integers. Let p
                     
                        i
                      be the processing time of job i and p
                     [i] be the processing time of job in position i in a sequence. Without loss of generality, assume that the jobs are numbered such that p
                     1

                        Property 1
                        Property I in Baker and Scudder, 1990
                        


                        
                           An optimal schedule cannot have inserted idle time between jobs.
                        

Due to Property 1, the job sequence along with the start time of the first job in the sequence describes the schedule. Let (λ,
                           τ) represents any arbitrary schedule and (λ
                           ∗,
                           τ

                              i

                           τ) be the completion time of job i under schedule (λ,
                           τ), and C

                           Given any schedule, MSD is the minimum when the due date is equal to the mean completion time.
                        

Due to Property 2, the unconstrained MSD problem becomes equivalent to the CTV problem.


                           An optimal schedule that minimizes MSD is V-about-d.
                        


                           An optimal schedule that minimizes MSD is V-shaped.
                        


                           Any optimal schedule for a tightly constrained MSD problem should start at time zero.
                        


                           An optimal schedule, when obtained by translation, can have its start time as an integral multiple of (1/n).

By definition a local minimum cannot be obtained when d
                        <
                        d

                        d
                        ∗∗), its minimum MSD is obtained only beyond d. Hence for a given d if an optimum can be obtained by the translation of a schedule, it should have the start time less than or equal to (d
                        −
                        d
                        ∗∗). It should be noted that an optimal schedule has its mean completion time equal to the given due date (Property 2). The translation of a schedule results in a shift in the mean completion time.

There is no efficient method to determine the value of d
                        ∗∗. Since 
                           d
                        
                        ∗∗ gives a lower bound on d
                        ∗∗, an optimal schedule cannot have a start time later than (d
                        −
                        
                           d
                        
                        ∗∗). Any schedule that has a start time beyond (d

                        ∗∗)} denote the set of possible start times of schedules considered in order to determine an optimal schedule. Then it follows that τ

Given a partial schedule, a lower bound on MSD is presented in this Section. This lower bound has been used in the proposed algorithm. Knowing that the search space consists of [2
                        n−1
                     ×
                     n(d
                     −

                     ∗∗)] V-shaped schedules, it is hard to get an optimum by enumeration. If for a partial schedule the lower bound computed exceeds a known MSD value, the search resulting from that partial schedule can be eliminated.

In the proposed algorithm, an optimum is obtained by scheduling the jobs successively in non-increasing order of their processing times. Thus at any intermediate stage of the algorithm, there are partial schedules which are to be completed in order to attain the optimum.

                           τ) since it depends on the job that comes in position [k
                           +
                           j]. Hence such completion times are set equal to d. Therefore, the contribution of the completion times of jobs thus fixed temporarily to MSD(γ,
                           τ) is the minimum. It should be noted that the completion times of only those temporarily fixed jobs which complete beyond the due date are set to d and hence do not contribute anything to MSD(γ,
                           τ). By similar argument, it can be proved for the case of k

                     A numerical illustration is given in Appendix A to show the computation of L

Now we use Lemma 1 in Federgruen and Mosheiov (1996, p. 1546) to determine L
                     2. They studied the minimization of MSD of job completion times from a common due date on identical parallel machines. According to them, if Δ(i) denote the ith smallest completion deviation among all n jobs on all m identical parallel machines and s
                     
                        j
                      denote the cumulative processing time for the j smallest jobs, then Lemma 1 in Federgruen and Mosheiov (1996, p. 1546) states that, for any schedule without idle times

                     The value ∣ζ
                     2∣ can be even or odd. Therefore, the computation of L
                     2 is done for the two possible cases.

(a) ∣ζ
                     2∣ is even:

Consider a 15 job problem with processing times given as 85, 79, 77, 75, 72, 68, 67, 63, 50, 44, 21, 20, 15, 11, and 4. Let the first position and the last three positions are fixed in a partial schedule at stage 4 and let the start time of this partial schedule be zero. At stage 5, job 5 can be fixed either in position 2 or in position 12 as shown in Figs. 1a and 1b
                     
                      respectively. In Fig. 1a, the subproblem is to schedule the 10 shortest jobs and τ′=157. In Fig. 1b, the subproblem is to schedule the 10 shortest jobs and τ′=85. The sum of processing times of the 10 shortest jobs is equal to the length of the block (363) representing the subproblem. The positions in the sequence are shown under each job in Figs. 1a and 1b.

                     p
                     1)]. However, for τ′⩾
                     d, by updating the best schedule at the end of each stage computations, effectively the DP algorithm has to store O(nd) partial schedules. Hence, over the n stages the space complexity of the DP algorithm is O(nd).

We propose in this Section, a dynamic programming based branch and bound algorithm which is more efficient than the DP discussed in Section 4.

The advantage of the DP algorithm over the branch and bound algorithm is that in a DP approach a subproblem to be solved more than once is avoided. On the other hand, the disadvantage of using a DP algorithm is its large memory requirements of the order O(nd).

The proposed algorithm is referred to as BBDP. The breadth first branching strategy has been used in the implementation of the BBDP algorithm. Each node of the B&B tree at stage H represents a state, and each state corresponds to a partial schedule (σ
                     
                        H
                     ,
                     τ) in which the first k and last q positions are fixed such that H
                     =
                     k
                     +
                     q and the schedule starts at time τ. The next longest job (k
                     +
                     q
                     +1) can take position [k
                     +1] or [n
                     −
                     q] due to the V-shaped property of an optimal schedule and hence two nodes are generated from (σ
                     
                        H
                     ,τ). Thus at stage H, there are 2
                        H
                      partial sequences possible each with a start time τ
                     ∈
                     T resulting in a search space consisting of 2
                        H

When we use the DP recursive equations it is not necessary to carry the job sequence of a partial schedule. If we store the partial schedule at each stage so that backward working is avoided after passing through all stages of the DP in order to get the optimal sequence, the memory requirements are much greater. However, by doing this we can discard all the states of a particular stage after all the states are obtained at the next stage. This will reduce the memory requirements considerably resulting in the proposed algorithm of O[n

This idea is combined with the B&B approach, which will further reduce the search space due to pruning of the nodes using the lower bound developed. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm lies in producing optimal solutions for unconstrained problem instances up to 1000 jobs size.

The following Rule obtained from Proposition 1 can be used to reduce the search at different stages in the implementation of algorithm BBDP.


                     RULE 1. Among all the nodes at stage H with same revised due date for the subproblem, keep the node with minimum Z(·) and fathom the remaining.

                     τ)>
                     d, following Property 3 the schedule can be completed by fixing all the unscheduled jobs in SPT order, following the job in position k. Therefore each node at stage H in the tree represents a complete schedule or a subproblem with (n
                     −
                     H) shortest jobs yet to be scheduled. Each subproblem at stage H can have a start time τ′∈{0,1/n,2/n,…,
                     d}. Thus due to Rule 1 the maximum number of nodes at stage H is limited by O(nd). Thus the worst case complexity of the algorithm is O(n
                     2
                     d) in terms time as well as space. Also, as the parent node can be pruned after branching has been done, the asymptotic space complexity of the algorithm is O(nd).

We use a heuristic solution (De, Ghosh, & Wells, 1990 – Appendix B) as the upper bound (UB) on MSD so that any node in the tree with LB
                     ⩾
                     UB can be pruned. Due to the V-about-d property of an optimal schedule, complete schedules may be obtained in an intermediate stage of the tree and a better UB may be found. This will reduce the search further towards the optimum. The proposed algorithm is presented in the following section.

The procedure starts at stage 1 where the longest job is positioned as the first job or the last job in the sequence with start time τ
                        ∈

                         denote the set of partial schedules available at stage H. Generate the heuristic solution and consider this as the upper bound (UB). The step-wise procedure of the B&B algorithm is now described as follows:
                           
                              
                                 Step 1.
                              Obtain an initial solution using the heuristic procedure in De et al. (1990) and set the MSD of this solution to UB.

                                    n−2 by fixing the jobs (n
                                 −1) and n alternately in the remaining two positions and evaluate the complete schedules.

Obtain the optimal solution.

The proposed BBDP algorithm is coded in ‘C’ and runs are taken on Vega cluster with each node having an Intel Dual processor, Quad-core, 32gigabytes RAM. Optimal solutions are obtained for problem instances of different sizes varying from n
                     =10 to 1000. Processing times are generated from uniform distribution. In order to test the robustness of the BBDP algorithm, three ranges of the processing time distribution are considered for testing (Hall & Posner, 1991). The processing times are generated from U[1,100], U[1,500] and U[1,1000]. Three different due dates have been considered as d
                     =0.9MS, 0.6MS and 0.333MS. The experimental setting is shown in Table 1
                     .

Optimal solutions are obtained using BBDP for problem instances up to 1000 jobs size when the processing times are generated from U[1,100], up to 600 jobs size when the processing times are generated from U[1,500] and up to 500 jobs size when the processing times are generated from U[1,1000]. Though a few methods are available in literature, they are inferior to the SMDP algorithm. For example, the DP proposed by Weng and Ventura (1996) can be used to solve only the tightly constrained MSD problem. Therefore, we considered the SMDP algorithm as the standard for evaluating the performance of the proposed BBDP algorithm. The SMDP and BBDP algorithms are coded uniformly and both algorithms are run on the same platform. Based on our computational testing, it has been found that the SMDP algorithm is unable to solve problem instances above 250, 300 and 350 jobs for d
                     =0.9MS, 0.6MS and 0.333MS respectively, when the processing times are generated from U[1,100]. Similarly, SMDP is unable to provide optimal solutions above 160, 180 and 200 jobs for d
                     =0.9MS, 0.6MS and 0.333MS respectively, when the processing times are generated from U[1,500]. SMDP is unable to provide optimal solutions above 100, 140 and 120 jobs for d
                     =0.9MS, 0.6MS and 0.333MS respectively, when the processing times are generated from U[1,1000]. This is due to the large amount of memory needed to store the partial schedules over all stages together.

The search space explored in terms of average number of nodes evaluated (rounded to lower integer values) is reported in Tables 2–4
                     
                     
                     . From Tables 2 and 3, it is to be noted that the average number of nodes evaluated is same for BBDP when d
                     =0.9MS and 0.6MS, which is obvious as for both due date settings the problem is unconstrained. The only difference might occur in the start time of the optimal schedules. Though the CPU time and the average number of nodes evaluated for SMDP are different for d
                     =0.9MS and 0.6MS, it is found that the optimal schedules remains the same. When d
                     =0.333MS, the start time of the optimal schedule is found to be zero indicating that all the instances are tightly constrained. In all the tables the symbol ≫ indicates that the results are not obtained.

The CPU times are reported in Tables 5–7
                     
                     
                      for different combinations of due date and processing time distributions. The SMDP algorithm is more time efficient than the BBDP algorithm. However, the BBDP algorithm saves huge memory requirements and thereby able to solve problem instances of much larger size. It can be observed that the BBDP algorithm takes more CPU time when the due dates are tight. This may be due to the fact that for tighter due dates, at any stage the number of nodes pruned based on LB
                     ⩾
                     UB is relatively less and consequently the BBDP algorithm has to use Rule 1 on large number of nodes.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The problem of scheduling n jobs on a single machine with mean squared deviation minimization has been considered in this paper. Given a partial schedule, a lower bound on MSD has been developed. A dominance condition as a result of the DP recursions has been presented. Irrespective of the version of the problem, an exact algorithm of pseudo-polynomial complexity has been presented based on the ideas of branch and bound and dynamic programming. Optimal solutions are obtained for problem instances of up to 1000 jobs size. This algorithm provides a best example of the breadth first strategy implementation in branch and bound algorithms. As the mean completion time corresponding to the global minimum for CTV problem is upper bounded by

Let d
