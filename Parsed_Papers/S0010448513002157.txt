                  In modern industry conditions, it is very important to develop methodologies for reducing costs and achieving the maximum quality of machined parts, especially considering the dimensional accuracy of workpieces. Geometrical and dimensional inaccuracies are due to several factors, such as workpiece and tool deformation during machining, thermal distortions, tool wear, and machine tool inaccuracy. There are two main approaches used to improve the accuracy of workpieces: mapping the tool–workpiece displacement and altering the finishing tool path or the interpolated tool position to compensate the dimensional errors. The aim of this paper is to propose a new compensation approach, based on adaptation of the geometrical 3D CAD model used to generate trajectories by CAM software. The concept is to produce a first workpiece using a CAM-generated tool path. Then, the workpiece is measured using optical methods and the displacements between the ideal workpiece model and the measured point-cloud are calculated. Eventually, the displacement vectors are applied to calculate a compensated workpiece model. Such model is then used as a reference by CAM software to calculate the compensated tool path, which is applied for production of subsequent workpieces. The mathematical background and implementation details are given together with an example of application to a benchmark workpiece purposely machined with inaccurate tools. As the results show, the new approach was able to compensate the geometrical inaccuracies of the benchmark workpiece.

Reduction of production cost is essential for enhancing the competitiveness of manufacturing companies. Demands in terms of quality and geometrical accuracy are constantly increasing and it is very important to develop methodologies for reducing the set-up time of new products and adjust production settings to achieve the maximum quality.

For machined parts, quality is strongly related to dimensional accuracy, which depends on several factors, such as: tool condition, tool and workpiece zero setting and position accuracy, machine tool thermal distortions, geometrical inaccuracies of the machine, machine wear, static deflection of machine components and many others. Therefore, it is important to develop methodologies for identifying and compensating such disturbances in order to improve the quality level.

Many machine tool producers propose sophisticated strategies for reducing some causes of inaccuracy, however there are many aspects which have to be dealt with directly by the machine tool user. For instance, errors in the tool and workpiece positioning or set-up, workpiece and tooling structure deformation, tool wear and thermal distortion of the tool/tooling structure and workpiece are usually not handled by the machine tool control unit.

The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach for automatic compensation of geometrical and dimensional inaccuracies based on adaptation of the workpiece 3D model, which is illustrated in Fig. 1
                      in comparison to conventional methods. First, an extensive overview of the state of the art methodologies is given. Then, the concept of the new approach is presented together with its mathematical description. Finally, the approach is experimentally validated by machining a benchmark workpiece.

After an analysis of the literature dealing with methodologies for geometrical and dimensional error compensation of machining operations, the state of the art was obtained, which is synthetized in Table 1
                     . The table is organized in order to indicate the bibliographic reference, year of publication, the causes of dimensional error, the surface measurements errors, type of machining strategies–2D means contouring milling or turning, 3D means sculptured surface milling with three or more axes–and the error correction strategy.

According to literature review, the main causes of dimensional errors in machined parts can be classified into three categories: machine tool inaccuracy, tool and workpiece deflection and thermal deformation. Machine tool inaccuracy involves machine static deflection, erroneous axis control due to axis flexibility and inaccuracy of machine tool assembly. Tool and workpiece deflection is caused by relatively high cutting forces and by inadequate stiffness of tooling system or fixture. Another important source of dimensional errors is the thermal distortion of the machining system caused by the cutting process and by the mechanical power dissipated by the machine tool.

Optical or contact methods are usually applied for measuring the machine tool inaccuracy and/or the workpiece dimensional errors. Optical methods can be used to obtain, without contact, a list of tridimensional coordinates of the workpiece surface points. Alternatively, the workpiece can be inspected on a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) by using contact methods, i.e. by using a touch probe. Optical approaches are quite fast, however they are rather inaccurate compared to contact inspection methods. Recently, some authors managed to apply the touch probe directly in the machine tool  [7,8]. This is a practical approach, however the measure is affected by the errors of the machine tool.

As can be clearly seen in Table 1, the error correction strategies are tool path compensation and interpolator compensation. Tool path compensation consists in modifying the tool path points–this is generally performed only for finishing operations–in order to reduce the geometrical inaccuracies. This method can compensate all types of dimensional inaccuracies under the hypothesis that they are repeatable. This can be either obtained by modifying the Cutter Location (CL) data  [3,6] or the Numeric Control (NC) code[4,5,10,12,13,17,18]. The machining process is first executed with the nominal uncompensated tool path. Then, surface errors are measured, for instance on a CMM. A corrected tool path is generated and applied for machining of subsequent workpieces. Tool path modification is obtained by translating the control points by the same amount of the measured error. The finishing pass has to compensate both workpiece inaccuracy and tool/workpiece deflections that occurred during the previous passes, as shown in Fig. 2
                     . Therefore, an augmented finishing allowance is present in the finishing pass which may cause problems, especially when slender tools are used. In addition, it is very difficult to apply this solution in industrial conditions since the tool paths generated by commercial CAM software are difficult to modify by means of control points.

Alternatively, the displacement map of tool position as a function of the coordinates can be determined by measuring machined workpieces or estimating the tool position inaccuracy, during void movements, using high precision optical methods such as laser interferometry  [9]. The displacement map is subsequently applied to modify the finishing part program or, alternatively, to correct the interpolated tool path. It has to be pointed out that displacement maps obtained using high precision optical methods are not suitable to compensate inaccuracies derived from machining operations, such as deflections and thermal expansion of the tool and workpiece. The interpolator compensation approach is seldom feasible since many numeric controls applied in industry are proprietary and there are strong restrictions which prevent customization. Moreover, the mathematical models applied for compensation are generally very rough and inaccurate.

An overview of the proposed approach and its integration into a conventional production system is given in Fig. 3
                     . Using an STL model, the first workpiece is produced conventionally. Then, the measurement and inspection data of the first workpiece is used to derive an adapted workpiece 3D model, which is applied in the CAM software to generate a compensated tool path to be applied for further production. Specifically, the adapted workpiece 3D model is obtained, starting from a registered point cloud of the first workpiece, through the following phases:
                        
                           •
                           generation of displacement vectors;

elimination of registration errors;

compensation of the workpiece model.

The main aim of this phase is to obtain a raw displacement vector

                           –i.e. the displacement between the theoretical and effective position–for each vertex 
                              j
                            of the original STL model of the workpiece in comparison to a point cloud derived from dimensional measurements of the machined workpiece. The point cloud 
                              
                                 PC
                              
                            should first be aligned to the STL model by using a point-cloud processing software such as 3D Reshaper or MeshLab.

The algorithm is composed of the following activities. For each vertex of the STL model, the set of points

                            included in a sphere 
                              S
                            of radius

                           (a). Successively, the set of triangles surrounding the vertex are extracted from the STL file and classified according to their face normal, as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). In this way, the list of planes in the surrounding of the vertex is determined and, according to the number of planes, it is known whether the vertex is located on a surface, edge, or corner of the STL. Then, each plane is translated in order to interpolate the largest number of points belonging to

                                    S
                                 
                              
                           . According to the vertex position, the displacement vector can be defined in the following ways: 
                              
                                 (a)
                                 single plane or surface–for the Euclidean distance vector between the STL vertex and the plane;

two planes or edge–for the distance vector between the STL vertex and the planes intersection line;

three planes or corner–for the vector between the STL vertex and the three planes intersection point;

four planes or more–for the vector between the STL vertex and the barycenter of all three planes intersection points.

For a successful evaluation of displacement vectors, it is critical that the number of points 
                              
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                              
                            inside the sphere 
                              S
                            is sufficiently high and evenly distributed among planes. Plane interpolation is in fact unreliable if based on a low number of points (from the author’s experience less than 5 points), and the method cannot be applied. In order to illustrate this, let us consider a sphere 
                              S
                            of radius

                            and a plane 
                              P
                            located at a distance

                            from the sphere center. Let us suppose that point are evenly distributed around plane

                            with density

In order to apply a smooth deformation of the STL vertices, an original approach for STL model compensation based on the solution of an equivalent truss structure with compliant constraints was applied. The concept of the approach is represented in Fig. 6
                        .

The vertices of the STL become the joints of an equivalent truss structure, which is also composed of beams of elastic modulus

                         connecting each vertex to the rest position of the compliant constraint.

The compensated STL vertices positions are obtained by solving the equilibrium equation of the truss structure.

                         ratio which determines the compromise between effective compensation of the displacement and preservation of the model shape. An example of the difference between the original model, displacement vectors and the new model is given in Fig. 7
                        .

The automatic regeneration of tool trajectories is based on direct substitution of the reference to the file of CAD model used by the CAM software for calculating offset and collision detection. This is possible when the CAM software allows a reference to an external file for this specific purpose. For instance, the following procedure was adopted by the CAM software used in this paper (OPEN MIND HyperMILL). Firstly, a CAD model of the workpiece was given as input to the CAM software. This was used as a static reference for visualization and boundaries definition. Then, another model–linked as external reference–was assigned for tool trajectory calculation and collision detection. An example of re-calculated trajectories is given in Fig. 8
                        .

However, it should be noticed that this approach may not be applicable for machining strategies which are based on feature recognition.

The error compensation approach was validated using a benchmark workpiece designed for the purpose, which is shown in Fig. 9
                     . The 3D CAD model of the workpiece, shown in Fig. 9(a), was generated in Siemens Solid Edge ST5 environment and exported in STL file format. Since the CAD software automatically minimizes the number of triangles, the obtained STL was not uniformly meshed, see Fig. 9(b). Accordingly, the STL file was further processed in Mathworks Matlab in order to obtain a remeshed STL, with a more uniform vertex distribution, which is illustrated in Fig. 9(c). The remeshing algorithm consisted in splitting iteratively each triangle whose longest side was longer than 2 mm into smaller triangles and an STL with 56950 vertices and 113896 faces was obtained.

The remeshed STL was then imported and linked in CAM environment and the list of working cycle strategies was defined. The stock was a cylindrical workpiece of 100 mm diameter and 55 mm height made of Al 6068 aluminum alloy. The list of machining strategies and cutting parameters is given in Table 2
                     , whereas tool details are reported in Table 3
                     . After machining strategies definition, the tool trajectories were automatically calculated by CAM and a CL file was obtained. An example of the tool trajectories generated by CAM is given in Fig. 10
                     (a).

In order to produce a workpiece with a significant dimensional inaccuracy and test the capabilities of the proposed automatic compensation approach, the diameters of the tools defined in the CAM software were slightly different from the diameters of the tools applied for machining, as highlighted in Table 3. Specifically, a 0.2 mm larger tool diameter was specified in the CAM environment to the cylindrical end-mill, tool 2. Similarly, a 0.1 mm larger nose radius was assigned to the hemispherical end-mill, tool 4. By so doing, a residual stock material was left by the cutting process, simulating the effect of a significant tool deflection, tool wear, wrong tool selection or wrong tool presetting. It is important to point out that only the radial tool position was affected, whereas the axial tool position was exact. Axial inaccuracies were neglected since they are not realistic.

The CL file generated by CAM was post-processed and machining operation was performed on an Okuma Multus B300W multi-function CNC center, as shown in Fig. 10(b).

                     . These problems were caused by inaccuracies in the workpiece measurement or in the calculation of the displacement vectors which were not sufficiently filtered out by the compensation approach and thus produced a defective tool trajectory. A good balance between the amount of the compensation and the preservation of the geometry of the compensated STL was

A second physical workpiece was machined with the relative NC using the compensated tool trajectories and then measured. According to the CMM measurement of the second workpiece, a satisfactory compensation of geometrical inaccuracies affecting the first workpiece was achieved. An example of the CMM measurement of a section of the hemispherical part of the first and second workpiece is given in Fig. 15

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, an innovative methodology for automatic compensation of geometrical and dimensional errors of machined mechanical parts, based on workpiece 3D CAD model adaptation, has been presented. The concept of the method and the complete mathematical background for its implementation have been illustrated.

The core of the method is an innovative algorithm for altering the 3D STL model of the workpiece in order to compensate its geometrical inaccuracies. It is based on the determination of the displacement vectors for each vertex of the STL and the solution of the equilibrium equation of an equivalent truss structure with compliant constraints. The ratio between the stiffness of truss beams and that of compliant constraints was critical to obtain a smooth compensation without defects.

Also, for automatic regeneration of the tool trajectory with a commercial CAM system, the CAM environment should fulfill some requirements. Specifically, it should be able to handle the workpiece model as an external reference. In this way, the compensated model was applied for regeneration of trajectories simply by updating the reference.

For validation, the innovative methodology was applied to a real benchmark workpiece whose first prototype was machined with wrong tool geometry specifications. With the obtained compensated tool trajectory, an accurate workpiece was machined.

The results show that the approach is feasible and it can be integrated in a relatively simple way in enterprise engineering procedures. However, its applicability is mainly limited to correction of macroscopic errors due to the need of fast and high density surface measurement tools, such as optical scanning devices, which are quite imprecise. With the availability of more precise superficial scanning techniques, the range of application of the method could be extended.

Another interesting future development would be to integrate the method into CAM software, thus compensation may be applied during tool path calculation directly.

It will be of further interest to continue the research in this field by improving the methodology in order to create an integrated system for automatic compensation of geometrical inaccuracies.
