                  This paper introduces a new scheme for encrypting images with a few details based on wavelet fusion. In this scheme, the image with a few details to be encrypted is fused with another image that is rich in details utilizing the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) prior to encryption. The fusion is a pre-processing step to change the homogeneity of flat areas in the images having a few details. RC6 or chaotic Baker map encryption are then performed on the fused image. Encryption with chaotic Baker map is just a permutation algorithm that cannot perform well on flat areas of the images, because the permutation yields approximately the same intensities. So, circular shifts on pixels are performed on the fused image prior to chaotic encryption to remove flat areas or reduce the degree of homogeneity. Chaotic encryption is then performed in the wavelet domain to increase the degree of diffusion. Several metrics are used in this paper for performance evaluation of the suggested ciphering schemes like visual inspection, histogram test, encryption quality analysis, and diffusion analysis. The robustness of the suggested image ciphering schemes is tested in the presence of noise before decryption. Simulation results demonstrated that the suggested image ciphering schemes provide a secure and effective way for encrypting images with few details.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Now, the security becomes a significant problem in telecommunication and image protection. Ciphering is considered as an efficient method to realize security. Image ciphering is employed in video conferencing, mobile multimedia systems, military communications, telecommunications, and telemedicine [1,2]. Image ciphering schemes are divided into confusion-based schemes and diffusion-based schemes. Encryption for the purpose of transmission over wireless channels is preferred to be implemented with confusion-based schemes, because diffusion-based schemes are sensitive to the accumulation of errors [3]. So, chaos-based algorithms have shown their superiority for image encryption [4].

Encryption of images with few details is a challenging task for most encryption algorithms. Block cipher algorithms like the RC6 algorithm fail in hiding the details of these images, because the pixel values incorporated into the encryption of a certain area of the image are very close. Also, spatial domain chaotic ciphering has a disadvantage of keeping an identical histogram to that of the plainimage. A solution to such problem is based on performing some type of pre-processing on the image prior to encryption to remove homogeneity of flat areas. This pre-processing step can be a fusion with another image that is rich in details.

Image fusion can be considered as a process that merges different images together to construct a single image [6–9]. In this paper, the target is totally different from that of traditional fusion algorithms, which aim at integrating information from different realizations of the same scene. Fusion is performed here with a totally different image from the image to be encrypted to create as much randomness as possible in the obtained image. This process is expected to increase encryption efficiency.


                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     The remaining paper sections are arranged with the following order. Section 2 presents image fusion with the wavelet transform. Section 3 introduces the suggested image ciphering schemes. Section 4 presents results and analysis. Noise effect on the decryption process is explored in Section 5. In Section 6, conclusions are given.

The DWT represents a compromise between the spatial and frequency domain representations. The DWT processes the signal at various frequency bands with various resolutions through decomposing the signal into a low frequency component (approximation) and high frequency components (details). The DWT employs scaling and wavelet functions. The 2-D DWT is employed through performing a 1-D DWT on rows and columns of the 2-D data. Fig. 1 shows the process of applying the 2-D DWT to an image with a bank of filters, where L and H represent low-pass and high-pass filters, respectively, and ↓2 denotes the down sampling by two. The finite impulse response filter coefficients of the low-pass and high-pass filters in both decomposition (L, H) and reconstruction (

The image fusion process is performed between the original image and an auxiliary image of rich details. The wavelet fusion is widely used for image fusion [8], in which wavelet coefficients of transformed images are merged in the DWT using defined fusion rule, and then the result is subjected to inverse DWT to obtain the final fused image. Wavelet fusion can be represented by taking the DWT W of the two images I

The averaging rule is adopted in this paper for the fusion of the image to be encrypted and an auxiliary image. It performs an averaging of values from the two wavelet-transformed images at each position. The selection of the averaging fusion rule aims at making the decryption process possible if the auxiliary image is known at the receiver. The steps of wavelet-based image fusion scheme are:

                        
                           1.
                           The forward DWT is performed for the image with few details and the auxiliary image to obtain the approximation and detail coefficients to be fused.

Coefficient combination according to a certain fusion rule (averaging) is performed to get the fused coefficients.

Inverse DWT of the fused coefficients is employed to get the fused image.


                     Fig. 3 shows a medical image with few details and its histogram. It is clear that the histogram is approximately binary-valued. So, it is difficult to encrypt this image with traditional encryption algorithms. This figure also shows the result of the fusion of this image with Lena image and how the resulting image histogram has changed in a manner, which makes encryption easier. Figs. 4–8 show similar examples for 512 × 512 gray-scale Medical, Logo, Chessboard, Fingerprint, Nike, and Tux images with a few details, respectively. Fusion has also a great effect on the resulting image histogram.

Two schemes for encrypting images with few details are suggested. The first scheme includes two steps as shown in Fig. 9(a). Firstly, the image fusion is performed on the original and auxiliary images. After that, encryption is performed with the RC6 algorithm. The second one includes three steps illustrated in Fig. 9(b). Firstly, the image fusion is performed. After that, encryption is performed in two steps; circular shifts of pixels and chaotic Baker map randomization.

After the pre-processing image fusion step, the fused image is subjected to pixel-level shifts. This is achieved using a secret key provided by a Pseudo-Noise (PN) sequence generator. The permutation process is performed by applying the secret key to both rows and columns of the plain image. If the secret key bit is 1, the corresponding row is circularly shifted to the right by a number of shifts equal to the row number minus one (e.g. row number 4 is shifted 3 times). If the secret key bit is 0, the corresponding row stays unchanged as depicted in Table 1. The permutation process is performed on the columns of the resulting image in a similar way using the same secret key as illustrated in Table 2.
                     

The Baker map randomization is applied on the image resulting from fusion and circular shifts, but in the wavelet domain to enhance the diffusion level of the encryption process [13,14]. The Baker map randomization for an N × N square matrix is performed through the following steps:

                           
                              1.
                              The matrix is split to k vertical rectangles of height N and width ni
                                 , where n
                                 1 + n
                                 2 + …nk
                                  = N.

The vertical rectangles are expanded horizontally.

After that, the rectangles are accumulated in a way that makes the left one at the bottom and the right one at the top.

The discretized chaotic Baker map should allocate every pixel to another location using a confusion way in which every pixel of the square matrix takes its new location according to this map. Let B(n1, … ,nk
                        ), denote the discretized chaotic Baker map, such that the vector, [n
                        1, … ,nk
                        ], represents the secret key S, N is the number of pixels in one row, the secret key is selected in a way that every integer ni
                         divides N, and Ni
                         = n
                        1 + …+ ni

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

Efficient encryption must be immune to attacks like brute-force attacks, ciphertext only attack, plaintext attack, differential attack, and statistical attacks [3]. A course of experiments is employed to investigate the performance of the two proposed image encryption schemes under different attacks. The first scheme has been implemented using wavelet fusion and RC6. The second one is implemented with wavelet fusion and chaotic Baker map. The auxiliary 512 × 512 Lena image is used in the wavelet fusion step and its entropy is equal to 7.3479. The 512 × 512 gray-scale Medical, Logo, Chessboard, Fingerprint, Nike, and Tux images with a few details have been used. Evaluation of the obtained results is based on visual inspection, encryption quality, and immunity to noise [16–18].

The visual inspection is one of the important factors in examining the encrypted image. The results of encrypting the images with a few details using the traditional and the proposed image encryption schemes are shown in Figs. 11–16 for the Medical, Logo, Chessboard, Fingerprint, Nike, and Tux images, respectively. It is clear that the encryption with the proposed schemes succeeds in hiding the details of the images.

The entropy metric is utilized to assess and evaluate the produced encrypted image. It is used to measure the amount of the information contained in the image, and it can be computed as [5]:

                         of ith point is its grayness value, and p is its probability. It is said that the image is better if it has a large E value. The entropy values for the original, fused and encrypted images are illustrated in Table 3. We notice that the fused and encrypted images entropy with the two proposed encryption schemes is higher than the entropy of original images. Baker map does not change the entropy of its inputs as it is just a permutation map.


                        Figs. 17–22 show the histograms of the encrypted versions of the Medical, Logo, Chessboard, Fingerprint, Nike, and Tux images with different schemes, respectively. Results confirm that the histogram of the encrypted image with the first proposal (wavelet fusion with RC6) is uniformly distributed and dissimilar from original image histogram for all images with few details. The encrypted images histograms with the second proposal (wavelet fusion, circular shifts and Baker map) contain several gray-scale levels with different probabilities, and they are dissimilar from those of the original images. Encryption with chaotic Baker map cannot alter the encrypted image histogram from that of the original image. To get rid of this limitation, the circular pixel shifts and the wavelet transform achieve the required degree of diffusion and confusion.
                        
                     

Encryption quality metrics such as the correlation coefficient between the source image and the ciphered image rxy
                        , the irregular deviation DI
                         and the histogram deviation DH
                         have been considered for performance comparison between the different encryption schemes. The correlation coefficient rxy
                         is estimated between the source image x and the ciphered image y, when arranged as 1-D sequences as follows [3,19–20]:

                        where h(i) denotes the encrypted image histogram at level i, and MH
                         denotes the mean value of an assumed uniform histogram for an ideally encrypted image. The objective is to obtain as low DI
                         as possible. The correlation coefficient and deviation metrics values for the encrypted images are given in Table 4
                        . We notice that the performance of the proposed schemes for encrypting images with few details is better than the RC6 and chaotic Baker map.


                        A significant feature of the proposed schemes for encrypting images with few details is the high sensitivity with respect to tiny changes in the plain-image.

To inspect the impact of a one-pixel variation on the image ciphered with the proposed schemes, we utilize two popular estimations; the Number-of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) and the Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI). If we have two ciphered images C1
                         and C2
                        with their equivalent plain-images having just one-pixel difference. The gray-scale values of the pixels at grid (i, j) in C
                        1 and C
                        2 are C
                        1(i, j) and C
                        2(i, j). Assume a bipolar array (D) with equal size as the images C
                        1 and C
                        2. Then, D(i, j) is estimated using C
                        1(i, j) and C
                        2(i, j). If C
                        1(i, j) = C2
                        (i, j), then D(i, j) = 1; otherwise, D(i, j) = 0. The NPCR is computed as:

It calculates the average intensity of differences between the two images. The results of this test illustrated in Table 5 show the impact of one-pixel change influence on the six images used above.
                     

The obtained results demonstrated that the RC6 and chaotic Baker map encryption schemes are not sensitive with respect to tiny changes in the plain-image, but the two proposed schemes have high sensitivity with respect to tiny changes in the plain-image.

We have also tested the robustness of the proposed image encryption schemes to the presence of noise in the decryption process.

The Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is utilized to evaluate the decrypted image quality. It is estimated as:

                        (i, j) is decrypted image pixel value at location (i, j). High values of the PSNR imply better immunity to noise. The noise immunity test results are given in Tables 6
                         and 7
                        . The test results demonstrate that the RC6 and the proposed wavelet fusion with RC6 cryptosystems are very sensitive to noise. So, they may be utilized in a noise-free environment. The chaotic Baker map and the proposed wavelet fusion, circular shifts with the Baker map cryptosystems are more robust to noise and can work in a noisy environment. The performances of the RC6 and the proposed wavelet fusion with RC6 cryptosystems are deteriorated in the presence of noise, because the RC6 has a diffusion mechanism in its equation f(x) = x(2x + 1)mod(2
                           w
                        ), which results in less noise immunity.

                          regions. The higher the value of the SSIM, the better is the immunity to noise. The results of the noise immunity tests are tabulated in Table 8
                        . These results confirm that the chaotic Baker map and the proposed wavelet fusion with circular shifts, and Baker map cryptosystems are significantly efficient in the presence of noise. So, they can be employed in noisy environments.

                        (x) is the total similarity between the two images, and PCm
                        (x) is the phase congruency value. The higher the value of the FSIM, the better is the immunity to noise. Noise immunity results are tabulated in Table 9
                        . Test results ensure again that both the chaotic Baker map and the proposed wavelet fusion with circular shifts and Baker map cryptosystems are not affected significantly by noise. So, they can work efficiently in noisy environments.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Wavelet fusion has been used as an efficient pre-processing tool for encrypting images with few details. Simulation results have ensured that wavelet fusion of the image at hand with another image that is rich in detail helps destroying the similarity between regions in the image with few details. Several metrics have been used for performance evaluation of the proposed encryption schemes. The robustness of the proposed schemes to the presence of noise in the decryption process has also been investigated. We can come to a conclusion that the proposed encryption scheme that uses wavelet fusion, circular shifts, and Baker map has succeeded in hiding the information in the images to be encrypted, but at the cost of a slight reduction in the visual quality of the decrypted image in the presence of noise. So, this proposed scheme can work properly in noisy environments. On the other hand, the proposed scheme that uses wavelet fusion and RC6 can successfully hide the information in the images to be encrypted, but at the cost of a considerable reduction in the visual quality of the decrypted image in the presence of noise. So, this scheme is more suitable for noise-free environments.
