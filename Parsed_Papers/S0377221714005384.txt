                  In some important group decision making, a moderator representing the collective interest, who has predetermined, and possesses an effective leadership and strong interpersonal communication and negotiation skills, is crucial to the consensus reaching. In the process of consensus reaching, the moderator needs to persuade each individual to change his/her opinion towards a consensus opinion by paying a minimum cost, while the individuals have to modify and to gradually approach this consensus opinion by expecting to obtain a maximum compensation. This paper, which proposes two kinds of minimum cost models with regard to all the individuals and one particular individual respectively, shows the economic significance of these two models by exploring their dual models grounded in the primal–dual linear programming theory, and builds the conditions under which these two models have the same optimal consensus opinion. The validity of the theoretical analysis is confirmed by numerical examples.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Group decision making (GDM) (Arrow, 1963; Palomares, Liu, Xu, & Martínez, 2012) requires the subjective judgment of a number of decision makers (DMs) to solve complex and unstructured problems, such as negotiations and conflict resolutions. In the process of GDM, different DMs may represent different interest groups, and may have different values or preferences even they have the same interest. In a GDM, most DMs may eventually arrive at a certain degree of consensus associated with the most relevant alternatives after thought-provocative discussions and many round of negotiations. The consensus decision making (Eklund, Rusinowska, & De Swart, 2007, 2008; French, 1981; Lehrer & Wagner, 1981; Liu & Zhang, 2013; Palomares, Martínez, & Herrera, 2014) is the base of making group choices. In recent years, abundant achievements have been made in the fields of consensus measure and consensus modeling.

Consensus measure is mainly about the similarity or dissimilarity among DMs’ opinions (preferences, interests). The early literatures suggest a “hard” approach (Bezdek, Spillman, & Spillman, 1978; Spillman, Bezdek, & Spillman, 1979) to measure the consensus level of a group, where the value of consensus level is between 0 and 1. The closer to 1 the index is, the higher consensus level is achieved; and conversely, the closer to 0 the index is, the lower consensus level is. The “hard” approach to consensus modeling is based on the premise that a full agreement within the group has been arrived at, which is also called a Utopian consensus by Tapia García, Del Moral, Martínez, and Herrera-Viedma (2012). It is difficult to achieve such a complete consensus (Cabrerizo, Moreno, Pérez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2010). Kacprzyk and Fedrizzi (1986, 1988, 1989), Kacprzyk and Fedrizzi (1989, 1992, 1997) and Fedrizzi, Kacprzyk, and Nurmi (1993) propose a “soft” method instead of the “hard” approach to measure the consensus level which is also referred as “soft” consensus degree level (Chiclana, Tapia Garcia, del Moral, & Herrera-Viedma, 2013). Since the key elements in GDM are based on human thinking and subjective judgment, most experts only expect to reach a fuzzy-majority-sense consensus at the best. The development of soft decision making theories such as fuzzy decision making theory and linguistic decision making theory provides a rich tool to the “soft” approach-oriented research over recent years (Ben-Arieh & Chen, 2006; Bezdek et al., 1978; Cabrerizo, Alonso, Pérez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2008; Carlsson et al., 1992; Dong, Xu, & Li, 2008; Fedrizzi, Kacprzyk, & Zadrozny, 1988, 1999, 2007; Tapia García et al., 2012; Herrera-Viedma, Martinez, Mata, & Chiclana, 2005; Kacprzyk & Fedrizzi, 1989; Kacprzyk et al., 1997; Parreiras, Ekel, & Morais, 2012; Xu, Wu, & Zhang, 2014; Xu, Li, & Wang, 2013; Xu & Cai, 2013). Usually, “soft” consensus degree level is computed by distance metrics such as Euclidean, Cosine and Jaccard distance functions. Recently, Chiclana et al. (2013) prove that different distance functions have significantly different effects on the speed of achieving consensus by exploring a statistical comparative method.

The optimization consensus modeling is based on the assumption that there exists an optimum consensus opinion such that deviations between this opinion and individual DMs’ opinions should be as small as possible. The aggregation model supposes that there exists a suitable aggregation operator that would be able to aggregate all the individual DMs’ opinions to the consensus opinion (Ben-Arieh & Easton, 2007; Ben-Arieh, Easton, & Evans, 2009; Dong, Xu, Li, & Feng, 2010; Dong, Li, Xu, & Gu, 2014; Fu & Yang, 2010, 2011, 2012; Xu et al., 2013; Xu, 2009, 2012; Xu & Cai, 2011; Zhang, Dong, Xu, & Li, 2011; Zhang, Dong, & Xu, in press). Technically, consensus models are mostly constructed by using methods of optimization, and belong to the “hard” approach. However, each optimization model is constructed on the assumption that individual DMs’ opinions do not exceed a tolerated error of consensus opinion after many times of dynamically revisions and modifications (Bryson, 1996, 1997; Bryson & Joseph, 1999; Dong et al., 2014; Zhang et al., in press). It means that consensus modeling is actually a combination of “soft” and “hard” approaches.

In the last few years, the rapid development of web technologies provides much more convenient platforms for larger number of users from all over the world to freely communicate, share and exchange ideas. Therefore, consensus modeling also needs to incorporate the feedback mechanism during consensus decision making: Alonso, Pérez, Cabrerizo, and Herrera-Viedma (2013) explore a novel linguistic consensus model for Web 2.0 communities, which increases the speed of consensus convergence; Pérez, Cabrerizo, Alonso, and Herrera-Viedma (2014) build up a new consensus model, which specially considers the heterogeneity of DMs; and Pérez, Wikström, Mezei, Carlsson, and Herrera-Viedma (2013) develop a consensus model by using the power of a fuzzy ontology, which deals with the psychology of negotiation. In many consensus decision making, it takes time, requires efforts, and then needs to pay cost to convince DMs to shift their opinions during the feedback process. To model this kind of consensus decision making, Ben-Arieh and Easton (2007) develop a minimum cost consensus model to obtain the optimal convergence point of all DMs: A moderator who represents the collective interest to help reach the consensus is introduced during consensus process, where he/she has been predetermined and possesses an effective leadership and strong interpersonal communication and negotiation skills (Bryson, 1996; Cabrerizo et al., 2008, 2010; Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Verdegay, 1996; Herrera-Viedma et al., 2005, Herrera-Viedma, Alonso, Chiclana, & Herrera, 2007, 2014; Mata, Martínez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2009; Palomares et al., 2012, 2014; Pérez et al., 2013; Tapia García et al., 2012). On one hand, the moderator tries his/her best to convince most of the individuals to conform to the collective interest or value by spending all possible forms of resources, such as material, financial, human, and information. He/She always wishes that the amount of resources he/she spends is as small as possible (Ben-Arieh & Easton, 2007; Ben-Arieh et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011). On the other hand, every individual DM has an eye on his/her own benefit. Each individual DM hopes that his/her opinion deserves to be particularly considered, or he/she should show the significance and value of himself/herself by playing an important role in the consensus decision making. When they have to change their opinions or they offer more useful opinions, they deserve to be compensated or to be rewarded. Each individual DM always hopes that his/her return is as big as possible. The minimum cost and the maximum return are respectively, the moderator’s optimum objective and the individual DMs’ optimum objective, and they are dual to each other mathematically, making it helpful to further explore the consensus reaching problem by considering both minimum cost and maximum return.

Considering the moderator’s interest, Ben-Arieh and Easton (2007) and Ben-Arieh et al. (2009) suggest a consensus model with linear minimum cost and a consensus models with quadratic cost respectively, to obtain the optimum consensus opinion. Recently, Zhang et al. (2011) and Zhang, Dong, and Xu (2013) generalized Ben-Arieh and Easton’s work by proposing a novel consensus model with aggregation operators to obtain the maximum consensus degree under the given cost budget. However, there is few research on consensus model considering the individuals’ interests. Actually, the process of consensus reaching needs balancing both the moderator’s and the individuals’ interests. The theories of primal–dual optimal programming will help to discuss how to obtain an optimum consensus opinion by preserving the benefits of both sides.

This paper discusses two kinds of consensus decision making problems by constructing primal–dual linear programming models. The first is that when all individuals are taken into account as a whole, a primal problem of minimum cost and its dual problem of maximum return for reaching the greatest consensus regarding all the individuals are developed. Secondly, when most individuals’ opinions do not exceed the tolerated error (or mathematically, in the neighborhood) of consensus opinion as suggested by the moderator, the individual DMs accept the consensus opinion but expect nothing about the return, while only a few DMs insist on their opinions unless the moderator pays more to them, this means that they accept the consensus opinion conditionally. For convenience, we suppose that there is only one individual who needs to be paid. Hence, a primal problem of minimum cost and its dual problem of maximum return for reaching the greatest consensus regarding one individual are also investigated.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the description of our problem. Section 3 constructs the primal–dual models based on the minimum cost consensus problem and the maximum return regarding all individuals. Section 4 discusses the economic significance of the primal–dual models by introducing its dual properties and exploring their relationship. Similarly, Section 5 establishes the primal–dual models based on the minimum cost and maximum return regarding only one individual, and investigates the economic significance of these models. Section 6 builds the conditions under which these two kinds of primal–dual models have the same optimal consensus opinion. Lastly, conclusion and problems for the future research are provided in Section 7.

From the viewpoint of the moderator, he/she hopes to achieve the greatest consensus while paying the minimum cost to all the individuals. And from the viewpoint of each individual, he/she expects to gain the maximum compensation for his/her changing opinions. Mathematically, these two goals are dual to each other. Next, we construct two consensus models of mathematical programming, and explore the relationship between these models.

                      can be considered to be the minimum total cost for obtaining the greatest consensus. The restriction condition (2–1) denotes the limits of the deviation between the consensus opinion and individual’s opinion. Obviously, the cost of arriving at the greatest consensus is as small as possible under the restriction conditions (2–1) and (2–2). Next, we further explore the specific meaning in economics by discussing the dual problem of Model (2). With the primal–dual theory of linear programming, the dual problem of Model (2) is as follows:

                      is considered to be the total return that is expected by all individuals for changing their opinions toward the consensus. It is obvious that what all the individuals want is for the return to be as large as possible. The value 
                        
                           max
                           
                           ψ
                        
                      denotes the maximum return of all the individuals. Because the “return” is actually a shadow price, its real meaning is referred to as the “expected return” but not the true return.

Given the analysis above, the following three questions arise naturally:
                        
                           (4.1a)
                           What is the relation between the maximum return 
                                 
                                    max
                                    
                                    ψ
                                 
                               of all the individuals and the minimum cost 
                                 
                                    min
                                    
                                    ϕ
                                 
                               of the moderator?

Do the consensus opinion and the unit return (shadow profit) have practical significance (do optimal solutions of Models (2) and (4) exist)?

The economic meaning implied in the Principle of Weak Duality is that the total return 
                           
                              ψ
                           
                         expected by all the individual DMs for changing their opinions is less than or equal to the cost 
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                         paid by the moderator for reaching a consensus. That is, the cost the moderator incurs can sufficiently satisfy the total demand all the individuals collectively claim, where we suppose that all individual DMs are relatively rational and do not claim more than they expect. Clearly, this conclusion holds in many real-life situations.

The economic meaning implied in the Principle of Optimality Criterion is that the total return 
                           
                              Max

                         expected by all the individual DMs for changing their opinions equals the cost

                              ϕ
                           
                         paid by the moderator for reaching a consensus. In other words, the optimal result of reaching consensus is that all the individuals obtain the maximum return that they expect, while the moderator pays the minimum resources that he/she is prepared to pay.

The economic meaning implied in the Principle of Sufficient Optimality Criterion is that if the total return 
                           
                              Max
                              
                              ψ
                           
                         expected by all individual DMs for changing their opinions is equal to the cost 
                           
                              Min
                              
                              ϕ
                           
                         paid by the moderator for reaching a consensus, then the consensus opinion and the unit return (shadow profit) have practical economic meaning (optimal solutions exist), or the economic meaning can be interpreted.

If either the primal problem 
                           
                              LP
                              (

                         or the dual problem 
                           
                              DLP

                         has an optimal feasible solution, then so does the other problem and the two optimal objective values are equal. That is, 
                           
                              Max

                              Min
                              
                              ϕ
                           
                        .

The economic meaning implied in the Principle of Strong Duality is that.
                           
                              •
                              once a consensus is reached (i.e., the optimal solution of the primal problem exists and hence the consensus opinion exists), the unit returns expected by all the individual DMs for changing their opinions have economic meaning (the shadow profit exists);

if the unit returns expected by all individual DMs for changing their opinions are solved (i.e., the optimal solution to the dual problem exists and hence the shadow profit exists), then the optimal solution to the primal problem exists and hence consensus has been reached and vice versa;

as long as either the unit return or the consensus opinion has been solved, the total return expected by all the individual DMs for changing their opinions is equal to the cost paid by the moderator for reaching the consensus.

Aiming at problem (4.1c) above, Theorem 1 actually presents a sufficient and necessary condition that an individual DM’s unit return or shadow profit is equal to the real unit compensation paid by the moderator. That is, when the sum of one part of individual DMs’ unit returns is exactly equal to the sum of the rest part of individual DMs’ unit returns, the unit return or shadow price

                        Theorem 2 implies that when the consensus opinion is greater than an individual DM’s opinion, then the value of the expected unit return of this individual DM is negative; and when the consensus opinion is lower than an individual DM’s opinion, the value of the expected unit return of this individual DM is positive. Under these two circumstances, the absolute value of the expected unit return of the individual DM must be equal to the real compensation paid to him/her.


                        Theorem 2 actually presents a condition under which a unit return expected by an individual DM is equal to a unit compensation paid by the moderator. Thus we have the following corollary.

                        Theorem 3 indicates that if an individual DM’s expected unit return is lower than the real unit compensation paid by the moderator, the individual DM’s opinion must be equal to the consensus opinion. This result actually provides a condition under which an individual DM’s opinion is exactly equal to the consensus opinion.

In some group decision making, the moderator proposes a relatively ideal opinion after many rounds of negotiation and communication. But he/she has to consider the following two cases:
                        
                           (i)
                           Most individual DMs feel that the moderator’s opinion is within the deviation limits of their own opinions. So they are happy to accept this opinion. And the moderator does not need to pay out any compensation. Mathematically, there exists an allowed deviation

                         may insist on his/her opinion, or may care about him/her being recognized as serious.

Obviously, the condition of Theorem 8 is more relaxed than that of Theorem 7.

A kind of consensus model regarding all individual DMs and a kind of consensus model regarding only one individual DM have been investigated in this paper: A minimum cost primal model and its dual model – a maximum return model for reaching greatest consensus – have been developed from the standpoint of all the individual DMs. Our results show that once a consensus is arrived at, the maximum return expected by all the individual DMs for changing their original opinions and the minimum cost paid by the moderator for persuading all individual DMs to accept the consensus opinion are equal; the existence of optimization solutions to the primal–dual models with all individual DMs implicates that both the consensus opinion and the shadow profits have economic significance. The optimality criterion and the principle of complementary slackness of the primal–dual models clarify the interrelation between the unit return or shadow profit expected by each individual DM and the unit cost or compensation paid by the moderator.

                      based on the minimum cost with a particular individual DM and its dual problem have also been explored from the standpoint of the particular individual DM. It is proven that once a consensus is arrived at, the maximum return expected by the particular individual DM for changing his/her original opinion and the minimum cost paid by the moderator for persuading this DM to accept the consensus opinion are equal; the existence of optimization solutions to the primal–dual models with respect to the particular individual DM explains that both the consensus opinion and the shadow profit have economic significance. The optimality criterion and the principle of complementary slackness of the primal–dual models with a particular individual expound the interrelation between the unit return or shadow profit expected by the particular individual DM and the unit cost or compensation paid by the moderator. The close interrelation between these two kinds of consensus models is also investigated, showing that when certain conditions met, the optimal consensus opinions derived by these two models are identical.

This paper focuses on the cost model of consensus reaching. In our consensus models, distance measure can more intuitionally reflect the deviation between the individual DMs’ opinions and the consensus opinion. The equivalent linear programming model transformed by nonlinear programming model 
                        
                           P
                           (
                           w
                           )
                        
                      (Ben-Arieh et al., 2009) has two merits: It is easier to get the optimal solution of a linear programming than that of a nonlinear programming; It is more convenient to analyze the economic significance of the primal–dual linear programming models. That is, we can not only build up relation between the minimum cost paid by the moderator and the maximum return expected by the individuals, but also explore the relation between the consensus opinion, the individual opinion, the shadow profit expected by the individual, and the unit cost paid by the moderator. In a word, the economic analysis of our primal–dual linear programming model considers both sides of the interests: the moderator’s cost and the individuals’ return, so it conforms to the process of practical consensus reaching.

However, consensus reaching is so complex in many GDM that a simple model can not fully simulate the whole process of consensus. Consensus reaching consists of different stages, and the individual DMs’ opinions may change gradually during each stage. Obtaining a satisfied consensus needs to consider different stages and different conditions of consensus decision making, the teams of Herrera-Viedma et al. (Alonso et al., 2013; Chiclana et al., 2013; Pérez et al., 2013, 2014) have done a series work on consensus in GDM, consensus measures, consensus and fuzzy ontologies, consensus software tools, and etc. In the future, we will construct a dynamic cost model to simulate the process of consensus reaching.
