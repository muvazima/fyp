                  Haul truck drivers at surface mines are exposed to whole-body vibration for extended periods. Thirty-two whole-body vibration measurements were gathered from haul trucks under a range of normal operating conditions. Measurements taken from 30 of the 32 trucks fell within the health guidance caution zone defined by ISO2631-1 for an 8 h daily exposure suggesting, according to ISO2631-1, that “caution with respect to potential health risks is indicated”. Maintained roadways were associated with substantially lower vibration amplitudes. Larger trucks were associated with lower vibration levels than small trucks. The descriptive nature of the research, and small sample size, prevents any strong conclusion regarding causal links. Further investigation of the variables associated with elevated vibration levels is justified.
               
               
                  Relevance to industry
                  The operators of mining equipment such as haul trucks are exposed to whole-body vibration amplitudes which have potential to lead to long term health effects. Systematic whole-body vibration measurements taken at frequent intervals are required to provide an understanding of the causes of elevated vibration levels and hence determine appropriate control measures.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Long term exposure to high amplitude whole-body vibration (WBV) is strongly associated with the subsequent development of back pain (Bernard, 1997; Bovenzi and Hulshof, 1998; Sandover, 1983; Wilder and Pope, 1996). Other health effects associated with WBV include adverse consequences for cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, reproductive, endocrine and metabolic systems (Griffin, 1990). Many operators of mobile equipment used in mines and other industries are exposed to significant WBV for relatively long periods (Burgess-Limerick, 2012; Eger et al., 2006; Eger et al., 2011).

ISO2631-1 (ISO, 1997, 2010) describes procedures for the evaluation of WBV. Two principle methods of describing frequency-weighted acceleration amplitude are defined: (i) the root mean square (r.m.s.); and (ii) a fourth root measure termed the Vibration Dose Value (VDV) which is more sensitive to high amplitude jolts and jars. ISO2631-1 also provides guidance regarding the evaluation of health effects, defining a “health guidance caution zone” (HGCZ). For exposures below the HGCZ it is suggested that no health effects have been clearly documented. For exposures within the HGCZ “caution with respect to potential health risks is indicated” and for acceleration exposures greater than the HGCZ it is suggested that “health risks are likely”. For an eight hour daily exposure, the upper and lower bounds of the HGCZ are 0.47 m/s2 and 0.93 m/s2 r.m.s. respectively (McPhee et al., 2009). The corresponding values for the VDV measure are 8.5 m/s1.75 and 17 m/s1.75.

Haul trucks are used extensively in the surface mining industry. It has been suggested that haul truck drivers may be exposed to WBV amplitudes which have adverse health effects. Kumar (2004) recorded accelerometer data during nine 15 s intervals while each of 4 haul trucks (240 ton and 320 ton) completed a hauling cycle over smooth frozen roads. It was concluded that vibration amplitudes were greatest in the vertical direction, and particular while the trucks were driven unloaded. Vertical accelerations measured at the seat pan while driving unloaded ranged from 0.45 m/s2 to 1.75 m/s2 r.m.s. Although the author concluded that haul trucks “frequently generated vibrations in excess of ISO standards” (p. 509), the extremely short duration measurements make interpretation of these data difficult.

In contrast, however, Eger et al. (2006) measured the WBV amplitudes associated with a range of mining equipment including two 150 ton surface haul trucks during several 5 min trials. Vibration amplitudes were found to be highest in the vertical directions, and the average was found to be 0.28 and 0.37 m/s2 r.m.s. for the two trucks respectively, well below the HGCZ defined by ISO2631-1.

More recently, Smets et al. (2010) collected one hour duration WBV measurements from eight haul trucks of varying capacities (30 ton to 150 ton) during normal operation at surface mines in Northern Ontario. The vertical accelerations measured ranged from 0.44 m/s2 to 0.82 m/s2 r.m.s., and the VDV(8) from 8.8 m/s1.75 to 16.4 m/s1.75. Seven of the eight measurements were found to lie within the HGCZ defined by ISO2631.1 for r.m.s. and all eight VDV(8) measurements lay within the HGCZ.

There is limited evidence to suggest that haul trucks used in surface mining may expose operators to levels of WBV which are associated with risks to the operators’ health, however there is some inconsistency in previous reports. These differences are likely to arise from the short measurement durations associated with some of the previous investigations, as well as variability in equipment and sites. Further investigation of WBV exposures associated with a larger sample of trucks is justified. The aim of the current investigation is to examine the WBV exposures of operators of haul trucks during a range of normal operating conditions at an Australian surface coal mine to assess the potential health risks to drivers.

@&#METHODS@&#

Thirty-two WBV measurements were taken from 32 different haul trucks at one mine site in New South Wales (Table 1
                        ). The measurements were taken on eight separate days over a five month period which provided natural variability in roadway conditions. The trucks ranged in capacity from 136 tonne to 290 tonne. Of the 32 measurements, 16 were taken from 290 tonne 930E trucks, and 16 were taken in smaller 789B/785B/785C trucks (136–181 tonne). Selection of haul trucks was a sample of convenience, determined through consultation with site management, and dependent on haul truck availability at the time of measurement.

The haul trucks were operated by 32 different drivers who agreed to participate by signing an informed consent form. Ethical approval was provided by the ethics committee of the Sustainable Minerals Institute, The University of Queensland. No personal information was collected from the operators.

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

Two commercially available devices were used to measure the WBV exposure (on different trials): a Bruel & Kjaer Human Vibration Analyser Type 447 (Brüel & Kjær Sound & Vibration Measurement A/S, Nærum, Denmark); and a Svantech SV106 (Svantek Sp., Warsaw, Poland). Both instruments provide frequency-weighted measurements of acceleration consistent with ISO 2631-1. WBV was measured at the driver/seat interface by placing a rubber seat pad containing an accelerometer on the vehicle seat beneath the operator's ischial tuberosities.

Accelerometer data were collected whilst the haul trucks were involved in normal mining production. The typical work cycle of haul trucks is (1) loading- by a shovel or digger, (2) loaded travel, (3) dumping (unloading) and (4) unloaded travel. The cycle is repeated throughout the shift. The length of each work cycle varied between 11 min and 20 min and was dependent on the location of mining, the dump zones and loading waiting time. Measurements obtained on each individual day were taken on haul trucks travelling the same route. The measurement durations ranged from 17 min to 58 min (mean = 35 min).

The roadways were inspected for each trial and categorised as either: (i) rough terrain typical of a new production zone or following extensive wet weather, (ii) maintained terrain typical of a graded surface, and (iii) a combination of rough and maintained. These categories are consistent with those proposed by Eger et al. (2011).

@&#ANALYSIS@&#

Frequency-weighted root mean square accelerations, and the Vibration Dose Value expressed as an 8 hour equivalent value, were compared with the HGCZ defined by ISO2631.1. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was undertaken to examine the association between roadway condition, haul truck size and vertical WBV exposure. Unbiased estimates of Cohen's d using the pooled within-groups standard deviation were calculated to express the magnitude of effects (Cumming, 2012).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#


                        Appendix A provides details of each measurement. The vertical axis was predominantly associated with the highest frequency-weighted accelerations, which is consistent with previous investigations of mining haul trucks (Kumar, 2004; Eger et al., 2006; Smets et al., 2010). The mean frequency-weighted r.m.s and VDV(8) for vertical WBV measured from 32 surface mining haul trucks are presented in Fig. 1
                        . While vertical acceleration measurements from 12 of the 32 trucks lay below the HGCZ for the r.m.s measure of WBV, the measurements from only two of the 32 trucks lay below the HGCZ when expressed as VDV(8). The remainder of the measurements fell within the HGCZ. The range of vertical acceleration measurements [0.27 m/s2 to 0.74 m/s2 r.m.s.; 7.9 m/s1.75 to 15.3 m/s1.75 VDV(8)] was consistent with those reported by Smets et al. (2010). These values suggest, according to ISO2631.1, that “caution with respect to potential health risks is indicated”.

The trucks and drivers from which these measurements were obtained were not randomly sampled from the population of trucks on site, and consequently it cannot be concluded that the measurements are necessarily representative of the exposures experienced by haul truck drivers at the mine site, nor can it be assumed that the site is representative of all surface coal mines. Conversely, however, there is no reason to believe that the situations measured were atypical, nor that the trucks and site conditions were unusual for the industry. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that the WBV exposure of haul truck drivers should be a cause for concern for the management of surface mines.

Further, the HGCZ values referred to here are based on an 8 hour daily exposure. Many mining equipment operators work 12 hour shifts and, taking into account meal breaks and travel time at the beginning and end of shift, operators are driving haul trucks for approximately 10 hours a shift. The results presented here may underestimate the health consequences of WBV exposures associated with driving mining haul trucks.

A considerable range of variability was observed in the vertical acceleration measurements obtained from a sample of 32 haul trucks undertaking similar tasks at a single mine observed over a five month period. The variability is likely to arise, at least in part, because the vibration exposures experienced by truck drivers are a function of a number of characteristics of the situation, all of which change over time (albeit with different time scales). These variables include: the phase of the work-cycle (loading, driving loaded, dumping, driving unloaded); the roadway conditions and grade; vehicle speed; vehicle type and size; vehicle suspension and maintenance; tyre design and maintenance; seating design, maintenance and adjustment; and driver behaviour. These variables also interact; for example, Kumar (2004) noted that vibration levels were particularly high when unloaded trucks were driven unloaded, but also that “drivers invariably drove their trucks at a much faster speed when returning with empty trucks”. An understanding of these relationships, and the interactions between them, is necessary in order to determine the likely effectiveness of potential measures aimed at reducing vibration exposures.

The associations between truck size, roadway conditions, and vibration amplitude were examined. Measurements taken from the smaller 136–181 tonne trucks (N = 16) were grouped and compared with those taken from the larger 290 tonne haul trucks (N = 16). Trials taken from “rough” roadways (N = 7) or roadways with both rough and maintained sections (N = 13) were grouped for comparison with trials obtained from “maintained” roadways (N = 12). Fig. 2
                         illustrates the mean r.m.s. and VDV(8) vertical accelerations measured for the two groups of haul trucks as a function of roadway condition groups.

Two-way ANOVA results suggest that there were no statistically significant interactions in the association between truck size and roadway conditions for either r.m.s. or VDV(8) measures (F[2,28] = 0.677, p = 0.4173; F[2,28] = 2.7, p = 0.086 respectively). A statistically significant, and large, association between roadway condition and vibration amplitude was observed for both measures (F[1,28] = 9.382, p = 0.0048, d = 0.916, 95% CI[0.179,1.682] and F[1,28] = 27.26, p < 0.0001, d = 1.71, 95% CI[0.9,2.582] respectively). Although strictly indicating an association only, a logical connection exists, and these data suggest that the effect of roadway condition on vertical accelerations experienced by haul truck drivers is potentially very large. This is consistent with previous examinations of haul trucks and other mobile plant used on mine sites (e.g., Kumar, 2004; Eger, et al., 2011; McPhee et al., 2009; Village et al., 1989). It is likely that roadway maintenance will be an effective control measure to reduce WBV exposure of haul truck drivers.

A significant association between truck size and vibration amplitude was observed for the r.m.s. measure (F[1,28] = 5.949, p = 0.0213, d = 0.593 CI[−0.106,1.314]), although the association was not significant for the VDV(8) measure (F[1,28] = 4.154, p = 0.0511, d = 0.379 95% CI [−0.314,1.086]). These data are again descriptive only, in that there was no random assignment. The different models of haul truck measured also differ in ways other than size (e.g., the smaller trucks were also older), and may have been driven differently. Consequently, it is not possible to draw any strong conclusions regarding truck size and vibration amplitude. Further investigation of these and other contextual relationships is warranted.

A range of interactions between truck size, suspension design, and travelling speed exist which may influence WBV amplitude. For example, the speed which a fully loaded truck is able to travel is reduced, especially when travelling uphill, which may reduce WBV amplitude. Other aspects of driver behaviour such as seat suspension adjustment also have potential to influence WBV amplitude.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Long term exposure to WBV is a recognised risk factor for degenerative changes in the spine, subsequent back pain, and other adverse health effects. The drivers of haul trucks commonly employed on surface mines are likely to be exposed to WBV levels within the HGCZ defined by ISO2631.1 for an eight hour daily exposure. WBV exposure of haul truck drivers should consequently be a cause for concern for the management of surface coal mines. This is especially so given that 12 hour shift durations are common in the industry, with haul truck drivers spending perhaps 10 hours a day exposed to these WBV amplitudes. This high daily exposure increases the risk of long term health effects, and particularly back injury.

Maintained roadways were associated with substantially lower WBV amplitudes. Further investigation of other variables associated with elevated vibration levels, and interactions between these variable, is justified. Systematic WBV measurements taken by mine sites at frequent intervals are required to provide an understanding of the causes of elevated vibration levels and hence determine appropriate control measures. This may be facilitated by the availability of accelerometers within consumer electronic products (Wolfgang and Burgess-Limerick, 2014).
