                  This paper introduces a novel memetic algorithm namely Fractional Particle Swarm Optimization-based Memetic Algorithm (FPSOMA) to solve optimization problem using fractional calculus concept. The FC illustrates a potential for interpreting progression of the algorithm by controlling its convergence. The FPSOMA accomplishes global search over the whole search space through PSO whereas local search is performed by PSO with fractional order velocity to alter the memory of best location of the particles. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, firstly an empirical comparison study is presented for solving different test functions adopted from literature. Comparisons demonstrate the preference of FPSOMA than other related algorithms. Subsequently, experiments are conducted to achieve optimal gains of Fractional Order Proportional-Integral-Derivative (FO PID) controller in solving tracking problem. Results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
