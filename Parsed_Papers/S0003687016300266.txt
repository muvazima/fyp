                  Helmet safety benefits are reduced if the headgear is poorly fitted on the wearer's head. At present, there are no industry standards available to assess objectively how a specific protective helmet fits a particular person. A proper fit is typically defined as a small and uniform distance between the helmet liner and the wearer's head shape, with a broad coverage of the head area. This paper presents a novel method to investigate and compare fitting accuracy of helmets based on 3D anthropometry, reverse engineering techniques and computational analysis. The Helmet Fit Index (HFI) that provides a fit score on a scale from 0 (excessively poor fit) to 100 (perfect fit) was compared with subjective fit assessments of surveyed cyclists. Results in this study showed that quantitative (HFI) and qualitative (participants' feelings) data were related when comparing three commercially available bicycle helmets. Findings also demonstrated that females and Asian people have lower fit scores than males and Caucasians, respectively. The HFI could provide detailed understanding of helmet efficiency regarding fit and could be used during helmet design and development phases.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Poor helmet fit to the wearer's head has been reported to decrease its safety benefits during a crash event (Romanow et al., 2014; Rivara et al., 1999a; Thai et al., 2015a). Poor helmet fit may be attributed to two main causes. First, the helmet could be worn incorrectly, with the helmet either worn back to front, or tilted forward or backward. The chin strap could also be unfastened. A Canadian observational study reported that 15% of bicycle users wear their helmets incorrectly (Hagel et al., 2010). Wearing under- or over-sized helmets is also considered to be inappropriate, and has been shown to be a frequent problem, especially among children and young people (Thai et al., 2015a). Second, helmet sizes and shapes available to the public might not be suitable for the full range of head morphologies (Thai et al., 2015a). Indeed, for some users, there is either a large gap between the inner liner and the head, or a low coverage of the skull area with significant unprotected regions of the head. Rivara et al. (Rivara et al., 1999a). found that during crash events, children with head injuries had large open gaps between their head and the helmet, compared with those without head injuries.

While the poorly informed usage of bicycle helmets is partly rectifiable through school-based education programs, government and helmet manufacturer advertising, or appropriate store advice and user information, the mismatch between head shapes and helmet liners primary relates to the design of helmets, particularly its liner.

Helmets are developed and tested on standard mannequin heads called headforms (Ball, 2009; Zhuang et al., 2010), which aim to represent the full range of head dimensions, geometries and shapes within a specific population. Although two headform standards have been developed in the past (ISO/R1511:1970 and ISO/DIS 6220:1983), neither of these have been adopted as international standards. Many countries adopted the guidelines presented in the draft ISO/DIS 6220:1983 as a reference for the development of their standards. For instance, Standards Australia developed the AS/NZS 2512.1:2009 Methods of testing protective helmets Part 1: Definitions and headforms (Australian/New Zealand Standard, 2512a) based on this draft (Australian/New Zealand Standard, 2512b). Remarkably, the ISO draft was itself founded on the first set of test headforms produced by the UK Transport Road Research Laboratory in the 1950s (Zhuang et al., 2010; British Standards Institution and BS EN960:2006, 2006). That said, designing bicycle helmets based on anthropometric measurements obtained from the 1950s British workforce might not encompass the variations of head shapes present in today's world.

Reviewing current design approach, helmet designers are inclined to create foam liners with significant offset distances from the standard headform surfaces. This approach ensures the highest proportion of users are accommodated within the smallest numbers of helmet sizes, as measured by the conventional one, two or three shell systems that are offered by most manufacturers. Foam pads are then added to the helmet to fill the gaps between the liners and wearer's head. An adjustment system may also be connected to the shell in order to resize the helmet over the head circumference of the wearer. While this approach noticeably improves comfort and allows minimum air circulation, it does not reduce front-to-back, side-to-side, or rotational movements that result from poor helmet fit (Thai et al., 2015a, 2015b).

Recognizing poor head-fit in helmet design (Robinette and Whitestone, 1994), researchers have used three-dimensional (3D) scanners to compute the Standoff Distances (SOD) between a person's head and the inside surface of a helmet (Meunier et al., 2000; Perret-Ellena et al., 2014; Cadogan et al., 1994; Alemany et al., 2012). For example, Meunier et al. (Meunier et al., 2000). introduced new computational techniques to align and position the scanned head and helmet. They developed color-coded illustrations to display the problem areas (i.e., SOD) between the head and helmet scans, which gave designers the objective assessment for design modification to improve helmet fit. Although a tested helmet was deemed to fit a person's head when the SOD was at least 12.5 mm, no maximum upper limit for the parameter was set. A critical element of helmet fit is needed to ensure that it closely follows the shape of the head without leaving significant gaps between the helmet liner and the head.

These considerations are addressed by the Helmet Fit Index (HFI) described in (Perret-Ellena et al., 2014), which estimated the ‘fit score’ of bicycle helmets for unique human head shapes. The HFI formulae set the SOD as optimum when spanning between 4 and 8 mm. Two other parameters are included in the formulae. They are, the Gap Uniformity (GU), which is the standard deviation of the gap distribution, and the Head Protection Proportion (HPP), which is calculated as the proportion of the head under helmet protection. Based on a 3D anthropometric study presented in (Perret-Ellena et al., 2015), a set of reverse engineering tools and computational techniques were developed to evaluate the fit of a helmet to an individual's head. The method developed in (Perret-Ellena et al., 2014) demonstrated that the HFI could be a valuable tool for statistical analysis of fit for a defined population and for the comparison of different headgear models with respect to fit. This paper develops further the HFI concept by: (i) establishing if the subjective feel regarding helmet fit correlates with the proposed index; and (ii) assessing if dissimilarities exist between gender and ethnic groups regarding helmet fit. Guidelines on how the HFI could be used by helmet manufacturers are discussed.

The survey conducted in this research took place at multiple sites in the metropolitan area of Melbourne, Australia, and spanned over an eight month period in 2014. Interview venues included five local bike shops and RMIT University research laboratory. The study was approved by RMIT University's Human Research Ethics Committee. The inclusion criteria were cyclists, over 18 years of age, who were familiar with the use of bicycle helmets. Recreational and commuter cyclists were recruited through either advertisement (online forums, Melbourne bicycle and triathlon clubs), or directly at the survey sites.

The target sample size was 125 participants. The sampling distribution plan was primarily drawn on the Australian Cycling Participation report (Munro, 2013). The report estimates the cycling activity (measured in the past week, month and year) across Australia according to gender and age groups. For each stratum, data were presented as “population proportion who rode in the past seven days”. Expected frequency distribution and its corresponding expected count for the study were then calculated based on these proportions and the 2011 Australian census data (Census et al., 2011) (Table 1
                        ). Census data are presented in five years groups (e.g. 15–19 years, 20–24 years) and therefore had to be extrapolated for age groups 18–29 of relevance to this study.

Participants were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire including demographics (gender, age and ethnicity, mass and height), cycling type (recreational, competition, commuter), helmet use, helmet fit requirements (helmet fit user ideal and helmet fit user importance) and helmet fit assessments. The survey required about 10 min to complete. Questions regarding helmet fit requirements were recorded on a ten-point scale with the following specific definitions:
                           
                              •
                              Helmet fit user ideal. On a scale from 1 to 10, please rate your ideal degree of pressure on your head when wearing a bicycle helmet. If 1 is a very loose feeling and 10 very tight, what value would best describe your fit requirement?

Helmet fit user importance. On a scale from 1 to 10, please rate the importance of achieving your ideal fit in a bicycle helmet model. When purchasing a new helmet, is it essential that it matches your ideal degree of pressure on your head (10), or would you buy one that does not (1), but satisfies other parameters?

Before completing the survey, participants were provided with three helmet models of two sizes each. They were asked to choose their preferred size for each helmet model and to assess its overall fit over five regions of the head, namely the front, top, right, left and back. The fit was assessed on a ten-point scale, where 1 was very uncomfortable and a poor fit feel (large gaps, pressure points/areas), and 10 was an excellent fit and comfortable.


                        Table 2
                         lists the twenty qualitative variables recorded for each individual participant on a ten-point scale.

An Artec Eva™ (Palo alto, CA, USA) 3D scanner was used for the anthropometric study. During the scanning process, participants were asked to sit straight and look at a fixed point on the wall with his/her usual facial expression. The posture position and scanning techniques were in accordance with the requirements of ISO 20685:2010(E) 3-D scanning methodologies for internationally compatible anthropometric databases (International Organization for Standardization, 2010a). Participants were asked to wear a wig cap on their heads and over their ears to avoid hair irregularities on the scanned geometry (Fig. 1
                           ).

The scanned mesh was then exported to Geomagic Studio 12® (rock Hill, SC, USA) for further processing. Hair bumps and fabric folds were removed, and angles between individual polygons were minimized to smooth out the scan. The deviation analysis tool was used to ensure that the modification of the mesh had not excessively distorted the original scanned head shape. The maximum deviation distance for non-hair bumps or fabric fold areas was set to ±50μm (Fig. 2
                           ).

Three commercially available bicycle helmet models in two different sizes each were chosen for the study. They were selected according to their price range from high, medium to low (Met Kaos – high price (Helmet A), Met Crossover – medium price (Helmet B) and Netti Lightning – low price (Helmet C)). Even though the medium and high price range helmets originated from the same manufacturer, their liner geometries and shapes were different.

The selected helmet models were digitized using an advanced white light 3D scanner (HDI Advance from LMI Technologies, Delta, BC, Canada), which has a high level of scan accuracy (45μm per single scan) when dealing with more complex geometries. Foam pads and the adjusting system were removed either (i) physically before the scan or (ii) digitally during the post-processing procedure. The scanned images were merged, repaired and “cleaned up” using Geomagic Studio 12® (Fig. 3
                           ). The clean-up process involved: (a) repairing the mesh to remove spikes and non-manifold triangles; (b) filling the holes with curvature continuity constraints with the adjacent geometry; (c) reconstructing the fillets and sharp edges; and (d) re-wrapping the mesh with new vertices for uniform spacing. Each final mesh comprised approximately two million triangles.

Furthermore, in order to perform the gap analysis on the inside surfaces of the helmet's liner; a simplified representation of the helmet was created to keep only the regions supposedly in contact with the cyclist's head. Fig. 4
                           (a) illustrates the final inside surface of the same helmet after careful trim and accurate area selection.

The fit analysis was performed both globally and locally as we predicted the fit to be dissimilar throughout the whole head shape. Consequently, the inside mesh of the helmet liner was further divided into five regions, namely front, top, right, left, and back as showed in Fig. 4(b). The regions were defined by simple visual demarcation of the helmets geometry.

An intermediate scan of the participant wearing the helmet was used to position the helmet and head scans accurately. Participants were scanned a second time with the selected helmet model fitted on their heads. During the scan, participants were asked to reproduce the same seating posture and facial expression as during the first scan described in Section 2.3a).

All three scans (Fig. 5
                           ) were then aligned using the n-points manual registration and the global registration algorithms within Geomagic Studio 12®. The alignment process was split into two stages: (i) align the head scan and the intermediate scan (Fig. 6
                           ) using the face polygons of the participant; and (ii) align the helmet scan with the intermediate scan (Fig. 7
                           ) using the helmet surfaces.

After the two-stage alignment process has been completed, the intermediate scan was removed, and the head and helmet scans were now aligned accurately (Fig. 8
                           ). This alignment allowed for objective evaluation of the gap between the head and helmet.

In this analysis, the gap distribution between the head mesh and the inside of the helmet was calculated. Two parameters were determined: (i) the Standoff Distance (SOD), which was defined as the average minimal distance between the head shape and all the points that defined the inside mesh of the liner; and (ii) the Gap Uniformity (GU), which was the standard deviation of the gap distribution defined as the dispersion from the average.

A distance analysis tool available in CATIA V5R21 (Dassault Système, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France) was used to measure the gap between the head and the inside liner meshes. The gap was first analyzed for any negative values that would indicate interference between the two meshes. Interference can be caused either by inaccurate alignment between the meshes, or by the hair thickness of the participant. The participant's hair was likely to be compressed under the helmet's weight during fit. Extra hair thickness, which was assumed to be uniform across the whole head, was considered during the gap analysis. Outlier points were removed from the gap analysis result, and the head scan was offset by the negative maximum deviation. Distance analysis was then recalculated, and the SOD and GU were recorded. Fig. 9
                               shows the gap analysis with color texture maps before and after the hair thickness was offset. In addition, similar deviation analyses were conducted in the five local regions, and the SOD and GU were recorded. Fig. 10
                               shows the gap analysis of the right region.

To provide maximum protection to the wearer, the helmet should cover as much skull area as possible. However, for some human head shapes, commercially available helmet models might provide only minimal total coverage area and reduce its intended protection capability. The AS/NZS 2512.1:2009 Methods of testing protective helmets Part 1: Definitions and headforms (Australian/New Zealand Standard, 2512a) defines a test line around the head to which the helmet is supposed to extend. Dimensions for the test line were based on the Bitragion coronal and inion arcs, and the mid-sagittal arc. We added the dimensions of the head length, breadth and circumference to define an area that should be under the helmet protection for each participant (magenta area in Fig. 11
                              (a)).

By projecting the boundary edges of the inside liner onto the test area, we were able to determine the proportion of the head mesh under helmet protection (green area in Fig. 11(b)). This fit parameter was named the Head Protection Proportion (HPP).

The Helmet Fit Index (HFI) provides a fit score for a particular helmet model and a human head. The index is defined on a scale from 0 (excessively poor fit) to 100 (perfect fit). The probability density function, f, of an exponential distribution is used to generate the index and is described as follows:

                           where λ>0 is the parameter of the distribution called the rate parameter; x is defined as a function of the SOD, GU, and HPP.

The probability density function was established on the exponential distribution rather than the log-normal distribution. This is because its right tail is relatively short and may be considered as having moderate skew (i.e. few outliers). A distribution with fewer outliers will produce more statistically significant results.

The SOD optimal value should be greater than zero to allow for thermal control throughout the helmet and the addition of thin foam paddings for comfort. However, previous research showed that an excessive standoff distance would decrease the helmet protective function during a crash (Rivara et al., 1999b). For this reason, we considered the SOD to be optimum when it was in the range between 4 and 8 mm.

GU is a critical parameter when analyzing the dispersion of the distance distribution. Seemingly, the fit is optimized when the standoff distance is uniformly distributed over the whole liner surface, which is equivalent to a lower deviation from the mean. Hence, the gap becomes more uniform when the GU approaches zero. Likewise, fit improves when the HPP approaches 1, which corresponds to a higher coverage area of the head provided by the helmet.

The fit parameter x, is defined as:

Based on the calculations for x from twenty participants reported in the previous pilot study (Perret-Ellena et al., 2014), and some test results published for 1D anthropometric studies using 1st and 99th percentile head measurements of males and females (Zhuang and Bradtmiller, 2005; International Organization for Standardization, 2010b), we anticipated that x rarely exceeds the 30 point value. A high value for x represents an extremely low fit. Therefore, it was decided to assign 0.1 to λ and multiply the function by 1000 to define the HFI function as shown in Fig. 12
                            (e.g. with x=30, HFI=5).

                           Table 3
                            summarizes all fifty-seven quantitative variables generated for each participant. HFI was defined for six regions (one overall and five locals) based on two or three parameters (SOD, GU and HPP (only for global)) and for three different helmet models.

The qualitative parameters (Table 2) were analyzed as ordinal variables (except for the ordered logistic regression where Fim and Fid were analyzed as continuous predictor variables), leading to the use of medians for the description of central tendency, and range and interquartile range for the description of dispersion. The space between the ten options on the ten-point scale proposed could not be equidistant and was hence problematic to model on a continuous scale. Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated for both medians and means, and for HFIs mean differences.

The first objective of the statistical models was to determine if the quantitative data (HFIs) were appropriate estimates of the qualitative data (Fit assessment scores FXG). Data for each helmet were first analyzed independently using ordered logistic regression where relationships between the independent variables (age, gender, Fim, Fid and HFIs) and dependent variables (FXG) were assessed. Odds ratios (OR) for a higher score in perceived helmets fit for the three helmets, given the independent variables, were determined where suitable. The data for the three helmet models were then compared using within-subject studies (statistical tests to determine difference between related groups) both at the subjective level and the objective level to evaluate how the helmets performed regarding fit. A Friedman test was run to determine if there were differences in the subjective assessment of helmet fit for each of the three helmet models. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in the global HFI scores for the three selected helmet models. Lastly, a hypothesis test for a proportion was run to establish the capability of the HFI to select the best and worst perceived fitted helmet, given the three distinct models.

The second objective of the statistical models was to assess whether there was differences in terms of helmet fit for diverse groups (gender and ethnic background). Where such differences existed, we determined where these dissimilarities occurred. Independent samples t-tests were run to assess gender disparity. One-way ANOVA with custom contrasts or Kruskal–Wallis tests were computed to investigate if any significant inequalities regarding helmet fit existed between Caucasians (Australasian and European) and Asians. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The statistical significance α level was set to 0.05.

@&#RESULTS@&#

A total of 117 cyclists were recruited for this study over the eight-month period, slightly fewer than the target sample size. Twenty-two percent were recruited at RMIT University (staff and students), while the remaining were recruited at local bicycle shops. The sample included 94 males (80.3%) and 23 females (19.7%) between the ages of 18 and 65 (35.4 ± 11.4). Of the 117 participants, 31 were males aged 18–29, 48 were males aged 30–49, 15 were males aged 50+, 11 were females aged 18–29, 10 were females aged 30–49, and 2 were females aged 50+. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test was conducted to determine if the sample followed the expected distribution from the Australian Cycling Participation report (Munro, 2013) (Table 1). The minimum expected frequency was 8.9. The chi-square goodness-of-fit test indicated that the sample distribution was statistically significantly different (χ
                        2(5)=23.135,  p<.01). The study's sample was biased in terms of gender and age, with large number of males participants over females, and a large number of young people over older adults (middle age men category was also over-represented). Cyclists were self-classified as the Australasian (48.7%), European (24.8%), Asian (17.9%) or Other (8.6%). Australasians were considered as Caucasians if they did not specify an ethnic background from Asia, Africa, America or a Middle East country. Ninety-five percent of the volunteers claimed to always wear a helmet while cycling.


                        Table 4
                         shows the means and medians for the key parameters used in this study. The means global HFI for helmet B were higher than Helmets A and C due to lower SOD and GU values. Results were to some extent similar to the global assessment of helmet fit. Some differences exist in local regions between quantitative and qualitative data.

Three cumulative odds ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds were performed (one per helmet to keep the assumption of independence of observations correct) to determine if the level of perceived helmet fit could be predicted based on age, HFI, Fid score and Fim score. The 10 ordinal levels of the fit assessment score were grouped together (2 b y 2) to reduce the number of cells with zero frequencies in the model (i.e. 1 and 2 scores gave 1, 3 and 4 scores gave 2, 5 and 6 scores gave 3, 7 and 8 scores gave 4, and 9 and 10 scores gave 5).

The assumptions of proportional odds were met, as assessed by comparing the similarities between odds ratios of multiple separate binomial logistic regressions run on the four cumulative categories of the dichotomous dependent variables. The deviance goodness-of-fit test indicated that the models were an excellent fit to the observed data (χ
                           2(460)=326.280, p = 1.000, χ
                           2(460)=318.165,  p = 1.000 and χ
                           2(460)=331.100, p=1.000 for helmet A, B and C respectively), but most cells were sparse with zero frequencies in 80% of cells. However, for helmet A and B, the final models statistically significantly predicted the dependent variable over and above the intercept-only model (χ
                           2(4) = 12.151, p<.05 for A, and χ
                           2(4) =16.855, p < .005 for B). An increase in one unit of HFI score was associated with an increase in the odds of a higher score in the perceived helmet fit, with an OR of 1.041 (95% CI, 1.006 to 1.078), Wald 
                           χ
                           2(1) = 5.170, p<.05 for helmet A, and 1.063 (95% CI, 1.030 to 1.098), Wald χ
                           2(1) = 13.845, p<.0005 for helmet B.

A change in HFI score for helmet C was not associated with a change in how participants scored the perceived helmet.

An increase in age (expressed in years) was associated with a decrease in the odds of a higher score in the perceived fitting of helmet A, with an OR of 1.040 (95% CI, 1.008 to 1.073), Wald  χ
                           2(1) = 6.056, p<.05. A change in Fid or Fim score was not associated with how participants perceived helmet fit for the three helmets.

A Friedman test was run to determine if there were differences in the subjective assessment of helmet fit for the three helmet models. Pairwise comparisons were performed (SPSS, 2012) with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Fit assessment was statistically different for the three helmet models, χ
                           2(2) = 38.429, p<.0005. Mean Ranks were 2.11, 2.31 and 1.59 for helmets A, B and C respectively (Fig. 13
                           ). Helmet B was ranked at a higher score more often than Helmets A and C. Helmet C was ranked at a lower score more often. Post hoc analysis revealed statistically significant differences in terms of perceived fit for helmets A (Mdn = 6) and C (Mdn = 4) (p < .0005), and helmet B (Mdn = 6) and C (Mdn = 4) (p<.0005), but not for helmets A and B.

Similar tests on local regions were performed and the comparative results are presented in Table 5
                           . Fit assessments were statistically different for the three helmet models at the local regions, and post hoc analysis revealed statistically significant differences for all regions between helmet A and C, (A higher ranking than C) and B and C (B higher ranking than C), but not A and B.

A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in the global HFI scores for the three bicycle helmet models. Data presented are mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise specified. Two outliers in the HFI distribution of helmet A were detected (HFI
                           
                              A
                            = 13.4 and 19.9). It was decided to keep them for the analysis after discovering no differences in the final result when running the same test with and without these two points. The distribution of the three within-factor levels was assessed. The three distributions were not normally distributed with a slight negative skewness (skewness = −1.013, −0.753, −0.501 with standard error = 0.224 and kurtosis = 1.648, −0.004, −0.457 with standard error = 0.444 for helmets A, B and C respectively). However, the test was continued regardless because the levels of the within-subjects factor were similarly skewed. The assumption of sphericity was violated, as assessed by Mauchly's test of sphericity, χ
                           2(2)=24.973, p<.0005. Therefore, a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied (ε=0.837). The computed HFIs showed statistically significant differences for the three helmet models (F(1.673,194.111)=45.289, p<.0005, partial η
                           2=0.281), with HFI means equal to 52.9 ±10.0, 55.7 ±11.4 and 48.3 ±12.0 for helmets A, B and C respectively. Post hoc analysis with a Bonferroni adjustment revealed that HFI means were statistically significant between all helmet combinations. Differences were −2.8 (95% CI, −4.6 to −1.0,  p<.001) for helmets A and B, 4.6 (95% CI, 2.3 to 6.9, p<.0005) for helmets A and C and 7.4 (95% CI, 5.8 to 9.0, p<.0005) for helmets B and C. On average, helmet B provided the highest HFI score, followed by helmets A and C.

Similar tests on local regions were computed and are shown in Table 6
                           . Helmet A performed better in the right, left and back regions, helmet B performed better in the front region, and helmet C performed better in the top region.

In the post hoc analysis, a difference of 3 HFI units (close to the measurement error for the design steps used in the HFI computation) or greater was required to indicate practical importance.

A hypothesis test for a proportion based on the normal distribution framework was applied to determine the capability of the HFI to pick the best and worst perceived helmet fit for the three helmet models. The probability p
                           0 of identifying the best helmet fit was 0.427 (95% CI, 0.338 to 0.517) and is determined as follows:

                           where x (=93), y (=15) and z (=9) are respectively; the number of participants with dissimilar ratings for the three helmets fit, the number of participants with two helmets tying at the highest score, and the number of participants with the same rating for the three models. The observations were independent, and the success-failure condition was achieved (np
                           0=50 and n(1−p
                           0)=67). A HFI prediction was considered a success when the highest helmet fit recorded by a participant was also the helmet with the highest calculated HFI score. The HFI had a success rate of 61.5%, providing a statistically significant difference with p
                           0 (p<.0005).

Likewise, the p
                           0 probability of identifying the worst helmet fit was 0.444 (95% CI, 0.354 to 0.534), while the HFI had a success rate of 65.8%, providing a statistically significant difference with p
                           0 (p<.0005).

Similar tests were run on the local regions and are presented in Table 7
                           . The HFI had a higher OR of finding the best and worst fitted helmet than p
                           0 for the front, right and left regions.

Three independent samples t-tests were run to assess the differences in HFI scores between males and females for the three selected helmet models. A total of four outliers were identified in the HFI distributions, one male and one female for helmet A, and two males for helmet B (HFIs too low). HFIs values were increased to values just inferior to the second (or third) lowest value in their particular distribution. HFIs followed a normal distribution for the three helmets for males and females. There was homogeneity of variances, as evaluated by Levene's test for equality of variances (p=0.629, 0.339 and 0.519 for helmet A, B and C respectively). HFI mean scores were significantly higher for males than females for the three helmet models. Similar tests were run on the five defined regions of the head. HFI means were significantly higher for males compared with females in the front, right, left and back regions. Differences in the top regions were either statistically non-significant or not practical. Table 8
                            below summarizes the test results (presented data are mean ± standard deviation).

Three one-way ANOVA with custom contrasts (one test per helmet) were conducted to determine if there were any significant differences in terms of helmet fit (HFI) between the four ethnic groups (Australasian, European, Asian and Other). One outlier in helmet A and one outlier in helmet B were detected (HFIs too low). HFIs values were increased to just smaller than the second lowest value in their particular distribution. HFIs were normally distributed for the three helmets within each ethnic group, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk's test (p<.05). The HFI scores increased from the Asian, to Other, to Australasian/European groups for the three helmets, in that order. There was homogeneity of variances, as assessed by Levene's test for equality of variances (p=0.660, 0.194 and 0.936 for Helmets A, B and C respectively). Two simple and one complex contrasts between the mean HFI scores for the Australasian and European groups (assessed individually and combined) compared with the Asian group showed that the mean differences were statistically non-significant. Similar tests were run on the local regions of the head and results are shown in Table 9
                            (95% CI for differences mean score between groups are only shown for the global region). However, when the assumptions of normal distribution for the HFIs were not met, and/or the number of outliers was too high, the Kruskal–Wallis test (rank-based nonparametric statistical test equivalent of the one-way ANOVA) was used. This was the case for the top and back regions where the distributions of the HFIs for the four ethnic groups were similarly shaped. Differences were statistically non-significant for the top region. Median HFI scores were statistically significantly different between the four ethnic groups for the back region. Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were performed using Dunn's procedure with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Adjusted p-values are presented. This post-hoc analysis on the back area of the head revealed statistically significant differences in median HFI scores between Asian and Caucasian (Australasian/European) subjects. Measures of central tendency are mean ± standard deviation for custom contrast tests and median for Kruskal–Wallis tests.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

A field survey of 117 cyclists was conducted to determine the ability of the Helmet Fit Index (HFI) (Perret-Ellena et al., 2014) to predict subjective assessment of helmet fit. Participants were asked to rate their perceived feel of fit for three nominated bicycle helmets where HFIs had been calculated. Analyses of local areas of the head were also included.

The conducted regressions on each helmet model demonstrated that perceived feel relating to helmet fit and HFIs were moderately correlated. An increase in HFI scores resulted in a slight increase in helmet fit assessment for two out of the three helmets (A and B). However, associations were fairly small. Comparing how users perceive comfort on an ordinal psychometric scale appeared to be a challenging task. Attitudes of the population toward a particular sensation may lie in a large, multi-dimensional continuum that can be problematic to capture in a single parameter. In addition, expectations and perception of helmet comfort and fit could be entirely different from one cyclist to another; even if their head shapes were quite similar. A superior approach is to allow individuals to compare individual's sensation in a within-subject design, where differences in the within-subject factor (helmet model) can be estimated objectively. For example, two cyclists with similar head shapes may have dissimilar fit requirements and, therefore, different fit assessments of the same helmet, but may react similarly when comparing multiple items. The fit assessment scales become an important objective measure to determine which helmet fits the best, or the worst on a user's head.

Following this approach in the current study, within-subject studies of subjective (fit assessment) and objective (HFI) data revealed a good correlation between the HFI formulae and the participants' perceived feel associated with fit. Both analyses showed that helmet B, in general, provided the best fit, followed by helmets A and C. Although the differences in terms of fit assessment between helmets A and B revealed statistically non-significance results, analysis of mean ranks validated a preference for helmet B (Table 5). The comparisons for local regions were slightly different. Helmet C was consistently ranked as the worst helmet in the five predefined regions, even if it performed better than helmets A and B in the top and almost equivalent to helmet B in the right, left and back regions. Helmet A was ranked below helmet B in the right, left and back regions, but performed better in terms of HFI in these regions. These differences can be attributed to participants either losing interest in answering the fit assessments in local regions due to time constraints or having difficulties understanding what was required. A fair proportion of participants just copied the same score for the global and local regions of each helmet. This may indicate that cyclists had trouble assessing helmet fit and comfort at a local level, but rather rely on their global or overall feel.

The HFI ranking had a successful rate of 61.5% and 65.8% (Table 7) in estimating the best and worst fitted helmets, respectively. Results were statistically significant compared with a simple random selection process. However, the results indicated that the HFI could not explain the full variety of fit assessment scores. Several possible reasons might explain these disparities. The global HFI formula includes a safety component through the HPP parameter that is probably not estimated in personal ratings. In addition, other parameters, such as the helmet's design, weight, material properties (surface roughness), adjustment system and retention straps, and the brand reputation (which probably influences the perceived sensory perception of fit), were not incorporated in the index.

Overall, the proposed index correlated reasonably well with the obtained subjective data. Fit was indeed related to the distribution of the gap between the head and the inside surfaces of the helmet liner (SOD and GU). The HFI incorporates another parameter, helmet safety, by integrating the proportion of the head area under helmet protection in its formula (HPP). The formula was developed based on previous work of Meunier et al. (Meunier et al., 2000). The presented HFI has considered maximum distances for SOD, the dispersion around the SOD responsible for non-uniform distribution of the gap, and details on how to deal with openings for air circulation that are not present in Meunier's ballistic helmets. The HFI enabled us to compare fit between cyclists' head shapes as well as between helmet models.

The broad range of HFI scores and the presence of outliers and extreme outliers recorded in the study have indicated that the current standard headforms used in the design of bicycle helmets might not capture the full variety of cyclists' head shapes. The conservative two or three shell system of helmet sizes offered by most manufacturers should be reviewed to account for the variability of head shapes in the population. In addition, current sizing labels do not inform users how the helmets are shaped. Using the head circumference as the only size criterion is probably not satisfactory. Shapes description such as roundness values (oval or round) could be a useful addition. Cyclists acknowledged this shortcoming by evaluating the fit of the three selected helmets with low median assessment scores (6/10, 6/10 and 4/10 for helmets A, B and C respectively). The importance of achieving a suitable fit was rated with a median score of 8/10, suggesting a need for better fitted helmets.

Findings of this study highlighted the differences in terms of fit between genders for three commercially available helmets (Table 8). Females presented much lower HFIs than males in all helmets tested and for both global and locals regions. Differences were predominantly in the front, back and side regions, indicating that females, in general, have smaller head shapes than males. The need for better-designed headforms for females has been previously highlighted in literature (Thai et al., 2015a; Zhuang et al., 2010; Zhuang and Bradtmiller, 2005; Farkas, 1994; Lacko et al., 2015), but standards have remained the same.

Similarly, ethnic differences were observed between Caucasian and Asian people (Table 9). Differences in HFI scores were observed in the front, back and sides regions. However, only the difference at the back of the head was statistically significant. The lack of statistical power for other regions might be due to gender bias where only 14% of the subjects in the Asian group were females, compared with 23% of the Caucasian group. Results could not be adjusted for gender as the sample size was too small for the Asian group. The outcomes from this study agreed with literature findings that Asian heads are rounder than Caucasian counterparts, with a flatter back and forehead (Ball et al., 2010). Specific helmet models should be designed to accommodate the Asian population (especially relevant for Australia where one eighth of the population has Asian ancestry (Census et al., 2011)). Helmet shapes must be rounder and should be based on Asian-specific headforms. For example, Ball et al. (Ball, 2009; Luximon et al., 2012) introduced Chinese headforms in 2009 by scanning thousands of people across multiple regions of the country. Recent development of Asian-specific products, such as helmets, sunglasses, and respiratory masks, is a confirmation that the industry has started to recognize this shortcoming.

We acknowledge there are some limitations in the study. First, we assumed that the participants' hair was fully flattened under the helmet compression and did not affect the fit score. However, HFI for people with very thick, bulky and curly hair will produce erroneous results. Also, a uniform hair thickness across the participant's head might not be an accurate assumption. People with partial baldness may only have hair on the side of the head, while others may have asymmetric haircuts with non-uniform hair distribution. Regarding the survey sample, a gender and age bias was unintentionally introduced compared with the population of concern (Australian cyclists who cycle at least once in the past week (Munro, 2013)), resulting in under coverage of females and older adults. The site selections for the study are the possible reason for this non-sampling error. First, in the University's engineer laboratory young males were more likely to be selected than females. Second, young and middle age males were more likely to be present in bike shops during interview due to their high interest in cycling equipment, compared with older males and females. In addition, participants had difficulties in assessing fit scores for the defined local regions, which made most of the comparisons statistically non-significant. Implications of these bias in the results are threefold: (i) HFI means reported are likely to be higher than the true population mean for the three listed helmets (more females in the sample would decrease the mean), (ii) Helmet C assessment scores might be lower than the true population median (participants with high interest in bicycle gears are more likely to be sensitive to the cost of bicycle helmets when estimating fit assessment. Helmet C was the cheapest and the lowest rated helmet), and (iii) fit assessment in local regions might be completely overestimated or underestimated, as assessed by low association between subjective and objective data in the local regions compared to global. Despite these limitations, our findings showed that the HFI method did provide accurate and efficient data to analyze, compare and improve bicycle helmet fit among the cyclist population considered. Observations in this study showed that the HFI correlates decently with cyclists' perceived feel related to helmet fit, and supports earlier findings in terms of helmet fit differences between genders and ethnic groups.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this research, a novel computational method was developed to compute the Helmet Fit Index (HFI) for a specific person and a specific helmet. The approach combined 3D scanning techniques, and analyses of the gap distribution between the head and the inside surfaces of the helmet to determine the three fundamental parameters used in the HFI formulae, namely the Standoff Distance SOD (average distance between the head and the helmet), the Gap Uniformity GU (measure of SOD dispersion), and the Head Protection Proportion HPP (measure of the head surface area percentage under helmet protection). The HFI was defined by an exponential distribution and provided a fit score on a scale from 0 (excessively poor fit) to 100 (perfect fit).

Correlations between the HFI and the perceived feeling regarding fit of 117 Australian cyclists showed that the index is a useful and suitable indicator of bicycle helmet fit despite its main limitations. Moreover, analyses of helmet fit differences between groups showed that females and Asian people experienced lower fit scores than males and Caucasians, respectively.

The possible applications of the HFI are listed below:
                        
                           •
                           Helmet design for standardization: Designers could test the fit accuracy of their new designs against the population of concern (e.g. country, gender, ethnic group, and child/adult). A sample of 3D head scans from this population could be tested against all the sizes proposed, where the highest HFIs for each individual would be kept. Measures of good fit would be the average HFIs (both global and local) and the dispersion around the average using percentiles. Furthermore, HFIs could be directly calculated for all headform sizes of a specific standard, but only if they have been truly shown to represent the population of interest (e.g (Ball, 2009).). Requirements for minimum HFIs values might be included in relevant standards. Further research studies are necessary to determine what these threshold values might be.

Helmet design for customization: The design of custom-fit bicycle helmets could be concentrated on the fit requirements conveyed in the HFI formulae, which are explicitly; high coverage of the head area, standoff distance between 4 and 8 mm, and low dispersion from the average gap distribution. It would achieve an optimum fit in terms of comfort and safety for the customer.

Online helmet purchase: 3D digital fitting rooms have started to emerge on the Internet, where customers can virtually try garments or glasses that fit their morphology. Similar developments are expected in the helmet industry, and the HFI could provide useful information on how a specific helmet fit a customer's head.
