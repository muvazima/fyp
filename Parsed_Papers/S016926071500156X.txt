                  Imaging systems transmit and acquire signals and are subject to errors including: error sources, signal variations or possible calibration errors. These errors are included in all imaging systems for atherosclerosis and are propagated to methodologies implemented for the segmentation and characterization of atherosclerotic plaque. In this paper, we present a study for the propagation of imaging errors and image segmentation errors in plaque characterization methods applied to 2D vascular images. More specifically, the maximum error that can be propagated to the plaque characterization results is estimated, assuming worst-case scenarios. The proposed error propagation methodology is validated using methods applied to real datasets, obtained from intravascular imaging (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) for coronary arteries, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for carotid arteries. The plaque characterization methods have recently been presented in the literature and are able to detect the vessel borders, and characterize the atherosclerotic plaque types. Although, these methods have been extensively validated using as gold standard expert annotations, by applying the proposed error propagation methodology a more realistic validation is performed taking into account the effect of the border detection algorithms error and the image formation error into the final results. The Pearson's coefficient of the detected plaques has changed significantly when the method was applied to IVUS and OCT, while there was not any variation when the method was applied to MRI data.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Diagnostic imaging plays an important role in medicine today. Delineation of vessels solves practical applications such as diagnosis of coronary artery disease and assessment of the degree of stenosis in carotid artery pathology [1]. Advantages in imaging technology led to a wide variety of imaging modalities for depicting the silhouette and the interior of blood vessels. These modalities can be either invasive [2,3], i.e. itravascular imaging (IVUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), near-infrared spectroscopic imaging (NIRS), etc., or non-invasive [4,5], i.e. X-ray angiography (XRA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), etc., each one having its advantages and disadvantages [6].

Imaging systems perform measurements and all measurements have uncertainties due to the equipment imperfection, human imprecision, instrumental calibration, etc. These uncertainties [7] describe how accurately a mathematical model can represent the true physics, and are determined after system tests and by taking into account the measurement procedure to estimate its reliability. To estimate the error of a system (group of instruments), the accuracy of a specified output approximated by a given numerical method is measured. Imaging systems [8] transmit and acquire signals using a detector in order to construct the image. However, all imaging systems are subject to error sources and the detected signals that construct the image include the variations of the detector or possible calibration errors [9]. Those artifacts can affect image quality [10,11], even though some of them are corrected by medical equipment software, resulting sometimes in false image representation. These artifacts, along with the image quality can affect automated or semi-automated computer-aided image processing methods. Spatial resolution [12] is a major determinant of image quality and describes the level of detail that can be distinguished on an image. Spatial resolution relates to how small an object can be in order to be detected by a particular imaging system. Imaging resolution of a digital image can be described in many different ways, including spatial resolution. Therefore, spatial resolution of an imaging system affects its resolution and the ability to resolve vessel microstructures; consequently, producing an error in the final image. Image formation errors include the limitations produced both by the pixel resolution (spatial resolution) of the image acquisition system and by any other possible systematic errors. Spatial resolution, usually is reported in line pairs per centimeter (lp/cm) and provides an adequate metric of the uncertainty implied by imaging system's formation errors.

The latest advances in computer technology and the need for automation of the diagnosis of vascular or carotid artery disease have made possible the development of automated methods for processing vessel images derived from various imaging modalities. These methods can be mainly grouped to methods segmenting the vessels [13–15] and methods characterizing the atherosclerotic plaque [16–20] of the segmented vessels, regardless of the imaging modalities used. Segmentation methods vary depending on the imaging modality or method being automated or semi-automated. Vessel segmentation methods are the key components of the automated plaque characterization methods; the results of a segmentation method are used as input in order for the plaque characterization method to be applied. However, all the plaque characterization methods have a serious drawback: plaque characterization and segmentation steps are validated independently. This leads to overestimated results as the segmentation error computed in the validation step and the acquired system image formation errors are not propagated into the final result.

In this work, a methodology to study the error propagation for both segmentation step and image formation is presented. The proposed error propagation methodology is validated using three different plaque characterization methods [16,17,20]. The first method [17] processes IVUS images and segments the artery using a semi-automated border detection method [13], based on the use of deformable models [21]. The pixels of the segmented area are then classified to dense calcium (DC), necrotic core (NC), fibrous tissue (FT), fibro-fatty tissue (FFT) and normal tissue-media (M), using a classification algorithm. The second method [20] uses active contours to detect the luminal borders in MRI images. It implements a knowledge-based algorithm to characterize the lipid core (LC) within the segmented area. Finally, the third method [16] segments and characterizes the artery automatically by classifying the plaque in four different plaque types: calcified plaque (Ca), lipid plaque (LP), fibrous tissue (FT) and mixed plaque (MP).

Although, the methods [16,17,20] have been validated thoroughly, the segmentation step error and the image formation error to the final plaque characterization results have not been taken into account. Currently, the proposed methodology is applied to present a more thorough and realistic validation. Specifically, for the IVUS method the influence of segmentation error and the image formation error to the detection of DC, NC, FT, FFT, M and the entire plaque area are validated. For the MRI approach, the influence of both segmentation error and the image formation error to the detection of LC are validated. Similarly to IVUS, for OCT the influence of both segmentation and image formation error to the detection of Ca, LP, FT, and MP are validated.

Although the plaque characterization results are affected by the propagated errors, still the results of the three methods [16,17,20] are accurate enough (Pearson's coefficient>0.86 in all plaque types) to be used for research or clinical applications.

The vessel plaque characterization methods are based on information derived from plaque segmentation methods, which detect lumen and media adventitia borders of a vessel. A block diagram showing the steps those methods and the error propagation from one step to another is presented in Fig. 1
                     .

The image formation error is calculated for the different modalities and plaque types based on simulation experiments. For the estimation of the maximum image formation error (MIFR) the shape S

The error which is propagated to the plaque characterization method is composed of the segmentation error of the method as well as the image formation error. The segmentation error is estimated for each modality by comparing the area of the ground truth and the method's detected area.

The error on the segmentation method is estimated in terms of percentage to the surface of each case. The mean error (E) is estimated as:

Plaque segmentation methods provide for each image frame two border lines: the lumen and the outer border. The region of interest (ROI) of the plaque detection methods is defined as the area between these two borders and is used as input to the plaque characterization methods. In order to estimate the error propagated in each plaque type, the ROI areas were modulated, until the desired area to be achieved (Eq. (5) or Eq. (6)), and were characterized.

The propagation of image segmentation errors in the plaque characterization algorithm is a random process, without any specific constraints, therefore to modulate the ROI area (A

divide the lumen (or the outer border) to four quadrants and choose one of the four,

increase the lumen quadrant (or decrease the outer quadrant) when the goal is to underestimate the ROI (

A schematic presentation of above described procedure is shown in Fig. 3
                        . The rationale, for using four quadrants was based on the assumption that an increment/decrement in the whole region of the lumen or outer border produces erroneous results (positive predictive value=1 or the sensitivity of the method=1); the area calculated by the method minus the common area between the two measurements and the golden standard area minus the common area between the two measurements is always zero. To overcome this limitation, the center of gravity of each lumen/outer border is detected, four quadrants are drawn and the lumen border can be increased or decreased uniformly (dividing the lumen to eight parts was also tested, and no significant change in the results was reported).

To validate the proposed error propagation method, IVUS, MRI and OCT images were used. All participants provided informed consent, while the study was approved by the Institution's Ethical Committee. To characterize the atherosclerotic plaque in IVUS images a plaque characterization method [17] which detects four tissue types: DC, NC, FT, FFT and normal tissue (M), was used. For MRI images a method [20] which detect LC, is used. Similarly for OCT images, a method [16] that detects four tissue types: Ca, LP, FT and MP was used.

The IVUS data were provided from the Department of Cardiology, Medical School of the University of Ioannina, using an electronic probe (Eagle eye Gold, Volcano Therapeutics, Inc.) of the following characteristics: synthetic aperture 3.5F and frequency 20MHz. IVUS images (size 648×648 pixels) and their corresponding virtual histology (VH-IVUS) [23] frames from 10 patients were acquired. From these dataset 35 IVUS frames were used as containing all four plaque types, and characterized [17] in order to study the error propagation. The color-coded VH-IVUS frames were used as gold standard.

The MRI data were acquired from 24 patients and were provided from Dept. of Radiology, school of clinical medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. The image parameters were: proton-density weighted (PDW): repetition time: 1379.31ms and the effective echo time: 7.672ms. Longitudinal relaxation time weighted (T1W): repetition time: 1428.57ms and the effective echo time: 7.672ms. Transverse relaxation time weighted (T2W): repetition time: 1379.31ms and the effective echo time: 99.736ms. The field of view was 100mm for all sequences and the section thickness 3mm. 35 T1W images were randomly selected and characterized. Two expert observers detected the regions of interests and identified the LC in these 35 MRI frames (any disagreement was resolved by consensus) and the inter-observer variability for the two expert observers in the 35 LC regions was −045±1.56mm2. Those data were used as the golden standard for the validation of the proposed error propagation methodology.

The OCT data were acquired from 22 patients, who underwent OCT investigation for clinical purposes using a C7XR Fourier Domain system (Lightlab Imaging, Westford, MA, USA) equipment. 35 OCT frames were randomly selected and characterized [16]. The data were provided by the San Giovanni Hospital, Rome, Italy. Annotations of two experts were used as gold standard for validating the proposed error propagation method. Any disagreements in experts’ annotations were resolved by consensus and the inter-observer variability for the two expert observers in the 35 tissue regions was −0.02±0.16mm2, −0.08±0.19mm2, −0.02±0.10mm2 and −0.06±0.26mm2, for Ca, LP, FT and MT, respectively.

In the 35 IVUS frames the error propagation study was performed for the detection of: all plaque components (DC, NC, FT, FFT and M), DC, NC, FT, FFT and M. In the 35 MRI frames the error propagation study was performed for the detected LC plaques, while in the 35 OCT frames the error propagation study was performed for the detection of: Ca, LP, FT, and MP.

For the acquisition of IVUS images, a Volcano system that generates intravascular images from an array of 64 microcrystals and has a spatial resolution of 0.15mm (150μm) [24] was used. For the acquisition of MRI images, a GE Medical Systems Signa Excite 1.5T MR unit, with spatial resolution of 0.4mm [25] was used. Finally, for the acquisition of OCT images, a C7XR Fourier Domain system generating images having a spatial resolution 0.015mm (15μm) [26,27] was used. The MIFR values computed for each plaque area calculated by IVUS, MRI and OCT are summarized in Table 1.

To validate the performance of the proposed methodology, regression analysis was performed to study the agreement between the plaque areas calculated by the method and the plaque areas obtained by the golden standard. Also, the Bland and Altman plots were constructed. Additionally, the positive predictive value (PPV) and ratio of overlapping (sensitivity)/non-overlapping (

As true positive values (TP) the common area between the two measurements was defined, as false positive (FP) values the area calculated by the method minus the common area and as false negative (FN) the golden standard area minus the common area (Fig. 4
                        ).

Before propagating the error from the border detection algorithm to the plaque characterization method in the 35 IVUS frames, an initial validation was made, using the initial ROI (with area A). When using the initial ROI (initial artery borders) of IVUS, the ROI area is not affected and consequently the plaque area remains the same. Thus, no validation results are presented for detecting all the plaque types (Fig. 7). Fig. 5
                         presents the comparison of DC, NC, FT and FFT areas extracted from VH and characterized by the method [17] using the initial, the overestimated, and underestimated lumen and external border areas while their corresponding Bland and Altman plots are shown in Fig. 6
                        . The comparison of plaque and normal tissue (M) using the initial, the overestimated and underestimated lumen and external border areas and their corresponding Bland and Altman plots are presented in Fig. 7
                        .

Similarly to IVUS, in OCT an initial validation was performed using the initial ROI. As the OCT method detects only the lumen border and expands the border up to 1.5mm to define the ROI we overestimated and underestimated the lumen borders and performed an error propagation analysis in Ca, LP, FT, and MP plaques. The methodology results were compared with areas detected by the experts (Fig. 8
                        ) and their corresponding Bland and Altman plots are presented in Fig. 9
                        .

For MRI, an initial validation was made using the initial ROI for detecting the LC in 35 MRI images. Fig. 10
                         presents the comparison and Bland and Altman plots for LC areas, detected by the experts and characterized by the method [20] using the initial, the overestimated and underestimated ROI areas.

Additionally to the error propagation of both the border detection algorithm and image formation (MIFR), the propagated error only from the border detection algorithm was calculated. The results are summarized in Tables 2–4

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this paper a methodology to evaluate the influence of the border detection methods and image formation errors to the overall accuracy of plaque characterization methods in arterial images is presented. The presented methodology is validated using recently presented plaque characterization methods [16,17,20] applied in real datasets with IVUS, MRI, and OCT images. The methods utilized [16,17,20] detect the vessel borders and characterize the atherosclerotic plaque. By calculating the maximum error that can be propagated to the plaque characterization result a more robust validation is presented. The proposed methodology shows that the final plaque characterization results can be affected by the propagated errors: ROI segmentation and spatial resolution errors.

The introduction of the proposed error propagation methodology in the IVUS plaque characterization method shows that the outcome of the method is affected by a significant factor. In order to study the propagated error in each of the steps of the IVUS method, the propagated error from the border detection algorithm was also computed. As presented in Table 2, when propagating the border detection error, there is no a significant change in the results: the mean bias is not too much affected and the Pearson's correlation coefficients of the plaques remain the same (0.99). However, when the border detection error and the image formation error is propagated, the final results do change. Although, there is no major change in the mean bias, the Pearson's coefficients of the detected plaque types change for both overestimation and underestimation of the ROI (lumen and external border) area: reduced to 0.93 from the initial 0.99. Normal tissue-media is the tissue type affected mostly by the error propagation: the Pearson's coefficient is decreased from 0.99, which was initially reported to 0.86 and 0.88 for overestimated and underestimated ROI area, respectively. However, this is a prospective result as the normal tissue-media detection is affected mostly by the Euclidian distance of the lumen to the external border [17]. Still, all mean biases of the different types of plaque are very close to zero, proving that the final plaque characterization results after propagating the border detection error and image formation error are still accurate enough for inferring clinical decisions.

In the carotid arteries, MRI case, the plaque detection and characterization method, using the originally produced artery borders, yielded an overestimation of the plaque areas. The underestimation produced by the introduction of border detection and image formation error canceled the aforementioned overestimation. Still, the image formation error increased the estimated mean bias by almost 10%, while the Pearson's coefficients are not affected (0.99). It should be noted that lipid plaque detection using MRI images assumes a minor user interaction, where the user defines a general region of interest. This interaction limits the impact of the two errors, border detection error and image formation, making the figures highly overestimated in what concerns the plaque error (meaning that the expected error is much less than the propagated one).

The proposed error propagation methodology when applied to the OCT plaque characterization method the final results are affected more than in the cases of IVUS and MRI. In both underestimated and overestimated ROI area, the mean bias is increased and the Pearson's coefficient is decreased (maximum decrement 0.73 from 0.97 in fibrous tissue), meaning that the plaque detection accuracy is reduced. Although OCT (0.015μm) has better spatial resolution compared to IVUS (0.15μm) and MRI (0.4), the propagation of the lumen and image formation errors to the final results decreases the plaque detection accuracy. However, the OCT method is limited in detecting the normal vessel wall (outer border of the ROI) and the external border of the ROI is the expanded lumen up to 1.5mm. In addition, plaque detection is not only based on the image intensity and texture as IVUS and MRI, but also on medical knowledge; i.e. a plaque region in order to be characterized needs to be fully bordered (Ca) or its outer border is estimated (LP) based on the plaque curvatures. Thus, the method is sensitive to lumen border detection as the ROI increment or decrement affects the final results. Still, the final results can be considered accurate enough.

The validation of all three imaging methods tested (IVUS, MRI, OCT) using the proposed error propagation methodology presented more realistic results and revealed that the accuracy of the detected plaques may be reduced in worst-case scenarios. In addition, in plaque detection methods which are sensitive to border detection, as OCT, an erroneous lumen detection can lead to erroneous results. Therefore, the proposed methodology could be used as an additional validation step in methods characterizing the atherosclerotic plaque. However, such methods should be two stage methods: in the first stage the lumen and outer wall are detected in order to determine the ROI and in the second stage the plaques are characterized. Furthermore, the methods need to be validated using the same validation metrics as the tested ones. Finally, the proposed error propagation methodology when applied to all three imaging methods (IVUS, MRI, OCT) does not affect the spatial location of the different plaque types when compared to the golden standard.

The most common imaging modalities for atherosclerosis are IVUS, OCT, MRI, IVUS Palpography, intracoronary angioscopy and computed tomography [28]. Currently, the proposed error propagation methodology is applied to three of these imaging modalities (IVUS, OCT, and MRI). All the above modalities depict the plaque area and its composition. Therefore, the proposed error propagation methodology could be applied in any two stage plaque characterization approach.

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

One limitation of the proposed error propagation methodology is that the error coming from the golden standard (VH-IVUS or experts) cannot be propagated. In order to incorporate such an error in the present study, validation of VH-IVUS plaque detection and expert annotation variability on MRI and OCT images must be performed using the same validation metrics. The inter observer variability for experts annotations, compared to VH-IVUS has been computed and validated using histology [23,29] and different metrics. However, in order to match histological cross sections with IVUS frames, experts stain with hematoxylin the histology (producing Masson's trichrome images) and annotate the stained histological images. Therefore, there is an extra error (both from Masson's trichrome images procedure and annotation) in the histology which is propagated in the VH-IVUS results. The propagation of such errors in the final characterization is a real challenge and requires both the presence of histological segments and the validation of the errors using the same metrics.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper a propagation methodology for calculating the error resulting from the application of sequential image processing methods toward plaque characterization in arterial segments is presented. Three application examples have been presented for plaque characterization in IVUS, MRI and OCT imaging modalities. All the methods presented in the literature, having sequential steps for characterizing the plaque do not take into consideration the error propagated from one step to another or the error resulting from the image formation. Although, presented in this work that the maximum resulted propagated error is higher than the initial one, the expected propagated error lies, in acceptable limits, not affecting clinical decision. Thus, the proposed methodology could be used as an extra validation step in plaque characterization methods followed by vessel segmentation.

To find the best threshold, thr for the MIRF calculation, the area of dense calcium (Table 1) was used and MIRF values for different thr in the range of [0.01–0.99] were computed. As it is shown in Fig. 11
                     , MIFR values are symmetric in the range of 0.01–0.99 and the highest MIFR is achieved for thr
                     =0.01. Therefore we choose thr
                     =0.01 as the percentage of activation for a low-resolution cell. The area of the plaque affects only the absolute value of MIFR (Eq. (1)) and not the distribution of MIFR over different values of thr. In order to have a threshold of larger precision (>0.01) a larger spatial resolution (more than 10×) should be applied, which however increases computational cost. Finally, the error trend as depicted in Fig. 11 is linear and therefore is not expected to increase significantly for thr
                     <0.01.
