                  We study the strategic behavior of two countries facing transboundary CO2 pollution under a differential game setting. In our model, the reduction of CO2 concentration occurs through the carbon capture and storage process, rather than through the adoption of cleaner technologies. Furthermore, we first provide the explicit short-run dynamics for this dynamic game with symmetric open-loop and a special Markovian Nash strategy. Then, we compare these strategies at the games’ steady states and along some balanced growth paths. Our results show that if the initial level of CO2 is relatively high, state dependent emissions reductions can lead to higher overall environmental quality, hence, feedback strategy leads to less social waste.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

According to the International Energy Agency (2011), energy related CO2 emissions have increased by 5.9 percent in 2010, with no perspective of a slowdown in the coming decade. Although 75% of this increase has been driven by emerging economies such as China or India, energy consumption in developed countries remains at high and increasing levels. The largest share of this increase in energy demand is absorbed by new coal, gas, and oil fired power plants, oil sands and more recently unconventional gas sources.
                        2
                        Unconventional gas sources refers to gas which has not been exploited to its full extent, essentially unprofitable. These gas sources include: (i) deep natural gas, trapped in very deep deposits underground, (ii) tight natural gas, stuck in tight formations, trapped in impermeable rocks or non-porous sandstone formations, and (iii) shale gas, caught in shale rock formations, deep underground. See Smith (1980) for more details about unconventional gas sources.

As a consequence, non-renewable energies will be used over a longer period, but they need to be used more efficiently. Unfortunately, improvements in energy use can only be applied progressively, as they often entail a switch in technology and ensuing adoption costs. Conversely, capture technologies, which do not require a change in production technology, could be more rapidly applied at a large scale, mainly for two reasons: (i) their only requirement is to fit coal-fired power plants with capture technologies; and (ii) capture technologies can be implemented on large energy supply sites at lower cost than current low emissions technologies.
                        3
                        The International Energy Agency (2010) noted that carbon capture and storage is fundamental in a least-cost carbon abatement mix. If carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are not implemented, the overall costs to limit to 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       2
                                    
                                    
                                       0
                                    
                                 
                              
                           C global mean temperature would rise by 70%. Furthermore, this figure could be even larger if CCS is used at a larger scale because it will further reduce its costs. Biello (2009) mentions that the present CO2 capturing cost is about $50 to $90 per metric ton, and costs could potentially be reduced to $20 by scaling up the process.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been at the forefront lately, as it encompasses a broad set of technologies, and it essentially consists in capturing CO2 emissions from large point sources and storing it in geological formations.
                        4
                        The storage technology is not new and has been in use mainly in oil fields and nature gas extracting wells. More details on key projects on http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/ccs/key-projects.
                     
                     
                        4
                      In the recent past CCS has raised increasing interest among scientists and policy makers. In 2007 for instance, CCS was accepted as a climate change mitigation possibility within the Kyoto Protocol, on top of national regulations (see IEA, 2010). However, the implementation of large scale transboundary policies remains largely an unaddressed issue, dealt at the national or regional level so far. This is notably true for the development of large scale CCS demonstration sites. International cooperation on CCS regulation seems unavoidable, given the international nature of climate change. In the coming years, CCS will therefore certainly be part of a mix of solutions to mitigate climate change, as it permits non-negligible reductions of CO2 emissions.

In the present paper, we use a dynamic framework to analyze the strategic behavior of countries when pollution is borderless and mitigation policies are nationally financed. This framework corresponds to the CCS case nowadays. Our framework focuses on non-renewable resources, i.e. we do neither consider the possibility of adopting technologies based on renewable resources nor energy saving technological progress. This is consistent with the view that CO2 emissions due to the usage of non-renewable resources will still be an important issue in the future.

Furthermore, the transboundary nature of pollution is of tremendous importance when dealing with CO2 emissions. A number of contributions have tackled this issue: Copeland and Taylor (1994, 1995) study the relationship between trade and transboundary pollution. In their 1994 contribution, they note that “…free trade increases world pollution…” and propose a number of policies regarding global pollution in their subsequent 1995 paper. Building on these results, Hatzipanayotou, Lahiri, and Michael (2002, 2005) offer complementary abatement policies, while Alemdar and Ozyildirim (2002) study the relationship among transboundary pollution, knowledge spillovers and growth in a North–South model. However, these studies ignore the possibility of having recourse to CCS, and only analyze long term issues. In the present work, we take these aspects into account. Our contribution also differs in this regard to Kalkuhl, Edenhofer, and Lessmann (2012), who explicitly model the CCS mechanism and provide some comparison elements between CCS and pure renewable energy policies. Nevertheless, their setting is based on one country model without any strategic interactions nor international competition.

Our framework partly relies on Dockner and Van Long (1993, 2000)’s model of a two-player dynamic game of international pollution control and transboundary pollution which characterizes cooperative and non-cooperative strategies of a government maximizing the discounted stream of benefits of the representative consumer. Special attention is paid to the existence, multiplicity and properties of stationary steady states via Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations. We however depart from previous work in several ways. First, we provide the short-run dynamics via a transitory dynamic analysis using Pontryagin Maximum Principle. The short run is crucial in the case of CCS since its implementation requires to complement existing technologies in the short run. Second, we present two alternative non-cooperative scenarios characterized by open-loop strategies and one scenario using a special type of Markovian strategies. In the absence of supranational institutions enforcing environmental regulations, our scenarios describe some alternatives available to policy makers, the multilateral negotiations involved and the optimal strategies. Notice that optimal strategies are adaptable in time and depend on the state of pollution. Further details about the strategic choices and their implications are provided in Section 4.1.

Further, we can describe analytically the short run dynamics. Adoption of new, more environmental friendly technologies is lengthy and involves considerable inertia due to high fixed costs of present technologies. This is not so much the case for CCS technologies, more readily applicable, and to which we refer to in the present paper. In terms of the modeling strategy, we suppose that pollution is predetermined and that agents decide the amount of emissions to reduce. As a corollary, pollution reduction does not imply a direct reduction of output in the production process. Following Aghion and Howitt (1998), we introduce a potential rate of regeneration in the equation for environmental quality. In the existing literature, most studies ignore the possibility that different countries may be endowed with different capacities to absorb pollution. We believe it is of considerable importance since the self-regeneration capacity of nature acts as a pollution sink.

Countries with open-loop strategies commit once and for all to a trajectory of reduction of emissions.
                        5
                        More about strategies choice and related literature are presented in the next Section.
                     
                     
                        5
                      Open-loop strategies are used in situations in which it is difficult or too costly to check commitments. We find a unique equilibrium solution to the dynamic system, which is interior under certain assumptions. Furthermore, weakly restricting the parameter set, we prove the existence of a balanced growth path where pollution and efforts displayed to absorb emissions grow at the same rate as the emissions. Contrary to most of the previous findings, and in line with Wirl (1994), we prove that Markovian strategies are not always socially less desirable. Indeed, allowing countries to revise their effort to reduce emissions every period leads to lower overall levels of pollution, provided levels of pollution are sufficiently high.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we briefly introduce the basics of CCS economics, and possible challenges for future multilateral rounds of negotiations. The model is unfolded in Section 3. Section 4 displays the different strategy choices, and explains the theoretical results; in Sections 5 we compare the outcomes from different strategies. Section 6 concludes.


                     
                        6
                        This section relies on Intergovernmental panel on climate Change (2007) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2007).
                     
                     
                        6
                     The tremendous growth performance of a number of economies and the ensuing energy famine thereof has led to a situation where new coal-fired power plants open every week worldwide, most of which are located in China and in a number of other emerging economies. Furthermore, coal plays also a significant role in countries like Poland or Germany, notably to progressively compensate for the reduction of nuclear energy. All these facts indicate that increases in energy supply will not come from zero-emission sources in the medium run. In this regard, CCS appears as a transition technology for the coming decades, as these technologies build on traditional energy supply technologies.

Whenever fossil fuel is burned, it generates CO2, which is usually emitted in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. CCS refers to a set of technologies meant at capturing, compressing, transporting and storing CO2 emissions permanently. Despite its advantages, CCS technologies have not been massively adopted since they remain relatively costly: estimates show that fitting a power plant with additional CCS technology might increase its cost by about 50 per cent for the installation of the capture equipment.
                        7
                        See, for example, the Global CCS Institute report (2011).
                     
                     
                        7
                     
                  

On top of the capture process itself, the transport and storage systems have to be built and operated, increasing the running costs further (Heal & Tarui, 2008). Inferring the cost structure on CCS is not straightforward, as the returns to scale depend on the interlink of costs of capture, transport and storage, each of which highlights potential economies of scale at given emissions levels (Bielicki, 2008).

From a legal point of view, there have been a number of steps undertaken to foster CCS regulation at national and international levels. Probably the most noticeable advance has been the integration of CCS as a climate change mitigation instrument within the Kyoto Protocol in 2007, although so far, no agreement has been found regarding their inclusion of CCS in the Clean Development Mechanism.
                        8
                        The Clean development Mechanism allows developed countries to invest in the reduction of emissions in less developed countries, earning this way certified emissions reduction credits.
                     
                     
                        8
                      A further issue facing CCS regulation is the classification of CO2 emissions as industrial by-product or as waste product. This seemingly unimportant detail has profound consequences as industrial projects are in general subject to less stringent regulations than waste disposal projects. In the London Convention, CO2 from capture processes is defined as industrial waste, which then opens the path to further legislation allowing its storage in sub-seabed geological formations.
                        9
                        The London Convention dealt with the prevention of marine pollution. It is in force since 1975 and was largely amended and modernized in 1996.
                     
                     
                        9
                      There is however no mention to CO2 transport across borders in this Convention.

There is a number of further regulatory and policy initiatives at the regional level. The Oslo-Paris Convention consists of the European Union, fifteen governments of the western coasts and catchments of Europe. They cooperate on issues related to marine environment protection. In the US, the Enhanced Oil Recovery has a long experience in transporting, injecting and storing CO2 (see Marston & Moore, 2008).

Despite existing regulations, many issues remain legally unframed. Among others, let us mention questions related to permits to explore and store, risk regulation, assessments of the effects of projects, measures in case of leakage, responsibility transfer and transport-related regulation. The lack of a complete regulation on CCS leaves many countries in a situation of self-organization.

In this present paper, we avail of the legal and policy aspects of CCS to develop a framework, allowing us to take account of the strategic interactions arising in a international competition setting, where CO2 emissions freely move between countries and affect their wellbeing. To address these issues, we present a model where countries act strategically to determine the level of CO2 emissions that each country will reduce. In the first version of the model, countries pre-commit simultaneously to an entire path of CCS (open loop strategies). Then, in a second version, countries condition their action to the current period’s level of pollution (Markovian strategies).

Suppose there are two neighboring countries, i and j. Both produce the same consumption good with pollution as a byproduct. These two countries share the same CO2 pollution state,

                      measure the quantity of captured CO2 emissions by country i and j, respectively. The positive coefficient 
                        
                           β
                        
                      measures the unit effect of CO2 emissions reduction. Notice that if abatement is zero, pollution will increase much faster. Furthermore, if emissions are over the absorption rate of nature itself, CO2 accumulation will increase without bound. In our context, CO2 capture depends on countries’ infrastructures resulting from specific investments and CCS qualifies in this regard.

Facing the CO2 emissions reduction problem, the two countries need to choose their capture rates

                      is specific to CCS technologies. Indeed, note that the amount of CO2 one country can capture is not constrained so that we implicitly assume that countries can capture and store any fraction of their emissions. Consequently, at any time t countries must have a storage capacity as large as their stock of pollution in case it is optimally required. Although it is easy to capture and store small stocks of CO2, the difficulty to find appropriate storage capacities increases with the size of the stock of CO2.

                      weights the mentioned difficulty to find appropriate storage capacities for CO2. Hence, the total marginal cost of storing is increasing, and it is given in the present setting by

                     , the problem boils down to the case of Dockner and Van Long (1993) where the reduction cost is state independent. Despite this, our analysis deviates from Dockner and Van Long (1993) as they compare cooperative outcomes to Markovian strategies along the stationary path, whereas we study the complete trajectory dynamics of the difference between open loop and Markovian strategies.

This case arises if country i cares more about the transboundary pollutant CO2, which may arise if (i) country j does not have enough storage capacity, (ii) it is too costly for j, or (iii) country j does not have the CCS technology yet.

In the next section, for the above defined game, we present both short-run and long-run open-loop strategies and one kind of Markovian Nash strategy. A detailed explanation of these different cases is provided in this section as well. Then following literature, Section 5 compares the outcomes of these two strategies in terms of their long-run steady states and their balanced growth paths.

In this section, we first provide a general description of the strategic choices available to the players. In particular, we provide a lengthy explanation as to how the two chosen strategies differ from each other and how they differ from previous work.

Second, we study the case in which the countries play open-loop strategies. At the beginning of the game, both countries commit to reduce emissions levels

                      for all periods in time, independently of the state of the world. We compute the explicit solution path. Then, we analyze the model’s steady state and its balanced growth path. The effect of

Third, we study one (among many) Markovian Nash equilibrium via the Pontryagin maximum principle where the emissions reduction strategies change according to the state of pollution: for

In their seminal work, Dockner and Van Long (1993) are the first to introduce a differential games approach into the study of a transboundary pollution control problem. They mainly compare the outcome between cooperative and non-cooperative pollution control strategies, considering the former strategy as their benchmark. Their main finding states that if both countries chose linear strategies, then there are losses, as both countries face a higher pollution stock at the steady state. However, if both countries opt for non-linear strategies, with small discount rates, the non-linear Markovian Perfect strategies may lead to an outcome which is very close to the cooperative strategy outcome.

In subsequent work, Rubio and Casino (2002) confirmed Wirl (1994) and Wirl and Dockner (1996)’s earlier finding that non-linear strategies may be Pareto-inferior to the linear strategies, thus weakening the argument for non-linear strategies. Our approach differs from Dockner and Van Long (1993) as well as from Rubio and Casino (2002), as we extend our analysis beyond the steady state and focus on the trajectory dynamics. In the present study of CCS technologies, the trajectory dynamics are crucial since they might well establish as a transition technology.

Furthermore, following Dockner and Sorger (1996), most studies have simply ignored open-loop strategies. It was thought that players are naive, as they do not use any information acquired during the game and consequently do not respond to changes in the current stock. In the context of climate change and mitigation policies, it is important to distinguish between countries which have taken binding commitments to stabilize/reduce their GHG emissions, such as in the Kyoto Protocol, and countries which have proposed more flexible approaches, based on regular updates of the targets to reach, according to current states of the world. Stated differently, the open-loop strategy can be considered as a translation of the current mechanisms to curb down GHG emissions.

The difference between open-loop and the Markovian Nash strategies can be illustrated using the Kyoto protocol as follows: the proponents of the former approach have taken commitments about emission reductions from which they cannot deviate. The holder of the latter approach can, on the contrary, deviate from their commitment and regularly revise their target.

In Rubio and Casino (2002), the authors find that in linear-quadratic games, the linear Markov-perfect equilibrium is typically less efficient than the open-loop equilibrium outcome and far less efficient than the cooperative outcome. However, given that “
                           
                              ⋯
                           
                         each country realizes that the other country’s future emissions may depend directly or indirectly on its own current emissions, the perceived feedback effect may cause it to choose a different course of action. This intertemporal dimension may attenuate the free-rider problem,” (Dockner and Van Long, 1993, p.14). Indeed, our results dig further in the standard free-rider problem, as we explain in the next section.

A further departure from Dockner and Van Long (1993) comes from the fact that we are not comparing open-loop Nash equilibrium with all infinitely many stationary Markovian Perfect Nash Equilibria provided by the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman.
                           14
                           The statement and reasoning of infinitely many Markovian perfect Nash equilibria can be found in Dockner and Van Long (1993), Rubio and Casino (2002) and the references therein.
                        
                        
                           14
                         Rather, we take one particular equilibrium via Pontragin’s maximum principle, which yields the stationary equilibrium and the trajectory path.
                           15
                           For the Hamilton-Jacob-Bellman equation, due to a lack of boundary conditions, there are infinitely many stationary solutions if the given functions are time independent. However, given the time dependency of our functions, there is no guarantee of a stationary solution during the trajectory path. Hence, the Hamilton-Jacob-Bellman equation is not useful in our situation. Note however that for linear-quadratic games, a linear-strategy can give a time dependent trajectory path.

In the sequel of this paper, we focus on symmetric solutions, i.e., countries adopt the same strategy.

                           We are thinking for example, on the largest CO2 emission parties, such as U.S.A, China or the EU.

                        , the above expressions imply that any increase in b leads to a decrease in the country’s CO2 capture and a subsequent increase in the CO2 stock. This case arises when the countries are patient enough (large r) and/or the nature regeneration level is high (large

On the other hand, when the direct damage cost is high enough, the environmental quality improves and emissions fall when the path for emissions capture is settled once and for all. More precisely, if

                        , then a higher b leads to a larger CO2 capture. The reason lies on the nature of the CCS process itself, on the infinite horizon of the problem and on the perfect foresight assumption. Indeed, if c is already large and b increases, then countries have accrued incentives to capture CO2 emissions and reduce their stock of CO2 as soon as possible. Failing to do so and letting grow the stock of CO2 generates higher costs directly, because the stock is larger, and indirectly because they would require a larger storage capacity.

In the next subsection, we study one type of state-dependent strategies. The level of emissions capture is revised every period according to the state of the environment. Under this scenario, countries can adapt their strategies according to the contemporaneous environmental situation.

Suppose now that both countries can change their emissions capture strategies depending on the pollution state. Define the Markovian Nash equilibrium as follows:

                           We only study one particular Markovian Nash equilibrium but there may be others.

In Example 4.1 in Dockner et al. (2000), players choose a mixture of open-loop and Markovian strategies via conjecturing the rival’s potential optimal strategy. We adapt this conjecturing method and prove that indeed conjecturing leads to one Markovian strategy (among possibly many).

So far, we have presented the short run trajectories of two different strategies: open-loop commitment and one special case of Markovian Nash Equilibrium. In the two settings, trajectories are explicit and essentially depend on short-run targets. In the next section, we go one step further and analyse the long run of the strategies established in this section. We shall assume there are two possibilities for emissions 
                           
                              E
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                         in the long run: either E is constant or it grows at a constant rate. We will pay special attention to the additional information provided by the feedback strategies about the capture process.

First, we notice that Assumptions 1 and 2 are not identical even when 
                        
                           E
                           (
                           t
                           )
                        
                      is a constant. If Assumption 1 holds and Assumption 2 fails, then there is a positive steady state with open-loop strategies while there is no steady state with Markovian strategies. Similarly, if Assumption 1 fails and Assumption 2 holds, there exists a positive steady state with Markovian strategies but not under open-loop strategies. In this section, we focus on the situation in which both open-loop and Markovian feedback strategies have positive CO2 stock at the steady state.

In order to compare the effect of different strategies in the long run, let us assume first that 
                        
                           E
                           (
                           t
                           )
                        
                      is constant in the long run and that Assumption 2 holds in both open-loop and our special Markovian strategy. Combining Assumptions 1 and 2, we study the situations in different cases.

Under Case 1 or 2, both open-loop and Markovian strategies lead to positive saddle path stable steady states, though the steady state values may not coincide.

                     Proposition 4 states that the special Markovian feedback strategy leads to a lower long-run CO2 level than the open-loop commitment. The Markovian strategy offers information on the CO2 stock at every time, so that countries can compute the future reduction in costs induced by capturing existing CO2. Indeed, if countries capture a higher share of CO2, they diminish the current and future CO2 stock, diminishing the future direct cost at the same time. Notice that the indirect cost is indeed lower since the term bx diminishes as well. Hence, one can conclude that Markovian strategies lead to a lower public bad and yield less social waste. Our finding is in line with Wirl (1994) who shows a similar result, but under a different setting (see also Braden & Bromley (1981), Hoel (1991), and references therein).

Furthermore, Proposition 4 also shows that countries should take into account both the environmental cost, which in our setting could be the direct cost due to CO2 emissions, and the state dependent cost of emissions reduction, that is, the indirect cost of CCS including installation and adjustment costs.

Besides, Markovian feedback strategies usually lead to free riding, i.e. there is lower public goods in feedback than in open loop and hence, higher public bad in feedback. However, this is not necessarily true in our framework. We have shown that if the environmental cost is high,

                     , it is better to reduce emissions further. People would be more willing to pay to improve the environment rather than face the consequences of higher CO2 pollution levels. Nonetheless, players with open-loop strategies will stick to their commitments ignoring real-time information.

                     . Again, depending on the cost coefficients b and c, the feedback strategy may provide countries with more information. This additional information leads to faster convergence to the lower steady state for pollution. Therefore, the Markovian Nash equilibrium can improve the long-run situation, giving the countries a chance to adjust their behaviors.

This result seems contradicting at first sight, given that agents playing in Markovian strategies capture less CO2 than under commitment,

                     , then agents playing open-loop strategies will experience a higher level of CO2 stock in the long run, and they will also capture a larger share of CO2. This picture is the limit of the short-run behavior described in Section 4. Indeed, players under Markovian strategies achieve a low long-run level of CO2 stock because they have captured more CO2 along the transition path than open-loop players. Therefore, Markovian players achieve a low CO2 stock, and having captured CO2 more intensively in the short run, they do not need to exert any intense capture effort along the balanced growth path.

Nonetheless, when the capture process is state independent, that is 
                        
                           b

                           0
                        
                     , the Markovian strategies coincide with the open-loop strategies along the balanced growth path. Therefore, policy makers should care about the cost of CO2 pollution and whether this cost is or not state dependent. Only then they can choose between an open-loop commitment or Markovian strategies.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have presented a dynamic strategic setting where two countries have to decide about their effort to reduce CO2 emissions through capture and storage mechanisms. Both countries benefit from these reductions, despite the private nature of CO2 capture and storage. We present explicit short run dynamics within two particular strategies. First, both countries decide upon the emissions capture once and for all, independently of the evolution of the environment. The case where countries choose open-loop strategies can be assimilated to a situation where both parties sign a binding treaty for a fixed time period about emissions reductions. We show that in this case total emissions of CO2 decrease and the environmental quality improves when the direct pollution cost is high enough. In the second case, the two countries play Markovian strategies. Contrary to the common belief of the free rider outcome of Markovian strategies (see Dockner & Van Long, 1993; Dockner et al., 2000), we find that if pollution is initially high, then Markovian strategies lead to a cleaner environment than open-loop strategies. Intuitively, countries tend to capture more emissions when they can adjust their efforts from one period to another. From a policy point of view, governing carbon capture and storage mechanisms can do better in flexible mechanisms.
