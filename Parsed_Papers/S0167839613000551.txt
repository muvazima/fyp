                  This paper proposes a generalization of the ordinary de Casteljau algorithm to manifold-valued data including an important special case which uses the exponential map of a symmetric space or Riemannian manifold. We investigate some basic properties of the corresponding Bézier curves and present applications to curve design on polyhedra and implicit surfaces as well as motion of rigid body and positive definite matrices. Moreover, we apply our approach to construct canal and developable surfaces.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In various applications like medical imaging, elasticity, array signal processing and dynamics, one has to deal with data living in a manifold, Lie group or more generally symmetric space. In several works including Ur Rahman et al. (2005), Wallner and Dyn (2005), Wallner and Pottmann (2006), Wallner et al. (2007), Grohs (2009, 2010), Nava-Yazdani (2008), Xie and Yu (2008), Nava-Yazdani and Yu (2011), Itai and Sharon (2013) and Ebner (2013) subdivision schemes have been generalized and applied to nonlinear settings. Besides subdivision schemes, the de Casteljau algorithm is of significant importance in modeling and computer aided geometric design. There are several publications on Bézier curves in the sphere including the early work (Shoemake, 1985). Moreover, Li et al. (2010) generalize the classical de Casteljau algorithm for constructing spherical Bézier based on corner cutting. For further approaches and modifications concerning the de Casteljau algorithm in certain nonlinear cases we refer to Park and Ravani (1995), Crouch et al. (1999) and Jakubiak et al. (2006). In the present work, we introduce a framework generalizing previous results to manifold-valued data and study some of main properties of the resulting Bézier curve. For many practical purposes geodesics are computationally too expensive or time-consuming. We show how to use alternative approaches preserving main desired properties of the construction. Moreover, we present applications to the geodesic Bézier approach for polyhedral surfaces, Euclidean group of motion and diffusion tensors and also use the produced curves to construct canal and ruled surfaces.

                      A good example to have in mind is the following. Let M be Riemannian and 
                        f
                        =
                        exp
                      the Riemannian exponential map. In this case, if 
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        ∈
                        U
                      with a distance within the injectivity radius of f at x, then 
                        g
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                      is the velocity and 
                        Φ
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                      is the geodesic from x to y. Moreover, if M is geodesically complete, then f is defined on whole TM and any two points can be joined by a (not necessarily unique) geodesic. For instance, see example 1. Another class of important applications is given, if M is a Lie group or more generally a symmetric space with f the exponential map. Note that if M is a Lie group admitting a bi-invariant metric (e.g., if M is compact), then the Lie group exponential map coincides with the Riemannian one.

If M is just the m-dimensional Euclidean space

                     . In this case, Definition 2 gives the ordinary linear de Casteljau algorithm. Other examples are provided by g being the nearest point projection in the ambient Euclidean space onto M as well as stereographic projection in case of a sphere. In this examples

                      and the maps f and g are independent of the base point x. Another example is given by 
                        g
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y

                      the orthogonal projection of y to

                        M
                      the tangent space at x. Compared to the geodesic construction, this approach has the advantages that it is computationally less time-consuming (f and g are simpler) and one needs only to deal with the resp. linearization of the manifold M at the control points. Next, consider any chart around 
                        x
                        ∈
                        U
                      and replace f and g by their local representation. Let us denote derivatives of f and g in the first resp. second argument by

Besides geometric and design issues, computational aspects are of great importance in most applications. Particularly, a polynomial or at least rational basic function is desirable. Note that the corresponding Bézier curve enjoys the same property.

Note that the basic functions given in Examples 4 and 5 are not segmenting. Moreover, every dynamical function is segmenting. Next, we characterize dynamical functions in terms of above geometric intuitive property.

                           Suppose that Φ is a locally rigid basic segmenting function on M. Then Φ is dynamical.

                            The Cayley map provides a suitable linearization of the exponential map near identity. In contrast to the exponential map it is rational. This fact is useful in numerical applications, since evaluating transcendental functions can be time-consuming. Cayley map is a first order Padé approximation. In our example any higher order Padé approximation can be used to increase accuracy.

Next, we consider the generalization of Lie groups to symmetric spaces. There are various applications of symmetric spaces in many areas and their structure admits the notion of exponential map. Positive definite symmetric matrices provide a prominent example of a symmetric space and arise in many applications like elasticity and medical imaging. Affine subspaces of Euclidean space provide further examples. For convenient of the reader, we recall some basic facts and refer to Wallner et al. (2011) and Nava-Yazdani and Yu (2011) for details. Suppose that M is a homogeneous space, i.e., 
                        M
                        =
                        G
                        /
                        K
                      where K is a Lie subgroup of a Lie group G. Then M is called a symmetric space iff there is an involutive automorphism

                        Example 19
                        This example addresses construction of Bézier curves on polyhedral surfaces. In polyhedra, one can consider shortest as well as straightest geodesics (see Figs. 4 and 5
                           
                           ). The concept of straightest geodesics has been introduced by Polthier and Schmies (1998). Straightest geodesics in polyhedral surfaces are characterized by the property that at inner point of an edge outbound and inbound angles coincide and at a vertex left and right angles sum up to half of total vertex-angle (see Fig. 6
                           ). In contrast to shortest, straightest geodesics uniquely solve the geodesic initial value problem (see Polthier and Schmies, 1998). Moreover a straightest geodesic coincides with the shortest, provided the geodesic does not pass through a spherical vertex. Hence, for an initial point 
                              x
                              ∈
                              M
                            and initial velocity v the Riemannian exponential map 
                              exp
                              (
                              x
                              ,
                              v
                              )
                            is the endpoint of the corresponding straightest geodesic. As for n vertices computation of the endpoint 
                              exp
                              (

Many important surfaces can be constructed as a 1-parameter family of simple curves. The most important examples are canal and ruled surfaces (1-parameter family of circles resp. straight lines). Envelope of a family of spheres whose centers lie on a space curve is a canal surface. Particularly, if the sphere centers lie on a straight line, then the canal surface is a surface of revolution. A surface S is ruled if through every point of S there is a straight line that lies on S. Hence it can be parametrized as a one-parameter family of straight lines. For applications of canal and ruled surfaces in architecture we refer to Pottmann et al. (2007).

Our approach can also be applied to produce further classical surfaces. For instance, Pinkall (2008) gives a constructive approach to design cylinders with constant negative curvature using their characterization via Gauß map. Therein the task is reduced to refine a discrete Chebyshev net in the 2-sphere. The Chebyshev net is completely determined by initial points

                            and

                                    i
                                    +

                           . Due to Theorem 3 applying Definition 2 parallelograms refine to parallelograms. Hence we may apply Definition 2 with 
                              M
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                            and f and g from our first example to construct the net. Using the method described in Pinkall (2008) the surface can then be reconstructed (see Fig. 9
                           ).

Considering computational and geometric aspects with focus on applications in CAGD and approximation tasks, we have presented a generalization of de Casteljauʼs algorithm to manifold-valued data. The canonical choice for Riemannian manifolds as well as Lie groups and more generally symmetric spaces uses an accurate approximation of the exponential map. The Cayley map and orthogonal projection on the tangent space provide further examples. Also, using certain Bézier curves on the 2-sphere we can efficiently construct canal resp. ruled surfaces as 1-parameter family of circles resp. straight lines.
