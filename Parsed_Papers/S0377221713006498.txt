                  This note studies the relationships between different aspects of agent’s preferences toward risk. We show that, under the assumptions of non-satiation and bounded marginal utility, prudence implies risk aversion (imprudence implies risk loving) and that temperance implies prudence (intemperance implies imprudence). The implications of these results for comparing risks in the cases of increase in risk, increase in downside risk and increase in outer risk are discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A wide literature in the theory of decision making under uncertainty focuses on agents’ attitude towards risk by analyzing features of the utility function. Some of the different concepts identified have great relevance to economic problems. Three of the most important are risk aversion, prudence and temperance.

Risk aversion was originally introduced by Pratt (1964), and describes the idea that agents dislike risks. Risk aversion is relevant in a wide range of economic issues, including insurance, portfolio problems and asset pricing (for a survey see, for instance, Gollier, 2001). When we assume that preference are represented by the utility function U(x) where x is the agent’s consumption, the agent’s attitude toward risk aversion is related to the second derivative of this function. In particular, an agent is risk averse if

Prudence was first introduced in the literature on precautionary saving (see Kimball, 1990; Leland, 1968; Sandmo, 1970) as the desire to increase saving in the presence of income risk. Beyond its relevance for saving decisions, prudence has also proved to be important in other fields, such as optimal prevention (Eeckhoudt & Gollier, 2005; Menegatti, 2009) and the agent’s preferences about skewness (Chiu, 2005; Menezes, Geiss, & Tressler, 1980). In utility theory, an agent is prudent if

Temperance, the third concept, was introduced by Kimball (1992) in the study of the effect of labor income risk on the fraction of saving devoted to risky investment, and is defined as “moderation in accepting [independent] risks” (Kimball, 1992, p. 160). This feature of preferences has been shown to be relevant for optimal decisions in the presence of background risk (Eeckhoudt, Gollier, & Schlesinger, 1996; Gollier & Pratt, 1996), in the study of the agent’s preferences when risks differ in kurtosis (Menezes & Wang, 2005) and for the analysis of the effects on saving of an increase in the downside risk of future labor income (Eeckhoudt & Schlesinger, 2008). In utility theory, an agent is temperate if

Risk aversion, prudence and temperance are concepts which concern different aspects of the agent’s attitude toward risk, and which are related to three derivatives of different orders of the utility function. However, since they are related to different features of the same preferences (i.e. different derivatives of the same function), it is important to understand if there are relationships between them. As will be shown in the literature overview below, few results have been derived on this issue.

The aim of this work is to provide new insight into this field. We will show in particular that the different aspects of the agent’s attitude toward risk are not independent and that, under plausible assumptions on the utility function, prudence implies risk aversion (imprudence implies risk loving) and temperance implies prudence (intemperance implies imprudence). Moreover, since risk aversion, prudence and temperance are related to agents’ choices in many economic problems, the existence of these relationships is potentially relevant for many issues. This work analyses some of the most relevant of these issues, by studying comparison between different risks and by providing a simple application to a precautionary saving problem.

The work proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a short literature overview. Section 3 introduces the assumptions and studies the relationships between temperance, prudence and risk aversion. Section 4 presents the implications of the results derived for increase in risk, increase in downside risk and increase in outer risk. Section 5 provides a simple application to precautionary saving. Section 6 concludes.

There are two main strands of literature relevant for the present work.

This work studies the relationships between different features of preferences toward risk, represented by the signs of derivatives of different order of the utility function. Despite its potentially important implications, this issue is not largely studied in utility theory.
                        1
                        For a very recent discussion on why it is important to study the signs of derivatives of the utility function of order larger than 2 (and in particular of orders 3 and 4) see the recent survey by Eeckhoudt (2012). Many papers (such as those cited in the introduction) study the interpretation of these signs. However they do not analyze the relationship between them.
                     
                     
                        1
                      To my knowledge the only explicit finding in this field was made by Menegatti (2001) who proved that if an agent is non-satiated and risk averse and if the third derivative of her utility function is assumed to be invariant in sign then this sign must be positive and the agent must be prudent.

It is useful to emphasize that this result is different and is in fact complementary to results presented here. Menegatti (2001) showed sufficient conditions (non-satiation and invariant sign of the third derivative of the utility function) which ensure that risk aversion implies prudence. The present work shows sufficient conditions ensuring that prudence implies risk aversion (as well as conditions ensuring that temperance implies prudence). Note that the sufficient conditions in the two works are not the same.

A further issue examined in the same strand of literature is the relationship between the index of absolute risk aversion (−U″(x)/U′(x)) and the index of absolute prudence (−U‴(x)/U″(x)). Some results have been published in this field. First Kimball (1992) proved that if preferences exhibit decreasing absolute prudence (i.e. −U‴(x)/U″(x) is decreasing in x) for every x
                     >0 then they also exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion (i.e. −U″(x)/U′(x) is decreasing in x) for every x
                     >0. Maggi, Magnani, and Menegatti (2006) extended this result to two other cases: the relationship between increasing absolute prudence and increasing absolute risk aversion and the relationship between constant absolute prudence and constant absolute risk aversion. Furthermore they show that, in general, the number of local minima (maxima) of the index of absolute risk aversion is not larger than the number of local minima (maxima) of the index of absolute prudence. Finally, in a related field, Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (1994) showed conditions ensuring that if one agent has a higher index of absolute prudence than another then she also has a higher index of absolute risk aversion and vice versa.

As stated in the introduction, this work presents implications and potential applications of its findings on risk aversion, prudence and temperance for comparing risks. The literature studying comparison of risks is thus also relevant for the present paper. The first seminal contribution was by Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) who introduced the concept of increase in risk as a case where a risk can be obtained from another risk by a mean-preserving spread, which leaves the mean of the distribution unchanged and increases the variance.
                        2
                        Note that the opposite is not true: a larger variance does not imply a mean-preserving spread. See also Section 4.
                     
                     
                        2
                      In the same field, Menezes et al. (1980) define an increase in downside risk as a case where a risk can be obtained from another risk by a mean–variance–preserving contraction, which leaves mean and variance of the distribution unchanged and increases negative skewness.
                        3
                        The opposite is not true: larger negative skewness does not imply a mean–variance–preserving contraction. See Section 4.
                     
                     
                        3
                      Finally Menezes and Wang (2005) study an increase in outer risk as a case where a risk can be obtained from another risk by a sequence of outer transformations, which leaves mean, variance and skewness of the distribution unchanged and raises kurtosis.
                        4
                        Again the opposite is not true. See Section 4.
                     
                     
                        4
                     
                  

These comparisons are relevant to many areas, and in general to all problems where an agent chooses between different risky prospects. A standard case is when a firm compares different investment projects where each of them has different possible returns with different probabilities to occur. Similarly, risk is compared in finance whenever an agent compares different portfolios characterized by different random returns with different distributions. Such problems have been widely studied in the literature. For a summary of results, see Gollier (2001) and Levy (2006).

Other applications of different kinds of risk changes have recently been presented in various fields. Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2008) studied conditions ensuring that different kinds of changes in risk increase precautionary saving. A simple application in this field is presented at the end of this work too. Eeckhoudt, Schlesinger, and Tsetlin (2009), Section 4.3 analyzed the effect of risk changes on production localization. Chiu and Eeckhoudt (2010) applied comparison of risks to the choice of agent’s labor supply. Finally Baiardi and Menegatti (2011) studied the effects of risk changes of different kinds on environmental policy.
                        5
                        Note that all these recent applications consider the general Nth-degree risk change as defined by Ekern (1980). The cases examined in the present paper are cases where N
                           =2, 3, 4.

We assume that the agent’s preferences are described by the utility function U(x) defined over the domain [0,+∞) and continuous in the whole domain. The assumption on the unbounded domain of the utility function is particularly relevant for all results derived in this paper and thus requires a short comment. Obviously, this assumption does not mean that the agent has to deal with a case where consumption is infinite. It means instead that we want to describe the agent’s preferences for every possible level of consumption. In fact, although in a specific economic problem the agent’s consumption can vary within the closed interval

                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 ̃
                              
                           
                        
                     , which requires that preferences are defined for the whole set R
                     +.
                        6
                        It should also be emphasized that an alternative option could be to assume that U(x) is defined over R instead of R
                           +. However, the domain is often limited to the positive real line excluding negative argument for U(x) in the analysis of consumption, because a negative level of consumption can be difficult to interpret. Note, on the other hand, that the results above hold if the domain of U(x) is R.
                     
                     
                        6
                      This is also the reason why utility functions which cannot be defined for this whole set are considered less appropriate for economic models studying risk.
                        7
                        This is the case for instance of the quadratic utility which exhibits the problem to be defined only on a bounded interval (see for example Gollier, 2001, p. 27).
                     
                     
                        7
                      Finally note that the assumption of a domain [0,+∞) is crucial in many papers studying desired or appropriate features of the utility function (e.g. Brockett & Golden, 1987; Caballé & Pomansky, 1996; Pratt & Zeckhauser, 1987),
                        8
                        The same assumption is also crucial for some conclusions by Kimball (1993) and for the results by Menegatti (2001).
                     
                     
                        8
                      it is standard in microeconomic theory (see, for instance, the well-known book by Mas-Colell, Winston, & Green (1995, p. 51)) and it is often introduced in works examining risk problems (recent examples are Çanakoğlu & Özekici, 2010; Choi & Ruszczyński, 2011; Hart, 2011; Roger, 2011).

                     . Furthermore we introduce the usual assumption of non-satiation, meaning that marginal utility is strictly positive for every x in the domain (i.e. U′(x)>0 ∀x
                     ∈[0,+∞)). Finally we introduce a further assumption on the features of marginal utility for x
                     →+∞, assuming that marginal utility function is bounded (i.e. that lim
                     
                        x→+∞
                     U′(x)≠+∞). Note that this assumption does not mean that marginal utility is decreasing (i.e. it does not imply concavity of the utility function) and is absolutely compatible with an increasing marginal utility. The assumption simply excludes that the function tends to +∞ for consumption tending to +∞. This assumption has two main justifications. First, it seems plausible that, when consumption becomes extremely high, an additional unit of it causes a small, or at least a bounded, increase in utility. Second, the assumption that marginal utility is bounded is standard in many economic models such as growth models and intertemporal models of consumption.
                        9
                        In the case of growth models we usually introduce the stronger assumption not only that lim
                           
                              x→+∞ 
                           U′(x)≠+∞ but also that lim
                           
                              x→+∞ 
                           U′(x)=0. See for instance the standard books by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004, p. 87) and Blanchard and Fisher (1989, p. 38).
                     
                     
                        9
                     
                  

Note that these assumptions define a fairly general class of utility functions, which includes many of the most frequently used ones, such as exponential utility and constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). This set of assumptions is kept unchanged for all the propositions in the paper. Also note that, later on, we introduce for simplicity the following notation: lim
                     
                        x→+∞
                     f(x)≡
                     f(+∞). This means that we have lim
                     
                        x→+∞
                     U′(x)≡
                     U′(+∞), lim
                     
                        x→+∞
                     U″(x)≡
                     U″(+∞) and so on.

Finally, before examining the new results in this work, we recall a specific version of a well-known theorem (sometimes called “theorem of sign permanence”), used in some of the proofs below.
                        Theorem 1
                        
                           Given a continuous function f(x), if f(+∞)
                           
                           =
                           
                           +∞ then ∃x
                           
                              0
                           
                           : f(x)
                           >
                           0
                           ∀x
                           ∈
                           (x
                           
                              0
                           
                           ,
                           
                           +∞) and if f(+∞)
                           
                           =
                           −∞ then ∃x
                           
                              0
                           
                           : f(x)
                           <
                           0
                           ∀x
                           ∈
                           (x
                           
                              0
                           
                           ,
                           
                           +∞)
                        

Note that the interpretation of the theorem is straightforward: if the limit for x
                     →+∞ of a function is +∞ then there exists a right-open interval where the function is positive, while if this limit is −∞ then there exists a right-open interval where the function is negative.

Given the assumptions above, we can now state the first results of this work showing the relation between prudence and risk aversion. We obtain that:

The results in Propositions from 1–3 show that, under plausible conditions on the utility function, the different aspects of the agent’s attitude toward risk are not independent. In more detail, once the usual hypothesis of non-satiation is introduced, once preferences are defined for every level of consumption and once it is assumed that marginal utility is bounded (i.e. that it cannot explode), we obtain that temperance implies prudence, which implies in turn risk aversion, and that intemperance implies imprudence which implies in turn risk loving.

The results in the previous section have significant implications for various problems. Some of the most important involve the analysis of different kinds of change in risk in an expected utility framework.

The seminal paper by Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) provided the following well-known definition and results about an increase in risk:
                        Definition 1
                        Given the two risks y
                           1 and z
                           1, z
                           1 is said to be an increase in risk over y
                           1 when z
                           1 can be obtained from y
                           1 by a sequence of mean-preserving spreads.
                              10
                              A mean-preserving spread is obtained by moving some probability mass of the distribution toward the tails, leaving the mean unchanged. For a formal definition see Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970).
                           
                           
                              10
                           
                        


                           When z
                           
                              1
                            
                           is an increase in risk over y
                           
                              1
                           
                           , E[U(y
                           
                              1
                           
                           )]
                           ⩾
                           E[U(z
                           
                              1
                           
                           )] if and only if the agent is risk averse.
                        

Note that, given this definition, an increase in risk leaves the mean unchanged while it raises the variance of the risk. It should be emphasized that, while a mean-preserving spread implies a larger variance, the converse is not true since a larger variance does not imply that a mean-preaserving spread occurred.


                     Menezes et al. (1980) provided the following definition and results for an increase in downside risk:
                        Definition 2
                        Given the two risks y
                           2 and z
                           2, z
                           2 is said to be an increase in downside risk over y
                           2 when z
                           2 can be obtained from y
                           2 by a sequence of mean–variance-preserving transformations.
                              11
                              A mean–variance preserving transformation is obtained by an appropriate pairing of mean-presearving spreads and mean-preserving contractions (which are defined as the converse of mean-preserving spreads). For a formal definition see Menezes et al. (1980).
                           
                           
                              11
                           
                        


                           When z
                           
                              2
                            
                           is an increase in downside risk over y
                           
                              2
                           
                           , E[U(y
                           
                              2
                           
                           )]
                           ⩾
                           E[U(z

                           )] if and only if the agent is prudent.
                           
                              12
                              Note that Menezes et al. (1980) just speak about downside risk aversion and show that it occurs if and only if U‴(x)>0. The term “prudence” is used to describe this feature of the agent’s preference only from Kimball (1990).
                           
                           
                              12
                           
                        

Note that an increase in downside risk leaves mean and variance of the distribution unchanged while it raises the negative skewness of the risk. Also in this case the converse is not true: an increase in negative skewness does not imply an increase in downside risk.

Finally Menezes and Wang (2005) provided the following definition and results for an increase in outer risk:
                        Definition 3
                        Given the two risks y
                           3 and z
                           3, z
                           3 is said to be an increase in outer risk over y
                           3 when z
                           3 can be obtained from y
                           3 by a sequence of outer dispersion transformations.
                              13
                              An outer dispersion transformation is obtained by an appropriate pairing of different mean–variance–preserving spreads. For a formal definition see Menezes and Wang (2005).
                           
                           
                              13
                           
                        


                           When z
                           
                              3
                            
                           is an increase in outer risk over y
                           
                              3
                           
                           , E[U(y
                           
                              3
                           
                           )]
                           ⩾
                           E[U(z
                           
                              3
                           
                           )] if and only if the agent is temperate.
                        

Note that an increase in outer risk leaves mean, variance and skewness of the distribution unchanged while it raises the kurtosis of the risk. Again the converse is not true: an increase in kurtosis does not imply an increase in outer risk.

The results in Section 2 can be applied to the relationship between increases in outer risk, increases in downside risk and increases in risk. In particular, given the assumptions in Section 2, we get:
                        Proposition 4

                           Lemma 3 proves that if the agent weakly prefers y
                           3 to z

                           3 is an increase in outer risk over y
                           3 then the agent must be temperate ∀x
                           ∈[0,+∞). By Proposition 2(a) this implies that the agent is prudent ∀x
                           ∈[0,+∞). By Lemma 2 this implies that she weakly prefers y
                           2 to z

                           2. Finally, by Proposition 4, this implies that the agent weakly prefers y
                           1 to z
                           1 for every possible pair (y

                           1) where z
                           1 is an increase in risk over y

                     Propositions 4 and 5 show the relationships between agent’s preferences in cases of different kinds of changes in risks. Proposition 4 shows that if the agent dislikes every increase in downside risk then she also dislikes every increase in risk.
                        14
                        Note that the fact that the agent dislikes every increase in risk is related to the assumption that the agent is risk averse for every level of consumption, i.e. ∀ x
                           ∈[0,+∞). A similar observation applies to Propositions 5 and 6.

                     Proposition 5 shows that if an agent dislikes every increase in outer risk then she also dislikes every increase in downside risk and every increase in risk.

As stated in Section 2, the results above can be applied to all kinds of economic models where an agent compares different risky prospects. What follows is a simple application to precautionary saving. Consider a typical two-period saving problem. An agent chooses her level of saving in order to maximize lifetime utility of consumption given by

Using results on risk changes, Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2008) showed that in this framework:
                        Lemma 4
                        
                           
                              
                                 (a)
                                 
                                    An increase in risk for y
                                    
                                       1
                                     
                                    determines a larger saving if and only if the agent is prudent.
                                 


                                    An increase in downside risk for y
                                    
                                       1
                                     
                                    determines a larger saving if and only if the agent is temperate.
                                    
                                       15
                                       It should be noticed that the word “larger” is used here in a weak sense to mean “⩾”. Also note that Lemma 4 directly comes from Corollary 1 by Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2008). That corollary refers to the concept Nth-degree risk change as defined by Ekern (1980). Ekern (1980) also states the equivalence of Nth-degree risk change to increase in risk and increase in downside risk respectively for the cases N
                                          =2 and N
                                          =3. Recalling this and substituting 2 and 3 in place of N in Corollary 1 by Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2008) we get Lemma 4(a) and (b).
                                    
                                    
                                       15
                                    
                                 

Considering together Lemma 4 and Proposition 2 we obtain:
                        Proposition 6
                        
                           If an agent increases saving in every case of increase in downside risk for y
                           
                              1
                            
                           then she will increase saving in every case of increase in risk for y
                           
                              1
                           
                           .
                        

By Lemma 4(b), if an agent increases saving in every case of increase in downside risk for y
                           1 then she is temperate ∀x
                           ∈[0,+∞). By Proposition 2(a) this implies that the agent is prudent ∀x
                           ∈[0,+∞). This, together with Lemma 4(a), implies that the agent increases saving in every case of increase in risk.□

The results in this work thus have clear implications for precautionary saving theory: the choice of the saving level in case of increase in downside risk and the choice of the saving level in case of increase in risk are related.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The study of the features of the utility function describing different aspects of the agent’s attitude toward risk, which started with the seminal paper by Pratt (1964), has become increasingly important in the literature. Over time the well-known concept of risk aversion/risk loving, related to the sign of the second derivative of the utility function, has been supplemented by the concepts of prudence/imprudence and of temperance/intemperance, related respectively to third and fourth derivatives of the utility function.

Although they are related to the same function, these features are usually considered as different aspects of the agent’s preferences, which are usually studied separately in utility theory and which are usually introduced as specific and independent assumptions in economic applications. This work studied the relatioships between these aspects and showed the existence of many clear linkages between them. In particular we showed that, under the usual assumptions that preferences are defined for every level of consumption and marginal utility is positive and bounded, temperance implies prudence which implies in turn risk aversion, and intemperance implies imprudence which implies risk loving. This means that the agent’s attitude toward temperance or intemperance also indicates her attitude toward prudence or imprudence and the agent’s attitude toward prudence or imprudence indicates her attitude toward risk aversion or risk loving.

These relationships also have important implications for the comparison between risks. In particular, we proved that if an agent dislikes every increase in outer risk à la Menezes and Wang (2005) then she dislikes every increase in downside risk à la Menezes et al. (1980) and if she dislikes every increase in downside risk then she dislikes every increase in risk à la Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970).

We finally presented an application of our results to precautionary saving and we showed the connections between the choice of the saving level in case of increase in downside risk and the choice of the saving level in case of increase in risk.
