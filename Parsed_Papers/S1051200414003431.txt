                  This paper deals with the design of the low complexity and efficient dynamic spectrum learning and access (DSLA) scheme for next-generation heterogeneous decentralized Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) such as Long Term Evolution-Advanced and 5G. Existing DSLA schemes for decentralized CRNs are focused predominantly on the decision making policies which perform the task of orthogonalization of secondary users to optimum vacant subbands of fixed bandwidth. The focus of this paper is the design of DSLA scheme for decentralized CRNs to support the tunable vacant bandwidth requirements of the secondary users while minimizing the computationally intensive subband switchings. We first propose a new low complexity VDF which is designed by modifying second order frequency transformation and subsequently combining it with the interpolation technique. It is referred to as Interpolation and Modified Frequency Transformation based VDF (IMFT-VDF) and it provides tunable bandpass responses anywhere over Nyquist band with complete control over the bandwidth as well as the center frequency. Second, we propose a tunable decision making policy,

                     , consisting of learning and access unit, and is designed to take full advantage of exclusive frequency response control offered by IMFT-VDF. The simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed DSLA scheme over the existing DSLA schemes while complexity comparisons indicate total gate count savings from 11% to as high as 87% over various existing schemes. Also, lower number of subband switchings make the proposed scheme power-efficient and suitable for battery-operated cognitive radio terminals.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Dynamic spectrum learning and access (DSLA) based Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) paradigm has been suggested to improve the overall utilization of the spectrum, which is crowded yet underutilized mainly due to static spectrum allocation policies [1,2]. In CRNs, multiple secondary (unlicensed) users can access the vacant frequency subbands in an opportunistic way with minimal interference to the primary (licensed) users [1,2]. Recently, the term “Green CRN” has been coined, which refers to the CRN which will minimize the 
                        C
                        
                           
                              O
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      emissions (by using area and energy efficient radio terminals) along with improving the spectrum utilization [3,4]. These CRNs can be deployed for smart grid networks, public safety networks, health-care networks, cellular networks [5] etc.

The two representative DSLA approaches are: 1) DSLA for centralized CRNs (centralized DSLA): A central unit is responsible for orthogonalization of M secondary users to optimum subbands (i.e., the subset of M subbands which are identified as superior, in terms of their probability of being vacant, lower interference and noise levels etc., amongst all available subbands in wideband input signal) [6,7], 2) DSLA for decentralized CRNs (decentralized DSLA): Each secondary user independently learns, senses and accesses the vacant subbands without any explicit information exchanges or pre-agreements with other users [6–14]. The centralized DSLA schemes using game theory approach, auction based approach, multi-armed bandit based approach etc. have been proposed and more details can be found in [6,7]. Various decentralized DSLA schemes are discussed in detail in Section 2.2. In summary, the decentralized DSLA has the advantages such as ease of implementation, robustness to link or node failures, no communication overhead and lower delay over the centralized DSLA [6–14]. As a result, decentralized DSLA is preferred choice for public safety networks and proximity-aware social networking services. However, decentralized DSLA suffers from lower utilization of optimum subbands due to the potentially higher number of collisions between the secondary users. This is because of the lack of coordination among secondary users as well as hardware and signal processing constraints at each secondary user terminal.

Existing centralized as well as decentralized DSLA schemes [6–11,13,14] assume that the vacant bandwidth requirements of all secondary users are fixed and equal. Such assumption may not be true in the next-generation heterogeneous CRNs such as 5G where multiple wireless communication standards with distinct channel bandwidths co-exist. In order to extend the capabilities of such decentralized CRNs beyond voice to video, data, location and Internet based services demanding distinct bandwidths and to seamlessly integrate multiple services on a single terminal, a tunable decentralized DSLA scheme is desired.

Another constraint for efficient DSLA scheme is the total penalty incurred in terms of delay, energy consumption, hardware reconfiguration and protocol overhead when secondary user switches from one frequency subband to another. Hereinafter, this penalty is referred to as subband switching cost (SSC) [6,7]. The total number of subband switchings and hence, SSC should be as small as possible, especially for the resource-constrained battery-operated secondary user terminals. Though the challenges of minimizing the collisions among secondary users are attracting much attention in the research community today, the design of decentralized DSLA scheme with additional constraints of tunable vacant bandwidth and minimum SSC for heterogeneous CRNs has yet to be systematically addressed. The stringent hardware specifications of minimum area and power make the design even more challenging and are the motivations behind the work presented in this paper. The proposed decentralized DSLA scheme consists of:
                        
                           •
                           A low complexity interpolation and modified frequency transformation based variable digital filter (IMFT-VDF). It provides tunable bandpass responses anywhere over Nyquist band with complete control over the bandwidth as well as the center frequency and offers total gate count savings from 11% to as high as 87% over other VDFs and filter banks.

                              . Both refinements lead to fewer number of collisions and hence, lower SSC.

The simulation results support our claims about the superiority of the proposed decentralized DSLA scheme over the existing decentralized DSLA schemes in terms of spectrum utilization efficiency and SSC. Note that the proposed scheme is not just a straightforward integration of the VDF and existing policy 
                        
                           
                              ρ
                           
                           
                              rand
                           
                        
                     . In fact, it is designed by exploiting the exclusive unabridged center frequency control offered by the IMFT-VDF and adapting the 
                        
                           
                              ρ
                           
                           
                              rand
                           
                        
                      to efficiently work with the IMFT-VDF.

The work presented in this paper is a significant extension of our preliminary works in [12,15]. For instance, the proposed IMFT-VDF offers complete control over the bandwidth as well as center frequency of bandpass responses compared to the coarse and limited control offered by our VDF in [15]. Furthermore, the design, architecture as well as gate count complexity are discussed in detail in this paper. Our DSLA scheme in [12] was designed for CRNs consisting of single secondary user, which is now extended for more practical and challenging scenarios of multi-standard multi-user CRNs.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The details of network model and the literature review of different stages of DSLA scheme are presented in Section 2. In Section 3, the design and architecture of the proposed IMFT-VDF are discussed along with suitable design examples and gate count complexity comparisons.

                      Next, the filtering and decision making stages of decentralized DSLA scheme are discussed in detail.

The task of the filtering stage is to extract the frequency subband of any desired bandwidth,

                         and center frequency,

                           (

                           )
                        . The filtering task is done jointly in the analog front-end and digital front-end of user terminal. Taking into account inter-standard as well as intra-standard channel bandwidth variations and limited flexibility of analog filters compared to its digital counterpart, the analog front-end performs only coarse filtering task and the digital front-end is responsible for the stringent subband filtering task. The digital filtering stage is realized either using digital filter or filter bank such as memory based filters, VDFs, discrete Fourier transform filter bank (DFTFB), fast filter bank etc. [15–29].

The filter bank [27–29] and multiple detectors based decentralized DSLA schemes allow quick learning and access to the optimum vacant subband of desired bandwidth, since multiple subbands can be sensed simultaneously. Though such schemes are popularly used in base station receivers, they do not offer an area and power efficient solution for battery-operated resource-constrained secondary user terminals. This is because, the smaller the value of desired subband bandwidth

                                    v
                                 
                              
                              (
                              k
                              )
                           , higher is the desired resolution (i.e. number of subbands) and hence, higher is the gate count complexity of the filter bank. Furthermore, such terminals can afford only one detector due to the imposed power constraints for longer battery life and hence, only one subband or multiple contiguous subbands in conjunction can be sensed at a time. Since, the other extracted subbands are not used, filter bank is not utilized to its full potential. Also, filter banks are not efficient for wideband input signal with non-contiguous bandwidth. In such cases, VDFs offer an efficient alternative.

In memory based digital FIR filters, filter coefficients corresponding to all desired bandpass response specifications are stored in memory beforehand. Such filter based scheme is area and power efficient for secondary user terminals due to fewer number of multipliers and adders. However, filter coefficients need to be updated frequently whenever

Higher sensing time means less time for data communication and hence, lower spectrum throughput.

The design of linear phase bandpass VDF for decentralized DSLA is a challenging research problem and highly nontrivial because of the fixed transition bandwidth (TBW) requirement as well as area, power and delay constraints.

A number of bandpass VDF designs are available in the literature [15–26]. The allpass transformation (APT) based VDF [23] offers complete control over the center frequency of bandpass responses but the phase is non-linear which limits its usefulness in DSLA scheme. The frequency response masking based VDFs [16] offer complete control over the cut-off frequency of lowpass responses and are suitable for applications requiring sharp TBW. However, their usefulness in the case of bandpass responses with complete control over

                           . The spectral parameter approximation based VDFs (SPA-VDFs) [19–21] have the advantages of fixed TBW, fewer variable multipliers and lower group delay. However, the gate count complexity of these VDFs is very high and large dynamic range of filter coefficients may impose constraints when fixed-point implementation is desired. Though the SPA-VDF in [19] and our SPA-MCDM-VDF [20] overcome some of these drawbacks, their gate count complexity is still high.

Various decision making policies have been proposed for the decentralized DSLA in single user as well as multi-user CRNs [6–14]. These policies have shown to outperform the conventional random selection based policies under self-play i.e. when implemented at all secondary users [6–14]. They mainly differ in the type of online learning algorithms they employ for decision making such as ε-greedy algorithm, Multi-Armed Bandit based upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms such as

Analytically, the UCB based algorithms [13,14] are mathematically proved to be optimal with logarithmic regret bound, which is the best we can expect when secondary users do not have any information about

In [12], we proposed DSLA scheme using UCB to support the tunable vacant bandwidth requirements for CRNs with single secondary user.

For practical scenario where CRN consists of M (>1) secondary users, notable research on the integration of learning algorithms such as UCB algorithm with different access strategies for orthogonalization of secondary users to optimum subbands has been pursued in [8–11].

In particular, the

                           . When collision occurs, the corresponding secondary users randomly and independently change their rank. Another access policy in [9] follows time division fare share approach where the rank of each secondary user is not fixed but is updated in round robin fashion to allow equal access to optimum subbands among all secondary users. Analytically, both the policies are simple, order-optimal and their regret,

                                    t
                                 
                              
                           , is logarithmic with time t. However, the SSC of the policy in [9] increases linearly with t since each secondary user switches the subband in each time slot compared to the policy in [8] where subband switching occurs only when secondary user experiences collision. Thus, policy in [8] is preferred over the policy in [9].

The mixed strategy based policy in [10] employs soft-max action selection method that uses the Boltzmann distribution. The performance of this method is similar to [8] but its SSC is high and convergence has not been proved analytically. The policy in [11] is designed by combining access strategies in [8,9] with two learning algorithms to take into account different

                         is limited to approximately 25% of the Nyquist band. This in turn narrows the bandwidth and the center frequency range of the bandpass responses. Our modified second order frequency transformation based VDF in [15] allows

                         to take any reciprocal of power-of-two value instead of unity. The resultant VDF is then combined with the CDM to obtain variable lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop responses from a fixed-coefficient lowpass prototype filter. However, it cannot provide complete control over the center frequency and the bandwidth of the bandpass response over the entire Nyquist band. Furthermore, the TBW deteriorates significantly at higher cut-off frequencies. To overcome these drawbacks, especially for the DSLA application, a new IMFT-VDF based on the modified frequency transformation and interpolation technique is proposed. The main differences between IMFT-VDF and our VDF in [15] are:

The VDF in [15] is combined with the CDM to obtain variable bandpass responses from variable lowpass responses. In IMFT-VDF, the interpolation and conventional lowpass to highpass conversion by reversing the sign of every alternate coefficient are used to increase the tunable cut-off frequency range of lowpass responses.

Consider the design of the IMFT-VDF which provides complete control over the cut-off frequency of lowpass response from

The IMFT-VDF is not just a straightforward integration of the frequency transformation and interpolation. In fact, the IMFT-VDF is carefully designed by exploiting the architectural advantages such as lower deterioration in TBW and lower multiplier complexity of the proposed second order modified frequency transformation as well as exclusive multiband response capability of the conventional interpolation technique, without compromising on the total gate counts. The architecture of the IMFT-VDF is discussed in the next section.

The architecture of the IMFT-VDF is shown in Fig. 2
                         where the modified second order frequency transformation is realized through

                        , as discussed in Section 3.2. These coefficients are fixed and can be hardwired. In the IMFT-VDF architecture, the Taylor structure of filter implementation is re-designed by shifting each 
                           D
                           (
                           z
                           )
                         block adjacent to the corresponding delay block. This is done to obtain multiple lowpass responses, each with distinct cut-off frequency, using single fixed-coefficient prototype filter and multiple branches of 
                           D
                           (
                           z
                           )
                        . The proposed structure is referred to as transposed Taylor structure. Even though the number of delay blocks are higher in the transposed Taylor structure compared to conventional Taylor structure [17], the total group delay of both structures is equal for a given N. Moreover, in the FPGA implementation of the VDF, delays can be implemented without significant hardware cost.

The multiplexer control signal, sel_y, is a 6 bit signal which controls two 2:1 multiplexers and two 4:1 multiplexers as shown in Fig. 4. The IMFT-VDF architecture provides variable lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop responses using fixed-coefficient lowpass filter. The control signals to obtain variable bandpass responses are given in Table 1
                         where “X” denotes “don't care” condition. Similarly, variable lowpass responses can be obtained using only a single branch of

Since the bandpass responses can be easily obtained by arithmetic subtraction of lowpass responses as discussed in Section 3.3, we can say that IMFT-VDF offers complete control over the bandwidth as well as the center frequency of bandpass responses.

A 16 × 16 bit multiplier, a 4:1 multiplexer, a 2:1 multiplexer, 32 bit adder and a word of memory were synthesized on a TSMC 65 nm process. The Synopsys Design Compiler was used to estimate the cell area. The area in terms of gate count is obtained by normalizing the cell area values by that of a two input NAND gate from the same library. The total gate count is the sum of gate counts of all the components. For the design examples with

                        . The term “NLP” in Table 2 stands for non-linear phase.

For the first design example, the order of an FIR filter is 90 and coefficients corresponding to different bandpass responses are stored in memory beforehand. The MCDM-VDF consists of prototype filter of order 2000 and decimation factor, D, varies from 1 to 25. Our APT-CDM-VDF consists of prototype filter of order 160 and variable responses are obtained by integrating the first order APT with the reduced second order APT. The SPA-VDF consists of 2 subsets of 6 sub-filters, each of order 90. Our SPA-MCDM-VDF consists of 6 sub-filters each of order 90 and a masking filter of order 14.

The IMFT-VDF offers total gate count savings of

The group delay of the IMFT-VDF is slightly higher than other VDFs. However, it must be taken into account that the total latency of the physical layer in each secondary user terminal is small compared to the latency of the CRNs [6,7]. This means that little penalty in group delay is acceptable for more than 27% savings in total gate count. For delay sensitive applications, our SPA-MCDM-VDF [20] offers good alternative at the cost of higher gate count.

                        , respectively. It can be easily observed that the second subset has higher number of optimum subbands than the first for this design example considered here. Thus, timely selection of the second subset will definitely lead to the lower regret,

The IMFT-VDF, due to its finer granularity of center frequency of bandpass responses, offers large number of subsets of orthogonal contiguous subbands. Higher the number of subsets, higher is the time spent in the non-optimum subbands and hence, higher is the regret,

                        . Thus, the number of subbands choices are limited to two in the proposed policy where the first subset starts with the subband numbered as 1 while the second subset starts with the subband numbered as

The idea behind such subset division is to keep less than 50% overlapping between the corresponding subbands of two subsets so that the subsets are sufficiently apart in terms of their combined vacancy statistics which in turn leads to fewer errors in the selection of optimal subset by secondary users.

In the existing policies for multi-user CRNs [8–11], the size of the subset, comprising of optimum subbands, is fixed, i.e.,

Also, the number of collisions and hence, SSC are bound to be large in the beginning as well as for higher M since it is unlikely that secondary users will always agree on the order of the optimum subbands [8,9]. The solution to these issues can be provided by making the subset size,

                     , in percentage vs. time slot t, are shown for case 1 and case 2, respectively. Here,

It can be observed that the total reward (vacant spectrum utilization) of the proposed scheme is higher than other schemes. In Fig. 7f, the plot of average reward at

                     , which corresponds to the prototype filter of order 90, are 1 925 070 and 873 230, respectively. Then, according to Table 2, the IMFT-VDF, with total gate counts of 465 385, offers 76% and 47% saving over 128-DFTFB and 64-DFTFB, respectively. However, the group delay of IMFT-VDF is 104 which is higher than the group delay of 45 in case of DFTFBs.

In this paper, a low complexity and efficient dynamic spectrum learning and access (DSLA) scheme for next-generation heterogeneous decentralized cognitive radio networks is proposed. The proposed decentralized DSLA scheme consists of new low complexity modified second order frequency transformation and interpolation technique based variable digital filter and tunable decision making policy,

                     . The simulation results and gate count complexity analysis verifies the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing schemes. The future research direction includes the efficient implementation of the proposed scheme on the USRP-GNU-FPGA platform and analyzing the performance using real radio signals.
