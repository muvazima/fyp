                  Objective
                  The effective and efficient assessment, management, and evolution of surgical processes are intrinsic to excellent patient care. Hence, in addition to economic interests, the quality of the outcome is of great importance. Process benchmarking examines the compliance of an intraoperative surgical process to another process that is considered as best practice. The objective of this work is to assess the relationship between the course and the outcome of surgical processes of the study.
               
               
                  Materials and methods
                  By assessing 450 skill practices on rapid prototyping models in minimally invasive surgery training, we extracted descriptions of surgical processes and examined the hypothesis that a significant relationship exists between the course of a surgical process and the quality of its outcome.
               
               
                  Results
                  The results showed a significant correlation with Person correlation coefficients >0.05 between the quality of process outcome and process compliance for simple and complex suturing tasks in the study.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  We conclude that high process compliance supports good quality outcomes and, therefore, excellent patient care. We also showed that a deviation from best training processes led to a decreased outcome quality. This is relevant for identifying requirements for surgical processes, for generating feedback for the surgeon with regard to human factors and for inducing changes in the workflow in order to improve the outcome quality.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The development of the digital operating room is an ever-progressing topic [1,2], and the complexity of the systems and the concomitant challenges posed to surgeons and other medical and technical staff are rapidly increasing. To cope with these growing demands and to develop new and sensible systems, it is indispensable to assess, manage, and evolve the surgical processes that are intrinsic to patient care.

Within the management of surgical processes, in addition to economic interests, the outcome quality is of great importance. By means of evaluating key performance indicators, the outcome quality can be determined. Postoperative pain, patient satisfaction and length of stay are some of these key performance indicators [3,4].

To improve the outcome quality, standards and recommendations for performing surgical processes were developed [3,5]. Compliance with these standards is controlled by quality assurance measures. Process benchmarking to compare processes with the best-known processes, the best practices allow for quality improvements to be made [6].

The outcome quality is considered to be good if the process conforms to the standards, whereas deviation from the standards leads to decreased quality. Analysis of this common sense relationship for surgical process standards is the subject matter of this work.

Three main components were identified by Donabedian for evaluating the quality of medical care [3]: the quality of outcomes, the assessment of the examination of the care process itself and the setting in which the medical care takes place. Furthermore, he assessed all the fundamental principles of evaluating this matter, including data sources and data collection, empirical evidence, normative standards and measurement scales, and thereby pointed out the manifold problem areas that exist within the evaluation of the quality of medical care. One key issue of this work is the analysis of the correlation between the course of a surgical process and the outcome of the process. Hence, two of the three components identified by Donabedian will be directly interrelated.

The correlation between the distance measurements of surgical processes and the outcome quality allows for analysis of the following hypothesis: surgical processes that are at a greater distance from the best surgical process will lead to worse training outcomes.

Hammermeister et al. concluded that if all three elements of Donabedian's quality triad (processes, structures and outcomes) are used, then the improvement in outcome quality proceeds most efficiently and effectively [4]. The strengths and weaknesses of outcome-directed assessments and improvements to the quality of care were reviewed. Furthermore, a summary of the current knowledge of the linkages between outcomes and the processes and structures of care was given. In most reports, no details regarding these processes have been described. The relationships between processes of care and outcomes have only been reported regarding patient analysis.

Several authors have applied these measures to hospital business processes, in order to systematically improve hospital business processes [5], to relate process compliance with patient risk factors [7], or to improve quality management methods [8]. Furthermore, Schmutz and Manser [9] conducted a literature review to examine the impact of team process behaviors, including coordination, leadership, and communication, on clinical performance. They found strong effects indicating that team processes significantly influence clinical performance in most studies.

Within surgery research, there are many authors who have compared different surgical methods to the quality of outcome. These authors used technical methods, such as Mehndiratta et al. [10], who used a color-coded versus gray-scale DCE-MR imaging display, as well as clinical methods, such as Baccari et al. [11], who evaluated the outcome after laparoscopic repair of large incisional hernias. Teoh et al. [12] assessed several outcome measurements of a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of laparoscopic single-site access versus conventional 3-port appendectomy. Theodosopoulos et al. [13] analyzed surgical outcomes of 5000 neurosurgical procedures in a prospective study; the outcomes for neurosurgical treatments were reported based on point-of-care interactions recorded in the electronic medical record.

Nøhr [14] reviewed ten evaluation studies to investigate the extent to which these studies reflect the structure, process, and outcome of the conceptual framework. It was found that all of the evaluation studies focused on structure measures. Nøhr stated that evaluation studies must strive to also evaluate process and outcomes measures in order to create adequate computer programs to support medical decision-making.

In summary, the outcome quality in surgery and medical care is a very important research topic. Some authors have focused on processes or methods, while others have focused on the outcomes themselves. There are a few studies that related the flow and the outcome of processes; these studies, however, assessed this relationship on a qualitative level. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publication in the medical field that has assessed this relationship on a quantitative level. In this paper, we quantitatively assessed the relationship between the workflow and the outcome of surgical processes, resting upon data recorded in a mockup scenario. Furthermore, the workflow-analysis was based not just on some of the key points, but rather comprises all performed steps of work at a high level of granularity.

In Section 2, the study setup, clinical datasets, and distance measurements (Levenshtein distance and Adjacency distance) are introduced. The results of the correlation analysis for the selected surgical tasks are depicted in Section 3. Finally, the results are discussed, and an outlook for future work is provided in the discussion.

The data sets consisted of surgical cases obtained during surgical training sessions in the context of pediatric surgery. The surgical processes were obtained by observation during training sessions in minimally invasive surgery in the Department of Pediatric Surgery of the University Medical Center Leipzig in 2011. Observation was supported by a software tool called the surgical workflow editor, which was validated in previous studies and showed a data acquisition accuracy of greater than 90% [15].

The main work steps for acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis of the data are shown in Table 1
                        .

Surgical processes consist of surgical activities and can be modeled by means of formal and structured languages [16]. Thus, surgical process models (SPMs) are an abstract concept used to represent surgical processes analogous to business processes. SPMs are used to study, analyze, and optimize surgical processes, as well as to evaluate technical support systems in the operating room [17]. The aggregate of all work steps in a single surgical case (one patient or one surgical session within a training system) is referred to as an individual surgical process model (iSPM) [18]. Each activity in an iSPM is associated with a surgical work step in the underlying surgical process.

In each training session, members of two subject groups, one consisting of five novices and the other of five expert surgeons, each performed three different tasks (cutting, simple suturing, and complex suturing) by applying different surgical strategies. A sequence of work steps was required in order for a task to be performed. A Pelvitrainer [19], which represented the abdomen, and silicone manikins, on which several tasks were performed, was used (see Fig. 1
                        ). The surgical strategy variations involved applying different instrument types and incision points: single incision with angled laparoscopic instruments, triple incision with straight laparoscopic instruments, and triple incision with angled laparoscopic instruments. The subjects repeated each task and each incision/instrument combination five times. Thus, the evaluation data set contained 450 iSPMs and a total of approximately 28,600 activities.

The work steps of the 450 training sessions were recorded using the ICCAS surgical workflow editor [20] and contained a high level of information. Decomposition of the surgical processes into single surgical motions followed the hierarchical decomposition approach of MacKenzie et al. [21,22].

The quality of the task results was reviewed in a blinded manner. Four experts marked the results independently from each other. They did not know either the setting or the level of experience of the executing subject. Grades from 1 (very good) to 5 (very bad) were given. The degree of achievement of the objectives (e.g. only 3 of 4 stitches achieved) and the accuracy of the result (e.g. exact cutting) were marked. The average of the four marks became the quality of the result of a single surgical process, providing an objective assessment of the process outcome.

In the field of business science, process benchmarking is an ongoing, systematic, and purposeful method used to compare one's own processes with the processes of other companies. The best solution, referred to as the best practice, is used as a reference for achieving superior performance [23]. A process is called best practice when it is best from a contextual sense, such as for patients or the community [6].

In surgery, the best practice is the surgical process that is renowned as the best procedure to achieve a given therapy goal. In our study, the method for producing a high-quality outcome was studied. Therefore, for each setting, the surgical process with the highest quality outcome was chosen as the best practice.

Process benchmarking was used to examine the compliance of a surgical process with the best practice process. Measuring the compliance of a process to another is the same as measuring the distance between them. The distance between two processes is defined as the quantitative difference between the courses of the activities. Varieties in the frequency and sequence of the performed work steps caused increases in distances.

Previous work [24] identified the Levenshtein and Adjacency distances as the most suitable measures for distances between surgical processes. The distance measurements quantify the variance of the course of action.

The Levenshtein distance [25] is often referred to as the string edit distance. The basis for calculation is the minimal number of the edit operations insert, delete, and substitute applied to work steps that are needed to transform one surgical process into another.

The editing operations and their order of succession are not definite, and there are various possibilities for transforming one surgical process into another. The Levenshtein distance d

The basis for the calculation of the Levenshtein distance thus comprises not only the number of activities, but also their order in the surgical process. For more explanation of the metrics applied in this work, refer to [24].

Adjacency matrices are neighborhood matrices in the sense that they depict the consecutiveness of elements of a process or graph [26]. Concerning a surgical process, this matrix is constructed from all possible work steps of an intervention.

For a given surgical process X
                        1, each element of the matrix represents the frequency C
                        
                           mk
                         of each different pair of consecutive work steps. For a comparison of the two surgical processes X

                        1 and MX
                        2 are constructed. For calculation of the Adjacency distance, the Euclidian distance of the two matrices MX

Thus, transitions between activities and their frequency form the basis for the calculation of the Adjacency distance.

These two distance measurements were applied to the compliance analysis between the best practice and all other surgical processes in each setting.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The objective of this study evaluation was to assess the correlation between surgical processes and quality outcome. In total, 450 surgical process models were analyzed.

After data acquisition and review of the outcome qualities, the individual surgical processes were grouped according to surgical strategies and tasks, in order to only compare surgical processes with the same subject matter. For example, from a clinical point of view, it is not reasonable to compare the complex suturing task with the cutting task. The next step was to find the best training practice in each group. Therefore, the surgical process with the highest quality of outcome was selected. The process distance and the quality difference between the best practice and all other surgical processes in each group were computed and then averaged to the iterations of each subject. We performed statistical analysis of these results using the Pearson correlation coefficient to estimate the correlation with a significance level of α
                     =0.05.

In Table 2
                     , the results for the correlation of the quality difference with the two distance measurements (Levenshtein distance and Adjacency distance) relative to the best practice are depicted. Significant correlations are highlighted in bold.

In Fig. 2
                     , linear regressions of the significant correlations (also with angled laparoscopic instruments, triple incision, simple suturing, with p
                     =0.098) are depicted. Corresponding gradients and the coefficients of determination R
                     2 are shown in Table 3
                     .

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The results showed significant correlations between the outcome qualities and distance measurements for angled laparoscopic instruments with single incision and triple incision for both simple and complex suturing. There was no significant correlation in the cutting tasks or in the setting of straight laparoscopic instruments with triple incision. The hypothesis, “the bigger the distance of a surgical process to best practice, the worse the outcome of the process”, was therefore mainly proven to be true.

In the following discussion, some contextual details are given, which could be reasons for derivations of the hypothesis.

The cutting activity is the main component of the cutting task, as only work steps performed by the right hand were analyzed. Only a few other activities were performed during this task. Variations in the surgical process are mainly based on the frequency of iteration of the cutting activity. Thus, the process is straightforward; in contrast, in the simple suturing and complex suturing tasks, the courses are complex enough to determine interdependences.

Currently, the setting with straight instruments and triple incision is the usual method used in laparoscopic surgery. There is a well-determined frame for the surgical process provided via concrete triangulation. Compared with other settings, there is less opportunity for decision-making in terms of the positioning and motion of the laparoscopic instrument. Here, a significant interdependence was not shown.

Altogether, the results showed that the outcome of these processes could not be seen separately from the work steps required to achieve them. The significant correlation, with a divergence from the best practice, means that there is also a decrease of the outcome quality. Quality management of surgical processes is useful for the improving the outcome of the processes.

Especially for laparoscopic surgery, proper training of the surgeons is essential. Surgical training can be enhanced with the knowledge provided in this work. If a student did not produce the required outcome quality, the distance measurements revealed the part of the process for which additional training is needed. Phases where the surgeon displayed good skills do not need to be repeated as often. This provides more precise, efficient and effective method of surgical training.

A study concerning the interference of the different incision methods and instruments in pediatric laparoscopic surgery was used as basis for the data in this work. The use of data gained from real surgical interventions represents the next step. The distance measurements can be easily made during real surgical interventions, but measuring the outcome quality is more difficult. There are innumerable aspects related to the quality. In the implemented practices, it is essential to set priorities and measure them with key performance indicators.

Even experts have strong opinions regarding the delineation of key performance indicators. Correct and continuous acquisition is often problematic [3,4]. The recording of surgical processes with the help of the surgical workflow editor and trained observers is a precise, established and verified method [15]. Furthermore, there are some approaches capable of detecting actions automatically [27–29].

The relationship between the best training practice and outcome quality found in this paper might also be useful for improving quality management. On the one hand, the compliance of the outcome quality can be better monitored by analyzing the work steps performed. Hence, the complete outcome of the surgical processes will be controlled rather than only certain key figures.

On the other hand, quality inspection using key performance indicators is only a retrospective method. Improvements can only be implemented in future work. With the help of the measurement of the surgical process during runtime, deviations from the best practice could be detected instantly. It would then be possible to take steps to change the surgical process, and the quality of the outcome could be controlled and improved during runtime. To use these methods in real surgical interventions, the human factors become essential. Feedback to the surgeon for improving the workflow must be given carefully in order to have a positive effect [30]. In further studies, this should be assessed in order to produce the best results.

Certainly, variations in the surgical process by means of patient-specific characteristics must be adequately taken into account. This was neglected in this study, because standardized phantom training models were used. Special occurrences, such as unusual patient anatomy, were not considered in the study.

The distance measurements are not given as yes-or-no answers, but rather allowed for grading the distances in relation to the reference process. Based on these data, the best practice can be a pool of very successfully performed surgical interventions. The mean course of several processes can be analyzed with a generic SPM [31]. The easy computations of distance measurements do not provide a determined frame, but instead allow for practical and applicable analysis.

Some topics for further research arise from the current study. First, while it seems obvious that poorly performed activities within a surgery can negatively impact the outcome and recovery time, the significance of the inverse situation, i.e., if negative outcomes or atypical patient recovery times result from poorly performed activities, remains to be investigated. This is especially required in cases where adverse circumstances required an objectively justifiable deviation from the best practice.

To further support this topic, we presented an easy-to-apply method in our work. However, in order to generalize the approach from the considered tasks to entire surgeries, a quantitative assessment of surgery outcome is necessary. Unfortunately, an objective measure of surgery outcome that is analogous to our task results and expresses the overall state in a single rating is currently not available.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The correlation between the best practice of a surgical process and the outcome of the surgical intervention is important. This information can be used in a variety of ways in the daily medical routine. Quality management cannot only be conducted retrospectively, but must also be done on the fly. In laparoscopic surgery, the skill level of surgeon is very important for the quality and, therefore, the success of the operation. Using distance measurements, the key aspects of surgical laparoscopic training can be more precisely expressed.

We showed that for exemplary surgical tasks in laparoscopic training scenarios, a deviation from the best training practice leads to a decreased outcome quality. For the measurement of the deviation of one process to the best practice, we used the Levenshtein and Adjacency distance measurements. The outcome quality was then reviewed by experts. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a significant correlation between most of the assessed processes.

The compliance of processes to best practices is not only important for comparing outcomes but also leads to a greater understanding of the underlying processes [6]. In this paper, we showed that there is a correlation between the process and the outcome of a process for the example tasks. Therefore, benchmarking is a reasonable method to assess and improve surgical processes. The improvement of surgical processes allows for the improvement of medical care.
