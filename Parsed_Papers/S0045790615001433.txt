                  An assessment approach to assess the likelihood of rock burst in coal mines by integrating the Multi-Agent System with data fusion techniques is proposed in this paper. We discuss an optimal algorithm for multi-sensor data fusion to improve the accuracy and reliability of the source data. Some model-based situation quantization methods are described and a rock burst situation quantitative assessment model incorporating improved Dempster–Shafer theory is presented. The Auto-Regressive, Moving Average and Holt–Winters models are used to address indefinability and inaccuracy of the prediction. A case study demonstrates that the proposed situation assessment model is capable of producing relatively accurate forecasts, and thereby it can provide coal mine decision-makers with an overview of the development of rock bursts.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Identifying potential rock burst is one of the most difficult problems in coal mine safety monitoring and warning has aroused wide concern in academia and industry. The production mechanisms are complex and this problem remains unsolved yet, despite considerable research and experiments producing quantities of theoretical results [1–5]. On the basis of these theoretical results, engineers and technicians have developed a series of practical warning systems using monitoring micro earthquakes, rock pressure, acoustic emission, electromagnetic radiation, roof abscission layers, etc. These monitoring systems are playing an increasingly important role in preventing rock burst disasters and ensuring safety coal mine production. However, each system concentrates on a single mechanism of rock burst. An integrated framework combining the data sources has not been successfully constructed due to the diversity of information sources. Furthermore, fundamental early warning methods and information processing techniques have not been fully developed and most systems take alarm thresholds set from experience. Therefore, existing systems have high false alarm rates and warning failures are quite common.

In this paper, a rock burst situation assessment method by integrating the Multi-Agent System (MAS) with data fusion incorporating the complexity and distribution features of each rock burst monitoring system are proposed. More specifically, firstly, the MAS framework for rock burst assessment is introduced. Then, an optimal algorithm for multi-sensor data fusion to improve the accuracy and reliability of sensor data is developed. A multi-source data fusion method is proposed based on improved Dempster–Shafer (D–S) theory. All monitor system outcomes are fitted into the interval [0,1]. Then, by incorporate the Auto-Regressive and Moving Average (ARMA) and Holt–Winters models into one algorithm one can forecast the rock burst situation. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method is illustrated with experimental data.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the MAS data fusion model on the basis of the rock burst situation assessment requirement. An optimal multi-sensor data fusion algorithm is discussed in Section 3. The multi-source information fusion method and its quantitative method based on improved D–S theory is presented in Section 4. Section 5 addresses the ARMA and Holt–Winters models-based algorithms to forecast the rock burst situation. Section 6 shows that our proposed rock burst situation assessment model provides a relatively accurate forecast for experimental. Some findings are discussed in Section 7.

The multi-source method for alarm and forecasting rock burst is widely used. However, this is less than satisfactory, due to random fault warnings for a diversity of reasons, and the abruptness of the warning before the actual rock burst. A warning system based on a situation assessment theory is proposed. It is extensively used in the field of military, transportation, disaster assessment, and computer networking.

The main tasks of a Rock Burst Situation Assessment (RBSA) system are as follows:
                        
                           (a)
                           to fuse the multi-source data from monitoring micro earthquakes, rock pressure, acoustic emission, electromagnetic radiation and so forth;

to provide information connection and complementation among each type of sensor;

to recognize and acquire time and spatial security-related elements; and

to assess the rock burst situation and forecast future trends.

The general structure of an RBSA system is shown in Fig. 1
                     .

The RBSA system includes four functional parts:
                        
                           (a)
                           Data acquisition: The acquisition of real-time data from monitoring systems and storage in a corresponding database.

Log file audit: Audits of log files generated from system operation. Domain knowledge which contains warning records and associated monitoring parameters is stored in the knowledge base.

Data fusion: Multi-source data fusion.

User interface.

The RBSA is divided into a series of sub-monitoring domains which correspond to different databases, knowledge base(s) and information fusion engine(s). The complicated data communication and message coordination among these domains is alleviated through the distributed existence of various monitoring domains. Therefore, the performance, expandability, and robustness of the RBSA system are significantly improved.

Each sub-monitoring system uses its domain knowledge to infer the rock burst situation independently. The RBSA coordinates these sub-systems and is able to identify errors according to relations among different domains, thereby preventing error transfer from one domain to others. When domains produce inconsistent forecasting results, they are submitted to the RBSA for further judgment.

The multi-agent model of the RBSA is shown in Fig. 2
                     . In the multi-agent framework, the monitoring system is divided into a series of independent domains, called local monitor agents. Each local monitor agent corresponds to a monitoring system which can apply domain knowledge to infer the rock burst situation independently. During data fusion and situation assessment, the RBSA supervisor agent coordinates each local monitor agent and eliminates conflicts. Data fusion is accomplished by the information fusion agents while the rock burst situation assessment is achieved by the situation assessment agents.

The process of applying the agent framework model to solve the distributed problem can be divided into three stages [6].
                        
                           (a)
                           Problem decomposition and task allocation. The RBSA supervisor agent decomposes the whole problem into some sub-problems and allocates each to its corresponding local monitor agent.

Problem solving. Each sub-problem is solved by its local monitor agent with its respective domain knowledge.

Information fusion. The results of Sub-problems are collated and fused to obtain an overview of the distributed problem.

In the monitoring system, the same parameter is usually measured from different aspects with multiple sensors. As the values are obtained from different sensors, deviations are inevitable between sensors for the same object. The multi-sensor data fusion algorithm is introduced to improve the precision and reliability of sensor readings.

Obtain the fusion set and the optimal fusion number. When using multiple sensors to measure the same parameter, the set of all the valid data is called the fusion set, and the number of data points in the fusion set is the optimal fusion number.

                                 , then the i-th and j-th sensor support each other. If one sensor is supported by a group of sensors, we deem that the readings of this sensor are valid. If one sensor is not supported by all other sensors or only supported by a few sensors, we deem this sensor is invalid and its corresponding data should be removed from the fusion set.

The optimal fusion result can be obtained by the use of the Maximum Total Probability (MTP) algorithm, the details of that method are discussed in [9].

Electromagnetic radiation monitoring can forecast rock burst effectively. Table 1
                         gives an example dataset of electromagnetic radiation intensity monitored by four sensors. The fusion values quoted were produced from the fusion algorithm in Section 3.1.

As an example, let us take the second group data. From Eqs. (1)–(5), we have the confidence distance matrix

The directed graph shown in Fig. 3
                         describes the relation among these four sensors according to the relation matrix R(2).

Sensors 1, 3, and 4 support each other, whereas sensor 2 is isolated. Therefore, we hold that sensors 1, 3, and 4 are valid, whereas sensor 2 is invalid. Hence, The data of sensors 1, 3, and 4 only should be included by the fusion set. Finally, by the use of the MLEF algorithm, the data in the fusion set can be fused. From Eq. (12),

                         shows the relationship between the fusion, average, and standard values. Fig. 5
                         shows the relative error between the values.

The MLEF algorithm is able to eliminate error data and achieve higher accuracy than the simple average.

Generally, the raw information acquired from the multi-agent system shows diversity, complexity, and uncertainty. As each individual agent has its own functions and duties, it is nearly impossible for one single agent to obtain all the information relevant to a rock burst situation. Therefore, fusion approaches are essential. In the multi-agent information fusion domain, the theory of evidence can compensate for missing data or ignorance, and it does not need a priori probabilities.

The information fusion agent receives a value, x. from local monitor agents at some time, t, The probability of rock burst is

Dempster [10] proposed a theory of evidence, extending earlier work of Shafer [11]. D–S theory provides composition method for relevant evidence.

D–S theory is based the frame of discernment, Θ, which is a finite, non-empty set of mutually exclusive elements. The power set of Θ forms a proposition set. For each proposition A, we have

There may be some problems, such as paradoxes, one ticket veto and lack of robustness [12–15] when using D–S theory to deal with evidence conflicts. Therefore, we adopt the improved D–S theory and apply the efficient combination rule introduced in [16]. The rock burst occurrence support probability is

The log audit facilitates real-time information acquisition, correlation analysis for the local monitor agent, and the discovery and reporting of security incidents. Therefore, to some extent, it enjoys a relatively high reliability. However, log audit alone is not accurate enough to forecast the rock burst situation.

We propose a comprehensive estimate by integrating Sections 4.1 and 4.2, to produce the quantified rock burst situation

If the time series is stable and smooth, then go to Step 2. If the time series is not smooth enough, then check its difference sequence until it is smooth.

Use the forecasting model to forecast the rock burst situation.

The rock burst situation can be forecast with the ARMA model. This method reveals the self-correlation of the time series, which is especially suitable for short-term forecast. However, for long-term forecast, there may be some drawbacks [18].

From the forecast value in Step 6, we can determine the smoothing constants. The principle is to minimize the variance between forecasting value and the real one. We use the method discussed in [21] to obtain the smoothing constants.

This method has taken full consideration of the time series, seasonal variation and randomness. It is especially suitable for short-term seasonal forecast. However, similar to the ARMA model, it is not valid for long-term forecast [18].

To test and verify proposed methods, we obtain the monitoring data of micro earthquake, rock pressure, acoustic emission, and electromagnetic radiation from one coal mine in Shandong Province from August to December 2011. With the situation assessment model of Section 4, we calculated the rock burst situation values by fusing these monitored data. The situation values are shown in Table 2
                     .

Using the ARMA model and Holt–Winters model, forecast values for December based on the first 4months are obtained, and these are shown in Table 3
                     .

We also calculate the forecast values for the last ten time scales based on the first 20 data points of Table 3, and these are shown in Table 4
                     .

Comparison of the ARMA and Holt–Winters models with actual events are shown in Figs. 6 and 7
                     
                     , respectively.

Both ARMA and Holt–Winters model predictions are consistent with the actual situation. The prediction algorithms incorporate the trends, randomness, cycles, and seasons of the time series data, and the mean square error of the prediction result are small in the short term. However, with extended time, the deviation grows. Hence, the ARMA and Holt–Winters models can accurately reflect the trend of a rock burst situation over a short time period, and can be used for rock burst forecasting.

Prediction accuracy of the Holt–Winter based algorithm is somewhat better than the ARMA model in the short time frame, but this suffers for longer term forecasts.

The prediction errors and the scope of application of the models are different: The ARMA model forecast error is small, reflecting autocorrelation, the overall trend, random, and periodic factors of the rock burst situation, therefore it is suitable for the prediction of various types of rock burst. The Holt–Winter model’s forecast error is smaller than that of the ARMA model. It reflects periodic, seasonal, and other factors of rock burst, and would be especially suitable for rock burst forecast with strong periodicity.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The accuracy of rock burst disaster forecast has a close relationship with the quantitative analysis method of monitoring data and logs. To gain a reliable prediction result about disaster, abnormal data which are gained in the process of sensor monitoring should be abandoned at first. After this process, the fault-tolerant ability of the monitoring system can be improved, solid data foundation can be established to assess and forecast rock burst disasters. Simulation analysis shows that the new Agent-based multi-sensors fusion algorithm, which is proposed in this paper, is reasonable and valid. In addition, the measurement accuracy of the monitoring data can also be improved with this new algorithm.In order to accurately assess rock burst disasters, we put forward a quantitative processing method of monitoring data and logs, which is realized based on the multi-agent technology and the improved D–S evidence theory. Moreover, a situation assessment model is constructed to implement the quantitative assessment of rock burst disasters.On the basis of the quantitative assessment of rock burst disasters, two time series analysis models, the ARMA model and the Holt–Winter model, are used for analyzing and forecasting the trend of rock burst disasters.Analysis of living examples shows that the ARMA model achieves a small error. Besides, it is suitable for forecasting multifarious scales of rock burst disasters. In contrast with the ARMA model, the Holt–Winter model has less error. However, the Holt–Winter model is only suitable for predicting the rock burst disaster with strong periodicity.
