                  To extract expert clinic information from the Deep Web, there are two challenges to face. The first one is to make a judgment on forms. A novel method based on a domain model, which is a tree structure constructed by the attributes of query interfaces is proposed. With this model, query interfaces can be classified to a domain and filled in with domain keywords. Another challenge is to extract information from response Web pages indexed by query interfaces. To filter the noisy information on a Web page, a block importance model is proposed, both content and spatial features are taken into account in this model. The experimental results indicate that the domain model yields a precision 4.89% higher than that of the rule-based method, whereas the block importance model yields an F1 measure 10.5% higher than that of the XPath method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many patients need to choose a suitable doctor when they need medical care, but there is not enough information or data to help them make a right choice. Nowadays, most hospital portals display information of their clinic experts, such as professional title, department, specialty and clinic time. If the expert information from all hospital portals of one or more cities are collected and integrated into databases of electronic health records (EHRs), it will provide great convenience for community residents who need hospital care. However, most of this information, hidden behind the Web, is not directly shown on Web pages. This information is known as the Deep Web [1,2]. Therefore, this paper focuses on the crawling of the Deep Web.

The only way to retrieve information from the Deep Web is through Web Query Interfaces (WQIs). 
                     Fig. 1 depicts this process. On Web pages, WQIs always appear as HTML forms that allow accessing Hidden-Web databases [3]. Two problems generally need to be dealt with when extracting information from the Deep Web. The first one is the identification of Web sites containing WQIs, and the second is to extract useful information from response pages searched by WQIs. In Cope et al., the authors put forward some rules to identify WQIs [4]. For example, they state that a HTML form is considered as a WQI if it contains some text input controls (<input type=text>) and attribute-words. Unfortunately, this method needs further improvements because it cannot distinguish search engines from WQIs. For the information extraction problem, it is critical to filter noisy information such as navigation information, advertisement information, version information, etc. Yan Fu et al. adopted a series of rules called XPath to distinguish useful content blocks from noisy clutters [5]. This method was tested in five different Web sites and resulted in average integrality of 92% and average accuracy of 83.2%. However, this method has a basic precondition that the Web pages should have a common layout. Therefore, this method does not have general applicability.

There are three main contributions in this paper:
                        
                           −
                           A domain model is defined to identify WQIs. The model can identify the domain to which an unknown interface belongs, and provide domain keywords to fill in WQIs.

In order to improve the performance of the domain model, a virtual MapReduce cluster based on VMware ESX2.0 and Hapood version 0.18.0 is established. This cluster provides a parallel computing environment.

A block importance model is proposed to filter noisy blocks on a Web page. Both content and spatial features are taken into account in this model.

Although our paper focuses on a clinic domain, it also can be generalizable to other domains. For example, vocabularies such as “From”, “To”, “Departing time”, “Returning time”, etc. are usually used to depict the attributes of air ticket query interfaces. Obviously, these attributes are convergent through clustering, therefore, a domain model can be established for extracting air ticket information. In addition, this model also can be used in the book domain, job domain, automobile domain, etc.

@&#METHOD@&#

Researchers from UIUC manually collected 477 WQIs in 8 areas through the Google engine and Web directory service, performed a statistical analysis of these WQIs and came to the following conclusions [6].
                           
                              −
                              Attributes of each WQI are finite.

Although there are numerous WQIs in each domain, vocabularies that depict the attributes of WQIs are convergent through clustering.

Based on these two unique features, a domain model that can describe the attributes of WQIs is proposed. The definition of the domain model is as follows.
                           Definition
                           The domain model is an ordered attribute tree that is defined as a 11-tuple, i.e.

Based on the above definition, the construction of a domain model can be described as follows. A WQI is chosen from one domain as an original domain model, then it is combined with other WQIs in this domain in order to enlarge and enrich the original one. This process is repeated until the domain model becomes stable. This combination process should comply with the following four rules.

Assuming u is a node belonging to the original domain mode and v is a new node, then
                           
                              −
                              
                                 Add rule. If the semantics of v is different from other nodes in the original domain model, then add a tree (v is the root node) to the original domain model.


                                 Update rule. If the semantics of v is similar to u, then update TP list, N list, Lb list and Val list of u with TP, N, Lb and Val of v.


                                 Refine rule. If the semantics of v is similar to u, and v contains some attributes that do not appear in u, then add v to the domain model as a child node of u.


                                 Generalize rule. If the semantics of v can generalize several nodes {u1,u2…un} in the original domain model, then add v to the domain model as a child node of these nodes׳ parent. At the same time, take {u1,u2…un} as children of v.

For example, 
                        Fig. 2 shows a typical example of two WQIs in the clinic domain, we can merge these two WQIs using the above rules. 
                        Fig. 3 shows the merging result.

A perfect and stable domain model can be established through clustering of WQIs. However, it should be stored before we use. Extensible Markup Language (XML) [7] is chosen as the storage model for multiple reasons. On one hand, XML is one of the most prevalent models to exchange and save data. On the other hand, it contains two well defined layers: one is a metadata layer and another is a data layer. Document Type Definitions (DTDs) can be used to define the structure of a XML document by using a series of legal elements. DTDs of the domain model are described as follows:
                           
                              <! ELEMENT DM (element+)>

<! ATTLIST element name ID # REQUIRED>

<! ELEMENT element (Lb, LbList, N, NList, TP, TPList, Val, ValList, R, tf, element?)>

<! ELEMENT Lb (#PCDATA)>

<! ELEMENT LbList (Lb+)>

<! ELEMENT N (#PCDATA)>

<! ELEMENT NList (N+)>

<! ELEMENT TP (#PCDATA)>

<! ELEMENT TpList (type+)>

<! ELEMENT Val (#PCDATA)>

<! ELEMENT ValList (#value+)>

<! ELEMENT R (#PCDATA)>

<! ELEMENT tf (#PCDATA)>

It is obvious that there are numerous Web pages containing WQIs on Internet, the efficiency and accuracy of WQIs identification are not only related to the identification method, but also closely related to large scale data distributed processing. Therefore, MapReduce is introduced.

MapReduce is a distributed computational model for big-data processing. In this model, processing is executed in two phases, a map followed by a reduce phase. Hadoop MapReduce and Google MapReduce are two main computational frameworks at present. In this paper, we use Hadoop MapReduce because it is an open source solution [8]. 
                        Fig. 4 depicts the MapReduce procedure of identification and classification of WQIs.

Our work relates to WQIs classification and identification in three key aspects.

First, a MapReduce of links classification is established, which aims at filtering links not containing WQIs. The output of this MapReduce should meet the following conditions.
                           
                              −
                              The depth of a Web page that containing WQIs is less than or equal to 3 [9];

Some Chinese words like “搜索(search)”, “高级搜索(advanced search)” and “点击这里搜索(click here to search)” are contained in anchor texts.

According to those two conditions, Maper1 outputs intermediate results <<url,hyperlinks>,html>, Reduce1 merges these results having the same key value, outputs results<<url,links>,html> and transmits to the next MapReduce procedure.

Second, another MapReduce of WQIs identification is established, which aims at filtering forms that are not right WQIs (e.g. logging forms, mailing list subscription forms).We made some improvements to the rule-based method proposed by Cope et al. [4]. Assuming that a form can be defined as a 5-tuple, i.e.

                                 Rule 4. If the root directory of Action is different from that of URL, then the Form is not a WQI (may be a search engine or a meta-engine form).

These rules can provide guidance on preliminary screening of WQIs, Maper2 outputs intermediate results <links,<formName,html>>, Reduce2 merges these results having the same key value, outputs results<<links,formName>,form> and transmits to the next MapReduce procedure.

Third, the last MapReduce of WQIs classification is established, which aims at WQIs classification. Maper3 receives results that from Reduce2 and transmits <formName,form> to Reduce3. Finally, Reduce3 makes a judgment to decide to which domain WQIs belong according to the domain model.

The process contains the following steps:

Standardize the extracted attribute-words, for example, remove stop words, restore word stem, filter illegal characters, etc.;

Calculate the similarity between the Form and each domain model through Vector Space Model [10], the Form belongs to a domain model with which it is better correlated.

Response Web pages often contain information that is irrelevant to the extracted theme. Such noisy information should be filtered to avoid topic drifting. Generally speaking, web designers are used to design their layout in a rational way: giving prominent to significant things and playing down the nonsignificant sections with appropriate features such as position, size, word, color, image, link, etc. A block importance model can be defined as a function to map from features to importance for each block, and can be formalized as:

<block features>->block importance

In the design process, significant information is usually put in the center, other information such as navigation and copyright information are put at the top or bottom side. Therefore, spatial features can reflect the importance of a block. On the other hand, if the spatial features of two block are similar, content features are used to distinguish their importance. 
                        Table 1 and 
                        Table 2 list the spatial features and content features of blocks respectively.

Based on these two kinds of features, we can label the importance of each block. 
                        Table 3 lists 3-level importance value.

In order to deduce block importance from block features, two kinds of algorithms can be used. The first one is a rule-based algorithm, unfortunately, it is difficult to construct a rule function manually when faced with dozens of features. The other one is a machine learning-based algorithm. Blocks are manually labeled as(x,y), where x is the feature of a block and y is the importance level of a block. Suppose T is a set of labeled blocks (training set), the learning process of this algorithm can be described as finding a function f(x) that can minimize

                        . Clearly, the importance level (y) is a discrete value, therefore, the learning process can be treated as a classification problem to be solved. Many available learning algorithms can be employed to tackle the problem. In this study, SVM [11] is chosen to learn the block importance model.

In this section, the experiments that are carried out to evaluate the proposed method, and their results are present.

In this experiment, the main goal is to demonstrate how the domain model and MapReduce can improve the performance and accuracy of classification and identification of WQIs. Based on VMware ESX2.0 and Hapood version 0.18.0, a virtual MapReduce cluster is established for a Deep Web crawler (VMRC).

Deep Web databases from two different domains are selected as data sources for this experiment. Their detailed information is listed in 
                        Table 4.

In order to compare VMRC to others, a crawler running on a common server (CC) and a crawler running on stand-alone MapReduce environment (MRC) are constructed.


                        
                        Fig. 5 describes the number of WQIs found by these three crawlers from the book domain and job domain.

It is clearly seen from Fig. 5 that the performance of MRC is nearly the same as CC when pages are not massive, but with an increase of crawled pages, MRC achieves better performance on WQIs discovery than CC. However, VMRC performs best among these three crawlers, there are two reasons accounting for this best performance. First, with an increases of crawled pages, CC and MRC will be under more pressure, while VMRC designed in this paper can easily solve this problem by adding virtual computing resources. Second, 
                        Table 5 lists hardware utilization of the server before virtualization and after virtualization. It is clear that VMware significantly increases resource utilization by reasonable planning.

Beside the performance experiment, we design another experiment to evaluate the accuracy of the domain model. 120 WQIs in clinic domain are manually collected, meanwhile, 60 non-deep Web Query Interfaces (non-WQIs) are collected from the Internet, including registration forms, search engines, logging forms, etc. The accuracy of the domain model has been measured via two metrics: accuracy and precision.

Two methods, the domain model and a rule-based method, are used to test the accuracy of WQIs identification. The accuracy obtained by these methods is compared in 
                        Table 6. The domain model achieves the best performance with accuracy 94.44% and precision 99.12%. The rule-based method performed worse than the domain model.

The reasons accounting for this result can be described as follows.

First, the rule-based method is conservative, it can only achieve preliminary identification of WQIs. Interfaces, such as search engine forms, survey forms, etc. are not easily identified by this method.

Second, the identification of WQIs based on domain model is a post-query method [12]. We can use this model to classify forms and choose domain keywords to fill in and submit forms. In [12], the authors proposed that at least 80% of responses have their LDS (largest difference subtree) of at least 1K bytes long. The authors also proposed a response analyzer to analyze response pages, one of the statements is that if responses were from other Web sites, forms would be search engines. According to these conditions, we can decide whether a form is assessed as a WQI.

2500 of Web pages are downloaded from Internet and segmented by Vision-based Page Segmentation (VIPS) algorithm. After this process, we get a total of 23,116 blocks. Then half of these blocks are manually labeled by 65 students of computer science. We use the labeled blocks for training samples and others for testing. L-SVM [13] and RBF-SVM [14] are used to learn the block importance model. In addition, the method proposed by Yan et al. [5], i.e. XPath is tested on the same data set for comparison. To evaluate the performance of these methods, precision (P), recall (R) and F1 metrics are introduced by using IR methods. Suppose x represents the number of blocks have been extracted successfully, y represents the number of blocks extracted correctly and incorrectly, and z represents the total number of blocks. P, R and F1 are defined as follows:

                                       +
                                       R
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     


                        
                        Table 7 shows the experimental results.

RBF-SVM achieves the best performance with F1 0.813, while L-SVM with F1 0.775, worse than RBF-SVM. This result indicates that nonlinear features combination is better than linear combination. Xpath achieves the performance with F1 0.708, lower than both RBF-SVM and L-SVM. The reasons accounting for this result can be described as follows:

First, when Web pages are massive, it is practically impossible to ensure that all pages have the same layout. In addition, it is not easy to construct rule functions for the XPath method.

Second, SVM with RBF kernel has strong abilities of interpolation, it is adept in fetching local properties of samples.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

A novel method is proposed in this paper for the extraction of clinic expert information from hospital portals. The method consists of a domain model and a block importance model. First, the domain model is used for identifying whether a form is a WQI. The experimental result shows that the model has a precision 4.89% higher than that of the rule-based method. Then the block importance model is adopted for noises filtering of a web page. The experimental result indicates that the model has an F1 measure 10.5% higher than that of XPath method.

With the effectiveness of the proposed method demonstrated, our future work is to integrate clinic expert information into the databases of EHRs in order to bring convenience to community residents.

We claim there is no conflict of interest regarding our manuscript entitled “Clinic expert information extraction based on domain model and block importance model”.
