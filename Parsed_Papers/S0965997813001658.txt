                  Bat inspired (BI) algorithm is a recently developed metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by echolocation behavior of bats. In this study, the BI algorithm is examined in the context of discrete size optimization of steel frames designed for minimum weight. In the optimum design problem frame members are selected from available set of steel sections for producing practically acceptable designs subject to strength and displacement provisions of American Institute of Steel Construction-Allowable Stress Design (AISC-ASD) specification. The performance of the technique is quantified using three real-size large steel frames under actual load and design considerations. The results obtained provide a sufficient evidence for successful performance of the BI algorithm in comparison to other metaheuristics employed in structural optimization.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A steel frame refers to a type of structure where vertical steel columns and horizontal beams generally selected from I-shaped steel sections are arranged in the form of a rectangular grid to support lateral and vertical loads acting on a building. The lateral stability of such systems is provided by flexural stiffness of beams and columns if beams are rigidly connected to columns at joints. Alternatively, moment-free connections can be used, in which case the framework must be stiffened with a full-bracing system that behaves like a vertical truss throughout the height of the building to transmit lateral forces to the ground. Different types of floor slabs can be adopted in such systems in composite or non-composite forms. A composite floor consists of a high-strength profiled steel deck with concrete topping cast and is more preferable for multi-story buildings due to high speed of construction.

Both safety and economy have to be considered while designing a steel frame. The common practice followed by a practicing engineer is to observe structural safety always, while an economical design is pursued meanwhile using intuition, experience and a trial-and-error based procedure. However, despite the best effort of the designer, the optimum design, which leads to minimum weight or cost of the structure, can be reached at almost no times. Further, sometimes a design produced this way may lead to very uneconomical solutions especially when the design is governed by displacement constraints. Hence, it is essential that the design process of steel frames be implemented in conjunction of computer-aided numerical algorithms that are automated to achieve optimum design of such structures.

In the past optimum design of structures was overwhelmingly carried out using optimality criteria (OC) and mathematical programming (MP) based methods [1]. Despite strong mathematical backgrounds and remarkable speed of convergence to the optimum, these methods have found scarce applications in discrete size optimization problems of steel frames. In the aforementioned problems, a set of steel sections selected from available section tables are initially collected in a design pool. Each steel section is assigned a sequence number that varies between one to the total number of sections in the list. The selection of steel sections for member groups is carried out using these numbers. This selection should be performed in such a way that a steel frame has the minimum weight or cost while behavior and performance of the structure is within the limitations described according to serviceability and strength requirements of a chosen code of design practice. The need for selecting member sizes from a list of ready sections as well as gradient-based nature of OC and MP algorithms hampers a direct application of these methods to such problems encountered in real life. Fortunately, in the last two decades a number of computational methods, commonly referred to as metaheuristics in the literature, have been developed as powerful tools that can effectively deal with discrete structural optimization problems at the expense of increased computational cost [2–10]. These novel and innovative approaches are derivative-free methods and make use of ideas inspired from the nature. There are a large number of metaheuristic techniques available in the literature nowadays. The state-of-the-art review of metaheuristics in structural design optimization is outlined in several excellent review papers, such as Lamberti and Pappalettere [11], Saka [12], and Saka and Dogan [13].

One recent addition to metaheuristic algorithms is the bat-inspired (BI) search. The idea behind this technique is to imitate echolocation behavior of bats. In simple words, echolocation is used to refer to the way bats use to navigate their surroundings. Bats get to find their directions and detect prey and different types of objects around them even in complete darkness. They achieve this by emitting calls out to the environment and listening to the echoes that bounce back from them. The echolocation behavior of bats was turned into a numerical algorithm by Yang [14] for solving optimization problems. A verification of this algorithm was conducted using several standard test functions of unconstrained optimization in Yang [14,15]. Besides, the technique was successfully applied to some benchmark constrained engineering optimization problems in Yang and Gandomi [16] and Gandomi et al. [17].

In Hasançebi et al. [18] a thorough reformulation of the BI algorithm was proposed for sizing optimization of steel trusses. In this study, the BI algorithm was scrutinized in the context of discrete sizing optimization of steel frames. It should be underlined that the latter is seemingly a more challenging optimization problem. The reason is that truss members carry only one type of force (i.e. axial force), and a discrete optimization process can be carried out for these systems using a well-ordered section list generated by sorting steel sections according to their cross-sectional areas. On the other hand, beams and columns in a steel framework are axial–flexural members. The governing behavior of a frame member is determined by relative magnitudes of axial force and bending moment carried by the member at a time. When steel sections are sorted according to a chosen sectional property, i.e. cross-sectional area or moment or inertia, there is no guarantee that the next section in the list is stronger for some frame members. This introduces a great deal of disorder in the list, and makes the search process more complicated for an algorithm. Hence, aside from presenting a new application of the BI algorithm, this study intends to investigate efficiency of this technique in more complicated problems of structural optimization. In the study strength and displacement provisions of steel frames are imposed according to the provisions of AISC-ASD specification [19]. The numerical performance of the BI algorithm is tested and verified using three real-size design examples. The numerical results evince that the BI algorithm performs very efficiently for this class of problems and produces improved results as compared to other techniques of metaheuristics.

                      members that are collected in Nd
                      design groups (variables), the optimum design problem according to AISC-ASD [19] code yields the following discrete programming problem, if the design groups are selected from steel sections in a given profile list.

For the computation of allowable compression and Euler stresses, the effective length factors (K) are required. For beam and bracing members, K is taken equal to unity. For column members, alignment charts furnished in AISC-ASD [19] can be utilized. In this study, however, the effective length factors of columns in braced and unbraced steel frames are calculated from the following approximate formulas developed by Dumonteil [21], which are accurate to within about −1.0% and +2.0% of the exact results [22]:

Apart from stress constraints, slenderness limitations are also imposed on all members such that maximum slenderness ratio

                      is limited to 300 and 200 for tension and compression members, respectively. The displacement constraints are imposed such that the maximum lateral displacements are restricted to be less than H/400, and upper limit of story drift is set to be h/400, where H is the total height of the frame building and h is the height of a story.

Finally, we consider geometric constraints between beams and columns framing into each other at a common joint for practicality of an optimum solution generated. For the two beams B1 and B2 and the column shown in Fig. 1

The role of nature as an inspiration resource for developing modern optimization techniques is undeniable. The bat inspired algorithm is derived from echolocation behavior of bats. Echolocation is an advanced hearing based navigation system used by bats and some other animals to detect objects in their surroundings by emitting a sound to the environment. In general echolocation calls are characterized by three features; namely pulse frequency, pulse emission rate and loudness (intensity). When flying, bats emit echolocation calls with varying frequencies between 25kHz and 150kHz depending on the proximity of a target [14]. Although low frequency sounds travel further than high-frequency sounds, the latter give bats more detailed and distinctive information about the surrounding objects. On the other hand, the pulse rate corresponds to the number of pulses emitted per second and it can also be adjusted by bats according to the distance to the target object. It is known that bats increase the rate of pulse to 200 pulses per second when approaching the target. Finally, bats decrease the intensity (loudness) of pulse from 120dB (loudest) to 50dB (quietest) as they come closer to their prey. Yang [14] simulated this echolocation behavior of bats in a numerical optimization procedure called bat-inspired (BI) algorithm. The BI algorithm implemented in the present study to solve minimum weight design problems of steel frames is outlined in the following.


                     Step 1. Initializing bat population (positions and velocities): A population of μ micro-bats (candidate solutions) is randomly generated first, where μ refers to the population size. Each micro-bat B
                     
                        i
                      has two sets of components; a position (design) vector x
                     
                        i
                      and a velocity vector v
                     
                        i
                     , Eq. (13). The position vector retains values (positions) of the design variables, while the velocity vector is used to vary these positions during the search. The iteration counter t is set to zero initially.

                     Step 2. Echolocation parameters and their initializations: The next step is to initialize an echolocation parameter set for the micro-bats in the population. Each micro-bat incorporates a set of echolocation parameters Ω

                     Step 3. Evaluating micro-bats in the initial population: The initial population is evaluated, where all micro-bats are analyzed with the set of steel sections selected for the design variables, and the force and deformation responses are obtained under the loads. The objective function values of the feasible micro-bats that satisfy all problem constraints are directly calculated from Eq. (2). However, infeasible micro-bats that violate some of the problem constraints are penalized using an external penalty function approach, and their objective function values are computed using Eq. (18).

                     In Eq. (18), ϕ is the constrained objective function value, ck
                      is the kth problem constraint and p is the penalty coefficient used to tune the intensity of penalization as a whole. This parameter is set to an appropriate static value, such as p
                     =1.


                     Step 4. Storing the current population: The current population, which consists of the best micro-bats (solutions) located so far in the search process from the beginning, is stored and iteration counter t is increased by one.


                     Step5. Generating candidate micro-bats: μ number of new micro-bats are generated as candidate solutions for the design population. This is implemented using a procedure that employs two probabilistic generation schemes referred to as random flying and local search. Random flying provides a more explorative search, allowing a micro-bat to fly to a new and possibly remote position in the search space. On the other hand, a more exploitative search is intended in a local search scheme, where a micro-bat selected from the current population is perturbed in the close vicinity of its current solution to browse neighboring points. The new micro-bat is generated by applying either one of these two schemes, which is determined probabilistically using the following pseudo code.

It follows that in the beginning of the search the new candidate solutions are originated using the two generation schemes under equal probability. However, as the search goes on, the role of local search is augmented while that of random flying is diminished. This way an exploitative search is progressively dominated in time to benefit more from the previously visited good solutions than exploring new design regions of the search space.

                     .


                     Step 6. Evaluating candidate micro-bats: Once generated, the candidate micro-bats are analyzed with the set of steel sections selected for the design variables, and the force and deformation responses are obtained under the loads. The objective function values of the feasible and infeasible candidate micro-bats are calculated from Eqs. (2) and (18), respectively.


                     Step 7. Echolocation parameters update: After evaluating candidate micro-bats, the echolocation parameters are updated for improving candidates. The rationale behind this is to automatically adopt a more useful set of values for the echolocation parameters, similar to real bats which adjust those parameters based on the distance to a target object. A micro-bat is allowed to update its echolocation parameters every time when it produces a solution that surpasses its individual best. The individual best refers to the best solution attained by the micro-bat itself during its iteration history. When this happens, a uniform random number ui
                      is first sampled in the range [0,1] and if it is smaller than the loudness li
                      of the micro-bat, then its echolocation parameters ri
                      and li
                      are updated using the following equations

                     Step 8. Selection: Selection is then carried out between current and candidate micro-bats to form members of the next population which will parent and guide generation of the subsequent micro-bats. Here, the employed selection methodology is borrowed from the well-known variant of evolution strategies technique referred to as (μ
                     +
                     μ)-ES [23]. In this selection methodology current and candidate micro-bats are set into competition together and the best μ solutions from a total of μ
                     +
                     μ
                     =2μ current and candidate solutions are selected deterministically in reference to their objective function values. It should be noted that this selection methodology comes up with a promise of guaranteed survival for the micro-bats; that is to say the selected micro-bats at any iteration represent the best solutions located by the algorithm from the start.


                     Step 9. Termination: The steps 4 through 8 are carried out in the same way until a termination criterion is met, which can be imposed a maximum number of iterations or no improvement of the best feasible design over a certain number of iterations.

                     , and penalty coefficient p
                     =1. For an objective comparison between different methods, the maximum number of iterations is limited to 50,000 in each example in line with the previously reported solutions of these problems in the literature. In all the examples, the material properties of steel is taken as follows: modulus of elasticity (E)=29,000ksi (203,893.6MPa) and yield stress (Fy
                     )=36ksi (253.1MPa).

The first design example shown in Fig. 2
                         is a 132-member unbraced steel frame consisting of 70 joints and 132 members that are grouped into 30 independent size variables (Fig. 2b) to satisfy practical fabrication requirements. The columns are to be selected from a section list consisting of 297 W-shaped steel sections, whereas a discrete set of 171 sections is used to size the beams. Both gravity and lateral loads are considered in designing the frame. Gravity loads yielding uniformly distributed loads on outer and inner beams of the roof and floors are given in Table 1
                        . As for the lateral forces, earthquake loads (E) are considered. These loads are computed as to equivalent lateral force procedure outlined in ASCE 7-05 [24], resulting in the values given in Table 1 that are applied at the center of gravity of each story as joint loads. Gravity (G) and earthquake (E) loads are combined under two loading conditions for the frame: (i) 1.0G
                        +1.0E (in x-direction), and (ii) 1.0G
                        +1.0E (in y-direction). The combined stress, stability and geometric constraints are imposed as explained in Section 2. The joint displacements in x and y directions are restricted to 1.53 in (3.59cm), which is obtained as height of frame/400. Furthermore, story drift constraints are applied to each story of the frame, which is equal to height of each story/400.

This problem has been formerly studied in the literature [25,26] using simulated annealing (SA), big bang-big crunch (BB-BC), tabu search (TS), harmony search (TS) techniques as well as two enhanced versions of BB-BC referred to as exponential big ban-big crunch (EBB-BC) and modified Big Bang-Big Crunch (MBB-BC) algorithms. A total of eight independent runs are performed with the BI algorithm using different values of the parameter set for loudness adaptation parameter α
                        ∊[0.90,0.99], pulse rate adaptation parameter γ
                        ∊[0.95,0.99] and standard deviation σ
                        ∊[1.0,3.0]. The best run of the algorithm has been obtained when α
                        =0.95, γ
                        =0.99 and σ
                        =2.0 are selected resulting in a minimum design weight of 57,519.97kg (126,809.83lb) for the frame. On the other hand, the mean and standard deviation of the eight independent runs come out to be 58,955.66kg (129,972.80lb) and 1582kg (3488lb), indicating a reliable performance of the BI algorithm. A comparison of the optimum designs obtained for the frame using different metaheuristics is carried out in Table 2
                         in terms of section designation adopted for each member group and corresponding design weights. It is seen from this table that the solution produced by the BI algorithm is significantly lower than the formerly best solution of this problem attained using EBB-BC technique with a final design weight of 60,804.31kg (134,050.55lb). The solutions produced by other metaheuristics mostly fall within a band of 63,000–65,000kg; namely 62,993.55kg (138,874.67lb) by SA, 63,056.72kg (139,016.28lb) by MBB-BC, 64,733.69kg (142,710.96) by TS, and 64,926.17kg (143,135.29) by HS. On the other hand, an unacceptably poor design weight of 87,468.21kg (192,834.39lb) has been located using the BB-BC algorithm, indicating that this algorithm gets stuck in a local optimum before a convergence to favorable design regions is achieved.

The variations of average pulse rate and loudness parameters during the optimum search process with the BI algorithm are presented in Fig. 3
                        (a and b), respectively. This figure evinces success of the BI algorithm displaying how a satisfactory tradeoff is established by the algorithm between explorative and exploitative search features. It should be clear that explorative and exploitative search features are managed by the algorithm using random flying and local search, respectively. In the beginning of the optimization process the roles of explorative and exploitative search are balanced in an identical weight by setting pulse rate parameter to 0.5. As the iterations go on, the role of exploitative search becomes more prominent in proportion to increase in pulse rate parameter, while the loudness is decreased in the meantime to gradually narrow the size of the area investigated during local search.

The second design example is an industrial building consisting of 100 joints and 209 members. Shown in Fig. 4
                         are the plan, side and 3D views of this structure. The main system of the structure consists of five identical frameworks lying 6.1m (20ft) apart from each other in the x–z plane. Each framework consists of two side frames and a gable roof truss in between them, as depicted in Fig. 4(b). The lateral stability against wind loads in the x–z plane is provided through columns fixed at the base along with the rigid connections of the side frames. Hence, all the beams and columns in the side frames are designed as moment-resisting axial–flexural members. The gable roof truss, on the other hand, is designed to transmit only axial forces through pin-jointed connections, and hence the web and chord members in the gable roof are all designed as axial members. For longitudinal stability (along y-axis) of the structure, bracing is provided in the end bays in the walls and the roof.

Three different types of loads are considered for design of the industrial building; namely dead, crane and wind loads. A design dead load of 1.2kN/m2 is assumed to be acting on both floors of the side frames, resulting in uniformly distributed loads of 14.63kN/m (1004.55lb/ft) and 7.32kN/m (502.27lb/ft) on the interior and exterior beams of the side frames. The dead weights of the gable roofs are neglected due to relatively light weight of these components. The crane load is modeled as two pairs of moving live loads acting on both sides of the crane runway beams, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Each pair consists of a concentrated load of 280kN (62.9kip) and a couple moment of 75kNm (5532kipft). In the study the crane load is represented in two distinct load cases referred to as CL1 and CL2 by choosing two different positions for the crane on its runway. In CL1, the crane is positioned at points A and A′ as shown in Fig. 4(d) to create maximum effect on the second framework. In CL2, however, it is positioned in the middle of the runway beam between the second and third frameworks (shown as B and B′ in Fig. 4(d)) to maximize response in the beams directed along y-axis.

Only the wind in the x-direction is considered for design purpose, and the corresponding wind forces are calculated based on a basic wind speed of V
                        =46.94m/s (105mph) in line with the prescriptions described in ASCE 7-05 [24]. Two load cases referred to as WL1 and WL2 are generated depending on the sign of internal wind pressure exerted on external faces of the building, as shown in Fig. 5
                        . In both cases, it is assumed that wind causes a positive compression pressure on the windward face, while it causes a negative suction effect on the leeward face as well as on side walls of the building. In WL1 the suction effect is considered for the entire roof surface, whereas in WL2 one part of the roof is subjected to compression pressure. From amongst the five load cases (DL, CL1, CL2, WL1 and WL2), a total of six load combinations are generated for strength design of each structural member in accordance with AISC-ASD [19] specification, as follows: (i) 1.0DL+1.0CL1, (ii) 1.0DL+1.0CL1+1.0WL1, (iii) 1.0DL+1.0CL1+1.0WL2, (iv) 1.0DL+1.0CL2, (v) 1.0DL+1.0CL2+1.0WL1, (vi) 1.0DL+1.0CL2+1.0WL2.

Considering symmetry of the structure as well as fabrication requirements of structural members, 209 members are collected in 14 member groups, Fig. 4(d). Section lists consisting of 297 and 171 W-shaped steel sections are used to size the columns and beams, respectively, whereas side wall and roof bracings are selected from a section list consisting of 407 equal-leg back-to-back double angle sections. Combined stress, stability and geometric constraints are imposed according to the provisions of AISC-ASD [19]. In addition, displacements of all the joints in x and y directions are limited to 3.43cm (1.25in.), and the upper limit of inter-story drifts is set to 1.52cm (0.6in.).

A number of metaheuristics have been employed to solve this problem in the literature [26,27], including classical harmony search (HS), adaptive harmony search (AHS), big bang-big crunch (BB-BC), exponential big bang-big crunch (EBB-BC), and modified big bang-big crunch (MBB-BC). A total of eight independent runs are performed with the BI algorithm using different values of the echolocation parameter set. The mean and standard deviation of the eight independent runs come out to be 43,849.46kg (96,669.89lb) and 1,016kg (2,241lb), indicating a reliable performance of the BI algorithm. Again the best run of the algorithm has been obtained when α
                        =0.95, γ
                        =0.99 and σ
                        =2.0 are selected resulting in a minimum design weight of 42,924.07kg (94,631.38lb) for the frame. In Table 3
                        , a comparison of optimum designs obtained for the industrial building using different metaheuristics is carried out in terms of section designation adopted for each member group and the corresponding design weights. It can be seen from Table 3 that the optimum design found by the BI algorithm is overall the best solution for this test problem and coincides with that found by the EBB-BC algorithm. Other acceptable yet slightly higher solutions to the problem are 44,053.45kg (97,121.3lb) by AHS, 46,685.83kg (102,924.73lb) by HS and 46,195.10kg (101,842.77lb) by MBB-BC. On the other hand, an unacceptably poor design weight of 73,375.37kg (161,764.99lb) has been obtained when the BB-BC algorithm is employed, indicating that this algorithm gets stuck in a local optimum before a convergence to favorable design regions is achieved. The convergence history showing variation of the best feasible design generated so far throughout the optimization process with each metaheuristic technique is plotted in Fig. 6
                        . The variations of pulse rate and loudness parameters during the optimum search process with the BI algorithm are presented in Fig. 7
                        (a and b), respectively.

The last design example shown in Fig. 8
                         is a 36-story high-rise braced steel frame composed of 814 joints and 1860 members. An economical and effective stiffening of the frame against lateral forces is achieved through exterior diagonal bracing members located on the perimeter of the building, which also participate in transmitting the gravity forces. The 1860 frame members are collected in 72 different member groups considering the symmetry of the structure and practical fabrication requirements. That is, the columns in a story are collected in three member groups as corner columns, inner columns and outer columns, whereas beams are divided into two groups as inner beams and outer beams. The corner columns are grouped together as having the same section over three adjacent stories, as are inner columns, outer columns, inner beams and outer beams. Bracing members on each facade are designed as three-story deep members, and two bracing groups are specified in every six stories. The member grouping details are depicted in Fig. 8(b). The wide-flange (W) profile list consisting of 297 ready sections is used to size column members, while beams and diagonals are adopted from section lists consisting of 171 and 147 wide-flange sections, respectively.

The frame is subjected to two loading conditions of combined gravity and wind forces. These forces are computed as per ASCE 7-05 [24] based on the following design values: a design dead load of 2.88kN/m2 (60.13lb/ft2), a design live load of 2.39kN/m2 (50lb/ft2), a ground snow load of 1.20kN/m2 (25lb/ft2) and a basic wind speed of 55.21m/s (123.5mph). Lateral (wind) loads acting at each floor level on windward and leeward faces of the frame are tabulated in Table 4
                         and the gravity loading on the beams of roof and floors is given in Table 5
                        . In the first loading condition, gravity loads are applied together with wind loads acting along x-axis (1.0GL+1.0WL−
                        x), whereas in the second one they are applied with wind loads acting along y-axis (1.0GL+1.0WL−
                        y). The combined stress, stability and geometric constraints are imposed according to the provisions of AISC-ASD [19]. The joint displacements in x and y directions are restricted to 32.0cm (12.6in.), which is obtained as height of frame/400. Furthermore, story drift constraints are applied to each story of the frame, which is equal to height of each story/400.

A total of eight independent runs are performed with the BI algorithm using different values of the echolocation parameter set. The mean and standard deviation of the eight independent runs come out to be 2,283,796.31kg (5,034,824.32lb) and 76,139kg (167,856lb), indicating a reliable performance of the BI algorithm for a test problem of this scale. The best run of the algorithm has been obtained when α
                        =0.99, γ
                        =0.99 and σ
                        =3.0 are selected resulting in a minimum design weight of 2,187,494.88kg (4,822,600.76lb) for the building. A comparison of this design with other formerly reported solutions of the problem using harmony search (HS) and adaptive harmony search (AHS) methods [27] is carried out in Table 6
                        . It is observed from this table that an acceptable yet slightly higher solution has been produced to this structure by the AHS method, whereas the HS method exhibits a poor convergence characteristic getting stuck in a local optimum very far from favorable regions of the design space. The convergence history showing variation of the best feasible design generated so far throughout the optimization process with each metaheuristic technique is plotted in Fig. 9
                        . The variations of pulse rate and loudness parameters during the optimum search process with the BI algorithm are presented in Fig. 10
                        (a and b), respectively.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The objective in this study is to investigate efficiency of the BI algorithm in discrete sizing optimization problems of steel frames. The optimum design algorithm presented in the study selects steel sections from available section tables such that design constraints described according to provisions of AISC-ASD are satisfied and the structure has the minimum weight. This addresses a challenging category in discrete structural optimization because a great deal of disorder existing in discrete section lists makes the search process very difficult for optimization algorithms.

In the study, the success of the BI algorithm has been quantified using numerical examples, where the optimum design weights obtained for the three real-size steel frames using the BI algorithm are compared to the previously reported solutions of these problems using different metaheuristics in the literature. The numerical results obtained indicate robustness and efficiency of the BI algorithm for this class of problems. The variations of average pulse rate and average loudness parameters in these design examples are plotted in Figs. 3, 7 and 10, which depicts how the algorithm can combine explorative and exploitative search features in a finest way when searching the design space.

Optimal ranges of the echolocation parameters are investigated based on independent runs performed using different value sets of these parameters. It has been found that the suitable values for loudness adaptation parameter α lie in a range [0.95–0.99]. The larger this parameter, more slowly does the loudness decrease. Accordingly, by virtue of Eq. (23) local search is performed over wide regions even at late iterations. This may slow down convergence of the algorithm for relatively small and regular design spaces, yet it is very beneficial for large and irregular design spaces for which escaping from local optima is not easy. Hence, it is recommended that this parameter be set to 0.95 for small scale problems, yet it can be increased up to 0.99 for problems having a large and irregular fitness landscape. The results have also indicated that the optimal value for pulse rate adaptation parameter γ is 0.99 when the algorithm is executed over a maximum iteration number of 1000. This parameter can be set to a smaller value if lesser iterations are performed. But in no case it should be smaller than 0.95. Finally, we note that standard deviation parameter σ can be set to 2.0 for small to medium scale problems, and for larger scale problems it should be set to 3.0. This parameter has an impact similar to loudness adaptation parameter described above.
