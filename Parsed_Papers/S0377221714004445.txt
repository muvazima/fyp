                  Importance measures have been widely studied and applied in reliability and safety engineering. This paper presents a general formulation of moment-independent importance measures and several commonly discussed importance measures are unified based on Minkowski distance (MD). Moment-independent importance measures can be categorized into three classes of MD importance measures, i.e. probability density function based MD importance measure, cumulative distribution function based MD importance measure and quantile based MD importance measure. Some properties of the proposed MD importance measures are investigated. Several new importance measures are also derived as special cases of the generalized MD importance measures and illustrated with some case studies.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Importance measures are very useful in ranking components in complex systems, especially when further improvement decisions have to be made. It is closely related to sensitivity analysis (Castillo, Mínguez, & Castillo, 2008; Helton, Johnson, Sallaberry, & Storlie, 2006; Kleijnen, 2005; Kleijnen & Helton, 1999; Saltelli, Chan, & Scott, 2000; Xie, 1987; Xie & Bergman, 1992). With the information of the relative importance of the parameters, one can quickly identify the improvement for the system performance instead of directly searching for a global optimal solution (Borgonovo, 2010; Kuo & Zhu, 2012a). The importance measures in reliability analysis can be classified into structure importance measure, reliability importance measure and lifetime importance measure (Kuo & Zhu, 2012b). A variety of importance measures have been proposed for different systems and different purposes, such as the traditional Birnbaum measure (Birnbaum, 1968) and Barlow–Proschan measure (Barlow & Proschan, 1975; Eryilmaz, 2013), the joint importance of components (Gao, Cui, & Li, 2007; Hong, Koo, & Lie, 2002), the importance measures for multi-state systems (Levitin, Podofillini, & Zio, 2003; Si, Cai, Sun, & Zhang, 2010; Si, Dui, Zhao, Zhang, & Sun, 2012) as well as the more recently importance measures for Markovian systems (Do Van, Barros, & Bérenguer, 2008, 2009, 2010) or for semi-Markov systems (Distefano, Longo, & Trivedi, 2012; Hellmich & Berg, 2013). On the other hand, the importance measures can be considered as “local” or “global” from the viewpoint of sensitivity analysis. The global sensitivity analysis techniques, including non-parametric techniques (Storlie & Helton, 2008; Storlie, Reich, Helton, Swiler, & Sallaberry, 2013; Storlie, Swiler, Helton, & Sallaberry, 2009), variance-based techniques (Iman, 1987; Li, Lu, & Zhou, 2011; Sobol, 2001, 2003; Zhou, Lu, Li, Feng, & Wang, 2013) and moment-independent techniques (Borgonovo, 2007), provide an attractive perspective in identifying the influence of the inputs on the output.

The moment-independent importance measures, which consider the impact of a certain parameter on the distribution of the output and bear the merits of model-free and moment-independent, have been proposed recently and received considerable attention. Borgonovo (2007) introduced a probability density function (PDF)-based importance measure, whereas Liu and Homma (2010) proposed a similar importance measure but in terms of the cumulative distribution function (CDF). In order to carry out the sensitivity analysis of the parameter inside the distribution function, Cui, Lu, and Wang (2012) suggested a CDF-based importance measure utilizing 
                        
                           
                              
                                 L
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                      the distance between the original CDF and the conditional CDF instead of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 L
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      distance.

In fact, all these importance measures weigh the importance of the parameter in terms of the distance between the conditional distribution function and the original distribution function of the output, where the distance can be 
                        
                           
                              
                                 L
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      distance or 
                        
                           
                              
                                 L
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                      distance. So it is natural to extend the measure into a more general case by L
                     
                        p
                      distance, i.e. Minkowski distance. On the other hand, since the distribution of the output can be characterized by its PDF, CDF or quantile function, it is reasonable to define importance measures on any one of these functions. With these considerations, three classes of generalized Minkowski distance based (MD) importance measures, i.e. PDF-based MD importance measure, CDF-based MD importance measure and quantile-based MD importance measure are proposed. The generalized MD importance measures have considerable flexibility and the existing moment-independent importance measures can be seen as their special cases. The properties of the generalized MD importance measures are studied and some new and promising moment-independent importance measures are derived from the generalized MD importance measures.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, three unified MD importance measures are proposed. In Section 3, properties of the proposed MD importance measures are investigated. In Section 4, some new importance measures derived from the generalized MD importance measures are discussed and illustrated with case studies. Conclusions are given in the end.

Minkowski distance is derived from the well-known Minkowski inequality. In general, the Minkowski distance of order p could be defined as:

                           X

                           X
                        (·), and h(·) is a deterministic continuous scalar function. The uncertainty in 
                           X
                         transfers through function h(·), which results in that the model output Y is also a random variable. As mentioned, the moment-independent importance measures concentrate on the discrimination between the original distribution function and the conditional distribution function of the output, where the original distribution function is simply the distribution function of Y and the conditional distribution function is the distribution function of Y conditioned on that X
                        
                           i
                         is fixed to a certain value x
                        
                           i0, i.e. Y∣X
                        
                           i
                        
                        =

                           i0.

Minkowski distance can be used to measure the difference between the original distribution and the conditional distribution to generalize the existing moment-independent importance measures in a unified form. Since the distribution of the output can be characterized by its PDF, CDF or its quantile function, three classes of generalized MD importance measures are proposed based on different distribution functions.

The PDF of a random variable characterizes the relative likelihood for this random variable to take on a certain value. For a random input X

                         measures to what extent the difference would be. Since we do not know the true value of X
                        
                           i
                        , it is natural to use the expected distance to represent the shape change of the PDF due to X
                        
                           i
                        . So the PDF-based MD importance measure could be defined as follows.

One may wonder whether the similar proposition can be carried out for the PDF-based or CDF-based importance measures. Actually, it is not possible to simply extend the conclusion of Proposition 1 to the PDF-based importance measure or the CDF-based measure (the first case study in Section 4 can serve as a counterexample). However, for

The most commonly used cases of the Minkowski distance are these with the order set to 1, 2 and ∞, which are rectilinear distance, Euclid distance and Chebyshev distance, respectively. Therefore, it is intuitive to use the MD importance measures with order 1, 2 or ∞ for practical applications. The MD importance measures with p

Therefore, they can be applied when one concerns to what extent the difference between the original distribution function and the conditional distribution function can be.

From the second and the third columns of Table 1, it can be seen that X
                        2 is the most important parameter, X
                        1 is the second important parameter while X
                        3 is the least important one. On the other hand, according to

                              )
                           
                         we know that X
                        1 is the most important one. So MD importance measures with different orders can produce different parameters rankings and it should be careful when determining the most influential parameter. Though different rankings can be derived from different MD importance measures, combining these three measures, we can have a deeper insight about how each parameter affects the output if its uncertainty is removed.

                        3 is the least important parameter and requires least attention since all the three measures give the same ranking for it.

                        In the above expression, Y represents the occurrence frequency of the top event of the fault tree model. X
                        1 and X
                        2 are initial events and are expressed as the number of occurrences per year. X
                        3,…,
                        X
                        7 are basic events and are expressed as failure probabilities. All the seven inputs are independent from each other and follow lognormal distributions. The corresponding mean values and error factors are listed in Table 2
                        .

Similar to the Ishigami case, we use Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the importance measures of X

                        =1000 samples are generated by LHS technique to estimate the CDF or the quantile function by kernel density estimation. Different MD importance measures of each X
                        
                           i
                         are given in Tables 3 and 4
                        
                        . The rankings of the parameters are given in the parentheses.

As can be seen from Table 3, all the three CDF-based MD importance measures give the same importance ranking for the inputs. It is thus reasonable to believe that X
                        2 is the most important inputs while X
                        3 is the least important inputs.

                         and the corresponding rankings. The second column is identical to that of Table 3, since

                         are the same by definition. Inconsistent with the results of the other five importance measures, the importance rankings of X
                        5 and X
                        6 as well as the rankings of X
                        1 and X
                        7 are swapped according to

                              ∞
                              )
                           
                        . This is possible since the importance of X
                        5 and X
                        6 (X
                        1 and X
                        7) are fairly close to each other according to other five importance measures and different measures emphasize different aspects of the importance. Combining the results of these six importance measures, the ranking of the inputs should be: X
                        2
                        ≻
                        X
                        6
                        ≻
                        X
                        5
                        ≻
                        X
                        4
                        ≻
                        X
                        7
                        ≻
                        X
                        1
                        ≻
                        X
                        3.

In practice, people should choose a proper importance measure to accommodate the situation since different importance measures reflect different aspects of the influence on the output. Alternatively, people can calculate different MD importance measures and combine these results to achieve a balanced ranking. For instance, in this fault tree model, the CDF-based MD importance measures with order 1, 2 and infinity give the exactly the same ranking for the seven inputs, then we are convinced to believe that the ranking is reasonable.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper presented a general formulation of moment-independent importance measures used in system reliability analysis. It is noted that almost all the existing moment-independent importance measures are based on Minkowski distance (MD). We have thus generalized the definitions of the existing importance measures by Minkowski distance. Three classes of MD importance measures are proposed: PDF-based, CDF-based and quantile-based MD importance measure. Their properties are investigated and some new and promising moment-independent importance measures are further studied as special cases of the proposed MD importance measures.

The proposed importance measures reveal the significance of the input by the expected Minkowski distance between the original distribution function and the conditional distribution function of the output, which compress less information at the begin (the distribution function is apparently more informative than the variance, for instance). So it is more sensitive in identifying the important factors. Indeed, the variance-based measures sometimes are not able to identify the important input (Plischke, Borgonovo, & Smith, 2012). Additionally, the proposed measures have little restriction on the distribution of the inputs or the output (unlike some statistical test-based measures, e.g., measures in Section 6.6 in (Helton et al., 2006)), which indicates that the measures proposed in this paper are more applicable in real applications.

In practice, the joint effect resulting from the variable interaction might be of concern, and measures proposed in this paper can be readily extended to the multiple variable case. For instance, the joint PDF-based importance measure for 
                        
                           {

It is pointed out that MD importance measures with different order might lead to different rankings of parameters and suggestions for order selection are proposed. Specifically, it is suggested to combine MD importance measures with different orders to achieve a reasonable parameter ranking. On the other hand, further studies on the comparison between different MD importance measures should be carried out to give more detailed guidance on the selection of the proper importance measure.

In addition, efficient calculation of the MD importance measures is urged. Generally speaking, the computational effort required by the moment-independent importance measures consists in two aspects: running the model to obtain samples to estimate the distribution function and calculating the Minkowski distance between the original distribution function and the conditional distribution function. The latter involves numerical integration techniques and its computational intensity is often negligible compared with the former, especially when the model is associated with the long-running computer codes. Studies towards efficiently estimating the moment-independent importance measures have been carried out, and techniques therein can also be used to estimate the MD importance measures (Castaings, Borgonovo, Morris, & Tarantola, 2012; Plischke et al., 2012). How to further reduce the required model runs to estimate the MD importance measures would be our future study.
