                  In this paper, we propose a robust principal component analysis (PCA) to overcome the problem that PCA is prone to outliers included in the training set. Different from the other alternatives which commonly replace L
                     2-norm by other distance measures, the proposed method alleviates the negative effect of outliers using the characteristic of the generalized mean keeping the use of the Euclidean distance. The optimization problem based on the generalized mean is solved by a novel method. We also present a generalized sample mean, which is a generalization of the sample mean, to estimate a robust mean in the presence of outliers. The proposed method shows better or equivalent performance than the conventional PCAs in various problems such as face reconstruction, clustering, and object categorization.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Dimensionality reduction [1] is a classical problem in pattern recognition and machine learning societies, and numerous methods have been proposed to reduce the data dimensionality. Principal component analysis (PCA) [2] is one of the most popular unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods which tries to find a subspace where the average reconstruction error of the training data is minimized. It is useful in representation of input data in a low dimensional space and it has been successfully applied to face recognition [3,4], visual tracking [5], clustering [6,7], and so on.

When automatically collecting a large data set, outliers may be contained in the collected data since it is very difficult to examine whether each sample of data is outlier or not [8]. It is well known that, in this case, the conventional PCA is sensitive to outliers because it minimizes the reconstruction errors of training data in terms of the mean squared error and a few outliers with large errors dominate the objective function. This problem has been addressed in many studies [8–16]. Among them, some studies utilized L
                     1-norm instead of L
                     2-norm in the formulation of optimization problem to improve the robustness of PCA against outliers [9–11]. In [9], the cost function for optimization was constructed based on L
                     1-norm and a convex programming was employed to solve the problem. R
                     1-PCA [10] was presented to obtain a solution with the rotational invariance, which is a fundamental desirable property for learning algorithms [17]. In [11], PCA-L
                     1 was proposed, which maximizes an L
                     1 dispersion in the reduced space and an extension of PCA-L
                     1 using L
                     
                        p
                     -norm with arbitrary p was also proposed in [14]. Other method utilizing L
                     
                        p
                     -norm was also presented in [15]. On the other hand, some of robust PCAs were recently developed using information theoretic measures [12,13]. He et al. [12] proposed MaxEnt-PCA which finds a subspace where Renyi׳s quadratic entropy [18] is maximized. Renyi׳s entropy was estimated by a non-parametric Parzen window technique. In [13], HQ-PCA was developed based on the maximum correntropy criterion [19].

In this paper, we propose a new robust PCA method based on the power mean or the generalized mean [20], which can become the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means depending on the value of its parameter. The proposed method, PCA-GM, is a generalization of the conventional PCA by replacing the arithmetic mean with the generalized mean. The proposed method can effectively prevent outliers from dominating objective function by controlling the parameter in the generalized mean. Moreover, it is rotational invariant because it still uses the Euclidean distance as the distance measure between data samples. In doing so, we also propose a generalized sample mean, which is an enhancement of the conventional algebraic sample mean against outliers to address the problem that the sample mean is easily affected by outliers. It is used in the proposed PCA-GM instead of the arithmetic mean. The optimization problems based on the generalized mean are efficiently solved using a mathematical property of the generalized mean. Recently, Candés et al. proposed a robust PCA [21], which is sometimes referred to as RPCA in the literature, where data matrix is tried to be represented as a sum of a low rank matrix, which corresponds to reconstructions of data, and a sparse matrix, which corresponds to reconstruction errors different from the methods mentioned above. It can model pixel-wise noise effectively using the sparse matrix, thus it has been known that RPCA is useful in the applications such as background modeling from surveillance video and removing shadows and specularities from face images [21] by using each element in the reconstruction error vector (the column of the sparse matrix). On the other hand, in this paper, we will utilize distance metric in removing the effect of outliers like the previously mentioned methods, and an entire sample is considered as an outlier if it has a large norm of the reconstruction error vector.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces PCA and the state-of-the-art robust PCAs. The proposed method is described in Section 3. It is demonstrated in Section 4 that the proposed method gives better performances in face reconstruction and clustering problems than other variants of PCA. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.

On the other hand, PCA-L
                     1 was developed in [11] motivated by the duality between maximizing variance and minimizing reconstruction error. It maximizes an L
                     1 dispersion among the projected samples,

                     . A novel and efficient method for maximizing the L
                     1 dispersion was also presented in [11]. The method allows PCA-L
                     1 to be performed by much less computational effort than R
                     1-PCA.

HQ-PCA is formulated based on the maximum correntropy criterion in terms of information theoretic learning. Without the zero-mean assumption, which is necessary in other variants of PCA, HQ-PCA maximizes the correntropy estimated between a set of training samples

                        The arithmetic mean, the geometric mean, and the harmonic mean are special cases of the generalized mean when 
                           p
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           p
                           →
                           0
                        , and 
                           p
                           =
                           −
                           1
                        , respectively. Furthermore, the maximum and the minimum values of the numbers can also be obtained from the generalized mean by making 
                           p
                           →
                           ∞
                         and 
                           p
                           →
                           −
                           ∞
                        , respectively. Note that as p decreases (increases), the generalized mean is more affected by the smaller (larger) numbers than the larger (smaller) ones, i.e., controlling p makes it possible to adjust the contribution of each number to the generalized mean. This characteristic is useful in the situation where data samples should be differently handled according to their importance, for example, when outliers are contained in the training set.

In [24], it was shown that the generalized mean of a set of positive numbers can be expressed by a nonnegative linear combination of the elements in the set and, in this paper, it is further simplified as follows:

                        In (5), a small number of outliers in the training samples dominate the objective function because the objective function in (5) is constructed based on the squared distances. To obtain a robust sample mean in the presence of outliers, a new optimization problem is formulated by replacing the arithmetic mean in (5) with the generalized mean as

                        , they usually have slow convergence speed. Alternatively, we develop a novel method based on (4), which is more efficient than gradient-based iterative methods. Our method for solving the problem in (6) is an iterative one, similar to the expectation–maximization algorithm [25].

In the derivation, we decompose (6) into the form of (4) and consider the weight b
                        
                           i
                         in (4) as a constant. Then, (6) can be approximated by a quadratic function of

                         shows the arithmetic sample mean and the two generalized sample means together with the generated samples. It is obvious that the generalized sample means are located close to the mean of the inliers,

To help understanding of Algorithm 2, we made another toy example as shown in Fig. 2
                        (a) where 110 two dimensional samples are plotted. Among the samples, 100 samples are regarded as inliers and the others are regarded as outliers. The samples were generated as the following rule:

                         for the samples as shown in Fig. 2(a). We can see from Fig. 2(b) that the conventional PCA is prone to the ten outliers because its objective function is minimized around

To evaluate the proposed method, we considered face reconstruction, digit clustering, and object categorization problems, the first two of which were addressed in [11,13], respectively. The proposed method was compared with PCA, PCA-L
                     1, R
                     1-PCA, and HQ-PCA. Except for the conventional PCA, they have the parameters to be predetermined and we determined the values of the parameters according to the recommendations in [10,11,13]. Also, in PCA-GM, the generalized sample mean was used instead of the sample mean, and the perturbation parameter δ in (13) was set to 0.01 times the minimum of

We collected 800 facial images from the subset ‘fa’ of the Color FERET database [27] for the face reconstruction problem. Each face image was normalized to a size of

                           ×
                           50
                         pixels using the eye coordinates, which were obtained in the database. We simulated two types of outliers. For the first type of outliers, some of the facial images were randomly selected, and each of the selected images was occluded by a rectangular area, each pixel in which was randomly set to 0 (black) or 255 (white). The size and location of the rectangular area were randomly determined. Fig. 3
                         shows examples of original normalized faces in the upper row and their corresponding faces occluded by the rectangular noise in the lower row. To evaluate the proposed method with different noise levels, we selected 80, 160, and 240 images from the 800 facial images and occluded them by rectangular noise, so that we made three training sets including 80, 160, and 240 occluded images. For the second type of outliers, other three training sets were constructed by adding 80, 160, and 240 dummy images (outlier) with the same size to the original 800 face images (inlier), so that the numbers of inliers and outliers in the three training sets are (800,80), (800,160), and (800,240) respectively. Each pixel in the dummy images was also randomly set to 0 or 255.

After applying different versions of PCAs to the training sets with the various numbers of extracted features m from 5 to 100, we compared the average reconstruction errors as in [11] defined as

                         were identical. Note that 
                           W
                         is the projection matrix obtained from PCA, PCA-L
                        1, R
                        1-PCA, HQ-PCA, and PCA-GM for the various values of m. Moreover, PCA-GM was performed using 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 for the value of p to figure out the effect of it.


                        Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                         show the average reconstruction errors measured as in (14) for the training sets constructed to simulate two types of outliers when 
                           5
                           ≤
                           m
                           ≤
                           100
                        . As shown in the figures, PCA-GM and HQ-PCA generally gave better performances than PCA, PCA-L
                        1, and R
                        1-PCA regardless of the types of outliers and the level of noise, and they yielded competitive results to each other. When the number of the occluded images is 240, which corresponds to Fig. 4(c), HQ-PCA provided lower average reconstruction errors than PCA-GM for 
                           m
                           ≤
                         40 while PCA-GM with 
                           p
                           =
                           0.1
                         and 
                           p
                           =
                           0.2
                         gave better performances than HQ-PCA for 
                           m
                           ≥
                         60. When the number of the dummy images is 80, which corresponds to Fig. 5(a), the lower reconstruction errors could be obtained by PCA-GM rather than HQ-PCA when 
                           m
                           ≤
                         60 while HQ-PCA preformed better than PCA-GM for 80 
                           ≤
                           m
                           <
                         100.

The effectiveness of the proposed method can also be found by visualizing projection matrices in terms of the Eigenfaces 
                        [3]. Fig. 6
                         shows the first ten of Eigenfaces obtained by different PCA methods when 
                           m
                           =
                           40
                         and the number of outliers is 240 for both types of outliers. We can see that the Eigenfaces of HQ-PCA and PCA-GM are less contaminated from the outliers than PCA, PCA-L
                        1, and R
                        1-PCA. Also, it can be seen from the figure that PCA-L
                        1 yielded projection matrix with a different property. This may be a reason of the fact that PCA-L
                        1 provided relatively large reconstruction errors when m is small as shown in Figs. 4 and 5(c).

The effect of p in PCA-GM was as expected. For the occlusion noise as shown in Fig. 4, the lower values of p gave better performances and the performance differences are more distinct as m and noise level increase. For the dummy images as shown in Fig. 5, PCA-GM showed almost similar performances for all the values of p except for 0.4 when 
                           m
                           ≥
                         70. These results agree with the fact that the generalized mean of a set of positive numbers depends on small numbers more and more as p gets smaller.

The clustering problem was dealt with using a subset of the MNIST handwritten digit database,
                           2
                        
                        
                           2
                           
                              http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
                           
                         which includes a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. We randomly gathered 100 examples per the digits ‘3’, ‘8’, and ‘9’ from the first 10,000 examples in the training set. To simulate outliers, we also randomly gathered 60 examples corresponding to the other digits from the same 10,000 examples. Thus, our training set for the clustering problem consists of 300 inliers and 60 outliers, which were normalized to unit norm. Fig. 7
                         shows nine images of the inliers in the upper row and nine images of the outliers in the lower row.

After obtaining projection matrices by applying various versions of PCAs to the training set, K-means clustering with 
                           K
                           =
                           3
                         was performed using the projected inlier examples. For the initial means of the K-means clustering, we selected the two examples with the largest distance and then selected another example which had the largest sum of the distances from the previously selected two examples. The clustering accuracy was computed based on the class labels assigned to the examples in the database. Table 1
                         shows the clustering accuracy for various numbers of extracted features. As the previous experiments, we conducted PCA-GM using the settings of 
                           p
                           ∈
                           {
                           0.1
                           ,
                           0.2
                           ,
                           0.3
                           ,
                           0.4
                           }
                        . The best performance was achieved when p=0.3 which is reported in Table 1. Considering the clustering accuracy without the dimensionality reduction was 70%, PCA-GM improved the clustering accuracy by 5%. Different from the results of the face reconstruction problem in the previous subsection, R
                        1-PCA and PCA-L
                        1 gave similar highest clustering accuracy as PCA-GM, while HQ-PCA performed poorly than PCA-GM. However, R
                        1-PCA and PCA-L
                        1 provided the highest accuracy when 
                           m
                           =
                           300
                         whereas PCA-GM yielded the best performance when 
                           m
                           =
                           200
                        .

We evaluated the proposed method by performing object categorization on Small NORB data set [28]. The NORB data set consists of images of 50 different objects belonging to 5 categories each of which contains 10 objects. For each category, the images of 5 objects shown in Fig. 8
                        (a) belong to its training set and those of 5 objects shown in Fig. 8(b) belong to its test set. The Small NORB data set is a subset of the NORB data set comprising 24,300 images for training and 24,300 images for testing, which are normalized with the size of 96 
                           ×
                         96 pixels on uniform background. Each object in the data set was captured under 18 azimuths, 9 elevations, and 6 light conditions. To evaluate the proposed method for different numbers of training samples, we uniformly sampled the three image capture variables to construct three training sets with 3375, 12,150, and 24,300 samples. We also resized the images in the data set to 48 
                           ×
                         48 and 64 
                           ×
                         64 pixels for computational efficiency. Consequently, we have six training sets with different number of samples (N) and dimensionality of input samples (n).

Although there are various approaches to categorize an arbitrary sample 
                           z
                         corresponding to an image of an object, we performed the categorization by the nearest-to-subspace, i.e., 
                           z
                         is determined to belong to the category minimizing the distance from 
                           z
                         to the subspace spanned by the training samples in the category. For the distance from 
                           z
                         to the subspace of the i-th category, we employed the squared residual error of 
                           z
                         to the subspace computed as

                         in HQ-PCA and PCA-GM, respectively. For the purpose of comparison, the categorization accuracy was evaluated varying the dimensionality of subspaces (m) from 5 to 50.


                        Fig. 9
                         shows the categorization accuracy measured on the 24,300 test images in Small NORB data set. It is necessary to note that artificial outliers were not used in this experiments different from the previous ones. We can see that PCA-GM with an appropriate value of p is competitive with the conventional PCA when N=3375 and the proposed method provides higher categorization accuracies than PCA as N increases. Especially when 
                           N
                           =
                           24
                           ,
                           300
                           ,
                         the proposed method achieves the best performance for all the cases of m. This trend appears in both cases of 
                           n
                           =
                           48
                           ×
                           48
                         and 
                           n
                           =
                           64
                           ×
                           64
                        . However, the other variants of PCA did not gave higher accuracies than the conventional PCA for most cases. In particular, HQ-PCA, which showed competitive performance in the face reconstruction experiments, resulted in the lowest categorization accuracy. This means that the proposed method can be an effective alternative to PCA in object categorization using the nearest-to-subspace when training data is enough.

Together with the categorization accuracy, we measured number of iterations in PCA-GM and running time of the proposed method to obtain projection matrices from the above six training sets of the Small NORM data set. Table 2
                         shows the average numbers of iterations performed in the proposed method. From this table, we can find that PCA-GM converges in less than 50 iterations on average. Also, the average number of iterations decreases as the value of p increases from 0.1 to 0.9. This may have been resulted from the fact that the objective function of PCA-GM has many fluctuations when the value of p is close to zero whereas it is similar to one of the conventional PCA, which is quadratic, when the value of p is close to one. The overall running time of the proposed method described in Algorithm 2 varies depending on the number of iterations needed until a stop criterion is satisfied. Thus, we divided the overall running times by the average numbers of iterations performed in computing five projection matrices with respect to five categories for every combination of m, n, and N, which are summarized in Table 3
                         in the setting of 
                           p
                           =
                           0.1
                           .
                         From the other values of p, we could see the similar tendencies. The running times were measured on a 3.4GHz Intel Xeon workstation with 12 cores using MATLAB. Each iteration in the algorithm consists of two processes, the approximation and the minimization. Compared to the approximation, the minimization requires much more computations. It corresponds to the weighted eigenvalue decomposition, which was implemented by applying the singular value decomposition (SVD) to the weighted data matrix instead of computing the weighted covariance matrix and applying the eigenvalue decomposition to it for efficiency. Thus, the running times reported in Table 3 can be regarded as the running time of the SVD approximately. Considering the average numbers of iterations shown in Table 2, it can be said that the proposed method is feasible enough until 
                           N
                           =
                           25
                           ,
                           000
                         and 
                           n
                           =
                           5000
                         roughly.

We proposed a robust PCA using the generalized mean to mitigate the negative effect of outliers belonging to the training set. Considering the fact that the sample mean is prone to the outliers, a generalized sample mean was proposed based on the generalized mean as an alternative to the sample mean in the framework of the proposed method. The efficient iterative methods were also developed to solve the optimization problems formulated using the generalized mean. Experiments on the face reconstruction, clustering, and object categorization problems demonstrated that the proposed method performs better than or equal to the other robust PCAs depending on the problems tackled. We expect that the proposed methods can be used in various applications. For example, a trimmed average, which is one of the robust first-order statistics, was used in a scalable robust PCA method [29]. We think that the generalized sample mean can be an effective alternative to the trimmed average.
