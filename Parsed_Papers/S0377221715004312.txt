                  In this paper we propose an inexact proximal point method to solve constrained minimization problems with locally Lipschitz quasiconvex objective functions. Assuming that the function is also bounded from below, lower semicontinuous and using proximal distances, we show that the sequence generated for the method converges to a stationary point of the problem.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is well known that the class of proximal point algorithm (PPA) is one of the most studied methods for finding zeros of maximal monotone operators and in particular to solve convex optimization problems, see Auslender and Teboulle (2006), Burachik and Iusem (1998), Burachik and Scheimberg (2000), Chen and Teboulle (1993), Kiwiel (1997), Rockafellar (1976).

In the last decades a great interest has emerged to extend the PPA for non monotone variational inequalities and non convex minimization problems not only for extending the convergence theory but by several applications in diverse science and engineering areas, see for example the works of Attouch and Bolte (2009); Attouch, Bolte, and Svaiter (2013); Kaplan and Tichatschke (1998); Pennanen (2002); Chen and Pan (2008).

In particular the class of quasiconvex minimization problems has been receiving attention from many research works due to the broad range of applications in location theory, Gromicho (1998), Fractional programming and specially in economic theory, see for example Takayama (1995) and Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995). Some related papers are the following: Goudou and Munier (2009), Souza, Oliveira, da Cruz Neto, and Soubeyran (2010), Chen and Pan (2008), Cunha, da Cruz Neto, and Oliveira, (2010), Pan and Chen (2007), Papa Quiroz and Oliveira (2012), Langenberg and Tichatschke (2012), Brito, da Cruz Neto, Lopez, and Oliveira (2012).

In this paper we are interested in extending the global convergence of an inexact proximal point method to minimize a quasiconvex function constrained on a nonempty closed convex set, that is,

                      the proximal parameter is bounded and assuming that f is differentiable, these research works obtained the global convergence of the method to a KKT point of (1.1). Furthermore, the sequence generated converges to a solution of the problem, should it exist, if the proximal parameters approach to zero.


                     Brito et al. (2012), proposed an interior proximal algorithm inspired by the logarithmic-quadratic proximal method for linearly constrained quasiconvex minimization problems. For that method, they proved the global convergence when the proximal parameters go to zero. The latter assumption could be dropped when the function is assumed to be pseudoconvex.


                     Langenberg and Tichatschke (2012), motivated from the work of Kaplan and Tichatschke (1998), studied the iteration (1.2) when C is an arbitrary open convex set and d is a Bregman distance. Assuming that f is locally Lipschitz and using the Clarke subdifferential, the authors proved the global convergence of the method to a critical point of (1.1).

The above works although important have some disadvantages:

                        
                           •
                           The main difficulty in extending the proximal method for nonconvex function, which was observed by Kaplan and Tichatschke (1998) and Langenberg and Tichatschke (2012), is that due to the nonconvexity of f the subproblems of (1.2) may not be convex and thus, from a practical point of view, we may obtain that minimization subproblems may be as hard to solve globally as the original one due to the existence of multiple isolated local minimizers. These authors have proved, under some appropriate conditions and chose a sufficiently large regularization parameters, the strong convexity of the proximal subproblems (and thus efficiently solvable subproblems) for a class of non convex functions, see Theorem 2 and Theorem 5 of Kaplan and Tichatschke (1998) and Langenberg and Tichatschke (2012) respectively. However, the above property is not true in general for arbitrary quasiconvex functions. So, we believe that a basic idea is to weaken the condition of minimizing a strongly convex regularization function by another one such that in each iteration we may use local information of the subproblems. If the regularized function is, for example, locally strongly convex we will have, in certain sense, efficiency in solving the subproblems. This motivates the following question: Is it possible to introduce a local stationary iteration that makes much more sense that the previously considered (1.2) for dealing with nonconvex problems?

In Rockafellar (1976) it is shown that in some cases let the proximal parameter converges to zero, although the regularizing effect vanishes, provides superlinear convergence of the algorithm in the convex case. Motivated by this fact, Brito et al. (2012), Souza et al. (2010), Cunha et al. (2010), Chen and Pan (2008) and Pan and Chen (2007) have been proved the convergence of the proximal method to an optimal point when the parameters converges to zero. On the other hand, when the proximal parameters are sufficiently greater than zero but bounded from above, Langenberg and Tichatschke (2012), see Theorem 9 of that work, proved the convergence to a stationary point which may be in the worst case a saddle point (observe that stationary point or critical point point does not necessarily a global nor local minimum point). This motivates the following question: is it possible to obtain a convergence theory to an optimal point when the proximal parameters are bounded from above?

Despite the fact that the proximal point method is not practical in its exact version, several works, for the convex case, have been shown that it is possible to obtain implementable algorithms with good convergence properties, see for example Alvarez, López, and Ramírez (2010), Liu, Sung, and Toh (2012), Santos and RC (2014). In our case, for a computational implementation of the proximal point algorithm for the quasiconvex case it is needed to solve the iteration (1.2) using a local optimization algorithm, which only provides an approximate solution. Thus it is important to consider inexact methods. Therefore, from the computational point of view, is it possible to introduce a inexact proximal method to solve (1.2) and prove the convergence of the iteration?

In this paper, motivated by a recently work of Papa Quiroz and Oliveira (2012), we answer the questions of the first and third bullet points and partially we answer the question of the second bullet one, see Subsection 4.3, proposing the following proximal method: given

                      we obtain the exact version studied by Papa Quiroz and Oliveira (2012) for the nonnegative orthant.

Observe also that the conditions (1.3)-(1.4) are more practical than (1.2), where a global minimum point is required in each iteration, and thus more practical than the works of Souza et al. (2010), Cunha et al. (2010), Chen and Pan (2008), Pan and Chen (2007) and Langenberg and Tichatschke (2012). Therefore in our opinion the local stationary iterations (1.3)–(1.4) makes much more sense than the previously considered (1.2) for dealing with nonconvex problems.

                     we obtain that the sequence {xk
                     } converges to a stationary point of the problem. Observe that the above conditions (1.5)–(1.6) have been used in convex proximal methods, see for example Auslender, Teboulle, and Ben-Tiba (1999), Kaplan and Tichatschke (2004), Eckstein (1998), Xu, Bingsheng, and Xiaoming (2006), Solodov and Svaiter (2000). We also get to rid the assumption (1.6) for a class of induced proximal distances which includes Bregman distances given by the standard entropy kernel and all strongly convex Bregman functions.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we give some basic results on quasiconvex theory and Clarke subdifferential of locally Lipschitz functions. In Section 3 we introduce the class of proximal distances that we will use along the paper. In Section 4 we present the inexact algorithm for solving minimization problems with quasiconvex functions and analyze its convergence properties. Finally, in Section 5 we give our conclusions.

                        In the classical approach to consumer demand, the analysis of consumer behavior begins specifying the consumer’s preference ≽(an “at-least-as-good-as” binary relation) over the commodity bundles in the consumption set

A function μ: X → IR is said to be an utility function representing a preference relation ≽ on X if the following condition is satisfied

                           Fortunately, a very general class of preference relations can be represented by utility functions, see for example Proposition 3.C.1 of Mas-Colell et al. (1995).

If a preference relation ≽ is represented by an utility function μ, then the problem of maximizer the preference of the consumer on X is equivalent to solve the optimization problem

                           On the other hand, a natural psychological assumption in economy is that the consumer tends to diversify his consumption among all goods, that is, the preference ≽ satisfies the following convexity property: X is convex and if x≽z and y≽z then

                            It can be proved that the if there exists an utility function representing the preference, then the convexity property of ≽ is equivalent to the quasiconcavity of the utility function μ. Thus, (P) becomes in a maximization problem with quasiconcave objective function. Taking

The above remark provides a class of non convex functions, in particular the class of functions f which ∂°f is locally Lipschitz, see Lemma 3.2, with regularized locally strongly convex functions. Thus, we expect local algorithms to perform efficiently enough to find good approximate solutions at reasonable time. For example, if this regularized function is locally self-concordant, see Nesterov and Nemirovskii (1994), we can use for computing the point xk
                         satisfying (4.12) the damped Newton method which is commonly recognized as a standard approach particularly efficient in such cases. When the objective function f is nonsmooth we can work with the so called bundle methods.

In this section, under some natural conditions, we prove the convergence of the proposed method. We begin imposing the following assumptions: Assumption 
                        A. f is a proper lower semicontinuous quasiconvex function. Assumption 
                        B. f is locally lipschitzian and bounded from below Assumption

It is possible to get rid the assumption (4.18) in Proposition 4.3 for a class of induced proximal distances which includes Bregman distances given by the standard entropy kernel and all strongly convex Bregman functions, see Kaplan and Tichatschke (2004). Of fact, suppose that the induced proximal distance H with

                              } is bounded, without the assumption (4.18).

Finally, we give the global convergence of {xk
                        } to a stationary point of the problem. We should note that result is an easy adaptation to proximal distances of Theorem 9 of Langenberg and Tichatschke (2012).

                         which may be in the worst case a saddle point. In this subsection we give some conditions to guarantee the convergence of the above sequence to a global minimum point. Consider the following minimization problem:

                           The main motivation of the paper was to extend the global convergence properties of an inexact proximal point method from the convex case to the quasiconvex one. However, when f is not convex and considering the errors criterion from the literature it was difficult, at least for us, to obtain the claim. So we introduce the following criterion, which is new even for the convex case,

                              It might be possible to get rid the condition (5.24) for a class of induced proximal distance following the paper of Kaplan and Tichatschke (2004) who presented an analysis how to get rid the assumption (5.24) for a class of Bregman functions which includes the standard entropy kernel and all strongly convex Bregman functions. They showed also the convergence of the proximal point method with the logarithmic-quadratic distance, obtained by Auslender, Teboulle, and Ben-Tiba (1999b), as also of a particular entropy-like distance without the condition (5.24) but using strongly the monotonicity (convexity for the minimization case) of the operator. For the quasiconvex case, we can see that the extension is not immediate and requires further analysis, so we may consider this research as a future work.

Another future research is to substitute the criterion (4.11), (4.17) and (4.18) by another one. A possibility may be to introduce a relative error condition what when

If the objective function of (4.9) is proper, lower semicontinuous and quasiconvex function but it is not locally Lipschitz, we can introduce the following method, which we call (IPPM)’: Initialization: Let a sequence of real positive numbers {βk
                              } and an initial point

It can be observed that both (IPPM) and (IPPM)’ use another subdifferential and, furthermore, they does not satisfy the condition (36) from Algorithm 2 of Attouch et al. (2013).

                               A class of these functions are the functions f such that ∇f(.) are (locally) Lipschitz. For the local case, a critical point is that in each iteration of the (IPPM) algorithm is need to known a local Lipschitz constant defined on some ball which is a hard problem. Another critical point is when local just means a small region, in this case our method only make very small slow progress. To overcome these difficulties we propose the following methodology: for simplicity suppose that f ∈ C

                               for each k. This idea has not been yet studied in the literature and it is a motivation to develop it in a future research.

Other future works may be the extension of this method to solve multiobjective quasiconvex minimization problems as also to solve quasiconvex vector optimization problems.

In modern optimization, proximal algorithms are important as a basic block for structured optimization. They can handle the non-smooth part of the objective function or constraints, see for example the forward-backward algorithm, alternating proximal minimization algorithms. In this perspective it would be interesting to study these algorithms in the quasiconvex case.
