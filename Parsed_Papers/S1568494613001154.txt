                  This paper proposes a new direction for design optimization of a water distribution network (WDN). The new approach introduces an optimization process to the conceptual design stage of a WDN. The use of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) for simultaneous topology and sizing design of piping networks is presented. The design problem includes both topological and sizing design variables while the objective functions are network cost and total head loss in pipes. The numerical technique, called a network repairing technique (NRT), is proposed to overcome difficulties in operating MOEAs for network topological design. The problem is then solved by using a number of established and newly developed MOEAs. Also, two new MOEAs namely multiobjective real code population-based incremental learning (RPBIL) and a hybrid algorithm of RPBIL with differential evolution (termed RPBIL–DE) are proposed to tackle the design problems. The optimum results obtained are illustrated and compared. It is shown that the proposed network repairing technique is an efficient and effective tool for topological design of WDNs. Based on the hypervolume indicator, the proposed RPBIL–DE is among the best MOEA performers.
