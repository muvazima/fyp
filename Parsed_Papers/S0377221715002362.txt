                  It is well established that multiple reference sets may occur for a decision making unit (DMU) in the non-radial DEA (data envelopment analysis) setting. As our first contribution, we differentiate between three types of reference set. First, we introduce the notion of unary reference set (URS) corresponding to a given projection of an evaluated DMU. The URS includes efficient DMUs that are active in a specific convex combination producing the projection. Because of the occurrence of multiple URSs, we introduce the notion of maximal reference set (MRS) and define it as the union of all the URSs associated with the given projection. Since multiple projections may occur in non-radial DEA models, we further define the union of the MRSs associated with all the projections as unique global reference set (GRS) of the evaluated DMU. As the second contribution, we propose and substantiate a general linear programming (LP) based approach to identify the GRS. Since our approach makes the identification through the execution of a single primal-based LP model, it is computationally more efficient than the existing methods for its easy implementation in practical applications. Our last contribution is to measure returns to scale using a non-radial DEA model. This method effectively deals with the occurrence of multiple supporting hyperplanes arising either from multiplicity of projections or from non-full dimensionality of minimum face. Finally, an empirical analysis is conducted based on a real-life data set to demonstrate the ready applicability of our approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Data envelopment analysis (DEA), introduced by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978, 1979) based on the seminal work of Farrell (1957), is a linear programming (LP) based method for measuring the relative efficiency of a homogeneous group of decision making units (DMUs) with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Based on observed data and a set of postulates, DEA defines a reference technology set relative to which a DMU can be rated as efficient or inefficient. For an inefficient DMU, DEA recognizes a unique or multiple projection(s) on the efficient frontier of the technology set. Associated with each projection, it also identifies a set of observed efficient DMUs against which the DMU under evaluation is directly compared. Those efficient DMUs are called reference DMUs, and the corresponding set is referred to as a reference set.

The identification of all the possible reference DMUs for an inefficient unit is an important and interesting problem in DEA, on which we concentrate in this contribution by means of the non-radial range-adjusted model (RAM) of Cooper, Park, and Pastor (1999). This issue has received significant attention in the literature due to its wide range of potential applications in ranking (Jahanshahloo, Junior, Hosseinzadeh Lotfi, & Akbarian, 2007), benchmarking and target setting (Bergendahl, 1998; Camanho & Dyson, 1999), and measuring returns to scale (RTS) (Cooper, Seiford, & Tone, 2007; Krivonozhko, Førsund, & Lychev, 2014; Sueyoshi & Sekitani, 2007a; 2007b; Tone, 1996, 2005; Tone & Sahoo, 2006).

From a managerial point of view, the identification of all the reference DMUs is specifically important for two reasons. First, to improve the performance of an inefficient DMU, it may not be logical in practice to introduce an unobserved (virtual) projection as a benchmark. In such a situation, however, the identification provides the possibility to derive practical guidelines from benchmarking against the reference DMUs. Second, when some (but not all) reference DMUs are identified for an evaluated unit, the decision maker may be of the opinion that the identified DMUs are not appropriate benchmarks and may wish to have more options in choosing targets. In such a case, the identification allows him/her to incorporate the preference information into analysis so as to yield a projection with the most preferred (i) closeness (Tone, 2010), (ii) values of inputs and outputs, and (iii) shares of reference units in its formation.

The pioneer attempt to find all the reference DMUs in non-radial DEA models was made by Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2007b). Based on strong complementary slackness conditions (SCSCs) of linear programming, they proposed a primal–dual based method using the RAM model. The proposed method in their impressive study is very interesting as a theoretical idea. However, as Krivonozhko, Førsund, and Lychev (2012b) have argued, not only the computational burden of Sueyoshi and Sekitani's (2007b) approach is high, but it also seems that the basic matrices defined in their approach are likely to be ill-conditioned, leading to erroneous and unacceptable results even for medium-size problems. Furthermore, the economic interpretation of some constraints of their proposed model does not make sense. In a more recent and conscious attempt to overcome these difficulties, Krivonozhko et al. (2014) have proposed a primal–dual based procedure based on solving several LP problems. Using computational experiments, they showed that their proposed method works reliably and efficiently on real-life data sets and outperforms Sueyoshi and Sekitani's (2007b) approach.

It is worth noting that the studies conducted by Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2007a, 2007b) and Krivonozhko et al. (2014) correctly found all the observed DMUs on minimum face – a face of minimum dimension on which all the projections are located – as a unique reference set of a given DMU. On the other hand, both of these studies pointed out that the occurrence of multiple reference sets was possible. However, neither of them explicitly made a clear distinction between the uniquely-found reference set and other types of reference set for which multipleness may occur. This lack of discrimination creates an ambiguity about the uniqueness and, consequently, about the mathematical well-definedness of the definition of reference set.

Therefore, we were motivated to eliminate this ambiguity effectively. To do so, we have proposed three types of reference set sequentially, as our first contribution. Corresponding to a given projection, we first introduce the notion of unary reference set (URS) including efficient DMUs that are active in a specific convex combination producing this projection. Since multiple URSs (hereafter referred to as problem Type I) may occur, we introduce the notion of maximal reference set (MRS) and define it as the union of all the URSs associated with the given projection. Since multiple projections may occur in the RAM model, we further define the union of the MRSs associated with all the projections as unique global reference set (GRS) of the evaluated DMU. We have had an interesting finding: the convex hull of the GRS is equal to the minimum face. The benefits of the introduced three types of reference set (i.e., URS, MRS and GRS) are outlined below.

                        
                           •
                           The introduced concepts are all mathematically well-defined.

The URS and MRS help demonstrate the occurrence of multiple reference sets associated with a single and multiple projection(s), respectively.

While the multipleness may occur for the URS and MRS, the GRS presents a unique reference set that contains all the possible reference DMUs.

As our second contribution, we have proposed an LP model that identifies the GRS, and provides a projection in the relative interior of the minimum face. The proposed approach has several important features. First, it can effectively deal with the simultaneous occurrence of problems Types I and II. Second, this approach involves solving a single LP problem, which makes this approach computationally more efficient than the existing ones for its easy implementation in practical applications. Third, the computational efficiency of our approach is higher than that of the previous primal–dual ones, since it is developed based on the primal (envelopment) form that is computationally more efficient than the dual (multiplier) form (Cooper et al., 2007). Fourth, since our proposed LP problem contains several upper-bounded variables, its computational efficiency can be enhanced by using the simplex algorithm adopted for solving the LP problems with upper-bounded variables, which is much more efficient than the ordinary simplex algorithm (Winston, 2003).

Fifth, our proposed approach is more general in the sense that it can be readily used without any change in both the ‘additive model’ (Charnes, Cooper, Golany, Seiford, & Stutz, 1985) and the ‘BAM model’ (Cooper, Pastor, Borras, Aparicio, & Pastor, 2011; Pastor, 1994; Pastor & Ruiz, 2007), because the difference between each of these two models and the RAM model lies only in the weights assigned to the input and output slacks in the objective function. With some minor changes, it can also be used in the ‘RAM/BCC model’ (Aida, Cooper, Pastor, & Sueyoshi, 1998), the ‘DSBM model’ of Jahanshahloo, Hosseinzadeh Lotfi, Mehdiloozad, and Roshdi (2012) and the ‘GMDDF model’ of Mehdiloozad, Sahoo, and Roshdi (2014). Furthermore, it can be easily implemented in any radial DEA model like the ‘BCC model’ of Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (1984), but with some minor changes. Finally, our proposed approach is free from the restricting assumption that the input–output data must be non-negative, so it can effectively deal with negative data. This can be very beneficial from a practical point of view since in many applications negative inputs or outputs could appear. See Pastor and Ruiz (2007) for various examples of applications with negative data.

The third contribution of this study is to measure the RTS in the non-radial DEA setting. As it is known, the concept of RTS is meaningful only when the relevant DMU lies on the frontier of the technology set. Hence, for an inefficient DMU, an efficient projection must be considered. In this case, the type and magnitude of the RTS is determined through the position(s) of the hyperplane(s) supporting the technology set at the projection used. The supporting hyperplane(s) passes/pass through the MRS associated with this projection and can be mathematically characterized via this MRS. Therefore, problem Type II causes the occurrence of multiple supporting hyperplanes (hereafter referred to as problem Type III), which makes the measurement of RTS difficult. Such a difficulty can be properly dealt with by using a relative interior point of the minimum face for the measurement of RTS. This is because the supporting hyperplane(s) binding at this point is/are characterized through the GRS, but not through a specific MRS. Nonetheless, the uniqueness of the characterized supporting hyperplane(s) cannot yet be guaranteed because the minimum face may not be a ‘Full Dimensional Efficient Facet’ (Olesen & Petersen, 1996, 2003).

To sum up, the difficulty raised by problem Type III in the measurement of RTS originates either from problem Type II or from the non-full dimensionality of the minimum face. To deal with this difficulty, we have developed a two-stage procedure for the measurement of RTS by exploiting the intensive study of Krivonozhko et al. (2014). In the first stage, we cope with the difficulty arising from problem Type II by finding a relative interior point of the minimum face via the LP problem proposed to identify the GRS. Then, for the obtained point,
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Note that this point does not influence the RTS, since all the relative interior points of the minimum face have the same RTS (Krivonozhko, Førsund, & Lychev, 2012c).
                      we use the indirect method of Banker, Cooper, Seiford, Thrall, and Zhu (2004) or the direct method of Førsund, Hjalmarsson, Krivonozhko, and Utkin (2007) to resolve the difficulty resulted from the non-full dimensionality of the minimum face. To demonstrate the ready applicability of our approach in empirical works, we have conducted an illustrative empirical analysis based on a real-life data set of 70 public schools in the United States.

The remainder of this paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 deals with the description of the technology followed by a brief review of the RAM model. Section 3 presents the main contribution of our study, where the three notions—URS, MRS, and GRS are introduced, and an LP model for the identification of the GRS is proposed. The model developed in this section is then used to develop a method for the measurement of RTS. Section 4 illustrates the application of our proposed approach with a numerical example, followed by an illustrative empirical application. Section 5 presents the summary of our work with some concluding remarks.

Since the projection P may be expressed as multiple convex combinations of its associated reference DMUs, multiple optimal values may take place for the vector 
                           λ
                        , leading to the occurrence of multiple URSs (problem Type I). Under such an occurrence, the measurement of RTS via the approach of Tone (1996) may be problematic. For a detailed discussion on this issue, interested readers may refer to the illustrative Figs. 1 and 2 in Krivonozhko et al. (2012c).

To deal with the occurrence of multiple URSs for a given projection P, we need to define a reference set containing all the possible URSs.

Because the RAM model is non-radial in nature, it may produce multiple projections for DMUo, resulting in the occurrence of multiple MRSs (problem Type II). The simultaneous occurrence of multiple URSs and multiple projections is illustrated with the help of an example in Section 3 in Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2007b).

To deal with the occurrence of multiple MRSs, we use the concept of minimum face

According to Theorem 3.1.2, a way of identifying the GRS is to find an element, namely (
                           λ', s
                        −', s
                        +'), in Ω
                        o such that the number of positive components of 
                           λ' is maximum. On the basis of this finding, we use Theorem 3.2.1 to formulate the LP problem

In summary, the solutions to (21) determine the set of all the DMUs spanning the minimum face (i.e., the GRS) together with a relative interior point of this face (i.e., the projection

Some useful properties of the proposed approach are presented below.

Our approach for determining the GRS involves the execution of a single LP problem, which makes it computationally more efficient than the existing ones for its easy implementation in practical applications. Moreover, the computational efficiency of the proposed approach is higher than that of the previous primal–dual ones since it is based on the primal (envelopment) form which is computationally more efficient than the dual (multiplier) form (Cooper et al., 2007).

Furthermore, since our proposed LP problem contains several upper-bounded variables, its computational efficiency can be enhanced by using the simplex algorithm adopted for solving the LP problems with upper-bounded variables. This is because considering (21) as an LP problem with upper-bounded variables leads to a further reduction in its size. More precisely, the size of the basic matrices during the solution process becomes (m + s + 2) × (m + s + 2), which is greater than the size of the basic matrices in model (3) by 3.


                                 RTS measurement
                              

As is well known, the concept of RTS is meaningful only when the relevant DMU lies on the frontier of the technology set. Hence, for an inefficient DMUo, an efficient projection must be considered. In this case, the type and magnitude of the RTS for DMUo is determined through the position(s) of the hyperplane(s) supporting 
                                    
                                       T
                                       
                                          VRS
                                       
                                       DEA
                                    
                                  at the projection used. The supporting hyperplane(s) passes/pass through the MRS associated with this projection and can be mathematically characterized via this MRS. This implies that the RTS measurement would be problematic under the occurrence of problem Type II, as it causes the occurrence of multiple MRSs and, consequently, the occurrence of multiple supporting hyperplanes (problem Type III). Note that overcoming the difficulty caused by problem Type II does not necessarily guarantee the uniqueness of the characterized supporting hyperplane(s). This is because the minimum face may not be a ‘Full Dimensional Efficient Facet’—an efficient facet of dimension m + s − 1 in the input–output space (Olesen & Petersen, 1996, 2003).

To sum up, the difficulty in the measurement of RTS arises either from Type II problem or from the non-full dimensionality of the minimum face. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a two-stage procedure based on the intensive study of Krivonozhko et al. (2014). The first stage is to determine a relative interior point of the minimum face by (24). This determination is based on the following two facts which show that the difficulty arising from problem Type II can be dealt with by using a relative interior point of the minimum face for the measurement of RTS.

All relative interior points of the minimum face 
                                    
                                       Γ
                                       
                                          o
                                       
                                       min
                                    
                                  operate under the same type of RTS (Krivonozhko et al, 2012c).

By Theorem 3.1.1, any relative interior point of 
                                    
                                       Γ
                                       
                                          o
                                       
                                       min
                                    
                                  can be expressed as a strict convex combination of all the reference DMUs in 
                                    
                                       R
                                       
                                          o
                                       
                                       G
                                    
                                 . Therefore, each supporting hyperplane binding at this point is also binding at all the reference DMUs. Precisely, this supporting hyperplane is characterized through the GRS, but not through a specific MRS.

In the second stage, the difficulty resulted from the non-full dimensionality of the minimum face is dealt with by measuring the RTS of 
                                    
                                       P
                                       
                                          o
                                       
                                       *
                                    
                                  through the indirect method of Banker et al. (2004) or the direct method of Førsund et al. (2007).

Our approach can readily be used without any change for the ‘additive model’ (Charnes et al., 1985) and the ‘BAM model’ (Cooper et al., 2011; Pastor, 1994; Pastor & Ruiz, 2007), because the difference between each of these two models and the RAM model lies only in the weights assigned to the input and output slacks in the objective function. With some minor changes, it can also be adopted for the ‘RAM/BCC model’ of Aida et al. (1998), the ‘DSBM model’ of Jahanshahloo et al. (2012) and the ‘GMDDF model’ of Mehdiloozad et al. (2014).

Furthermore, it can be implemented in any radial DEA model (e.g., the BCC model
                                    5

                                    The issue of identifying all possible reference DMUs of each inefficient unit using the BCC model was explored by Jahanshahloo, Shirzadi, and Mirdehghan (2008), Krivonozhko, Førsund, and Lychev (2012a), Roshdi, Van de Woestyne, and Davtalab-Olyaie (2014) and Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2007a).

The assumption of VRS is maintained in our study. This is because when a data set contains some negative values, one may not be able to define an efficient frontier passing through the origin, as is assumed under constant returns to scale (CRS). Therefore, as argued by Silva Portela and Thanassoulis (2010), the assumption of CRS is untenable with negative data.

It is, however, worth noting that while the minimum face is a polytope in the VRS-based technology, it is an unbounded polyhedral cone in the CRS-based technology that is generated by the reference units in the GRS. Despite this structural difference between the two technologies,

                                  our results can still be successfully adapted for the case of CRS by removing the convexity constraint, i.e.,

                                 . This is because our approach is primarily based on finding a solution with the maximum number of positive components for a linear system of equations, and is independent of the existence of the convexity constraint, accordingly.


                                 Dealing with negative input–output data
                              

Being independent of the data sets used, our proposed approach is free from the restricting assumption that the input–output data must be non-negative, which makes the identification of the GRS possible in the presence of negative data. From a practical point of view, this can be very beneficial since we deal with negative inputs and/or outputs in many empirical applications.

Let us consider a data set exhibited in Table 1 that consists of eight hypothetical DMUs with one input and one output. Based on these data, Fig. 1
                         depicts the frontier spanned in the two-dimensional input–output space.

To illustrate the application of our proposed approach, we first evaluate each DMU using the RAM model. Table 2
                        
                         exhibits the efficiency score and the projection obtained for each DMU. The results reveal that DMU1, DMU2, DMU3 and DMU4 form the efficient frontier, and hence, are RAM-efficient. Among the inefficient DMUs (DMU5, DMU6, DMU7 and DMU8), DMU8 has the minimum efficiency score of ρ
                        8 = 0.643.

While DMU4 and DMU2 are found as the unique projections for DMU5 and DMU6, respectively; DMU7 and DMU8 do not have unique projections despite the fact that DMU3 is determined as a projection for both. The projection sets of DMU7 and DMU8 are, respectively, the line segment connecting DMU2 and DMU3 and the line segment connecting DMU2 and DMU4 (
                           
                              
                                 R
                                 1
                                 −
                              
                              =
                              8
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 R
                                 1
                                 +
                              
                              =
                              8
                           
                        ). So, the minimum face associated with each of these units is the line segment connecting DMU2 and DMU4.

Having obtained the efficiency score for each DMU, we use model (21) to identify its GRS and determine a relative interior point of its corresponding minimum face. The results are all presented in Table 2. Out of the four RAM-efficient DMUs, DMU1, DMU2 and DMU4 are extreme-efficient and DMU3 is non-extreme efficient (see Fig. 1).

Since DMU5 and DMU6 have unique projections (i.e., DMU4 for DMU5 and DMU2 for DMU6), the GRS for each of these units is exactly the same as its unique projection. Formally,

                        .

Now, consider the case of DMU7 suffering from the occurrence of problems Types I, II and III:

                           
                              •
                              Type I: The sets {DMU3}, {DMU2, DMU4} and {DMU2, DMU3, DMU4} are the three URSs for DMU7 associated with the projection DMU3. So, the MRS of DMU7 associated with DMU3 is {DMU2, DMU3, DMU4}.

Type II: Λ
                                 2 is the line segment connecting DMU2 and DMU3.

Type III resulted from Type II: The RTS of DMU7 based upon the RTS of DMU2 and DMU3 (as its projections) is constant and decreasing, respectively.

As can be seen in Table 2, the GRS of DMU7 consists of DMU2, DMU3 and DMU4 with the respective weights of 0.5, 0.25 and 0.25, i.e., 
                           
                              
                                 J
                                 7
                                 G
                              
                              =
                              
                                 {
                                 
                                    2
                                    ,
                                    3
                                    ,
                                    4
                                 
                                 }
                              
                           
                        . This finding confirms Corollary 3.1.1, i.e., the convex hull of DMU2, DMU3 and DMU4 is 
                           
                              Γ
                              7
                              min
                           
                        . Moreover, DMU3 is determined as a relative interior point of 
                           
                              Γ
                              7
                              min
                           
                        .

We now turn to measure the RTS of each inefficient DMU based upon the RTS of the relative interior point of its associated minimum face given in Table 2. To do so, we use the two-stage method of Banker et al. (2004) and examine the sign of the intercept of the supporting hyperplane(s) passing through the given relative interior point. In Stage 1, we solve the multiplier form of the BCC model and obtain the intercept; if the intercept is equal to zero, the RTS is constant. Otherwise, depending on the sign of the intercept, we solve an additional problem in Stage 2 to determine the RTS.

We apply the two-stage approach to each relative interior point and summarize the results in Table 2. As can be seen, out of the four inefficient units, the three units—DMU5, DMU7 and DMU8 operate under decreasing RTS and one unit (i.e., DMU6) under constant RTS.

To demonstrate the ready applicability of our proposed approach, we conduct an illustrative empirical analysis based on a real-life data set of 70 public schools in the United States, which was taken from Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1981). To carry out all the computations, we have developed a computer program using the GAMS optimization software.

The data consist of five inputs and three outputs. The inputs of schools are the education level of mother as measured in terms of percentage of high school graduates among female parents (x
                        1), the highest occupation of a family member according to a pre-arranged rating scale (x
                        2), the parental visit index representing the number of visits to the school site (x
                        3), the parent counseling index calculated from data on the time spent with child on school-related topics such as reading together, etc. (x
                        4), and the number of teachers at a given site (x
                        5). The outputs are the Total Reading Score as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test (y
                        1), the Total Mathematics Score as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test (y
                        2), and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, intended as a measure of self-esteem (y
                        3).

In order to apply model (21), we have to obtain the efficiency score of ρ
                        o beforehand. Thus, we first make the efficiency assessment of the schools using the RAM model. The results show that 26 (37 percent) schools are RAM-efficient. For the remaining 44 (63 percent) inefficient schools, Table 3 provides summary statistics of the efficiency scores and the inputs and outputs of the projection points. It can be observed that the values of ρ
                        o range from 0.844 to 0.965 with the mean efficiency score of 0.938.

As is well known, the RAM model is not by itself able to find out all the possible reference units for inefficient DMUs. Therefore, we apply model (21) for each inefficient school to identify the reference schools in its GRS as appropriate benchmarks. For the 44 inefficient schools, Table 4
                         shows all the reference schools together with their corresponding weights. For example, the efficient schools S44, S58 and S59 with the respective weights of 0.052, 0.915 and 0.033 appear in the GRS of the most inefficient school S66. This means that S66’s target inputs and outputs are a linear combination of S44, S58 and S59’s inputs and outputs. Thus, in order for S66 to become efficient, it must adjust its inputs and outputs so that it produces 0.052 × y
                        
                           S44 + 0.915 × y
                        
                           S58 + 0.033 × y
                        
                           S59 amount of output by consuming 0.052 × x
                        
                           S44 + 0.915 × x
                        
                           S58 + 0.033 × x
                        
                           S59 amount of input.

Now, we proceed to measure the RTS of the inefficient schools. For each inefficient DMU, we first use (24) to obtain a relative interior point of its corresponding minimum face. The statistics of the results are given in Table 4. Applying the two-stage method of Banker et al. (2004) to the obtained interior points of Table 5
                         yields the results that are reported in the last three columns of Table 4. As the results show, among 44 inefficient branches, 3 (7 percent) schools have decreasing RTS status, 1 (2 percent) has increasing RTS status, and the remaining 40 (91 percent) schools have constant RTS status.

The current study is mainly concerned with the identification of all the possible reference units of an evaluated inefficient DMU. It is also interested in its application for the measurement of RTS in non-radial DEA models. Corresponding to a given projection of the DMU under evaluation, first, two basic notions were introduced: (i) URS: the set of efficient DMUs that are active in a specific convex combination generating this projection, and (ii) MRS: the union of all the URSs associated with this projection. Then, the notion of GRS was defined as the union of the MRSs associated with all projections of the evaluated DMU. With the help of the introduced notions, it was demonstrated that the convex hull of the GRS is equal to the minimum face, from which it was immediately concluded that the minimum face is a polytope.

Three types of multipleness may occur in any non-radial DEA model: multiple URSs (Type I), multiple projections (Type II), and multiple supporting hyperplanes (Type III). The occurrences of problems Type I and II cause difficulties in the identification of all the possible reference DMUs. The difficulty in the measurement of RTS arises mainly from problem Type III, which itself originates from two sources: problem Type II and the non-full dimensionality of the minimum face.

To deal effectively with the simultaneous occurrence of problems Type I and II, an LP-based approach was proposed to identify the GRS. Our proposed approach has several advantages over the existing ones. First, since it requires the execution of a single LP problem, it is computationally more efficient than the existing ones for easy implementation in practical applications. Second, using the simplex algorithm adopted for solving the LP problems dealing with upper-bounded variables, the computational efficiency of our approach can be substantially improved. Third, as our proposed approach is primal-based, its computational efficiency is higher than that of the previous primal–dual methods. Fourth, our proposed approach is more general in the sense that it can easily be applied to both radial and non-radial DEA models (e.g., the BCC and the additive models).

To estimate the RTS, a method in the non-radial DEA framework is also proposed to deal effectively with problem Type III, which arises either from problem Type II or from the non-full dimensionality of the minimum face. A key outcome of the LP problem proposed to identify the GRS is that it generates a projection in the relative interior point of the minimum face. Using this projection for determining the RTS of the evaluated inefficient DMU, our proposed method overcomes the difficulty arising from problem Type II. This is because each supporting hyperplane binding at the used projection is determined through the GRS, but not through a specific MRS. To cope with the difficulty arising from the non-full dimensionality of the minimum face, our proposed method employs the indirect method of Banker et al. (2004) or the direct method of Førsund et al. (2007).

According to Theorem 2 in Davtalab-Olyaie et al. (2014), FS
                      is a polytope (bounded polyhedral set). Hence, the equality holds if Λ
                     o∩ri(FS
                     ) ≠ ∅, since this relation implies that all the observed DMUs on FS
                      belong to 
                        
                           R
                           
                              o
                           
                           G
                        
                     . Assume, by the way of contradiction, that Λ
                     o∩ri(FS
                     ) = ∅ or, equivalently, Λ
                     o⊆∂(FS
                     ). Then, there exists a unique face of FS
                      of minimum dimension, namely KS
                     , for which Λ
                     o⊆K
                        S
                     ⊆∂(FS
                     )⊊FS
                     . The face KS
                      is a strong face of 
                        
                           T

                      (Rockafellar, 1970), whose dimension is less than that of FS
                     . This is a contradiction and, thus, the proof is complete by Definition 2.1.1.□
