                  Optimal inventory allocation policies have a significant impact on profits in the retail industry. A manufacturer ships products to the retailers’ stores where the end customers buy the product during the selling season. It has been put forward that it is beneficial for the manufacturer to reserve a certain fraction of the inventory for a second replenishment. Then the manufacturer can replenish the retailers’ inventories optimally and can take advantage of the risk pooling effect. In practice, retailers require a certain availability of the product throughout the selling season. Supply contracts are used to coordinate the delivery of products. Under such a contract, the manufacturer agrees to achieve a certain service level and to pay a financial penalty if she misses it. We analyze how a manufacturer responds to a service level contract if she wants to minimize her expected costs. We develop an allocation strategy for the multiple retailer case and find that our results allow for a better understanding of the effect of service level contracts on manufacturers and retailers.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The decision on how to allocate inventory among multiple retailers during a selling season can have a significant impact on the costs of a manufacturer. When Hewlett-Packard rationed among retailers the Laser Jet III as they could not meet demand, they were not anticipating that retailers would exaggerate their future orders, resulting in excess costs for Hewlett-Packard (Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang, 1993). It has been shown in literature that it is beneficial for the manufacturer to reserve a certain fraction of inventory for a second delivery to the retailers, in order to better balance the retailers’ inventories as much as possible (Jackson, 1988). Nevertheless, retailers have a natural interest in a certain availability of the manufacturer’s product throughout the selling season. Therefore, the manufacturer’s performance is controlled by supply contracts with specific financial consequences (Fry, Kapuscinski, & Olsen, 2001). There are several types of supply contracts that are commonly used. A particularly popular type of such contract is the service level contract (Sieke, Seifert, & Thonemann, 2012). Under a service level contract, retailers specify a service level that the manufacturer must achieve and the financial consequences of missing it. Hewlett-Packard and UPS Supply Chain Solutions are using service level agreements in order to better manage their partnership (Lewis, Rai, Forquer, & Quinter, 2007).

Since most companies measure their own service levels and many companies also measure the service levels of their suppliers, the information required for implementing a service level contract is typically available at both partners of the supply chain. In the consumer goods industry, for instance, essentially all manufacturers measure their own service levels and 70 percent of the retailers measure the service levels of the manufacturers. In this industry, manufacturers and retailers typically agree on a service level that a manufacturer is expected to achieve (Behrenbeck, Küpper, Magnus, & Thonemann, 2007). However, one of the main challenges for the manufacturer is the optimal fulfillment of multiple service level contracts. This issue has not been analyzed in literature and we aim to fill the gap with this paper. We analyze a supply chain with one manufacturer and multiple retailers. The manufacturer has signed a service level contract with each retailer. Our interest is in optimal allocation policies for a given set of service level contracts. We analyze how a manufacturer responds to multiple service level contracts optimally. We derive decision rules that allow the manufacturer to trade-off between different contracts. The results of our analyses provide a foundation for decision makers when they have to allocate scarce inventory among multiple retailers.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we review the relevant literature. In Section 3, we present a mathematical model of a two-echelon supply chain that is governed by service level contracts. In Section 4, we analyze the one-retailer case. We derive the probability that a penalty has to be paid and show that a ship-all policy is optimal. We extend the analysis to multiple retailers in Section 5 where we trade-off between multiple contracts. We show how the manufacturer can make an optimal allocation at the second replenishment and compare our approach to an inventory balancing policy. We conclude in Section 6. All proofs are in the Appendix.

Two streams of research are related to our work: research on inventory allocation decisions in two-echelon supply chains and research on service levels in inventory systems. Next, we review each stream in turn.

The inventory allocation literature is the first stream of research that is related to our work. One line of research focuses on supply chains where the central warehouse does not hold any stock and only allocates the inventory optimally among the retailers. Eppen and Schrage (1981) analyze a model with identical costs at the retailers and develop a cost optimal policy. Federgruen and Zipkin (1984) extend their model to non-identical retailers and develop an approximation that is based on the assumption of ideal stock distribution among the demand points. Zipkin (1984) then analyzes the case where inventory imbalances are significant and improves the stocking policy for this case. Verrijdt and de Kok (1996) consider a model where a target service level should be guaranteed at the retailer echelon and develop an optimal ordering and allocation policy. Xu, Bisi, and Dada (2010) extend the research of Eppen and Schrage (1981) by ensuring safety factor equalization through strategically selected lost sales for any discrete or continuous demand distribution.

The second line of research is similar to our setup. Inventory can be held back at the central warehouse for a later replenishment of the retailers. Jackson (1988) extends the model of Eppen and Schrage (1981) by allowing to reserve some inventory for a later delivery. They use a ship-up-to-S policy and show that the approach leads to a high reduction in backorder periods. Later Jackson and Muckstadt (1989) analyze the special case for two replenishment opportunities for identical retailers and provide easier approximations. Jönsson and Silver (1987) build on the previous research and use a service level as objective function like in our model. Since their service measure is based on an infinite-horizon, their analysis results in a backorder minimization. Subsequently, McGavin, Schwarz, and Ward (1993) provide important insights for the identical retailers case without considering holding costs. For the infinite-retailer system they show that a 50/25 policy gives good results, i.e., a second replenishment should take place in the middle (50 percent) of the selling season and 25 percent of the inventory should be reserved for this replenishment. They also suggest that this heuristic yields good results in the finite-retailer system.

The research on service levels in inventory systems provides the foundation of our paper: In single-echelon supply chains, service levels are used to compute optimal inventory levels that guarantee a prespecified service level at minimal cost. In multi-echelon inventory systems, service levels are typically specified at the most downstream echelon and cost minimizing target inventory levels are computed for each echelon. A review of the relevant service level models can be found in Diks, de Kok, and Lagodimos (1996). Research on service levels in Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) systems are particularly relevant for our research. Fry et al. (2001) show that (z,Z)-type VMI contracts perform better than retailer-managed inventory policies. The minimum and maximum inventory levels are denoted by z and Z and penalty payments are due if the inventory levels fall below or above these thresholds. This contract type assures a minimum availability of the product, but limits the maximum inventory at the retailer’s warehouse at the same time. Choi, Dai, and Song (2004) consider a two-echelon supply chain where the supplier has finite capacity and manages the inventory of his components at the manufacturer’s site under a VMI arrangement similar to our model. The manufacturer uses the components for assembling the final product with a finite production capacity. He faces stochastic end customer demand and requires a certain customer service level. Choi et al. (2004) show that specifying target service and backorder levels for the supplier leads to optimal inventory decisions at the supplier.

While the latter papers base their analyses on traditional long term service level measures, some recent work has analyzed the distribution of service levels if performance is measured over a finite number of periods. Chen, Lin, and Thomas (2003) study the effect of a finite time horizon on the service level. This approach is of particular interest in practical applications because infinite horizon service levels are difficult to control in reality as companies measure performance over finite time horizons. The authors show that using an infinite horizon to derive optimal base stock levels in a periodic review system leads to a higher than desired short term service level. Subsequently, Thomas (2005) analyzes the effect of the length of the time horizon on the distribution of service levels.

In our work, we extend the literature on inventory allocation policies by integrating service level contracts. We use the work of Thomas (2005) to integrate finite horizon service level measures in the objective function and charge financial penalties if a contract service level is not achieved.

We consider a two-echelon supply chain with one manufacturer that produces one product (Fig. 1
                     ). The product can only be sold during one selling season and is delivered to N identical retailers (indexed by 
                        
                           i
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           N
                        
                     ). The retailers face stochastic, continuous, and stationary end customer demand that is independent and uncorrelated between periods and retailers. We denote the demand in period t at retailer i by ξit
                      and the corresponding p.d.f. and c.d.f. by f(ξit
                     ) and F(ξit
                     ), respectively. The mean is μ and the standard deviation σ. Demand can be arbitrarily distributed as long as the p.d.f. is strongly unimodal with a non-negative skewness. This property holds for most theoretical distributions that are relevant for modeling demand, such as the Normal, truncated Normal, Gamma with shape parameter α > 1, and the Uniform distributions. For an in-depth treatment of logconcave distributions and their application to inventory control we refer the reader to Rosling (2002). To keep our analyses concise, we will focus on distributions with infinite non-negative support. Distributions with finite support can be treated analogously, but they require the definition of feasible regions for the parameter values of the supply contracts, which makes the analysis much more complex and adds little value.

The system is managed by a central decision maker, the manufacturer, where the overall objective is to minimize the manufacturer’s and the retailers’ expected costs for the selling season. Our setup is similar to a VMI system where the manufacturer is responsible for the management of her products at the retailers’ sites. Under such an agreement the manufacturer decides on the shipment quantities (Bernstein, Chen, & Federgruen, 2006). The manufacturer produces R units of the product in 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           0
                           ,
                        
                      i.e., at the beginning of the selling season, without knowing the exact customer demand. She has two replenishment opportunities, 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           1
                        
                      and 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           2
                           ,
                        
                      to ship the product to the retailers’ stores. Two replenishment opportunities are widely used because they offer a good trade-off between the additional fixed delivery costs and the potential savings due to the risk pooling effect (Güllü & Erkip, 1996; Jackson & Muckstadt, 1989). The replenishments of the manufacturer arrive at the retail stores instantaneously, i.e., with zero lead time. Excess customer orders are backordered. The backorder assumption is reasonable in cases where the customers do not have an immediate substitute for the product or where the retailer can quote different lead times to the customer. The latter case is widely used at online retailers. For example, Amazon.com can backorder customer orders into the next replenishment period by quoting longer lead times on their web page.

The sequence of events during the selling season is as follows: First, the manufacturer produces R units of the product and allocates the initial inventory to the retailers at the beginning of the first period 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           1
                        
                     . We define α as the reservation factor and it is the fraction of inventory that is reserved for the second delivery. The retailers then receive the customer orders and fill them. If the inventory is not sufficient to fill all customer orders, the retailers backorder and fill the orders after new inventory has arrived at 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           2
                        
                     . The unit backorder cost at retailer i is b. A unit holding cost h is charged for every left over inventory either at the manufacturer or the retailer. We assume that the holding cost is independent of where the inventory is hold in order to avoid benefits of holding inventory at the manufacturer (Jackson & Muckstadt, 1989). In 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           2
                           ,
                        
                      the manufacturer can replenish the inventories at the retail stores. The retailers fill open backorders first and start fulfilling new orders if inventory is available. Demand in 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           2
                        
                      that cannot be filled is backordered. At the end of 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           2
                           ,
                        
                      excess inventory at the retailers is either transshipped to other retailers in order to fill open backorders. Excess inventory (after transshipments) incurs a unit holding cost of h. Our model can be easily extended to accommodate the case of salvaging inventory at the end of the selling season.

To ensure an adequate performance, the retailers require that the manufacturer guarantees a certain service level for the product. This is a common approach in VMI systems as it has been suggested by Choi et al. (2004) or Fry et al. (2001). Choi et al. (2004), for example, use as β-service level (also Type-II service) the infinite-horizon measure

                                 .
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  

We focus on contracts that have a finite measurement horizon. The retailers measure the service level during the two replenishment periods. Then, the service level is stochastic. That means that it is not known with certainty which service level can be achieved during a selling season for given replenishments in 
                        
                           t

In our paper we consider a flat penalty contract similar to Sieke et al. (2012). Under such a penalty contract, the manufacturer pays the retailer a fixed amount p for a selling season in which the contract service level 0 < SL ≤ 1 is not met, i.e., for a season in which the manufacturer’s replenishments do not allow the retailer to fill at least a fraction SL of the customer demand immediately from stock. Such contracts are commonly used in practice (Shapiro, McOriary, & Cline, 1992). In

In this section, we will gain some important insights on the behavior of a service level contract by analyzing the single-retailer case which serves as a building block for the multiple-retailer case. In the single contract case, the manufacturer only serves one retailer i. We are interested in solutions that coordinate the supply chain. Therefore we present the centralize and decentralized solution and identify the contracts (p, SL) that coordinate the supply chain.

In order to gain some important insights on the optimal inventory allocation among multiple retailers we analyze the centralized supply chain. The service level penalty can be omitted in the centralized objective function, because it is a payment transfer between the manufacturer and the retailer. The objective is to decide on the shipment quantities from the manufacturer to retailer i for the two periods S

                        The first two terms of the manufacturer’s cost function represent the holding cost for the inventory physically remaining at the manufacturer at the end of the first and second period correspondingly. The third term is the penalty to be paid to the retailer for not satisfying the service level contract. The manufacturer’s first decision consists of the production quantity R and the initial allocation quantity S
                        
                           i1. The holding cost depends on S

                           i2 but the penalty costs have a more complex behavior. Therefore, we will analyze them next. Eq. (1) shows that a penalty p has to be paid by the manufacturer if the service level cannot be met, i.e., if

                        Since we are interested in the expected penalty costs, we need to derive the probability of a penalty event, by partitioning the demand space (ξ
                        
                           i1, ξ
                        
                           i2). The demand partitions correspond to certain stock-out events during the selling season. The following proposition summarizes the conditions for a penalty payment:

                        Proposition 1 states the cases where a penalty payment p has to be paid to the retailer, considering all combinations of whether there was a stock-out in period

                        . Fig. 2 shows the demand space for a service level 0 < SL < 1 and a low initial allocation S
                        
                           i1 ≪ R. The grey Areas 1–3 indicate the demand space where a penalty payment has to be paid. In Area 1, the initial allocation S
                        
                           i1 was sufficient to fill all demands in the first period, but the second period demand was too high to achieve the contract service level. In Area 2, not all customer demands could be filled in the first period and, furthermore, at the end of the second period some customer orders are still outstanding. In Area 3, the initial inventory S
                        
                           i1 was not sufficient to fill all customer orders in

                        . However, the inventory level at the beginning of the second period was high enough to fill all backorders from the first period and a sufficient number of demands in the second period. An exceptional case can appear when the first period demand cannot be fulfilled although the retailer received a high initial allocation S

                         was higher than the total available inventory R and not a single second period demand could be filled.

By integrating the demand probabilities over the demand partitions where a penalty is due, we can derive the probability of a penalty event.

Since in both the centralized and the decentralized case a ship-all policy is optimal we do not need to define the reservation factor α in the previous proposition as it will be zero. For the flat penalty case Sieke et al. (2012) proved that the penalty cost p is quasi-convex in the contract service level SL.

In this section we discuss the multiple retailer case and show how the manufacturer can take advantage of the risk-pooling effect by holding back inventory and allocating it optimally among the retailers. Similarly, we present the centralized and decentralized solution and identify contracts (p, SL) that coordinate the supply chain.

In the centralized supply chain, the objective is to decide on the optimal shipment quantities from the manufacturer to N identical retailers for the two periods that minimize the total supply chain cost denoted as CSC

For a discussion of solving techniques of such problems please refer to Jackson and Muckstadt (1989). The authors state that an order-up-to level inventory policy is optimal that balances inventories at the retailers, however, an exact optimal solution for more than two retailers is intractable.

In the multiple-contract case, the manufacturer is managing multiple retailer’s accounts, where her expected cost is

The manufacturer faces two decisions: (i) how much inventory to reserve for the second replenishment and (ii) how to allocate the inventory among the retailers in each replenishment period. The – inventory reservation decision – allows the manufacturer to hold back a fraction 
                           
                              α

                                          ¯

                                       |
                                    
                                 
                                 R
                              
                           
                         for a second replenishment. This inventory can be used to replenish the retailers’ inventory optimally. Holding back inventory leads to positive risk pooling effects because it gives the manufacturer a higher degree of freedom to equalize different demand realizations at the manufacturers. The – inventory allocation decision – takes the retailer’s characteristics into account in order to decide on the quantity each retailer receives at each replenishment. In the first replenishment, retailers receive the same quantities. In the second period, the retailers normally differ with respect to their first period performance. Therefore, a manufacturer would prefer to stock more inventory at a retailer where the improvement in the expected penalty costs is the highest.

In literature, several approaches for an optimal solution of the two decisions exist. A common approach that is frequently used is inventory balancing, which is used to minimize expected backorder costs. The manufacturer has to balance the inventories after observing the first period’s demand. For identical retailers this is done by simply equalizing the inventory levels at the retailers (McGavin et al., 1993). For non-identical manufacturers, Zipkin (1984) proposed an equal-fractile rule. Note that it is not always possible to rebalance retailer inventories if excess stock at the retailer cannot be transshipped or returned to the manufacturer.

We propose a contract balancing approach, where the manufacturer minimizes her expected costs from Eq. (6). As other authors have stated, the joint optimization of the manufacturer’s production quantity and the allocation decision among multiple retailers is not straightforward (Jackson & Muckstadt, 1989). We propose a solution algorithm to solve the allocation problem for a given reservation factor α and production quantity R, where we assume that both α and R are determined initially from a heuristic. For example, McGavin et al. (1993) have derived an optimization approach for the infinite-retailer case and found out that a reservation factor α of 25 percent leads to good results in the finite-retailer model for a variety of parameter sets. In order to keep our analysis tractable, we assume that R is determined by a single-retailer ship-all policy, i.e., 
                           
                              R
                              =
                              N
                              ·
                              
                                 R
                                 s
                              
                           
                         with N being the number of retailers and Rs
                         being determined from Proposition 3. Even though we expect further pooling effects for the production quantity in the case of multiple retailers, this assumption allows us to provide a computational approach for an otherwise mathematically intractable problem. In our numerical analyses we use 
                           
                              R
                              =
                              N
                              ·
                              
                                 R
                                 s
                              
                           
                         as an upper bound and find the optimal second period allocation for various sets of reservation factors and production quantities. By comparing these solutions we are able to numerically evaluate the cost minimizing reservation factor, production quantity and second period allocation for all retailers.

The discussion in Section 4 has shown that the probability for a penalty event depends on the demands in period 
                           
                              t

                         and 
                           
                              t
                              =

                        . Therefore, we cannot base our allocation decision in 
                           
                              t

                           i1. The manufacturer then has to decide on the optimal replenishment at the second replenishment opportunity. Some retailers can already be excluded from a replenishment decision if there is no possibility of avoiding a penalty payment any more.

                         represents Area 3 from Fig. 2. In this case, the initial inventory was not sufficient to fill all customer orders in the first period, but the second allocation was sufficient to cover all backorders from the first period and a sufficient number of demands in the second period. Since the service level is a weighted average of both periods’ stock-outs, a perfect second allocation cannot offset the inferior performance of the first period. This probability as seen from Fig. 2 is small and only relevant if some retailers have negative inventory level after the first period. Thus we decided to exclude it from our analysis for simplicity reasons. The second probability

                         represents Area 4 from Fig. 3. This is an exceptional case where the first period demand was beyond the first period allocation even though the retailer received a high initial allocation S
                        
                           i1 ≤ R. In this case the demand of the first period was higher than the total available inventory and not a single second period demand could be filled ξ

                           i1. We decided to exclude this probability as the second period allocation would not affect this probability. This leads to a small overestimation of the improvement of penalty probabilities in some cases. However, a stock-out after the first period is not highly probable in practical applications (for example, if the 50/25-heuristic is used). Therefore, we suggest that the error from our approximations is small. Then the total available inventory after the replenishment for retailer i is

                              has the highest marginal penalty probability where ν denotes the modal value of f.
                           

That means that the manufacturer has the incentive to prioritize retailers where he expects to have a high penalty cost reduction potential and thus, not to replenish retailers where a penalty cannot be avoided with a high probability. Based on this finding, we can characterize the optimal solution in the next proposition.

For the optimization of the second period allocation decision, we have to adapt the steepest-descent approach. The steepest-descent approach would lead to the optimal solution if all contracts would lie on the convex part of the demand c.d.f. Unfortunately, retailers can also lie in the concave part of the demand c.d.f. as Fig. 5 shows. The following algorithm extends the steepest-descent approach and finds the optimal solution:

                        . The intuition behind the algorithm is to increase the convex contract set by sequentially adding contracts from the concave part. The contract sets have been highlighted in Fig. 6. Since the solutions for the contract sets are also locally optimal, we get several local optima under which we find the optimal solution.

We summarize our findings in Table 1, where we present the cost benefits when using the optimal reservation policy in comparison to the optimal ship-all policy. For example for 
                           
                              h

                              =
                              1000
                           
                         the ship-all policy with the minimum cost would be that with 
                           
                              
                                 R
                                 *
                              
                              =

                         with an expected cost of 394.70. If we would instead reserve 1 percent for a second allocation then we would achieve cost savings of 1.70 percent as opposed to using the optimal ship-all policy. In this table we have used a wide range of parameters in order to better showcase the observed effects, however a penalty value of 
                           
                              p
                              =
                              10000
                           
                         for a holding cost of 
                           
                              h
                              =
                              10
                           
                         would be rather high, and thus the cost savings of 6.70 percent would be on the upper limit. From Table 1 we can observe that the cost benefits increase when p increases or h decreases. For a very high holding cost and a relatively low penalty cost (for example 
                           
                              h
                              =
                              100
                           
                         and 
                           
                              p
                              =
                              1000
                           
                        ), a ship-all policy is optimal. This is because the manufacturer has to pay the holding cost for the reserved inventory for the first period, which in this case exceeds the potential penalty cost benefits of reserving inventory for a second allocation.

From the decentralized solution we can observe that in the first period, all retailers have the same inventory level and the performance does not differ among the retailers. In the second period however, some retailers might receive a replenishment and some not. Retailers with a low first period demand might not receive a replenishment because the availability is still guaranteed by the excess stock from the first period. Retailers with a very high first period demand might not receive a replenishment because additional stock would not reduce the probability of a penalty significantly as shown in Proposition 8.

It is interesting to investigate how our proposed contract balancing approach compares to the inventory balancing approach (Jackson & Muckstadt, 1989). Since an exact optimal solution for more than two retailers is intractable, we resorted to a numerical comparison. We found that the results derived from the contract balancing are equivalent to those of Jackson and Muckstadt (1989). Our findings extend the observation of Choi et al. (2004) who analyzed the one retailer case. They found out that a minimum service level constraint on the manufacturer does not always lead to a minimum retailer service level and that an additional backorder contract parameter is needed to ensure a minimum retailer performance.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

Service level contracts are commonly used in theory and practice for evaluating supplier performance. In many supply contracts, service levels are specified as well as the consequences of not achieving them. In this paper, we have analyzed a two-echelon supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and multiple retailers, where the manufacturer has signed a service level contract with each retailer. One of the main challenges for the manufacturer is the optimal fulfillment of multiple service level contracts, which has not been analyzed in literature yet.

We have shown that if the manufacturer manages each retailer individually then a ship-all policy is optimal and the optimal production size can be determined easily. We have also derived results for the case that the retailers are managed jointly, where the manufacturer can realize risk pooling effects and can reduce her expected costs by reserving inventory for a second replenishment similar to Jackson (1988). The solution for the multiple retailer case was not trivial and we had to resort to an optimal solution algorithm. The results of our analyses can support decision makers in fulfilling service level based supply contracts. Our model can be modified to a setting with non-identical retailers where demand can be correlated between the two periods. In literature, service level based supply contracts in inventory allocation decisions have not been analyzed analytically, although these contracts are very popular in practice. With this paper, we take a first step towards filling this gap. The results of our analyses allow for a better understanding of the effect of service level based supply contracts on manufacturers and retailers.

                            is optimal as it reduces the expected cost of the manufacturer as seen in Eq. (3). Since there seems to be no no risk-pooling benefit from reserving inventory at the manufacturer for a second replenishment and given the structure of Eq. (3) it is easy to see that

                            can also lead to an optimal solution. Therefore, increasing the contract solution set S sequentially into the concave contract set leads to a number of locally optimal solution I
                           
                              c* that satisfy the optimality criteria from Proposition 7. From Proposition 7 also follows that other optimal solutions cannot exist. From these local solutions, the optimal solution can be found by taking the maximal value of the expected penalty reduction Δ. The first contract to be replenished has a contract inventory level
