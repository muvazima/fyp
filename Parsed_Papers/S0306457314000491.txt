                  Influence theories constitute formal models that identify those individuals that are able to affect and guide their peers through their activity. There is a large body of work on developing such theories, as they have important applications in viral marketing, recommendations, as well as information retrieval. Influence theories are typically evaluated through a manual process that cannot scale to data voluminous enough to draw safe, representative conclusions. To overcome this issue, we introduce in this paper a formalized framework for large-scale, automatic evaluation of topic-specific influence theories that are specialized in Twitter. Basically, it consists of five conjunctive conditions that are indicative of real influence exertion: the first three determine which influence theories are compatible with our framework, while the other two estimate their relative effectiveness. At the core of these two conditions lies a novel metric that assesses the aggregate sentiment of a group of users and allows for estimating how close the behavior of influencers is to that of the entire community. We put our framework into practice using a large-scale test-bed with real data from 75 Twitter communities. In order to select the theories that can be employed in our analysis, we introduce a generic, two-dimensional taxonomy that elucidates their functionality. With its help, we ended up with five established topic-specific theories that are applicable to our settings. The outcomes of our analysis reveal significant differences in their performance. To explain them, we introduce a novel methodology for delving into the internal dynamics of the groups of influencers they define. We use it to analyze the implications of the selected theories and, based on the resulting evidence, we propose a novel partition of influence theories in three major categories with divergent performance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the context of a social network, influencers are prominent individuals with special characteristics that enable them to affect a disproportionately large number of their peers with their actions. Their special characteristics are related to their individual activity and social background as well as to their position in the network (i.e., their connections with the other members). These influencers typically play a crucial role in a variety of scientific and business domains (Bakshy, Hofman, Mason, & Watts, 2011). For example, marketing campaigns could gain value from this process, since individual customers are prone to imitate their highly influential peers with respect to product adoption (Keller, Fay, & Berry, 2007). Instead of overwhelming the entire customer base with massive, but blind advertisements, marketing campaigns could target a small number of influential people. This cost-effective alternative is called viral marketing and is capable of achieving similar levels of product diffusion with traditional approaches (Brown & Hayes, 2008).

To facilitate such applications, a lot of research has focused on the identification of influencers. This effort led to the development of influence theories,
                        1
                        It should be stressed at this point that the term “influence theory” is used abusively in this work, since it does not refer to actual theories that provide insights into the behavior of social network users, explaining why some of them imitate the behavior of others. Instead, the term refers to influence ranking methods, which associate every user with a score that is proportional to an estimation of the influence she exerts on her peer members. By convention, though, these methods are termed influence theories in the literature. This convention is followed in this work, as well.
                     
                     
                        1
                      which constitute formal models that estimate for every member of a social network the influence she exerts on her peers according to one or more criteria. Some theories study influence on a global scale, considering the activity and the user base of the entire social network. Most commonly, though, an individual’s influence is local: she may be considered expert in a specific domain, but her opinion usually holds little weight outside this particular area. Based on this principle, local influence theories aim at identifying influencers among the members of individual communities, which are usually formed around a particular topic. Typically, the local theories are more accurate and efficient than the global ones, as they exclusively consider the activity and the dynamics inside the individual communities.

A major issue in the study of local influence theories is their evaluation. Over the recent years, On-line Social Networks (OSNs) have provided researchers with powerful tools for studying the dynamics of influence diffusion. They contain a vast amount of user-generated content as well as explicit connections among their members, thus allowing for the analysis of social influence on an unprecedented scale. Still, influence constitutes a subjective concept and, as such, it is very hard to measure and track. Most works actually lack a formal methodology for evaluating the results produced by their theories. Instead, they typically resort to selecting a small sample of the top ranked users in order to assess their authority in the real world (e.g., their fame or the quality of their content) (Cha, Haddadi, Benevenuto, & Gummadi, 2010; Weng, Lim, Jiang, & He, 2010). This manual procedure, however, cannot scale to large volumes of data and, thus, is incapable of yielding representative, reproducible and generalizable results.

In this work, we aim to overcome this shortcoming, by establishing a principled framework that is capable of evaluating local influence theories for OSNs on a large-scale. It receives as input the groups of influencers they define – called prominent groups in the following – along with the rest of the community and the corresponding activity. The goal of our framework is to estimate the relative accuracy of influence theories in predicting activity patterns that denote an imitation by the rest of the community. Internally, our framework encompasses five conditions that should be satisfied by a prominent group with real influence over the other members of the community. These conditions can be summarized as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           real influencers comprise a small subset of the community,

they are able to affect their fellow members with limited cost, i.e., by accounting for a limited portion of the community’s overall activity,

their activity is highly correlated with that of the remaining community with respect to an objectively measured metric,

their activity that is relevant to this metric chronologically precedes that of their peer community members, and

the volume of their activity that is relevant to this metric corresponds to a mere fraction of the overall activity this metric takes into account.

Conditions 1, 2 and 5 actually correspond to the pre-processing requirements of our framework. Their goal is to ensure that a prominent group is compatible with it, accounting for a limited portion of the activity and the user base of the underlying community. These are fundamental prerequisites for drawing safe conclusions from the analysis performed by our framework. The remaining two conditions encapsulate the real functionality of our framework. At their core lies an objectively measurable metric that correlates the activity of a prominent group with the rest of the community. To elucidate its functionality, consider a metric that assesses the aggregate sentiment of a group of users; a high correlation between the prominent group and the rest of the community members indicates that the stance of the former coincides with the overall “mood” of the latter. Failure with respect to either of these conditions indicates a theory that is inadequate in identifying real influencers. In contrast, an influence theory is effective if the individuals it marks as influencers satisfy both conditions. The stronger these conditions hold for them, the more effective the theory is. For instance, among two theories with similar performance, the one that exhibits higher correlation with the rest of the community is preferred.

Given that all five conditions rely on objectively measurable metrics, our framework allows for comparing the performance of local influence theories on a large-scale, without manual intervention. To put it into practice, we form a large-scale benchmark dataset that consists of real-world data. We actually draw our data from Twitter,
                        2
                        
                           https://twitter.com/.
                     
                     
                        2
                      which was selected for several reasons (Bakshy et al., 2011; Cha et al., 2010; Weng et al., 2010): it is one of the most popular OSNs in the field, it conveys ad hoc, yet clear and manageable rules for social interaction among its members, it abounds in dynamic topic communities and finally, it provides easy access to large volumes of user-generated content. In total, our test-bed comprises 75 topic communities from Twitter with more than 600,000 highly active users, who have posted over 6 million messages during a time period of 7months. Hence, it is suitable for performing large-scale qualitative and quantitative analyses with our framework.

Our experimental study also includes several local influence theories from the literature. To facilitate the understanding of their functionality, we introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy that classifies them with respect to their scope and the metric they use for assessing influence. The former criterion partitions influence theories into global, local (i.e., topic-specific) and hybrid ones, while the latter criterion distinguishes the evidence they consider into textual, graphical and hybrid information. We then map the main influence theories for Twitter to our taxonomy and explain which ones are applicable to our settings. Our analysis results in the selection of five established and representative influence theories that have been widely used in the literature.

The outcomes of our thorough evaluation indicated significant differences in the performance of these influence theories. To explain the resulting performance patterns, we introduce a novel methodology for delving into the internal functionality of every theory in order to examine the dynamics of its group of influencers. In essence, it comprises a series of statistical analyses that reveal three aspects of each prominent group:
                        
                           1.
                           the levels of homophily among its members,

the versatility of their activity, and

the affinity between them, in terms of the frequency of their pairwise interactions.

The outcomes of this methodology advocate a tripartite categorization of influence theories: (i) those that form groups of influencers with strong ties among them, (ii) those that select unrelated, but individually powerful influencers, and (iii) those that mark as influencers ordinary users, who lack any sense of team spirit and exhibit low levels of collaboration. In practice, the last category yields poor performance with respect to our evaluation framework, while the first one identifies highly effective influencers, who coordinate with each other in order to spread their impact to the entire community. Similar effectiveness is achieved by the influencers of the second category, despite the limited collaboration between them, because they benefit from their individual merits.

On the whole, the main contributions of our work are the following:
                        
                           •
                           We formalize the problem of evaluating the performance of local influence theories on a large scale. We actually reduce it to checking five objectively-measurable conditions that provide strong indications of real influence exertion in the context of any social network.

We put our evaluation framework into practice, testing five established local influence theories over a large dataset that comprises 75 Twitter communities with more than 600,000 users and 6 million tweets.

We analyze the performance of the selected influence theories through a novel methodology that provides insights into their functionality and the dynamics of the prominent groups they define.

We further analyze the performance of the selected influence theories, by introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that classifies influence theories according to their scope and the influence metric(s) they employ. We apply it to the main influence theories for Twitter, but it is general enough to accommodate theories for any other social network.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we present the most important works in the field and organize them according to our two-dimensional taxonomy. Section 3 formalizes the notions that lie at the core of Twitter and based on them, it introduces our evaluation framework. In Section 4, we analyze the performance of selected influence theories with respect to the five conditions of our framework and in Section 5, we introduce a novel methodology for analyzing the internal dynamics of prominent groups. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper, providing directions for future research.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

Influence diffusion in real-world social networks has been the subject of various studies over the past few decades – see (Katz, Lazarsfeld, & Roper, 2005) for more details. Recently, it raised new interest among researchers, largely due to the popularity of OSNs, such as Facebook
                        3
                        
                           http://www.facebook.com.
                     
                     
                        3
                      and Twitter. The user activity recorded by these systems actually allows researchers to study real-world social influence on an unprecedented scale. To the best of our knowledge, though, no prior work proposed a formal methodology for comparing the effectiveness of influence theories on a large scale. The only work that is relevant to our evaluation framework is a model proposed in Gayo-Avello (2013) for evaluating influence theories with respect to their resiliance to abusive users. According to this model, a successful theory should assign low ranking scores to spammers and marketers, while reserving high ranking positions for verified accounts. The author performed a comparative analysis of several global, graph-based influence theories (see Section 2.1 for this categorization), including PageRank, HITS, TwitterRank (Weng et al., 2010) along with some variations of them. The outcomes demonstrate that most algorithms achieve a similar performance in terms of resiliance to abusive users, with the exception of TwitterRank, which scored much lower than the others.

In the following, we first examine the main influence theories for Twitter, organizing them in a two-dimensional taxonomy. Then, we go more in depth on three additional topics that are closely related to their development and use.

As explained above, Twitter offers a convenient platform for studying influence diffusion on a large scale. Thus, many influence theories have been developed especially for its social network. In this section, we elaborate on the most important ones so as to select those that will be examined in the context of our evaluation framework. To facilitate their understanding, we introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes them in terms of their scope and the metric they use for assessing influence.

The scope of an influence theory determines its application area, i.e., the part of the social network that provides the candidate influential users as well as the evidence that characterizes their activity. This dimension partitions influence theories into the following categories:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Global influence theories take into account the activity of the entire social network with the aim of identifying the overall most influential users. For example, consider a theory that identifies as influencers the users with the highest number of followers across the entire Twitter network (i.e., global indegree).


                                 Local influence theories exclusively consider the activity of a specific topic community with the aim of detecting the most influential of its members. For instance, such a theory selects as influencers the users with the highest number of followers within the current community (i.e., local indegree).


                                 Glocal influence theories involve a hybrid functionality, deriving evidence from the entire social network so as to detect the influencers of a specific community. As an example, consider a theory that marks as influencers the members of a community that have the highest global indegree.

With respect to scope, our analysis focuses on local influence theories for Twitter. Such influence theories are more effective in their predictions and more efficient in their functionality, given that they exclusively consider evidence drawn from the activity and the topology of individual communities.

The metric of an influence theory determines the type of information it takes into account when assessing the influence exerted by a specific user. This dimension distinguishes influence theories into the following categories:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Graphical influence theories derive influence from the position of a node (i.e., user) on the social graph. In this category fall graph criteria, such as indegree, node centrality and betweeness.


                                 Contentual influence theories assess the influence of a user judging exclusively from the textual content she produces. Given, though, that there is no objective measure for explicitly assessing the quality of user-generated content, implicit estimations are typically employed in practice. In the context of Twitter, influence criteria that belong to this category consider the number of retweets and the number of mentions pertaining to an individual user. Their implicit assumption is that the higher the quality of the messages posted by a user is, the more frequently she is retweeted or mentioned.


                                 Holistic influence theories rely on a hybrid functionality that considers both the content produced by users and their position on the social graph.

Note that theories belonging to the first two categories can be further refined according to their granularity into atomic and composite influence theories; the former take into account a single source of evidence (i.e., a single metric), while the latter consider a combination of multiple metrics. For example, the holistic influence theories are composite by definition. Our analysis focuses on atomic graphical and contextual metrics, provided that they draw evidence exclusively from the information contained in individual topic communities.

The outline of our two-dimensional taxonomy is depicted in Fig. 1
                         along with the influence theories for Twitter that have been mapped to it.
                           4
                           It is worth stressing that our taxonomy can be generalized to accommodate any influence theory, regardless of the social network it is crafted for. For example, Choudhury et al. (2010) introduce a generic glocal influence theory based on holistic metrics, while Tang, Sun, Wang, and Yang (2009) and Bodendorf and Kaiser (2009) present generic local influence theories that involve composite graph metrics. However, an exhaustive categorization of all influence theories for OSNs lies out of the scope of this work.
                        
                        
                           4
                         We observe that some types of influence theories have not been explored in the literature yet – at least not in the context of Twitter. For example, there is no glocal theory that relies on contentual evidence. In contrast, the majority of Twitter theories employ holistic metrics for assessing influence and are local with respect to scope. In the following, we delve into the internal functionality of each theory in order to decide which ones are suitable for our analysis.

In Cha et al. (2010), the authors examine a series of atomic influence theories that employ local and global evidence. Their work actually investigates the impact of ordinary users as opposed to that of prominent Twitter users, such as celebrities. The local influence theories they consider are the Indegree, the Mentions and the Retweets Influence Theories, which are analytically presented in Section 3.3.

In Bakshy et al. (2011), the authors consider influence as the user’s ability to post URLs which diffuse through their followers into the entire social graph of Twitter. This is a global theory that employs a regression tree model for predicting a user’s influence in terms of the average size of all the cascades she triggers. As features for this model, they use a combination of graphical and contentual metrics: the number of followers, the number of friends, the number of tweets, the date of joining as well as the number of retweets by the author’s immediate neighbors (past local influence) and by any other Twitter user (past total influence). The outcomes of their experimental study suggest that the local past influence and the number of followers are the most reliable factors for determining influence. The authors also conclude that marketing campaigns should consider every individual as an influencer, targeting many ordinary users in order to achieve high levels of adoption. We examine this idea in the context of topic communities through the Random Influence Theory that is presented in Section 3.3. Note also that the influence criterion based on the size of cascades is similar to the Retweets Influence Theory (cf. Section 3.3), when restricted in the borders of a topic community.

In Petrovic, Osborne, and Lavrenko (2011), the authors use a variety of contentual and graphical metrics in order to determine the probability of a tweet to be retweeted. They found that the global social features of the author (especially her indegree) have higher predictive accuracy than features extracted from the tweet itself. However, most of these global metrics are incompatible with our topic-specific analysis. Only the indegree is employed by the Indegree Influence Theory (cf. Section 3.3), adapted, though, to the local settings of topic communities.

In Purohit and et al. (2012), the authors examine local influence in the context of brand-pages, extracting features from user interactions and user profiles. The former include the number of retweets, the number of replies and the number of mentions, while the latter involve the number of followers and the number of tweets on the topic. All these metrics are also included in our analysis; for instance, the number of topic tweets lies at the core of the Tweets Influence Theory, and the number of replies is closely related to the Mentions Influence Theory (cf. Section 3.3). In addition, the authors apply established link analysis algorithms, such as HITS and PageRank, on the explicit social graph of Twitter as well as on the implicit network that is formed by retweets. Their findings suggest that these algorithms yield higher performance than user profile features, especially for the explicit network of Twitter. However, the global evidence they employ is incompatible with our topic-specific analysis. Most importantly, though, such graphical evidence is inappropriate in the context of Twitter communities: their members participate in them through the content they publish and, thus, they are not necessarily interlinked.

A graph-based approach is also taken by Li, Bhowmick, and Sun (2011). Their algorithm quantifies the influence of every community member by using the underlying signed graph structure, which conveys the positive and the negative relationships between all individuals. Given that Twitter is not an explicitly signed network, we cannot include this approach to our analysis.

In Liu and et al. (2010), the authors introduced a probabilistic model for mining direct and indirect influence between the nodes of heterogeneous networks. Their model combines contentual and graphical metrics in order to predict the probability that a user will retweet a friend’s post. It was experimentally evaluated over Twitter and two other social networks, with the outcomes verifying significant improvements in predictive accuracy. This method, though, operates on the level of individual links between users; thus, its goal differs from that of our analysis, which aims at evaluating the accuracy of local influence theories in detecting highly influential community members.

Finally, Weng et al. (2010) introduced a novel glocal influence theory that is based on a modified version of Google’s PageRank, intuitively called TwitterRank. To measure the local influence of individuals, it estimates the topical similarity between users based on global information about all other topic communities they participate. Apart from contentual evidence, it also considers the link structure of the entire social graph of Twitter. As explained above, though, such global and glocal evidence are incompatible with our analysis, which exclusively considers influence theories that are based on information contained within an individual topic community.

An important problem in social network analysis is the task of predicting the effect of social influence on the behavior of associated users. The goal is actually to forecast the actions of individual users with the help of an influence theory and the historical data about their own activity and that of their affiliated users.

In Goyal, Bonchi, and Lakshmanan (2010), the authors proposed various static and time-dependent models that calculate the probability that a user will follow her neighbors into joining a particular group as well as the time this action will take place (within tight margins). Their models take into account both the topology of the social network and the history of user’s activity. They were tested on a real-world dataset from Flickr,
                           5
                           
                              http://www.flickr.com.
                        
                        
                           5
                         yielding high accuracy.

In Tan and et al. (2010), the authors proposed a Noise Tolerant Time-varying Factor Graph Model (NTT-FGM) for modeling and predicting social actions. For higher predictive accuracy, NTT-FGM considers user attributes in addition to the structure of the social network and the history of user actions. Authors also introduced the notion of latent state, which indicates how likely a user is to perform an action at a specific point in time. The model was evaluated over real-world datasets from three heterogeneous social networks and was found to consistently outperform the baseline methods.

In Cosley and et al. (2010), the authors evaluate two definitions of influence with respect to the probability of behavior adoption as a result of peer pressure. The first definition is based on snapshot observations of the network at the time right before the individual decides whether to adopt a behavior, while the second definition relies on detailed temporal dynamics. The relationship between those two types of influence was examined using data extracted from Wikipedia, with the outcomes confirming the hypothesis of a direct link between them.

The notion of social influence constitutes the cornerstone of many business applications. The goal is actually to employ influence theories in advertising and marketing campaigns so as to increase their efficiency, achieving similar levels of adoption at a lower cost. This problem has been formalized as the influence maximization problem, i.e., the task of identifying a small subset of users that could maximize the spread of influence over the social network (Chen, Wang, & Wang, 2010). In the context of viral marketing, this problem translates into maximizing the consumption of a product by targeting a small number of highly influential users and giving them incentives to adopt it. The small number of users keeps the budget low, increasing the cost-effectiveness of marketing campaigns, while their high influence capacity ensures large product diffusion through word-of-mouth advertising.

In Domingos and Richardson (2001), the authors viewed the market as a social network that can be modeled as a Markov random field. They also introduced the notion of a customer’s network value, which expresses the expected profit from sales to other persons that have been influenced by a particular customer. In Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (2003), the authors considered the problem of selecting the most influential nodes and studied it in the context of the most widely adopted models in social network analysis. They proved that, under these settings, it constitutes an NP-hard optimization problem and provided approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. This work has been the basis of several more recent studies on the subject.

On another line of research, Cha et al. examined influence dynamics in Twitter and discovered that the top influential users get disproportionately more references than the ordinary users (Cha et al., 2010). They conclude, therefore, that the spread of information can be maximized by targeting a small number of opinion leaders. Their findings are in accordance with the traditional view on influence diffusion (Katz et al., 2005), but contradict modern theories that emphasize the role of interpersonal relationships among ordinary users (Bakshy et al., 2011). The latter works actually claim that marketing campaigns should target a large number of plain users in order to be successful.

Also related to influence maximization is the diffusion of innovation. In Ma, Yang, Lyu, and King (2008), the authors propose a novel way of tackling this problem through the heat diffusion theory of physics. They develop three diffusion models along with specialized algorithms for selecting the best individuals to receive marketing samples. Their outcomes verify that their framework outperforms previous work and that it is particularly effective in capturing diffusion of negative information. In Luu, Lim, Hoang, and Chua (2012), the authors examine macro-level diffusion with regard to behavior adoption using topology characteristics, such as degree distribution, along with the word-of-mouth influence stemming from neighboring nodes.

The above works primarily considered social influence as the sole drive that persuades individuals to change their attitude so as to conform to the activity of their neighbors. However, this is not the only source of social correlation. The same effect can actually stem from homophily, a phenomenon that has been analytically examined in McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook (2001). This work advocates that social ties are highly likely to be formed between individuals sharing several characteristics of their personality, such as beliefs, interests and demographic background (e.g., age, race and location). It is crucial, therefore, to distinguish social influence from homophily and other unobserved confounding variables that can induce statistical correlation between friends in a social network. This task lies at the core of several works (Anagnostopoulos, Kumar, & Mahdian, 2008; Aral, Muchnik, & Sundararajan, 2009; Fond & Neville, 2010).

Other works have examined the dynamics of social influence with respect to homophily. In Holme and Newman (2006), the authors proposed a model for combining these two factors of social correlation and explained how their balance can be controlled through a single parameter. The authors studied how homophily-based and influence-based dynamics affect the clustering of the network, concluding that homophily results in a large number of small clusters, while social influence dynamics generate large and coherent clusters. In Scripps, Tan, and Esfahanian (2009), the authors examined how homophily and influence affect the modeling of dynamic networks and introduced formal definitions for both factors. They also developed metrics for assessing the alignment between links and attributes under different strategies for using the historical network data. Their outcomes demonstrate that the importance of individual attributes in forming links changes over time.

In this section, we formally define our evaluation framework along with the fundamental notions that are related with it. We begin with the basic parts of Twitter that lie at the core of local influence theories, we continue with the formalization of the theories that participate in the evaluation and conclude with the definition of the five conditions that comprise our framework.

Twitter constitutes one of the most popular micro-blogging services, encompassing a user base of more than 500 million registered users that post more than 340 million short messages per day.
                           6
                           
                              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter accessed on November 06, 2012.
                        
                        
                           6
                         It is also one of the most popular OSNs among researchers studying influence diffusion (Bakshy et al., 2011; Cha et al., 2010; Weng et al., 2010). Responsible for Twitter’s popularity are the unique characteristics that lie at its core:
                           
                              1.
                              Users are only allowed to post short messages of up to 140 characters, which are called tweets. This urges content providers to put all their talent into creating original, self-contained and witty messages that require the minimum attention and time from their readers. Thus, tweets can be easily understood, memorized and shared with other people, strongly resembling marketing slogans.

Twitter accounts are publicly available by default, thus encouraging and supporting the interaction between users. Any user can freely “follow” (i.e., register to) the accounts of others in order to receive their latest tweets. By following a specific user u, the subscriber explicitly denotes that u is of particular interest to them, either due to a common background (e.g., a hobby) or because of content quality (e.g., news services).

Also crucial for the success of Twitter are the usage patterns that were established by its users:
                           
                              1.
                              Tweets can be easily categorized in topics that have been freely defined by other users. This is typically done by adding – usually at the end of a tweet – one or more hashtags. These are annotations that consist of the symbol #, followed by one or more words or alphanumerics concatenated together (e.g., #twitter). Hashtags can be used, therefore, to identify groups of people that are interested in the same topic.

Twitter can operate as a platform for discussion among its members. By adding the annotation “@gpapadis” in their tweet(s), a user u can directly address the user gpapadis, who can later respond back in the same way (i.e., @u). This annotation is called mention and allows for detecting users that are engaged into bilateral discussions.

Users can share with their followers tweets that they find quite appealing or interesting, but have been authored by other users. This is typically done by posting the original tweet along with the special annotation “RT @gpapadis” so as to give credit to its first author –gpapadis in our case. This practice is called retweeting and allows for tracking the diffusion of a particular tweet in order to estimate its influence. The larger the cascade it triggers (i.e., the more users retweet it), the more influential it is (Bakshy et al., 2011).

These Twitter practices lie at the core of our analysis of the interaction patterns between members of specific communities. For brevity, we call annotated tweets the messages that contain a mention or a retweet. We also call polarized tweets, those tweets that express either a positive or a negative sentiment, as denoted by the appropriate emoticon. A positive tweet contains either of the following smileys “:)”, “:-)”, “:)”, “:D” or “=)”, while a negative tweet is marked with “:(”, “:-(”,or “:(” (Barbosa & Feng, 2010). Tweets that contain both a positive and a negative emoticon are ambiguous and, thus, we exclude them from our analysis; they are quite rare, though, comprising just 1423 tweets out of the 6 million messages of our benchmark communities (cf. Table 2
                        
                        ).

It is worth stressing at this point that more advanced methods have been proposed in the literature for automatically detecting the sentiment of a tweet in a more comprehensive way – the interested reader can refer to (Tsytsarau & Palpanas, 2012) for more details. However, applying a more elaborate classification scheme for sentiment analysis lies out of the scope of this work. The reason is that such techniques are typically language- and application-specific, as they have to overcome the inherent challenges of the user-generated content posted in Twitter (Giannakopoulos et al., 2012):
                           
                              1.
                              High levels of noise in the form of spelling mistakes and missing or incorrect information.

Sparsity, as the size limitations minimize the information conveyed by individual messages.

Multilinguality, since a single message may contain words in multiple languages. Even when a single language is used, there are no metadata to indicate it or to facilitate its automatic identification.

Evolving, non-standard vocabulary, in the form of slang words and dialects that are commonly used in the casual communication between OSN users.

In the lack of any generic approach to sentiment classification in Twitter, we employ emoticons for identifying the sentiment of individual tweets. This approach overcomes the above challenges and is generic enough to apply to any topic community. It is also reliable enough for illustrating the functionality of our evaluation framework, as it is typically employed in the literature for building the ground-truth of polarized content (Go, Bhayani, & Huang, 2010).

In order to facilitate the understanding of the following formulations as well as of the analyses presented in the subsequent sections, we first summarize the main notation they use in Table 1.

The members of Twitter and the connections between them are typically modeled through a graph. Each user is represented by a node, and every relationship between two users is denoted by an edge connecting the corresponding nodes. In fact, every edge 〈x,
                        y〉 is directed, pointing from follower x (i.e. subscriber) to followee y (i.e., content provider). This abstraction effectively captures the topology of the underlying social network, but leaves out its activity. To model the latter, we additionally employ the notion of social metadata, i.e., the collection of tuples that record all content produced by Twitter users over time. An individual tuple is represented as 〈m,
                        u,
                        t〉, where m is a message posted on-line by user u at time t.

Plugging these two abstractions together, we formally define the social graph of Twitter as follows:
                           Definition 3.1
                           The social graph of Twitter is a graph GT
                              
                              ={VT
                              ,
                              ET
                              ,
                              M}, where VT
                               is the set of vertices representing its users, ET
                               is the set of directed edges denoting the social connections between them, and M is a function that associates every user u
                              ∊
                              VT
                               with the messages she has posted: M(u)={〈m,
                              u,
                              t〉}.


                        M(u) encapsulates the entire writing activity of user u, which is called user metadata. It should be distinguished from the metadata of topic h, which is defined by a function N(h) and comprises all messages that contain a specific hashtag h along with their authors and the time they were posted. More formally:
                           
                              
                                 N
                                 (
                                 h
                                 )
                                 =
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          〈
                                          m
                                          ,
                                          u
                                          ,
                                          t
                                          〉
                                          :
                                          hashtag
                                          (
                                          m
                                          ,
                                          h
                                          )
                                          =
                                          true
                                       
                                    
                                 
                                 ,
                              
                           
                        where hashtag(m,
                        h) is a boolean function that returns true if the message m contains the hashtag h and false otherwise.

In general, the set of all tweets sharing a specific hashtag form a topic community in Twitter that comprises their authors, as well. This approach has some limitations, mainly the fact that it fails to capture topic related activity that is not denoted with a specific hashtag. Nevertheless, the practice of using hashtags to define a topic community is advocated by several works in the field: in Ernesto and et al. (2012), the authors use hashtags as surrogates for topics, in Pal and Counts (2011) the usage of relative hashtags serves as a quantifier of the user’s relevance to a specific topic, while in Bruns and Burgess (2011), the authors examine the dynamics of politics-related topic communities as defined by hashtags. We follow the same convention and define a topic community as the metadata of topic h together with the social connections between its authors. More formally:
                           Definition 3.2
                           Given the social graph of Twitter GT
                               along with a label h, the topic community corresponding to h is a sub-graph Gh
                              
                              ={Vh

                              ,
                              N}, where N(h) is the set of topic metadata, Vh
                               is the set of all users in VT
                               that have posted at least one message with the label h (i.e., Vh
                              
                              ={u
                              ∊

                              N(h)≠0} and Eh
                               comprises all the edges of ET
                               with both adjacent vertices contained in Vh
                               (i.e., Eh

                              ET
                              ). The number of users participating in the community is referred to as the size of the community and is denoted by |Vh
                              |.

The members of a topic community typically differ in the degree of influence they exert over their peers. Some users are rather passive, while others excel in some aspect of the community, affecting the behavior of other members and setting relevant trends. We call influencers or prominent users those members that have established a prominent position inside a community. Collectively, the influential users of a specific community comprise a sub-community that is called prominent group. Formally, this group is defined as follows:
                           Definition 3.3
                           Given a topic community Gh
                              , its prominent group is a sub-graph Gp
                              
                              ={Vp

                              M}, where Vp
                               is the set of prominent users contained in Vh
                              , Ep
                               is the set of the edges between them in Eh
                               (i.e., Ep

                              | of the prominent group is called prominent size.

Note that for simplicity, the overall metadata of a prominent group Gp
                         are denoted by M(Gp
                        ); that is,

                        , i.e., to any sub-graph of Twitter’s social graph that encompasses a specific set of users along with their social connections and the messages they have authored. In the following, we use the term (sub-)community in order to collectively refer to an entire topic community and to its prominent groups.

A local influence theory is a formal model that aims at detecting the influencers inside a topic community. To this end, it associates every user with an influence ratio, i.e., an ordinal value that denotes their individual degree of influence. As an example, consider an influence ratio that is equal to the local indegree of a user, i.e., the number of followers she has within the community. After mapping users to a scale of influence ratio, an influence theory sorts them in descending order, and those placed at the top k ranking positions form the community’s 
                           k-prominent group
                         – symbolized by

More formally, a local influence theory is defined as follows:
                           Definition 3.4
                           Given a topic community Gh
                              , a local influence theory is a mapping of its members Vh
                               to a totally ordered set Oh
                              , which assigns an influence ratio to each member u
                              ∊
                              Vh
                               through a function F:Vh
                              
                              ×
                              Gh
                              
                              →
                              R and ranks them in descending order according to the following implication: F(ui
                              ,
                              Gh
                              )⩽
                              F(uj
                              ,
                              Gh
                              )↔
                              o(ui
                              )⩾
                              o(uj
                              ), where o(ul
                              ) denotes the ranking position of the user u
                              1 in Oh
                              . The lower the ranking position o(ul
                              ) assigned to user ul
                              , the higher is her influence, with o(ul
                              )=1 corresponding to the most influential user.

Two points are worth clarifying with respect to this definition:
                           
                              •
                              The influence ratio assigned to a particular user may depend not only on her own activity (i.e., user metadata), but also on information drawn from the entire community (e.g., her local indegree).

Any evidence that stems outside the topic community is ignored. For example, any external user uj
                                 
                                 ∉
                                 Gh
                                  that follows a specific community member ui
                                 
                                 ∊
                                 Gh
                                  is not considered in the local indegree of ui
                                 , until uj
                                  joins Gh
                                 .

Based on Definition 4.4, we now formalize the local influence theories that were selected in the Section 3.1 for our large-scale evaluation:
                           
                              1.

                                 ) argues that every member of a topic community is an influencer. All users share, therefore, the same level of influence and are assigned to the same influence ratio:

The Indegree Influence Theory (Find
                                 ) is based on the rationale that the larger audience a person has, the more people are likely to adopt her opinions and, thus, the larger is her influence. Therefore, the corresponding influence ratio is analogous to the popularity of a user in terms of the number of her followers inside the topic community (i.e., the local indegree of her node).

The Mentions Influence Theory (Fmnt
                                 ) associates the influence of a user with her ability to get involved in discussions with other members of the community. The more sociable a user is, the more people get in contact with her and the higher is her influence. To quantify this notion, the influence ratio of a specific user is set equal to the number of internal mentions that pertain to them:

The Retweets Influence Theory (Frtw
                                 ) assumes that the influence of a user depends on the value of the content she posts on-line. The more interesting her tweets are, the more people are likely to read it and the higher gets her influence. This subjective measure can be practically inferred from her internal retweet frequency, i.e., how many times her posts have been reproduced by her peer members in the topic community.

The Tweets Influence Theory (Ftwt
                                 ) regards the volume of content that is produced by a particular user as a strong evidence for her level of influence. The more prolific a user is, the higher is the likelihood that a community member will read their posts and the more influential they are. In this context, the influence ratio of a user u is equal to the number of tweets on the topic she has posted on-line:

Having formalized the influence theories of our analysis, we are now able to build a principled framework for evaluating their predictive accuracy.

The behavior of prominent users is rather crucial for a topic community, as their actions and opinions are imitated and propagated by a considerable part of their peer community members – even those out of their direct reach. This phenomenon is so intense that some aspects of a community’s overall activity can be considered as an extrapolation of the corresponding behavior of influencers. To quantitatively measure its extent, we need to compare the aggregate activity of prominent users with that of the entire community on the basis of an objectively measurable metric. Such a measure takes as input (part of) a social graph and maps the corresponding activity to a numerical value. We call it activity summary metric and formally define it as follows:
                           Definition 3.5
                           Given a (sub-)community Gl
                              , an Activity Summary Metric (ASM) is a function that maps Gl
                               to the space of the real numbers, based on a particular subset of the information it conveys.

This is a general definition that can accommodate various metrics. As an example, consider a function that estimates the frequency of occurrence of specific topic-related terms in the tweets of the community members. Given, though, that such ASMs are both language- and topic-specific, the noisy, multi-lingual content of Twitter renders them incompatible with our evaluation framework, which makes no assumption about the quality and the characteristics of the topic communities it uses as benchmark data. Given also that the goal of this analysis is to illustrate the functionality of our framework, we exclusively consider as ASM a measure that relies on polarized content, as it is defined in Section 3.1. In essence, it quantifies the aggregate opinion expressed by the tweets of a community or a part of its users. We call it Polarity Ratio (PR) and define it as follows:
                           Definition 3.6
                           Given a (sub-)community Gl
                              , its polarity ratio

                              ) is defined as follows:

                               that correspond to negative and positive tweets, respectively – as defined in Section 3.1 on the basis of emoticons (i.e., in a language-independent, noise-tolerant way). |Neg(Gl
                              )| and |Pos(Gl
                              )| represent their cardinality, with |Neg(Gl

                        PR(Gl
                        ) takes values in the interval (−|M(Gl
                        )|,+|M(Gl
                        )|), with the positive ones suggesting the prevalence of positive tweets and vice versa. In more detail, a positive value n suggests that the positive tweets outnumber the negative ones by a factor of (approximately) n
                        +1; the opposite applies to negative values. Neutral sentiments correspond to a balance between negative and positive tweets (i.e., |Neg(Gl
                        )|≈|Pos(Gl
                        )|), thus yielding values very close to 0.

Based on the notion of ASM and its instantiation through PR, we now introduce the formal definition of our large-scale evaluation framework for influence theories. In more detail, we deem that the following conditions provide strong indications for true influence exertion when they are satisfied in conjunction:
                           
                              (i)
                              
                                 Correlation condition. The output of an ASM allows for estimating the proximity of prominent users’ behavior with that of the entire community. A high correlation between ASM(Gp
                                 ) and ASM(Gh
                                 ) means that the behavior of the prominent group is representative of the entire topic community. In fact, the closer their values are over time, the higher is the impact of the prominent users on the community. We formally denote this condition as follows: 
                                    
                                       
                                          ASM
                                          (
                                          
                                             
                                                G
                                             
                                             
                                                p
                                             
                                          
                                          )
                                          ≈
                                          ASM
                                          (
                                          
                                             
                                                G
                                             
                                             
                                                h
                                             
                                          
                                          )
                                          .
                                       
                                    
                                  As an example, consider the polarity ratio: real influencers are expected to determine the overall opinion of a community in an unequivocal way and, thus, PR(Gp
                                 ) and PR(Gh
                                 ) should share the same sign and similar magnitudes.


                                 Size condition. The relative size of the prominent group (i.e., |Vp
                                 |) plays a crucial role in the correlation between ASM(Gp
                                 ) and ASM(Gh
                                 ): the more users we consider as influencers, the closer is the behavior of the prominent group to the aggregate behavior of the community. The perfect match (i.e., ASM(Gp
                                 )=
                                 ASM(Gh
                                 )) actually corresponds to the extreme case, where Gp
                                  comprises the entire community Gh
                                 . In practice, though, the smaller the prominent group is, the more cost-effective is the corresponding application (e.g., viral marketing). Thus, it is fundamental to consider prominent groups with a size that is merely a fraction of the entire community. This condition is denoted as follows:

                                                p
                                             
                                          
                                          |
                                          ≪

                                                V
                                             
                                             
                                                h
                                             
                                          
                                          |
                                          .
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              


                                 Volume conditions. The volume of the content produced by a prominent group is a crucial factor in determining its actual influence over the entire community. Imagine a community where the polarized tweets considered by PR are monopolized by a handful of users, while the rest of its members are rather parsimonious, contributing less than 10% of the polarized content; although there can be no real influence relationship, the polarity ratio inevitably yields a high correlation between PR(Gp
                                 ) and PR(Gh
                                 ). It is evident, therefore, that a prominent group should account for a mere fraction of the community’s content that pertains to the selected ASM. In other words, a prominent group cannot comprise hyperactive users that overwhelm their peers with their content. Instead, eligible prominent users should account for a mere fraction of the community’s overall content. In more detail, our framework requires that real prominent users satisfy the following two conditions with respect to the volume of their content:
                                    
                                       •
                                       The overall volume condition demands that eligible prominent users contribute a small portion of the entire community metadata, i.e., |M(Gp
                                          ,

                                          ,

                                          ) denotes the set of metadata that were posted by the users of Gl
                                           in the time interval [ti
                                          ,

                                          )| stands for its cardinality.

The metric volume condition requires that eligible prominent users produce tweets pertaining to the selected ASM, but they amount to a small percentage of those community tweets that participate in the estimations of ASM, i.e., 0<|M(Gp
                                          ,

                                          ,
                                          tj

                                          )| stands for its cardinality. In the case of PR, the metric volume condition sets an upper bound on the portion of polarized tweets that are posted by prominent users.


                                 Rate condition. Another important aspect of real influence exertion is the temporal relationship between ASM(Gp
                                 ) and ASM(Gh
                                 ), since the content accounting for ASM(Gp
                                 ) has to chronologically precede the content that pertains to ASM(Gh
                                 ). To understand this condition, imagine a small group of users that simply follows the overall sentiment of the community and is conservative with publishing polarized tweets; this group satisfies all the above conditions and, thus, it can be mistaken for a prominent group, even though it exerts no real influence over the rest of the community.

Given an ASM, we measure the relative rate of content production between two groups during a specific time interval [t
                        1,
                        t
                        2] through the cumulative activity curve, a metric that is defined as follows:
                           Definition 4.7
                           Given an ASM along with a (sub-)community G
                              l that was active during the time interval [t
                              1,
                              t
                              2], the Cumulative Activity Curve (CAC) quantifies the production rate of the content in Gl
                               that is relevant to ASM and is defined as follows:

CAC actually takes values in the interval [0,1], with higher values indicating faster convergence to the final size of the produced content. In our settings that rely on PR, CAC expresses how fast the polarized content of a community Gh
                               (or its prominent group Gp
                              ) was produced during the time interval [t

To understand the rationale behind this measure, consider the 2-dimensional space of Fig. 2
                        : the horizontal axis (x) corresponds to time period between t
                        1 and t
                        2, and the vertical one (y) to the portion of polarized tweets. CAC essentially estimates the area under the curve that is formed by mapping to this space the value of the ratio

The exemplary data that are presented in Fig. 2 actually illustrate the three general layouts of CAC; G
                        1 represents a community that has produced most of its polarized content by the middle of the time period, taking a high CAC value: CAC(G

                        t
                        2)=0.70. In contrast, G
                        3 indicates a user group that posted the vast majority of its polarized tweets at the end of the examined time interval, taking a low CAC value: CAC(G

                        t
                        2)=0.37. In the middle of these two extremes lies G
                        2, whose polarized content is evenly distributed among the examined period, leading to a balanced value for CAC: CAC(G

Note that CAC is by definition a normalized metric. Hence, it is suitable for comparing the activity of two user groups (e.g., Gh
                         and Gp
                        ) that were active during the same time period on an equal basis: the group with earlier content production takes a higher value for CAC, regardless of the relative size of their relevant metadata.

Plugging the above five conditions together, we can now formalize the task of evaluating the performance of an influence theory as follows:
                           Problem 1
                           Given an ASM along with a topic community Gh
                               that was active during the time interval [t
                              1,
                              t
                              2], an effective local influence theory identifies as prominent group a subset Gp
                                 
                              ⊂

The stronger these conditions hold, the more effective is the influence theory.

Note that the above definition is generic enough to accommodate a wide variety of activity summary metrics. For the aforementioned reasons, we exclusively consider the polarity ratio in the following. Note also that the last two conditions should be applied only in case the other requirements hold for the prominent group(s) at hand. In fact, the first three conditions filter out prominent groups that are incompatible with our evaluation framework; we cannot draw safe conclusions about prominent users that comprise a large part of a community’s user base or influencers that are too prolific, dominating the overall or the metric-specific content of the community. The same applies to prominent groups that have not posted any relevant content for the selected ASM metric. In Section 4, we adhere to this execution order when applying our framework to the above influence theories.

In this section, we put our evaluation framework into practice, comparing the influence theories of the previous section on the basis of Problem 1. First, we document the process we followed in the creation of our large-scale, real-world benchmark dataset. Then, we examine every condition individually, in the order it should be applied. The only exception is the Size Condition: in its place, we consider the fixed set of prominent sizes k
                     ∊{10,20,50,100}. We selected this particular set of k values for a number of reasons: first, it allows for comparing the influence theories on an equal basis under several different settings. Second, every value ki
                      poses a suitable size for many applications and satisfies the condition ki
                     
                     ≪|Vh
                     | for every benchmark community Gh
                     , as explained in Section 4.1. Third, sizes of finer granularity (e.g., k
                     ∊{10,20,30,40,…}) result in negligible variations, while sizes of coarser granularity (e.g., k
                     ∊{10,100,1000,…}) miss a lot of valuable information. In contrast, the selected range results in a balanced performance variation that allows for approximating the optimal prominent size, i.e., the one that yields the best performance for Problem 1 across most of the benchmark communities.

Note that in the following, we refer to the combination of an influence theory with a specific prominent size as influence settings.

In our experimental study, we considered the Twitter dataset that was employed in Yang and Leskovec (2011). It contains more than 475 million tweets that were posted by 17 million distinct users in a time period of 7months – from the beginning of June, 2009 until the end of December, 2009. In total, it has recorded around 20–30% of the entire Twitter activity during that period, thus constituting a representative sample of Twitter activity that suffices for drawing safe conclusions about the influence patterns among its members. It lacks, however, any information about the social connections among its users.

To cover this gap, we additionally consider the graph formed by the directed links between its users. We actually use the snapshot of Twitter’s graph that was employed in Kwak, Lee, Park, and Moon (2010), which dates from August, 2009 and chronologically coincides with the crawling period of the content we are considering. As a result, we were able to join the two datasets through the usernames (i.e., Twitter accounts) they have in common – almost half of each community’s members were included in this snapshot, on average. This graph, however, lacks the temporal aspect of user connections, i.e., the exact time they were formed as well as their evolution throughout the time period we are examining content-wise. Consequently, the conclusions we draw with respect to the link structure of Twitter are an approximation of the actual phenomena.

As explained in Section 3.2, topic communities are defined through hashtags. However, the use of a hashtag does not necessarily entail any interaction with some other members of the topic community – the author may not even see other tweets with the same hashtag. To ensure a minimum level of social interaction within a topic community, we consider as eligible for our study those communities that contain:
                           
                              •
                              more than 500 internal mentions (i.e., mentions to a community member posted by a fellow member), and

at least 500 internal retweets (i.e., re-posts by community members of messages originally authored by a fellow member).

We additionally impose the following constraints in order to ensure that the communities we consider are large enough to draw safe conclusions
                           7
                           Note that all thresholds were set to a rounded value that approximates the mean one across all topic communities.
                        
                        
                           7
                        :
                           
                              •
                              it contains more than 5000 distinct tweets,

it comprises more than 500 users,

it entails more than 500 polarized tweets.

Our content dataset contains more than 49 million of tweets marked with at least one hashtag, which correspond to around 3 million distinct topics, in total. Among them, 728 communities satisfy all the aforementioned constraints. To select the most vibrant ones, we ranked them in descending order of the average number of tweets posted by each member. The higher this number is, the more active the individual members are expected to be. We then selected the top 100 ranking hashtags and carefully examined their content to ensure that they define real topic communities.

In this effort, we relied on previous works that evaluate hashtags with regard to their ability to define actual topics. In Zubiaga, Spina, Fresno, and Martínez (2011), the authors actually distinguish hashtags into those defining real-world events and the memes, the latter being conversational topics or widespread annotations that are not related to actual events. As examples consider the hashtags #ff, which serves for suggesting users to follow, and #job, which annotates tweets advertising a job opportunity. A similar approach is followed by Cui and et al. (2012). Based on this categorization, we eliminated memes from our analysis, as they are unlikely to form real topic communities and, thus, are inappropriate for our evaluation. We also eliminated hashtags that are too generic to define a topic community, such as #web, as well as ambiguous hashtags that refer to two or more topics. An example of the latter is #gr88, which stands for green revolution (the Persian calendar year being 1388), but is also used as a reference to an online casino (gr88.com). The remaining 75 topic communities, after the elimination, formed our benchmark data.
                           8
                           Note that we cannot release publicly the actual content of the communities forming our benchmark dataset, due to restrictions imposed by Twitter. A complete list of the topics it includes along with the detailed outcomes of the statistical analyses that are presented in the following can be found at: http://l3s.de/~papadakis/EvaluationFrameworkStatisticalAnalysis.xlsx.

Their technical characteristics are presented in Table 2. On average, every test-bed community was active for over 6months and comprised almost 9000 distinct members. Approximately half of these users are also included in the dataset considered in Kwak et al. (2010) which, as explained above, served as the basis for graph related information in our analysis. Each community member individually posted more than 8 tweets on average. Content-wise, every community corresponds to 80,000 tweets on average, 1/10 of which pertain to discussions between community members. The internal retweets cover 1/4 of the overall content, while 650 tweets are marked as negative and another 900 as positive. Note, though, that the higher frequency of positive tweets does not imply that the balance is in their favor across all topics. In fact, the negative tweets outnumber the positive ones in 1/3 of all communities.

This section investigates the performance of the selected influence theories with respect to the two volume conditions. We start with the metric volume condition, which measures the portion of polarized content per topic community that stems from the prominent users defined by each influence setting.
                           9
                           A similar analysis was conducted in Kardara and et al. (2012) as well, with the difference that for every influence setting, it considered the aggregate polarized content produced by the prominent groups across all topic communities. The problem with this approach is that it hides a lot of interesting information, such as the inactive and the hyperactive prominent groups. Note also that there are many typos in Table 5 of Kardara et al. (2012), because the numbers presented in the columns from 2 (Positive Tweets) to 6 (Retweets) have not been multiplied by 100, although they are presented as percentages. Disregarding these typos, the two analyses lead to similar conclusions.
                        
                        
                           9
                         In fact, our goal is to distinguish prominent groups into three major categories:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Inactive prominent groups post neither positive nor negative tweets. Thus, they do not satisfy the first part of the metric volume condition (i.e., 0<|M(Gp
                                 ,
                                 ASM,
                                 t
                                 1,
                                 t
                                 2)|) and cannot exert any real influence.


                                 Hyperactive prominent groups monopolize the polarized content of a community, producing a disproportionately high volume of positive and negative tweets. The metric volume condition does not hold for them, since their influence comes at an excessively high cost. In this study, we instantiated the second part of the metric volume condition as:

This means that we consider a prominent group as hyperactive if it produces more than 25% of the overall polarized content. In such cases, the remaining polarized content may be insufficient for drawing safe conclusions about the mood of the rest of the community members.
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Valid prominent groups are neither inactive nor hyperactive, thus satisfying the metric volume condition.

The outcomes of this analysis across all influence settings are presented in Table 3
                        . Note that in order to draw safe conclusions for Frnd
                        , we applied it 1000 times for each prominent size k, employing in each iteration a random sample of k users from every community.

We observe that the inactive prominent groups are rather scarce, as they merely appear in a dozen of topic communities for k
                        =10. With the increase of k, though, increases the contribution of influencers to the polarized content. As a result, inactive prominent groups are reduced to just 5 for k
                        =20 and completely disappear for larger prominent sizes. In the same vein, the increase in k increases the portion of hyperactive groups. In the case of Fmnt
                         and Frwt
                        , they remain a minority for prominent sizes up to 50, but become the majority for k
                        =100. The relation between the mean and the median values actually suggests that the distributions of these theories have a positive skew (i.e., towards smaller portions of polarized content). For k
                        =100, though, the mean and the median values slightly exceed our limit of 25%, thus dividing evenly the individual topic communities into valid and hyperactive ones. In contrast, the majority of the prominent groups defined by Ftwt
                         are hyperactive already for k
                        =20; for larger prominent sizes, the portion of valid prominent groups is reduced to less than 1/5. This should be expected, since its prominent users are quite prolific by definition, contributing large volumes of polarized content, as well.

Consistent exceptions to these patterns are both Find
                         and Frnd
                        : none of the prominent groups they define across all influence settings is hyperactive. Hence, they satisfy the metric volume condition in all cases – except for the few inactive groups that are defined by Find
                         for small prominent sizes.

We continue our analysis with the overall volume condition, which estimates the portion of all tweets that is authored by the prominent users. In this case, our goal is to distinguish the prominent groups into hyperactive and valid ones.
                           10
                           Note that there is no point in defining inactive prominent groups with respect to the overall volume condition. By definition, every user that participates in a community has posted at least one relevant tweet and, thus, every prominent group has produced at least as many tweets as its prominent size – regardless of the influence theory that defines it.
                        
                        
                           10
                         As hyperactive, we consider prominent users that have posted more than 25% of the overall content of the community, while the remaining prominent groups are considered valid. Apparently, among the two categories, only the valid groups of influencers are compatible with our evaluation framework.

The outcomes of this analysis are presented in Table 4
                        . Note that the performance of Frnd
                         was estimated using the same 1000 random samples of k users from each topic community as in Table 3. We observe that all theories exhibit similar behavior with the metric volume condition: all prominent groups defined by Find
                         and Frnd
                         are valid across all influence settings, while Ftwt
                         is dominated by hyperactive groups already for k
                        =20. For Fmnt
                         and Frwt
                        , the portion of hyperactive groups increases with larger prominent sizes, but is restricted to less than 1/3 for k up to 50. For k
                        =100, though, their prominent groups are evenly partitioned between valid and hyperactive ones.

On the whole, we can conclude that Ftwt
                         is incompatible with our evaluation framework; it defines hyperactive groups of influencers even for small prominent sizes, violating both volume conditions. For this reason, we exclude it from the analyses of the correlation and the rate condition. In contrast, Frnd
                         and Find
                         consistently satisfy both volume conditions across all influence settings. Fmnt
                         and Frwt
                         exhibit similar behavior, defining valid prominent groups with respect to both volume conditions across most topic communities and influence settings. To draw safe conclusions about their performance, we exclude from the remaining analyses all those communities that correspond to hyperactive groups for either influence theory and for any prominent size. Out of the 75 topic communities considered in our study, 30 of them consistently satisfy both volume conditions for the selected influence theories. We exclusively consider these communities in the following. Note, though, that Find
                         defines inactive prominent groups for some of these communities: there are 10 such communities for k
                        =10, while for k
                        =20 they are reduced to 4. In the following analyses, these communities are not taken into account when estimating the performance of Find
                        .

The goal of this section is to investigate to which extent the aggregate sentiment of prominent groups matches that of their peer community members. As explained above, we quantify this relation through the polarity ratio of the corresponding user groups. In fact, our goal is to estimate the correlation between PR(Gh
                        ) and PR(Gp
                        ) across all benchmark communities for all influence settings.

To this end, we first defined two variables for every influence theory Fi
                         and prominent size kl
                        : Xi
                        
                        ,
                        
                           l
                         denotes the polarity ratio of the corresponding prominent groups over the 30 valid topic communities, while Yi
                        
                        ,
                        
                           l
                         represents the polarity ratio of the remaining community members. We then estimated the Pearson correlation coefficient

                           The Pearson correlation coefficient ρX

                               is an established metric that expresses the linear dependency between two variables X and Y. It takes values in the interval [−1,1], with higher absolute values corresponding to a stronger correlation between X and Y. In fact, a value of |ρX

                         is, the stronger holds the correlation condition for the corresponding influence settings.

The results of our analysis are presented in Table 5
                        . A detailed breakdown of PR(Gh
                        ) and PR(Gp
                        ) per topic community for the influence settings we are considering is given in Appendix A. Note that for Frnd
                         and for each prominent size k, we considered the same 1000 random samples of k users from every community that were used in the previous section.

We observe that there is a positive correlation for all influence settings, which increases proportionally with the increase of k: the larger the prominent groups are, the larger is the portion of polarized tweets they produce and, thus, the closer is their aggregate sentiment to that of the entire community (see next section for more details). We can deduce, therefore, that small prominent groups are less accurate in predicting the overall mood of their peers.

Comparing the individual influence theories across the four prominent sizes, we observe that the correlation coefficient for Frnd
                         is lower than the other influence theories by 1/3 across most prominent sizes; there is a single exception for k
                        =10, where Fmnt
                         exhibits an even lower correlation. Frtw
                         and Find
                         take similar values in most cases, followed by Fmnt
                         in close distance. The overall highest value corresponds to Frtw
                         and is very close to 1, denoting an almost linear relationship between the aggregate sentiment of the prominent users and the rest of the community.

In the following section, we examine whether these correlations emanate from prominent users’ tweets that chronologically precede those of their peer members.

In this section, we evaluate the rate condition using the 30 topic communities that are valid for the selected four influence theories across all prominent sizes. Remember that this condition expresses the relative rate of polarized activity between the prominent groups and the rest of the communities and is defined as follows: CAC(Gp

                                 .
                              
                           
                        
                     

Apparently, the rate condition holds only for a positive CAC deviation (ΔCAC
                        >0), with higher values indicating a stronger “early adopter’” effect for the influencers.

The distribution of ΔCAC across all influence settings is summarized in Table 6
                        . Note that the rightmost column, named Pos.Com., expresses the number of communities where ΔCAC takes positive values.

For Frnd
                        , we used the usual 1000 random samples per topic community and prominent size. We observe that its median and its mean ΔCAC take negative values in all cases. The same applies to its maximum values for k
                        =10 and k
                        =20. Inevitably, Pos.Com. is zero for these prominent sizes, indicating that the polarized activity of the influencers defined by Frnd
                         chronologically follows that of the common members across all topic communities. Hence, the former exert no real influence over the latter. Pos.Com. actually demonstrates that Frnd
                         defines real prominent groups only for large prominent sizes and for a handful of communities. Still, these cases correspond to very low ΔCAC, thus suggesting that their chronological advance is rather limited.

Regarding the remaining influence theories, Pos.Com. indicates that they consistently define real prominent groups for at least 2/3 of the considered communities. The only exception is Find
                         for k
                        =10, which defines real influencers for just 16 topic communities; this is caused, however, by the inactive prominent groups that are present in 10 of the selected communities. We also observe that the maximum value of Fmnt
                        , Frtw
                         and Find
                         decreases with the increase of prominent size, while the minimum one increases. This means that the larger their prominent groups are, the smaller is the variance of ΔCAC across the 30 topic communities and the more consistent their behavior becomes. Also remarkable is the monotonic decrease in the value of their median and mean ΔCAC with the increase of prominent size. This pattern advocates that the larger prominent groups defined by Fmnt
                        , Frtw
                         and Find
                        , the less agile they are in forecasting the overall mood of their community. Finally, it is worth noting that Find
                         consistently outperforms Fmnt
                         and Frtw
                         across all prominent sizes, achieving higher values for all statistical measures.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The above analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of the selected local influence theories.

First of all, it reveals that Frnd
                         fails to capture real influence exertion. The main reason is that it is oblivious to the activity of individual users, defining influencers without taking any qualitative information into account. Its behavior with respect to the rate condition advocates that the positive correlations reported in Table 5 cannot be attributed to the “early adopter” effect. Instead, they merely demonstrate that the prominent users defined by Frnd
                         follow the polarized activity of their peers.

Second, our analysis verifies that Fmnt
                        , Frtw
                         and Find
                         exhibit real influence exertion under most settings. In fact, the conditions of our framework reveal the following patterns for these theories: the larger the prominent size is, the more content their influencers produce and the more close their polarized content is to the aggregate sentiment of the remaining community. This comes, however, at the cost of delayed polarized activity, as the corresponding prominent users are less timely in predicting the mood of the community.

Third, our analysis highlights the relative performance of these three influence theories. The influencers of Frtw
                         excel in approximating the community’s aggregate sentiment, while those of Find
                         yield the timeliest predictions. In both cases, Fmnt
                         follows in close distance. It is worth noting that Find
                         manages to have so competitive a performance, despite the lower (by two orders of magnitude) volume of polarized and general content its influencers produce in comparison with those of Fmnt
                         and Frtw
                        . Apparently, this performance should be attributed to the large audience of its influencers; even though they post a negligible number of polarized tweets, they are able to reach a large part of the community.

Finally, our analysis demonstrates that Ftwt
                         is incompatible with our evaluation framework; for most topic communities, the overwhelming activity of its influencers violates both volume conditions – even for small prominent sizes.

In the following section, we investigate the internal functionality of all five influence theories in an effort to explain the aforementioned performance patterns.

This section introduces a methodology for the internal analysis of local influence theories, i.e., for examining the dynamics that occur inside the prominent groups they define. This methodology considers three aspects of the relations among prominent users:
                        
                           (i)
                           their homophily, as inferred from the reciprocal links among them,

their affinity, in terms of the frequency of their communication, and

the versatility of their activity, as indicated by the overlap patterns among the prominent groups of different theories.

The ultimate goal of this methodology is twofold: (i) to explain the relative performance of influence theories, as documented in the previous section, and (ii) to approximate the optimal prominent size, which achieves high performance across most influence theories.

Twitter users are free to post messages on any topic at any time, thus forming topic communities on-the-fly. As a result, community members are not necessarily linked with explicit edges on the social graph. In fact, the links in Eh
                         are likely to represent relationships formed outside the community Gh
                        , a situation that indicates people that have more things in common than just the interest in topic h. In the same vein, reciprocal links
                           12
                           In Twitter, two users are reciprocally connected to each other, if they follow one another.
                        
                        
                           12
                         signal users that share even higher levels of homophily, i.e., similar personal backgrounds in socially significant ways (Weng et al., 2010).

The goal of this section is to examine the levels of homophily that are shared by the prominent users of each influence theory. We can infer this information from the topology of Ep
                        : densely linked sub-graphs indicate strong similarities among users, and vice versa. To this end, we estimated for all influence settings the reciprocity of the corresponding prominent groups by calculating the portion of pairs of prominent users that are reciprocally connected. Formally, the reciprocity of a prominent group Gp
                         is defined as follows:
                           
                              
                                 reciprocity

                        where the nominator estimates the number of existing reciprocal links, while the denominator amounts to the total number of possible reciprocal links inside Gp
                         (i.e., all distinct pair-wise combinations of prominent users). Reciprocity takes values in the interval [0,100], with higher values corresponding to higher portions of reciprocal links. The results of our analysis are summarized in Table 7
                        .

Note that for Frnd
                         and for every prominent size, we repeated our measurements over the same 1000 random samples that were used in Section 4. We observe that its behavior remains relatively stable across all values of k: the median reciprocity lies close to 5% and the mean one close to 6% in all cases. Therefore, the prominent users defined by Frnd
                         share negligible levels of homophily.

Regarding Find
                        , we notice that its prominent groups exhibit substantially lower levels of reciprocity than Frnd
                        . This clearly indicates that the most popular users inside a topic community typically share little common background.

In contrast, the reciprocity values of Fmnt
                        , Frtw
                        , and Ftwt
                         are much higher than that of Frnd
                        . The maximum values actually correspond to Fmnt
                         and Frtw
                        , with Ftwt
                         following it in close distance. In all cases, reciprocity reaches its peak for k
                        =10 and decreases proportionally with the increase of the prominent size. This means that the quadratic increase of its denominator (i.e., pairs of prominent users) is larger than the increase of its numerator (i.e., reciprocally connected prominent users). For k
                        =100, the reciprocity of these three theories actually gets rather close to Frnd
                         – especially with respect to the median values. This implies that members of large prominent groups share the same average levels of homophily as any random pair of users. We can, thus, consider the prominent size of k
                        =50 as the critical limit, above which the notion of prominent groups is degenerated.

On the whole, we can conclude that the prominent groups of Fmnt
                        , Frtw
                        , and Ftwt
                         exhibit high levels of homophily for sizes up to 50, forming prominent groups with a densely connected graph structure. This applies neither to Frnd
                         nor to Find
                         – regardless of the prominent size.

This section seeks to measure the affinity among prominent users, i.e., the extent to which they know each other and socialize together. As a means of interaction, we consider the reference from one user to another. In the context of Twitter, this is exclusively done through the annotated tweets, which come in the form of mentions and retweets. We can reasonably assume that the more a Twitter user “refers” to another one, the closer is the affinity between them. Therefore, our goal is to examine whether prominent users are more likely to “refer” to their fellow influencers than to other members of the same community. To quantify this idea, we employ the following two measures:
                           Definition 6.1
                           Given a topic community Gh
                               and its prominent group Gp
                              , the internal mention probability (Pim
                              ) expresses how likely it is for a prominent user in Gp
                               to mention a fellow member of the prominent group. It is defined as follows:

Both metrics are defined in the interval [0,100], with higher values corresponding to more frequent interactions among influencers. Therefore, the higher these probabilities are, the stronger is the affinity between the prominent users.

We calculated these probabilities over all topic communities for the usual influence settings. For Frnd
                        , we considered the usual 1000 groups of k random users per topic community. Note that, by definition, there is a strong bias between Pim
                         and Fmnt
                         as well as between Pir
                         and Frtw
                        : influencers with high mention (retweet) rate within the community are also expected to be frequently mentioned (retweeted) by their peer prominent users, thus leading to a tautological observation. Nevertheless, we include these combinations in our analysis in order to provide an indication of the maximum possible probabilities.

The outcomes of our evaluation are presented in Table 8
                        . Looking at the results, we observe that Frnd
                         takes very low values for both probabilities across all prominent sizes: its median value is equal or very close to 0, while its mean one increases in proportion with k, but remains lower than 3% in all cases. This behavior demonstrates the insignificant levels of interaction between randomly selected prominent users, as they are more likely to “refer” to community members outside their prominent group.

On the other extreme lie Fmnt
                         and Frtw
                        , which take the highest – by far – values for both probabilities across all prominent sizes. In all cases, their median value is almost identical to the mean one, thus indicating normal distributions over the 75 communities. For Pim
                        , Frtw
                         takes values 10% to 20% lower than the maximum ones (i.e., those of the tautology of Fmnt
                        ). A similar pattern is exhibited for Pir
                        , where Fmnt
                         lies within 10% of the tautology of Frtw
                        . In every case, the larger the prominent size is, the higher the corresponding probabilities are. In fact, for k
                        =10 and k
                        =20, their median and average probabilities take values lower than 50%, thus indicating moderate levels of affinity between prominent users. Higher prominent sizes, though, yield higher median and average probabilities, which exceed 50% to a considerable extent. This implies a rather strong affinity, as prominent users are more likely to refer to a fellow influencer than to any other member of their community.

In the middle of these two extremes lie Ftwt
                         and Find
                        , which exhibit similar behavior for both probabilities – regardless of the prominent size. For k
                        =10, they are closer to Frnd
                        , as their median and mean values are lower than half the difference between Frnd
                         and Fmnt
                        /Frtw
                        . For larger k, though, the affinity patterns among their prominent users are extensively reinforced, bridging the gap with Fmnt
                         and Frtw
                         to some extent. Nevertheless, their values for both Pim
                         and Pir
                         rarely exceed 50%, thus indicating that the influencers they identify are more likely to interact with the rest of the community than between them. We can deduce, therefore, that on average, these two theories exhibit moderate affinity patterns for large prominent sizes.

To understand the variations of Pim
                         and Pir
                         across the individual communities, we examined the effect of community size on them. In general, we expect that the more members a community encompasses, the lower is the probability for a prominent user to interact with another influencer. To examine this assumption, we estimated the Pearson correlation between the community size and the probabilities Pim
                         and Pir
                         across all communities and prominent sizes. The results demonstrate a clearly negative: the correlation coefficient fluctuates between −0.20 and −0.45, with the lower values corresponding to larger prominent sizes. This pattern applies to all influence theories for both Pim
                         and Pir
                         and is particularly intensive for Find
                         and Frnd
                        .

On the whole, we can conclude that the influencers of Fmnt
                         and Frtw
                         form tightly coupled sub-groups with frequent references to each other, especially for prominent sizes larger than k
                        =20. In contrast, the prominent users of Frnd
                         have practically no ties between them, unless large prominent sizes are considered. Finally, Ftwt
                         and Find
                         define prominent groups with moderate affinity that increases in proportion with k.

In this section, we investigate whether different influence theories consider the same users as influencers in the context of the individual topic communities. Given that every theory captures a different aspect of a community, the prominent users shared by two of them correspond to highly influential members with versatile activity, thus affecting their peers in multiple ways. To investigate this aspect, we consider cross-theory overlaps, i.e., the portion of common users among the prominent groups of the same community and prominent size that are defined by different influence theories.

To measure the cross-theory overlaps, we employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Given two prominent groups of equal size,

                        In essence, Jaccard similarity expresses the portion of users that are common among the input groups. It takes values in the interval [0,100], with higher values denoting higher overlap.

Note that we had to exclude Frnd
                         from our analysis, since it does not provide any useful insights; its overlap with any other theory is random by definition. For the remaining influence theories, we considered the 6 possible pair-wise combinations, computing the overlap between their prominent groups for the usual four prominent sizes across all communities. In total, we have 24 different combinations of prominent sizes and pairs of influence theories. The outcomes of our analysis are presented in Table 9
                        .

We start with the pair of theories that corresponds to the highest similarity, namely Fmnt
                         and Frtw
                        . Their minimum overlap exceeds 0 in all cases, which means that they share at least one influencer for every individual topic – regardless of the prominent size. In most of the cases, their median overlap is equal to the average of the minimum and the maximum ones, a strong indication of a normal distribution across the individual communities. This evidence is also advocated by the fact that the median value is almost identical with the mean one across all k. In absolute numbers, both metrics exceed 25% in all cases, thus suggesting that on average, 1/4 of the prominent users immersing themselves into discussions with other community members generate content of high value, which is propagated to a wide audience, and vice versa. This is consistent with the intuitive perception that both criteria are indicative of a user’s ability to trigger a direct reaction from fellow users.

On the other hand, the lowest similarity consistently corresponds to Find
                         and Ftwt
                        . For k lower than 50, their median Jaccard similarity is 0, thus suggesting that there is a cross-theory overlap solely for a handful of communities. Even for these communities, the overlap of the prominent groups remains rather low, taking a maximum value of 20% and a mean one of less than 3%. For larger prominent sizes, most metrics increase proportionally, with the mean one reaching 6% for k
                        =100. Therefore, even for the largest prominent groups, only 1/20 of the most popular users are among the most prolific of the community members. This means that popular users do no need to overwhelm the community with large volumes of content in order to ensure their high levels of influence.

In the middle of these two extremes lie the overlaps of Fmnt
                         and Frwt
                         with Frnd
                         and Find
                        . All four combinations exhibit highly similar behavior – regardless of the prominent size. They all indicate a normal distribution across the 75 communities, as the mean overlap is very close to the median one as well as to the average of the minimum and the maximum value. In absolute numbers, the mean overlap fluctuates between 12% and 18%, with the higher values corresponding to higher prominent sizes. This implies that on average, around 1/6 of the k most prolific or popular users are heavily cited or discussed, with their portion increasing slightly with the increase of k. These overlap patterns, which remain relatively stable across all prominent sizes, are also consistent with earlier evidence that was derived after examining the relations between Find
                        , Fmnt
                         and Ftwt out of context (i.e., over the entire social graph of Twitter and over the entire activity of its users) (Cha et al., 2010).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The outcomes of our internal analysis suggest that influence theories can be distinguished into three main categories.

The first one includes those influence theories that define prominent groups with strong ties among their members. Their prominent users are acquainted with each other, forming tightly connected groups with an organized, uniform behavior that exerts significant influence over the rest of the community. These internal dynamics facilitate the collaboration between influencers, enabling them to maximize their influence and to achieve high performance with respect to our evaluation framework. Fig. 3
                         visualizes these dynamics. Among the theories examined in Section 4, Fmnt
                         and Frtw
                         fall under this category. Their prominent users share high levels of homophily (especially for prominent sizes k
                        ⩽50) and high levels of affinity (especially for prominent sizes k
                        ⩾50). Part of them also exhibits a highly versatile activity, contributing heavily to the content and the discussions of the topic community as well as to the promotion of personal opinions. These patterns are intensified for prominent groups with 50 members, thus providing a reliable approximation of the optimal prominent size.

The second category comprises influence theories that identify as prominent users individually powerful members who fail to form a team with their fellow influencers. The reason is that they share low levels of homophily, they interact with each other to a limited extent and their activity within the community is typically unilateral, exhibiting low versatility. These internal dynamics are depicted in Fig. 4
                        , demonstrating that the influencers defined by these theories rarely operate in collaboration. To this category belong Find
                         and Ftwt
                        . The latter is incompatible with our evaluation framework, but the former achieved high effectiveness. Its influencers are rather parsimonious with the content they contribute to the community, yet they are able to predict accurately and on-time certain aspects of the community’s activity.

Finally, the third category entails those influence theories that define prominent users who form a team only by euphemism. They do not associate with each other, as they are highly likely to be unknown to each other or to have different social backgrounds (i.e., absence of homophily). They also appear to be rather indifferent to the activity of the community, as they rarely excel in any of its aspects. It is no wonder, therefore, that they fail to synchronize and collectively influence their peers, thus yielding rather low effectiveness with respect to our evaluation framework – regardless of the prominent size. In our study, this category is exemplified through Frnd
                        . The dynamics of its prominent groups are illustrated in Fig. 5
                        .

Another point worth considering is whether our findings for Twitter (i.e. influential individuals affecting the sentiment of a topic community) translate to actual influence in the real world. Previous studies O’Connor et al. (2010) and Abbasi, Chai, Liu, and Sagoo (2012) suggest that the sentiment expressed in social media is strongly correlated with the opinions of people in the real world to such an extent that sentiment detection in social media could act as a surrogate for polls. From that point of view, it seems that influential social media users can have an effect on the opinions of the general population.

To clarify the comparison between real and online world and to further elucidate the results of our analysis, we examine the prominent users defined by each influence theory in terms of their real-world status and identities – where applicable. Two topic communities were selected for this purpose
                           13
                           The top 20 influencers of each theory for all topic communities can be found at: http://l3s.de/~papadakis/EvaluationFrameworkStatisticalAnalysis.xlsx.
                        
                        
                           13
                        : #iranelection, which refers to the Iran presidential election held on 12 June 2009, and #noh8, which pertains to the NOH8 Campaign, promoting marriage, gender and human equality. Their prominent groups for k
                        =20 are listed in Tables 10 and 11
                        
                        , respectively.

Starting with #iranelection, we observe that the prominent group of Frtw
                         consists almost entirely of journalists, bloggers and activists, the majority of whom is Iranian. The prominent group defined by Find
                         contains an equally high amount of news agencies and journalists/political bloggers. The influencers of Fmnt
                         are similar with those of Frtw
                         with the addition of few random users and seemingly unrelated celebrities. The prominent group of Frtw
                         seems to be the least relevant, merely containing a handful of accounts that are associated with Iran and the Green movement. An interesting observation is that two accounts are selected as influencers by all theories, except for Ftwt
                        : oxfordgirl and persiankiwi. Both of them correspond to ordinary users from Iran, who were previously unknown, but gained reputation as reliable sources on the topic through their dedication and active participation in the community. It is also worth noting that a large part of this community’s influencers (including oxfordgirl and persiankiwi) also appear in the prominent groups of relevant topics, such as #neda.

For #noh8, we observe that Find
                        , Fmnt
                         and Frtw
                         contain an equal mix of celebrities and random users along with few accounts that belong to human rights organizations fighting against discrimination. Under closer examination, though, most of the random users appear to be gay activists or people with strong participation in gender equality issues. Again, the Ftwt
                         theory produces the least relevant results, with more than two thirds of the accounts being disabled or suspended at the moment, a strong indication that they exhibited spamming or marketing behavior. It is also worth mentioning that there is no overlap between the prominent groups of the two topic communities across all influence theories.

The above findings are consistent with the results of the previous analyses, which demonstrate that Find
                         and Frtw
                         are the most reliable methods for detecting influencers, while Ftwt
                         does not convey real influence (Purohit et al., 2012). We can deduce, therefore, that Find

                         incorporate different, but equally important types of evidence, with the former considering users’ popularity as a reliable estimation of their influence and the latter relying on their ability to produce interesting content. Finally, it is important to stress that influence appears to be context-specific, since there is negligible or no overlap between the prominent groups of different communities, unless the corresponding topics are semantically related.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we proposed an evaluation framework for assessing the relative effectiveness of topic-specific influence theories. Its goal is to examine whether these theories identify as influencers small groups of users who are able to affect certain, objectively measurable aspects of a community with minimal effort. Two assumptions lie at the core of our framework:
                        
                           i.
                           Each topic community is defined by the same hashtag throughout its lifetime and, thus, it involves members that are not necessarily connected with explicit links on the social graph, while excluding those using another hashtag for the same topic.

Each community involves a substantial portion of polarized messages.

In this context, our framework defines five necessary and sufficient conditions that an effective influence theory should satisfy across a series of topic communities. The first three encapsulate prerequisites that filter out theories yielding oversized or overwhelming influencers. For the other two conditions, we introduced evaluation metrics that estimate the semantic and chronological relation between the average sentiment of influencers and the remaining community. Both are based on emoticons for identifying the expression of sentiment, an approach that was preferred over more advanced sentiment analysis techniques, which are also compatible with our framework.

To demonstrate the use of our framework, we evaluated the relative effectiveness of five established topic-specific influence theories for Twitter, namely Ftwt
                     ,
                     Frnd
                     ,
                     Fmnt
                     , Frtw
                      and Find
                     . We applied them on a large-scale, real-world dataset that comprises 75 topic communities defined by hashtags, with each one involving 80,000 tweets and almost 9000 users, on average. The outcomes of our analysis indicate that Ftwt
                      is incompatible with our framework, while Frnd
                      defines groups that exert no real influence over their peers. In contrast, Fmnt
                     , Frtw
                      and Find
                      exhibit high effectiveness across most theories. To shed light on our experimental results, we introduced a novel methodology for examining the internal dynamics of the prominent groups of each theory. The outcomes of this analysis suggest that influence theories can be classified in three main categories with respect to the interactions among their prominent users. The first one involves theories that define coherent prominent groups, whose members operate as a team, sharing high levels of homophily and affinity. The other two categories select as influencers unrelated individuals that do not operate in coordination; they differ, though, in the quality of their prominent users, i.e., whether they are ordinary community members, or they excel in some aspect of the community’s activity.

In the future, we intend to explore ways of generalizing our conclusions on Twitter to other OSNs. In addition, we plan to investigate possible methods for combining Fmnt
                     , Frtw
                      and Find
                      into a single, comprehensive theory that outperforms in effectiveness the individual theories comprising it.
