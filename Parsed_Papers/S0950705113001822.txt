                  The vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is a common policy in supply chain management (SCM) to reduce bullwhip effects. Although different applications of VMI have been proposed in the literature, the multi-vendor multi-retailer single-warehouse (MV-MR-SW) case has not been investigated yet. This paper develops a constrained MV-MR-SW supply chain, in which both the space and the annual number of orders of the central warehouse are limited. The goal is to find the order quantities along with the number of shipments received by retailers and vendors such that the total inventory cost of the chain is minimized. Since the problem is formulated into an integer nonlinear programming model, the meta-heuristic algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO) is presented to find an approximate optimum solution of the problem. In the proposed PSO algorithm, a genetic algorithm (GA) with an improved operator, namely the boundary operator, is employed as a local searcher to turn it to a hybrid PSO. In addition, since no benchmark is available in the literature, the GA with the boundary operator is proposed as well to solve the problem and to verify the solution. After employing the Taguchi method to calibrate the parameters of both algorithms, their performances in solving some test problems are compared in terms of the solution quality.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In today’s global markets, supply chain management (SCM) plays an important role to integrate different parts of organizations and companies in order to achieve better performances. SCM is a set of approaches used to efficiently integrate suppliers, manufactures, warehouses, and stores, so that merchandise is produced and distributed at the right quantities, to the right locations, and the right time, in order to minimize system-wide costs while satisfying service level requirements [44].

Inventory is one of the key factors in SCM. In a supply chain, undesirable or fluctuating inventory, referred to the bullwhip effect, may even make companies to go near bankruptcy [9,44]. Although there are several strategies in retailer–supplier partnerships such as quick response, continuous partnerships, and advanced continuous replenishments, the vendor-managed inventory (VMI) policy has shown to have the best performances in many companies [8,44]. VMI is a strategy based on which suppliers (or vendors) manage buyers’ (or retailers’) inventory level such that the chain total inventory cost is minimized.

Information technology is required in VMI to share retailers’ sales and inventory information with vendors. The obtained information is used to schedule deliveries, program production, and determine the amount of the orders and inventory levels such that total inventory cost is minimized. The possible benefits of the VMI models include reduction of inventory costs for the supplier and the retailer and improvement of customers’ service levels [1]. Wal-Mart, Kmart, and JC-Penny are just a few examples of successful companies that took advantage of the VMI policy [43].

Although the classical economic order quantity (EOQ) and economic production quantity (EPQ) [2,48] due to their simple and easy to understand natures have been the most employed inventory model in VMI implementation, some researchers extended them in order to bring the models closer to reality based on real-world constraints. While there are several constraints in an inventory system, in this research, the number of orders and the warehouse capacity in a multi-vendor multi-retailer VMI problem are assumed limited. In other words, a supply chain problem consisting of several vendors and several retailers with a single constrained-capacity central warehouse is investigated in which the number of orders is limited. The objective is to determine the order quantity and number of shipments received by retailers and vendors in a cycle so as the total inventory cost of the chain is minimized. Since the proposed model of the problem is shown to be of an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) type and is difficult to be solved by exact methods, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) is presented for an approximate optimum solution. Moreover, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed as well to evaluate and verify the solution. In order to have better solutions, the parameters of both algorithms are tuned by the Taguchi method. Furthermore, in order to improve the performances of the employed meta-heuristics, a new operator, namely the boundary operator, is added to the GA; while the improved GA is employed as a local searcher for the PSO called the hybrid PSO.

The structure of the rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section illustrates the application, the motivation, and the contribution of the paper. A review of the literatures and the notations used to model the problem are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. The problem along with its assumptions is introduced in Section 5. The mathematical model of the problem is developed in Section 6 and the solution methodologies are described in Section 7. Subsequently, the Taguchi method is employed in Section 8 to calibrate the parameters of the solution methods. The performances of the meta-heuristic algorithms and their improvements are compared in Section 9 using some illustrative examples. Finally, conclusions and recommendations for future research are given in the last section.

VMI is a common practice in production–distribution systems to both reduce bullwhip effects and to decrease costs. There are many successful companies such as JC-Penny and Wal-Mart that took advantage of VMI [43]. The retailer–supplier partnerships in the VMI can be classified into three classes of namely single-vendor single-retailer, single-vendor multi-retailer, and multi-vendor multi-retailer. Although different applications of VMI have been proposed in the literature, the multi-vendor multi-retailer (MV-MR) case has not been investigated yet. Indeed, it is quite possible to have a production–distribution system with several vendors and retailers. An appliance factory is just an example where its agencies and customers are called vendor and the retailer, respectively. In these cases, although a shared central warehouse can be an important part of a VMI problem, most of the research works in VMI models have not considered it yet (see Table 1
                     ). Therefore, in this research, a multi-vendor multi-retailer single warehouse (MV-MR-SW) supply chain problem in VMI environment is investigated in order to reduce the bullwhip effect and to minimize the total cost of the supply chain.

To be more specific, the first contribution of this paper is to consider a constrained MV-MR VMI problem with a central warehouse. The second novelty of this paper is to improve the performances of two different parameter-tuned meta-heuristic algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA), with a new local searcher and a new operator, respectively. These algorithms are employed in order to find a near optimum solution of the complex problem.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The vendor-managed inventory is a well-known strategy in supply-chain inventory management in which there is retailer–supplier partnerships. Determination of when and how much to replenish is the key issue in the VMI model. Marqu’s et al. [32] provided a good survey of literature on VMI. Goyal [16] first developed an inventory model for a single-vendor single-buyer production inventory system, in which the vendor’s lot size was an integer multiple of the purchaser’s order size. He then extended his model for single-vendor multi-buyer, where the effect of production rate in computing average inventory was ignored [17]. Moreover, Lu [30] presented a heuristic approach to solve a single-vendor multiple-buyer integrated inventory problem. Whereas Goyal [16,17] and Lu [30] considered the inventory models in which the shipment sizes all are equal, Hill [20] demonstrated an optimal policy if shipment sizes vary. Later, Hill and Omar [21] extend the model to the case where shipments sizes may differ. Based on the ‘consignment stock’ (CS) case, Braglia and Zavanella [3] extended Hill’s [20] model to be applicable in supply chains consisting of a single-vendor and a single-buyer. In the CS case, the retailer pays the vendor for each item he sells. CS is a stock legally owned by the vendor, but held by the retailer. In other words, ownership of CS is passed only when the stock is sold. As a result, remaining stocks may be returned to the vendor. Using the CS case, Zavanella and Zanoni [54] extended Braglia and Zavanella’s model [3] for the case of one-vendor multi-buyer production–distribution system.

Dong and Xu [11] employed the EOQ policy in a VMI environment based on deterministic demand and lead-times. The benefits of using the VMI approach in transportation cost savings of a supply chain were demonstrated by Disney et al. [10]. Yao et al. [51] studied a VMI model for one supplier and one buyer using the EOQ policy. Darwish and Odah [6] considered a VMI model for one-vendor multi-retailer supply chain problem in which the vendor incurs a penalty cost for items exceeding definite bounds. They provided a heuristic algorithm to find the optimal solution that would reduce the computational efforts significantly. Duan et al. [26] presented an inventory model for a one-vendor one-buyer supply chain problem with a fixed lifetime product in which the quantity discount policy was applied. Zammori et al. [53] defined a standard structure of a VMI agreement that can guide personnel involved in the initial definition of the agreement.

Pasandideh et al. [37] considered a supply chain, in which one supplier manages retailer’s inventory for multi products. In this problem, shortages were backordered and the supplier storage capacity along with the total number of orders for all products was limited. They formulated the VMI problem into an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) problem and proposed a GA to solve it. Later, Cárdenas et al. [4] provided a simple and better algorithm to solve the problem introduced by Pasandideh et al. [37]. However, both of these VMI strategies did not consider the replenishment frequency. In other words, it is reasonable to assume that the supplier delivers a lot of size Qi
                      to a retailer in n shipments of size qi
                      each [51]. Nonetheless, the replenishment frequency was considered in Sadeghi et al. [40] work in which an INLP model was derived and a parameter-tuned GA was developed to solve the model. The tuning approach of their research was the response surface methodology (RSM).

Since the parameters of meta-heuristic algorithms affect the quality of the solution obtained, it is necessary to calibrate them, particularly when their performances are compared. However, this approach was not used by Sue-Ann et al. [46], where they proposed a PSO and two GAs to find an approximate optimum solution of the mathematical model derived [34]. Table 1 contains a summary of some relevant research works performed in VMI environments.

The novelty of this paper is twofold. First, it is one of the pioneer research works that investigates a constrained multi-vendor multi-retailer supply chain problem; a closer to reality problem that may occur in many organizations and companies. Second, two different parameter-tuned meta-heuristic algorithms with improved operators are applied to solve the problem.

In this strategy, a retailer’s order cost is smaller than his order cost when no-VMI strategy is used [51]. When the jth retailer’s inventory goes down to the reorder point Rj
                     , a batch of size qij
                      is ordered to ith vendor. Moreover, the demands are known and deterministic, extra demand is lost, and no surplus shipment is allowed. It is assumed that retailers sell all the products received from the vendors; thus, the annual demand of the product for vendor i is obtained by the summation of all retailers’ demands that are supplied by vendor i, that is

The goal is to find the order quantities along with the number of shipments received by retailers and vendors such that the total inventory cost of the chain is minimized.

In this research, the replenishment (consumption) interval for all retailers that are supplied by a specific vendor is assumed unique; that is Tij

The total inventory cost (TC) of the VMI supply chain problem under investigation consists of the total ordering cost of the retailers (TOCR
                     ), the total holding cost of the retailers (THCR
                     ), total ordering cost of the vendors (TOCv
                     ), total holding cost of the vendors (THCv
                     ), total ordering cost of the warehouse (TOCw
                     ), and total holding cost of the warehouse (THCw

                     Since the integer nonlinear programming (INLP) problem in (19) is analytically hard to solve, in the next section, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented to find its approximate optimal solution.

While there may exist several reasons in selecting a meta-heuristic algorithm to solve a problem, their capability in solving NP-complete problems is the one of the most important one in the selection process. The INLP problem in (19), especially in its large-scale form, is difficult or even impossible to solve with exact methods [24]. Some researchers such as Farahani and Elahipanah [13] and Nachiappan and Jawahar [34] illustrated incapability of exact methods to solve INLP problems with respect to their computational time, and hence proposed evolutionary algorithms (EA) to solve them. Other researchers such as Maiti et al. [31] and Pasandideh et al. [37] employed genetic algorithm (GA) to solve an INLP model as well. An evolutionary approach like GA, because of flexibility and capability was used in many other supply chain problems. For instance, some researchers such as Nachiappan and Jawahar [34], Michaelraj and Shahabudeen [33], Lin et al. [29], Gupta et al. [18], and Yang et al. [50] considered supply chains including a single-warehouse and multi-retailer, formulated the problem into an INLP model, and proposed GAs to solve it. Moreover, Kuo and Han [25] presented GA and PSO as solution algorithms. The multi-vendor, multi-retailer issue also can be solved using bi-level/tri-level programming technique. For instance, Gao et al. [14] employed a PSO to solve two bi-level pricing problems in a supply chain with a buyer (the leader) and a vendor (the follower). For applications of the GA algorithm in finding an approximate optimal solution of other optimization problems one may refer to [25].

In this research, a PSO is used to obtain an approximate optimal solution of the problem in (19). Since no benchmark is available to assess its capability, a GA is employed for verification. Moreover, the parameters of both algorithms are calibrated using the Taguchi method. In addition, the meta-heuristics are improved in Section 9.1.

The PSO algorithm that mimics social behavior of bird flock or fish school, is a computational method that was first developed by Kennedy and Eberhart [23]. Similar to GA, PSO is a powerful population-based search algorithm. While different variations of PSO were used in the literature to optimize various supply chain problems (interested readers are referred to [38,45,49] for more details), the detailed procedure of the PSO used in this research is shown in Fig. 2

Note that large and small momentum components facilitate finding global and local search, respectively [41,42]. Further, the best position is defined by the objective value; in addition, the velocity of a particle is improved by considering its previous best position and the previous best position of its companions.

In an iteration of the PSO (denoted by gen), the velocity of the ith particle in jth dimension is obtained by [52]

                        2, and the number of particles (Np
                        ) are found using the Taguchi method explained in Section 8.1. Moreover, the algorithm stops after a fixed number of iterations obtained by the Taguchi calibration method.

As mentioned previously, since there is no benchmark available in the literature to evaluate the performance of the PSO, in the next section a GA is developed as well to verify the results obtained by PSO.

Since GAs are strong tools for solving INLP problems [22], in this section, a GA is utilized to solve the problem in (19) as well. GAs were formally introduced by John Holland in the 1960 [22], but the custom form of the GA was presented by Goldberg in the 1989 [33]. The steps of the GA used in this research follow [15]:
                           
                              1. Set the parameters (the population size Npop
                                 , the crossover probability Pc
                                 , the mutation probability Pm
                                 , stopping criteria, the selection strategy, the crossover operation, the mutation operation, and the number of generations.) Some of these parameters are calibrated using the Taguchi method in Section 8.1.

2. A chromosome is a ((2×
                                 v)+1) dimensional vector containing the quantities of the products dispatched by the vendors (qi1
                                 ;
                                 i
                                 =1,2,…,
                                 v, see Eq. (2)), the number of shipments received by retailers from vendor i, (ni
                                 ), and annual replenishment frequency of vendors supplied by the warehouse (m). Moreover, since real number encoding reduces the amount of computation involved in GA due to not requiring a decoding process, in this paper the chromosome is presented by real number encoding (see Fig. 3
                                 ).

3. An initial population containing Npop
                                  chromosomes is randomly generated. The chromosomes that do not satisfy the constraints (21) are infeasible and are penalized using the death penalty method. The penalty method changes a constrained optimization problem to an unconstrained optimization by associating a penalty or cost with all constraint violations. This penalty is included in the objective function evaluation.

4. Genetic operators such as crossover and mutation generate the next population. The two-point crossover operator that is shown in Fig. 4
                                  for say a 2-retailer 2-vendor one-warehouse supply chain is used in this research with the probability of Pc
                                  on each chromosome.

Moreover, a single point mutation depicted in Fig. 5
                         is employed with probability Pm
                         on the offspring that are generated using the crossover operation. Based on Fig. 5, the random mutation selects a chromosome from the population, and replaces one of its randomly selected genes with a gene that is generated randomly.
                           
                              5. Feasible chromosomes compete to be involved in the next generation. Since chromosomes with higher fitness should have a greater chance of selection than those with lower fitness, the roulette wheel selection method is used in this research to select the chromosomes for the operators. In this method, the selection operates proportional to relative fitness of the chromosomes; consequently, Npop
                                  chromosomes are selected through the parents and offspring according to their fitness function.

6. The above generation process is repeated until a predetermined number of generations obtained by the Taguchi method is performed.

Note that after producing a new generation, both the old and the new generation are first sorted based on the fitness function. Then, extra chromosomes are removed from the population (that is the so-called optimal preservation strategy (OPS)). Also, note that there are several kinds of operators such as two-point, single-point, and uniform for crossover and mutation to generate a new population. While almost a single-point crossover and a random mutation were used in studies [34,37,46] in order to apply GA to optimize VMI problems, in this paper, the two-point crossover and the random mutation are utilized in GA, because they presented better solutions compared to the single-point crossover. In addition, Nearchou [36] elaborated the two-point crossover and showed that it is the most effective operator in optimizing scheduling problems.

Since the quality of the solution obtained by any meta-heuristic algorithm such as PSO and GA depends on the values of their parameters, in this section the Taguchi method is employed to tune the parameters. Recently, Eiben and Smit [12] proposed a conceptual framework for parameter tuning in EAs. There are two approaches in their research to select a parameter value. First, the so-called parameter tuning approach, in which the parameter values are fixed during running the algorithm. Second the parameter control approach, in which parameter values are changing while running the algorithm. In the current research, the parameter tuning approach is used.

In a meta-heuristic algorithm (a process thereafter), the parameters are controllable factors, the problem being solved is the process input, and the fitness function is the process output. Therefore, instead of employing suggested values by other researchers or using a trial and error procedure, it seems reasonable to adjust the parameters using statistical methods based on a set of experiments defined in the next subsection.

In the Taguchi method [39], the factors affecting the performance (response) of a process are divided into two categories: noise factors N such as weather condition that are not controlled, and controllable factors S like the parameters of a meta-heuristic algorithm. Taguchi first designed experiments using orthogonal arrays, and then presented a procedure to control N in order to reduce the variation or scatter around the target; in other words, the design that is impressed less by N is a robust design.

There are two different ways of analyzing the results obtained by the Taguchi method. First, the standard approach (using analysis of variance) for experiments with only one replication. Second, the approach that uses signal to noise ratio (S/N) for experiments with more than one replications. Since meta-heuristic algorithms do not present a unique result in different runs, more than one replication is required and hence the second approach has to be employed.

In the S/N analysis, a condition is good if S more than N impresses the quality characteristic (the fitness value in this research), and the aim is to find a condition that optimizes S/N. The quality characteristics are basically classified in three groups. First, smaller is better for which the objective function is of a minimization type. Second, nominal is the best; for which the objective function has modest variance around its target. Third, bigger is better, where the objective function is of a maximization type. Then, for the three classes of the quality characteristics the S/N is defined respectively as [39]:

In the Taguchi method, the parameters that may have significant effects on the process output are first selected for calibration. Then, using a trial and error procedure, the values that present good fitness function are selected to implement the experiments, mainly because the Taguchi compelled to utilize quality design at the beginning of production and not during it [39]. At the end, three levels are selected in this research for the values of parameters to be considered in the experiments. In other words, four parameters each with three levels are considered in the calibration process of both PSO and GA. Tables 2 and 3
                           
                            show the parameters. The L
                           9 from of the orthogonal arrays of the Taguchi method is utilized for experiments. A numerical example with three vendors and ten retailers with the basic data given in Table 4
                            is considered for a typical calibration.

The experimental results of nine runs, each with the best five out of ten replications are illustrated in Tables 5 and 6
                           
                           . Comparing the results in Tables 5 and 6 reveals that GA verifies approximate optimal costs obtained by the PSO. Besides, since the problem is of a minimization type, the values for S/N s are calculated using Eq. (28) and are presented in the last column of Tables 5 and 6. These values are then depicted in Figs. 6 and 7
                           
                           , based on which the best levels of all the parameters are chosen and are summarized in Table 7
                           .

It should be noted that the best levels of the parameters are problem dependent and change when different problems with different sizes are considered. Moreover, all the programming codes are written in MATLAB 2010b, where a PC with 2.2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU, and 4GB of RAM memory is used for all calculations. Besides, Figs. 6 and 7 are obtained using Minitab 15.1.30.0.

For better solution verification of the PSO algorithm, in this Section 10 different problems of different sizes are considered based on which both parameter-tuned PSO and GA are employed. Each problem is solved 10 times using each algorithm and the best in terms of the solution quality is selected for comparison. Moreover, several criteria such as CPU-time, Best Solution, relative percentage deviation (RPD) and relative deviation index (RDI) are employed for comparisons. The RPD and RDI are defined as [35]

                     Table 8
                      demonstrates the performances of the two algorithms in terms of different criteria obtained to solve 10 different problems of different sizes. The first column of this Table refers to the problem size. For instance, 2v
                     −4r refers to a problem with 2 vendors and 4 retailers. The results in Table 8 show that PSO is the better algorithm based on the required CPU time for all problem classes. In terms of the solution quality (the approximate optimal inventory cost), the results obtained by PSO is at least equal to the one obtained by GA, most of the time being less. In terms of the average RPD, PSO performs better. However, the only criterion based on which GA performs better is RDI. In general, one can state that for the problems under investigation, PSO is the better solution algorithm.

There are several ways such as using operators of other algorithms, new operators, an algorithm for local search, and the like to improve the performances of meta-heuristic algorithms. This section provides procedures for performance improvements of the two meta-heuristics used to find approximate solutions of the problem at hand.

Since the two main operators, namely crossover and mutation, have an important role in offspring generation, many procedures are proposed in the literature to improve their performances. For instance, Deep and Thakur [7] first provided a new mutation operator called power mutation for real coded GA, and then presented its advantages compared to the ones in previous studies. Li and Du [27] employed a boundary simulation method to generate a feasible space for inequality constraints in GAs. Li and Du [28] developed a method to create a boundary point by a hybrid GA that optimizes constrained multi-objective optimization problems. Gwizdałła [19] investigated the influence of genetic operators on the performance of the GA for global optimization.

Since there may be good solutions close to the chromosomes that are randomly generated, in this research we try to simulate this condition with the following proposed operator called boundary that works in GA as follows.
                              
                                 1.
                                 Select a population for an operator.

Create randomly a vector called Bo
                                    ∼(−Un,+Un) similar to a chromosome.

Create randomly an integer vector called Zr
                                    ∼(0,1) similar to a chromosome.

Obtain Va
                                    =
                                    Bo
                                    ×
                                    Zr; (see Fig. 8
                                    ).

Generate new chromosomes by adding Va to the selected chromosomes.

If the new chromosomes contain negative genes, make them positive.

In the above steps, Un is obtained as follows.
                              
                                 (33)
                                 
                                    Un
                                    =
                                    Average
                                    (
                                    Genes
                                    )
                                    ×
                                    Co
                                 
                              
                           where Gene is an element of a chromosome and Co is the coefficient of the boundary operator defined in (0.01,0.10). Note that Co can be tuned with respect to the performances of the operator. Here Co
                           =0.10.

Having said the above method, Fig. 9
                            shows a graphical presentation of the boundary operator used in this research.

In order to increase the performances of PSO, this paper employs the GA, which was improved in Section 9.1.1., as a local searcher. The local searcher is used in the stage of generating particles in PSO such that GA presents a feasible solution and then PSO improves it to obtain better solutions.

GA that was described in Section 7.2, is improved by using the suggested boundary operator to reduce the total costs defined in Eq. (19). The improved GA has equal CPU time with the original (not improved) GA. In addition, the hybrid PSO, which uses the improved GA as a local searcher, presents identical solutions obtained with lower CPU time. Based on the improved results shown in Table 9
                           , it can be concluded that the hybrid PSO has better performance than the improved GA in optimizing Eq. (19). In Table 9, in order to select the best solution, each problem is solved 10 times using each algorithm and the best in terms of the solution quality is chosen for comparison. Note that the setting of the GA is Npop

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

In this research, a vendor managed inventory (VMI) problem was investigated for supply chains in which the vendors manage the retailers’ inventory with respect to constraints on the central warehouse. The aim of this paper was to find the number of shipments received by retailers and vendors and to determine order quantities such that the total inventory cost of the chain is minimized. The problem was formulated into an integer nonlinear programming and two meta-heuristic algorithms of PSO and GA were developed to solve it. The parameters of both algorithms were tuned using the Taguchi method. The tuned algorithms were then compared based on different criteria using various problems of different sizes. In addition, a boundary operator was added to the GA to improve its performances and that the improved GA was used as a local searcher for the PSO. The results showed that the hybrid PSO was the better algorithm for the problems investigated.

This research is one of the pioneer works that investigate multiple vendor multi-retailer single warehouse vendor managed inventory of supply chain with two constraints, for which a model was derived and two parameter-tuned meta-heuristic algorithms were developed to solve it. For future work extensions, the followings are recommended
                        
                           1.
                           Presenting the VMI model in an uncertain environment that is closer to reality. For instance, fuzzy or stochastic demand can be considered.

Some other meta-heuristics such as the bat algorithms (BAs) and the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) can also be employed to find approximate solutions.

Response surface methodology can be employed to tune the parameters of the algorithms as well.
