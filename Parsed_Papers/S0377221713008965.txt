                  The recent contribution by Cheng et al. (2013) presents a variant of the traditional radial input- and output-oriented efficiency measures whereby original values are replaced with absolute values. This comment spells out that this article contains some imprecisions and therefore presents some further results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The recently published article by Cheng, Zervopoulos, and Qian (2013) introduces a variant of the traditional input- or output-oriented radial efficiency measure in a DEA production model to handle negative values of inputs and outputs. However, this article contains some imprecisions in that the consequences for the interpretation of these efficiency measures are ignored. We draw upon the analysis in the earlier article by Kerstens and Van de Woestyne (2011) which treats the more general case of the directional distance function to refine some of these results.

In a traditional production context, inputs and outputs are assumed to be non-negative (see, e.g., Färe, Grosskopf, & Lovell (1994, pp. 44–45) for conditions on the input and output data matrices). When data can be naturally negative (e.g., growth rates, etc.), then modifications must be made to the basic DEA production specifications. The small literature accommodating negative data in DEA models has been competently surveyed in Pastor and Ruiz (2007).

When inputs and/or outputs can be negative, the notion of a technology must be generalized on this extended data domain as follows:

In Cheng et al. (2013), the input and output Variant of the Radial Measure (VRM) is introduced in their expressions (9) and (10). Trivially, their relation with Definition 2.2 is given by:

                     Observe that for semi-positive inputs and outputs, the input and output Variant of the Radial Measure (VRM) coincide with their traditional counterparts.


                     Cheng et al. (2013, p. 102) explicitly claim that these VRM efficiency measures have a proportional interpretation in that these involve “applying the ratio of proportionate input decrease to the observed input value (input-oriented) or the ratio of proportionate output increase to the observed output value (output-oriented)”. However, as we immediately show, this claim needs qualification.

Combining (2) and (3) and Proposition 2.1 directly leads to the following result:

We consider two cases. The first case uses all available inputs and outputs, while the second case only uses the second (semi-negative) input. The resulting efficiency measures are reported in Table 1. First, in both cases, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 VRM
                              
                              
                                 o
                              
                           
                        
                      is located between 0 and 1. Second, only in the first case when the first input is strictly positive, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 VRM
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                      is bounded between 0 and 1. However, when only the second semi-negative input is maintained in the second case, then 
                        
                           
                              
                                 VRM
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                      no longer obeys this restriction. For instance, Table 1 even denotes an efficiency value of −7.8893 for observation 5.

Note finally that this extended data domain can yield problems for certain technology specifications (e.g., the assumption of constant returns to scale: see Silva Portela, Thanassoulis, & Simpson (2004) for details). For the DEA model of Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (1984), the solutions provided allow to handle negative data (as illustrated in Kerstens & Van de Woestyne (2011) and here above). While Cheng et al. (2013) also seem to focus on the same production technology in their final expressions (9) and (10), there is ambiguity in their expressions (5)–(6) and (7)–(8) where the so-called variable returns to scale constraint is put between brackets and the text maintains that it can be dropped to obtain constant returns to scale (see p. 102). To the best of our knowledge, there is no solution available in the literature to handle negative data under the constant returns to scale assumption.
