                  This paper presents a binary optimization framework for modeling dynamic resource allocation problems. The framework (a) allows modeling flexibility by incorporating different objective functions, alternative sets of resources and fairness controls; (b) is widely applicable in a variety of problems in transportation, services and engineering; and (c) is tractable, i.e., provides near optimal solutions fast for large-scale instances. To justify these assertions, we model and report encouraging computational results on three widely studied problems – the Air Traffic Flow Management, the Aircraft Maintenance Problems and Job Shop Scheduling. Finally, we provide several polyhedral results that offer insights on its effectiveness.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Allocation of resources over time is a problem of significant importance that many organizations in industry, government and education face. Correspondingly, resource allocation problems have received considerable attention in the Operations Research literature. In real world applications of resource allocation problems, specific issues arise: assignment of requests to resources over time, allowing the flexibility of utilizing alternative resources to complete the requests, fairness issues among different requests, among others. There has been extensive work on specific examples of resource allocation problems (for example, the extensive literature on Job Shop Scheduling). Still, to the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of a unified approach that can be easily modified to accommodate variations, while simultaneously being computationally tractable for large scale instances. On the contrary, it is widely believed that optimization might not be the right approach for certain classes of resource allocation problems such as scheduling for example. In fact, commercial solvers like ILOG for scheduling problems are typically not optimization based, but rather rule based.

Our aspiration in this paper is to develop a widely applicable, flexible and tractable modeling framework based on binary optimization that is capable of modeling and solving large scale instances for a variety of resource allocation problems over time. The paper has its intellectual origins with the work of Bertsimas and Stock (1998) on air traffic flow management, which is a resource allocation problem over time. In this problem, the resources are airports and sectors of the airspace, the requests are flights and the objective is to minimize delays in the system. To this date, within the scope of air traffic flow management, this modeling approach has proven successful, as it continues to be used extensively by several researchers and practitioners around the world. Two significant generalizations of the model in the context of air traffic flow management that suggest flexibility include: (a) the work of Bertsimas and Gupta (submitted for publication) that shows how fairness issues among airlines can be modeled in a computationally effective way, and (b) the work of Bertsimas, Lulli, and Odoni (2011) that allows the use of alternative routing of flights, when the current resources decrease possibly because of bad weather. Given the success of this modeling approach to air traffic flow management, it is natural to ask:
                        
                           (a)
                           Can we develop a modeling approach to general dynamic resource allocation problems that is flexible, tractable and widely applicable?

Can we give some insights (both theoretical and empirical) on the reasons of the approach effectiveness in the context of resource allocation?

The broad framework we have in mind for Dynamic Resource Allocation Problem (DRAP) is as follows. The primitive quantities are: a set of resources 
                        
                           R
                        
                      and a set of requests 
                        
                           I
                        
                      belonging to a set of owners 
                        
                           O
                        
                      that need to be processed by these resources over a time horizon 
                        
                           T
                        
                     . Each request i needs to be completed by certain time and it can be completed by using alternative sets of resources 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       n
                                    
                                    
                                       i
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     . Different allocations of resources to requests over time result in delays if the request is completed after its desired time. The overall goal is to allocate resources to requests over time in order to complete the requests as efficiently as possible (minimum delay), potentially using alternative resources and ensuring that the distribution of delays amongst these requests (and implicitly to their owners) is fair.

In the opening sentence of his 1963 book Linear Programming and Extensions (Dantzig, 1963), George Dantzig writes: “the final test of any theory is its capacity to solve the problems which originated it”. Motivated by this philosophy, we first present the modeling framework, and then use it to model and solve the following three widely-studied problems:
                        
                           1.
                           
                              Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM). Air Traffic Flow Management aims to prevent local demand-capacity imbalances by adjusting the flows of aircraft on a national or regional basis. ATFM models optimize for each flight the time of departure, the route selected, the time required to traverse each sector, and the time of arrival at the destination airport, taking into account the capacity of all the elements of the air traffic management system. In our generalization, each request will represent a scheduled sector-based path from takeoff through landing of a flight. The resources are the runways for takeoff and landing as well as the en-route airspace sectors. The fairness controls will be imposed at the destination airports where the final flight sequences are desired to be as close to the original scheduled sequence as possible. Finally, the alternative resources allows the option of flying a different origin–destination route for each aircraft.


                              Aircraft Maintenance Problem (ACM). The Aircraft Maintenance Problem is an important dynamic resource allocation problem in the airline industry. In this problem, an aircraft requests a large number of inspection and repair activities for which resources like equipments, sophisticated tools and highly specialized skills are used over several months.


                              Job Shop Scheduling (JSP). Job Shop Scheduling is one of the most notoriously hard combinatorial optimization problem. It entails processing a set of jobs on machines with the objective of minimizing some function of the completion times of the jobs (examples include the makespan, i.e., the maximum completion time and the minsum, i.e., the average completion time), subject to two requirements: (a) the sequence of machines for each job is prescribed; and (b) each machine can process at most one job at a time, and the schedule must be non-preemptive. In this paper, we model this problem within our framework and solve it for the two most widely applicable objective functions we mentioned earlier, makespan and minsum.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

In the literature, there is a lack of a scheduling framework of the form aspired in this research effort. Nonetheless, we attempt to enumerate the relevant papers which have the same taste. Bar-Noy, Bar-Yehuda, Freund, Naor, and Schieber (2001) present a unified approach to approximating resource allocation and scheduling. There has been recent work on using approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods to solve dynamic resource allocation problems which overcome the “curses of dimensionality” of standard dynamic programming methods. Using ADP, Powell and Topaloglu (2005) describe solution strategies for large-scale resource allocation problems under uncertainty. Similarly, Gocgun and Ghate (2012) develop an ADP method that uses Lagrangian relaxation and constraint generation for dynamic stochastic resource scheduling problems. ADP techniques have also been used by Erdelyi and Topaloglu (2010) to solve a dynamic capacity allocation problem and by Powell and Van Roy (2004) who present computationally efficient algorithms for a mathematical model of dynamic resource allocation motivated by problems in transportation and logistics. In terms of specific applications, Menasce and Casalicchio (2004) design a framework for resource allocation in grid computing, whereas, Alhusaini, Prasanna, and Raghavendra (1999) focus on a unified resource scheduling framework for heterogeneous computing environments.

We next review relevant literature on the three problems discussed in this section.

                                 ATFM. This is an extensively studied problem. Starting with the first paper by Odoni (1987) in 1987, there have been a plethora of proposals attacking various aspects of the problem. One of the most comprehensive models is by Bertsimas and Stock (1998) which considers the problem of controlling release times and speed adjustments of aircraft while air-borne for a network of airports taking into account the capacitated airspace. For a detailed survey of the various contributions and a taxonomy of all the ATFM problems, see Bertsimas and Odoni (1997) and Hoffman, Mukherjee, and Vossen (2011).

For the special case of aircraft engine maintenance, Zarybnisky (2011) proposes near-optimal approximation algorithms. For F-series fighter aircraft (specifically, F-15 and F-100), Forbes and Wyatt (1975) and Amouzegar, Galway, and Geller (2002) contain details on the dependency between various maintenance components in the context of aircraft engine maintenance.


                                 JSP. There have been a plethora of proposals for JSP which utilize both exact methods and heuristic approaches. The earliest exact method can be traced back to Giffler and Thompson (1960) in 1960. Thereafter, many branch and bound type algorithms were developed by Carlier and Pinson (1989), Applegate and Cook (1991), Brucker, Jurisch, and Sievers (1994). An approach based on exploiting the disjunctive graph representation of JSP was developed by Adams, Balas, and Zawack (1988) and Balas and Vazacopoulos (1998). These are known as Shifting Bottleneck methods.

Section 2 describes the proposed binary optimization framework. It introduces the constraints for scheduling, usage of alternative resources and fairness controls. Section 3 enumerates several examples of problems and formulates the three applications mentioned in this section within our framework. Section 4 presents theoretical evidence (by providing several polyhedral insights) and Section 5 presents computational evidence on the strength of the overall framework. Section 6 contains concluding remarks.

In this section, we present the proposed binary optimization framework for DRAP. Our framework represents time as discrete time intervals. This choice renders the possibility of formulating the various constraints in the DRAP in a relatively simple manner and usually leads to well-structured optimization models (Floudas & Lin, 2005). Moreover, formulations of discrete-time models generally compute solutions of better quality with respect to formulations of other models, as experienced – for instance – on the single machine scheduling problem by Keha, Khowala, and Fowler (2009). For these reasons, a gigantic number of discrete-time models is available in the literature on scheduling problems and more in general with resource assignment problem over time. The earliest research contributions that employed discrete-time formulations are due to Bowman (1959) and Manne (1960) for Job Shop Scheduling problems. Notable subsequent developments include the work by Pritsker, Watters, and Wolfe (1969) for resource limited multiproject and Job Shop Scheduling.

In addition to the above, we introduce some more notation specific to the alternative resources and fairness components in their respective sections (Sections 2.4 and 2.5).

                           We assume that for each request i, there is a unique resource (

                                    M

For each request, we need to decide whether to accept the request, and if so, when to schedule its resource utilizations to satisfy the problem constraints. To do this, we define the following decision variables. The first set corresponds to enforcing the requests that have to be scheduled.

The reason is that this definition of the variables leads to a natural modeling of a class of connectivity constraints. Moreover, it is quite flexible as it allows us to calculate many interesting properties as a linear combination of the

In this paper, the authors compare several formulations of the ATFM problem obtained by using different definitions of the scheduling decision variables. The formulation that uses the chosen scheduling variables outperforms the other formulations computationally.

Constraints (1a) enforce that all the capacity limits of resources are satisfied. These constraints correctly account for the use of resource r at time period t if requests utilize resource r for a fixed duration, i.e., for

                         consecutive time periods. However, in some applications, the use of a resource by a request does not have a fixed duration, but continues until the request starts using another resource. In this case, to account for the quantity of resource r that is used at time period t, constraint (1a) has to be modified as follows:

                           Remark 2
                           Every constraint of the type (1b)–(1d) and (1e) contributes only two non-zero entries in the corresponding row of the constraint matrix. The resulting sparsity of the constraint matrix is an important factor contributing to the tractability of our framework.

The scheduling component of the DRAP framework includes the resource constrained project scheduling problem (RCSP) as a special case. Specifically, if we consider the case of a single request, i.e., 
                           
                              |

                         is the time spent in using resource r, then Constraints (1a)–(1c) define the solutions of the RCSP, see for example Brucker, Drexl, Mohring, Neumann, and Pesch (1999).

In this section, we introduce the constraints required to incorporate the flexibility of alternative resources. Alternative resources allows to model many important settings of real applications, for instance, rerouting in the air traffic management (Bertsimas et al., 2011) and multimode execution of activities in resource constrained project scheduling (RCSP) (Brucker et al., 1999). Note that we do not need any new decision variables to incorporate this flexibility.

We first generalize the scheduling constraints to the case of alternative resources. For each request i and resource r, we define the following sets:

Constraints (2a) generalize the precedence constraints. More precisely, they stipulate that a request i cannot use resource r by time t if it has not first used one of the resources of set

We next present an important class of valid inequalities. These constraints incorporate and generalize valid inequalities introduced to strengthen the formulation of different problems. Referring to the applications cited above, these inequalities include as special cases the “fork” and “joint” inequalities for the air traffic flow management with rerouting (Bertsimas et al., 2011) and a generalization of the Christofides inequalities (Christofides, Alvarez-Valdes, & Tamarit, 1987) to the multimode RCPS.

To strengthen the formulation further, we now introduce two classes of valid inequalities for alternative resources. Borrowing concepts and definitions from the theory of partially ordered sets, a subset of the resources

                              The number of the antichain inequalites 
                                 (3a) and of the island constraints 
                                 (3b) are polynomial in the number of requests and in the total number of resources included in all the sets of alternative resources.

In the special case when the sets of alternative resources are used to model the multimode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (mmRCPS), the island constraints 
                                 (3b) are equivalent to a generalization of the precedence constraints proposed by Christofides et al. (1987) for RCPS.

In this section, we introduce fairness in our framework. Specifically, we incorporate three widely-used fairness paradigms, namely, (i) First-Scheduled First-Served (FSFS) fairness; (ii) proportional fairness; and (iii) min–max fairness.

This fairness criterion is based on a control on the ordering of the requests at each resource based on an agreed upon schedule a priori. This is intuitively appealing because the agreed upon sequence of processing the requests at each resource embodies internally calculated priorities set forth by the individual stakeholders. To include this fairness in our modeling framework, we introduce the notion of set of pairs of requests,

The final fairness paradigm we incorporate is that of min–max fairness which is widely used in telecommunications and networks (e.g. bandwidth allocation and packet routing). In fact, in this paper, we report results for JSP with the makespan objective which corresponds to min–max fairness.

The objective function F is flexible enough to accommodate any linear combination of scheduling variables 
                           
                              w
                              ,
                              x
                           
                         and the fairness variables 
                           
                              s
                           
                        . This flexibility allows the objective function to be tailored to multiple problem domains. Table 1
                         presents various possible objective functions and the corresponding applications. For instance, the first objective minimizes a weighted combination of total delay and reversals. The decision-maker can choose the tradeoff parameter 
                           
                              λ
                           
                         to adjust the degree of controlling reversals. The second one corresponds to makespan, which entails minimizing the delay of the maximum delay request (this indirectly embodies a fairness notion emanating from the min–max fairness paradigm). Finally, the third objective minimizes the total priority of unscheduled requests. As such, it aims to give scheduling precedence to the requests with high priority.

Although our modeling framework as a standalone proposal is able to solve many problems tractably (as evidenced by encouraging computational results in Section 5), as also mentioned in van den van den Akker, Hurkens, and Savelsbergh (2000) and Keha et al. (2009), the proposed time-index formulation may have one major disadvantage, i.e., the size. Indeed, under our framework, the time window within which each request can be processed at a resource governs the size of the formulation. This, in turn, dictates the computational efficiency of the model. In this section, we propose an iterative procedure which calls the framework multiple times to further improve upon the efficiency and/or optimality of our framework. The iterative procedure we design builds upon the following two key ideas:
                           
                              1.
                              
                                 Scaling. By scaling the durations that requests need to use resources, we can reduce the size of the formulations being solved. Furthermore, a feasible solution in the scaled space can be mapped back to a feasible solution in the original search space.


                                 Adjustable time windows. By adjusting the windows within which requests can be processed in a resource, the search space over which the optimization is to be performed can be controlled. This flexibility is particularly attractive when natural bottlenecks have been identified and emphasis needs to be given on solutions in their neighborhoods.

The algorithm invokes the model in Section 2.6 multiple times. At each iteration k, it solves a new instance of the problem obtained by:
                           
                              (a)

This sequence of steps is repeated until one of the following stopping criteria is met: (i) the improvement in the objective function is smaller than a given threshold; (ii) the number of iterations have reached an upper limit specified a priori; and (iii) a time limit has been reached.

In this section, we first highlight the generality of our framework and then present formulations of the three applications mentioned in the Introduction as special cases of DRAP.


                        Table 2
                         enumerates numerous applications which can be modeled within our framework. The range of problem domains presented emphasizes its broad applicability. A brief description of the problems is as follows:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Bandwidth Allocation. In this problem, computer systems (PCs) request bandwidth from a pool of available servers, each with its own capacity. These requests must be scheduled, preferably to minimize the overall wait time, but especially to minimize the wait time for the highest priority requests. Finally, in the presence of competing players, proportional fairness might need to be enforced to ensure overall equity.


                                 Internet Packet Routing. Internet packets need to be routed from origin to destination servers by making use of intermediate routers. The critical requirements for this problem is overcoming local congestion, satisfying precedence constraints at the destination servers and meeting the scheduling requirement of the critical packets.


                                 Pipeline Scheduling. The scheduling problem within the pipeline industry involves allocating different types of pipes (in terms of length, size, material, etc.) in the pipeline network (resources) to individual products (requests) demanding specific types for varying lengths of time.


                                 Hospital Scheduling. A hospital has multiple classes of resources like nurses and doctors, operating rooms, and specialized equipment. There are capacity limits for each human resource governed by the hospital’s overall staffing, including available temporary employees and weekly work hour limitations. The scheduling problem is then to allocate the resources to various hospital shifts.


                                 Shipping. The scheduling problem in the shipping industry pertains to the allocation of ships (which can be of multiple types based on size, transportable goods, etc.) between different origin–destination pairs in order to satisfy cargo demand and supply requirements at various nodes.

As mentioned in Section 1, ATFM refers to the composite of services that attempt to prevent local demand-capacity imbalances by adjusting the flow of aircraft on a national or regional basis. ATFM models optimize for each flight the time of departure, the route selected, the time required to traverse each sector, and the time of arrival at the destination airport, taking into account the capacity of all the elements of the air traffic management system.

Under our modeling framework, requests in the ATFM problem are aircraft that have to fly from its airport of origin to the airport of destination. The resources are the airports as well as the en-route airspace sectors. The complete execution of a flight (request) requires the utilization of a sequence of resources in set 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                         – origin–destination route flown by aircraft i; whose order in the resources’ utilization is enforced by a set of ordering constraints 
                           
                              O
                              (
                              i
                              )
                           
                        . Since each aircraft i may fly one of many possible routes, the set of alternative resources

                                    j
                                 
                              
                           
                         is also specified. The capacity of a resource 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    b

                         is the number of aircraft which are allowed to use the resource in the specified period of time. For airports, this is the number of aircraft that are allowed to land and to take off, while for en-route sectors, capacity is the number of aircraft that an air traffic controller can oversee simultaneously and may vary with the geographic location of the sector, its geometric configuration and the weather conditions. The set 
                           
                              E

                              )
                           
                        , set of transition times for resource r, allows to capture the connectivity between flights at airports (resource r). They handle the cases in which a flight is continued, i.e., the flight’s aircraft is scheduled to perform a subsequent flight within some user-specified time interval

In case, the rerouting option is not included as a control option in the mathematical model, each aircraft may only fly a pre-assigned route. Consequently, the routing constraints (2a)–(2c) can be substituted by (1c) and (1d). Under this assumption, there is only one ordering condition

In the aircraft maintenance problem, we are concerned with hangar maintenance which is performed on the aircraft after a certain number of flight hours (that depends on the aircraft type). Hangar maintenance may involve the check of all the individual parts of an aircraft which can take up to several months. It includes a large number of inspection and repair activities. For instance, disassembly, cleaning, and inspection of dismounted components, replacement work and testing operations (see Gharbi et al. (1997)).

Maintenance activities require particular tools and equipments – e.g., X-ray, magnetic particle and ultrasonic facilities, which are used to detect corrosion, cracks, and other structural abnormalities on the aircraft surfaces (see Aircraft inspection, xxxx) – and highly specialized skills, e.g., mechanical, electrical, or radio-skilled engineers. Moreover, maintenance personnel are licensed to operate on limited types of aircraft (see Dijkstra et al. (1994)).

A request for this problem corresponds to an aircraft undergoing a maintenance program. As described above, the aircraft maintenance program is composed of several activities each requiring specific resources in terms of workers, tools and equipments. The set of all the equipments that can be used on aircraft i and of all the workers that can operate on aircraft i form the set of resources 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                        . For complete execution of an activity, more than one resource of the set 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                         may be required. The duration of an activity 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    l

                        , depends on the expertise of the worker allocated to the activity (Gharbi et al. (1997)) and/or on the attributes of the equipment used. Therefore, alternative resources represent workers with different expertise and/or equipments with different attributes. Maintenance activities have to satisfy logical precedence conditions. These conditions translate in a set of ordering constraints 
                           
                              O

                         is the amount of resource available at time period t, i.e., the number of workers with specific skills and licenses – e.g., electrical engineers with the Boeing 747 license, or the number of specific equipments – e.g., X-ray machines.

Job Shop Scheduling is one of the most famous combinatorial optimization problems. The computational intractability of this problem is evident from the fact that it is NP-Hard and a relatively small instance of the problem, namely a 10 job by 10 machine instance proposed by Giffler and Thompson (1960) remained unsolved for decades. This problem (FT10 henceforth) was solved to optimality for the first time by Carlier and Pinson (1989) in 1989 using a branch and bound type algorithm. Subsequently, numerous other proposals solved the FT10 problem to optimality (e.g., Adams et al. (1988); Applegate and Cook (1991)).

The problem entails processing a set of jobs (each comprising of a set of sequential tasks) on machines with the objective of minimizing some function of the completion times of the jobs. Under our modeling framework, the requests are the set of tasks and resources correspond to the set of machines. Each task i comes pre-assigned with the machine 
                           
                              r
                              (
                              i
                              )
                           
                         where it needs to be processed. Finally, the multiple tasks comprising each job is modeled by the set of ordering constraints

                        . For JSP,

                              =
                              ∅
                           
                         as each task only gets processed by one machine and thus, the request connectivity constraints (1e) are not needed.

Finally, we remark that the critical requirement of non-preemption (i.e., once a task begins processing, it needs to be completed before the machine can start processing any other task) is naturally enforced in the above formulation. Please refer to Supplementary material for the proof.

In this section, we present theoretical evidence on the strength of the constraints for scheduling, alternative resources and fairness which illuminate the reasons for the computational effectiveness of our framework.

In this section, we present numerical results on the three applications which were modeled within our framework (in Section 3) to illustrate its computational effectiveness. The optimization models for all the three problems are solved using the Gurobi branch-and-bound method 4.5.2, implemented using AMPL as the modeling language, on a PC with AMD-Xeon 4 processors, 3gigahertz, 8gigabytes RAM with Linux Ubuntu 4.03 OS. We terminate the models until we find a solution with optimality gap of 1% up to a time limit of 3600seconds.

We present numerical results on the ATFM problem modeled within our framework. We evaluate the computational performance of the mathematical model on real-world flights data. In our experimental setup, the airspace is subdivided into sectors of equal dimensions (10 by 10) that form a grid, thereby, having a total of 100 sectors. The 55 major airports of the US are then mapped to one of these 100 sectors based on its geographical coordinates. Finally, the flight operations in these datasets correspond to the 5 largest US carriers. Please see Bertsimas and Gupta (submitted for publication) for details on the ATFM problem with fairness controls and Bertsimas et al. (2011) for ATFM problem with the flexibility of alternative resources.

We report numerical results for this problem under both fairness paradigms of FSFS and proportional fairness using our framework. In the US, “Ration-by-Schedule” (RBS) is the fundamental principle for allocation of arrival slots. Under this paradigm - arrival slots at airports are assigned to flights in accordance with the published sequence. But, under capacity reductions at the airports, a feasible solution under RBS might not even be possible. A close equivalent to the RBS solution would be one which has a small amount of overtaking or reversals, i.e., one which follows the FSFS priority discipline. Consequently, FSFS fairness paradigm is particularly appealing in the ATFM context.

The instances reported here have a typical size of the order of 300,000 variables and 800,000 constraints. Table 3
                         reports the numerical results from our framework under the FSFS paradigm. The objective function minimizes a weighted combination of total delay and reversals (please see Table 1) with the tradeoff parameter 
                           
                              λ
                           
                         set to 100. For each one of the datasets, we report the number of reversals and overtaking when fairness is imposed at k airports (k is progressively increased from 0). 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              0
                           
                         corresponds to the case when no fairness is imposed at any airport. Reversals are potentially controllable up to single digits which is quite encouraging given that the actual flight sequences had thousands of reversals (around 7000 on average). A similar control is possible on overtaking. This obviously comes at a increase in delay cost which is reported in the last two columns. The running times on average are less than an hour which are encouraging for real-time deployment in the ATFM context. The optimality gap is less than 1% in all cases except for one when a time limit of 3600seconds is attained (the gap in this instance was 4.1%). Finally, one of the most striking observations is that the solver did not branch at all for all but one instance, which highlights the strength of the framework. In the one case when the algorithm requires branching, only 3 branch-and-bound nodes are explored during its execution. These results are quite promising as the framework on its own is able to solve the problem (involving hundreds of thousands of variables and constraints) to optimality (without the need to invoke the iterative procedure).


                        Fig. 4
                         plots the box plot for the computational times of the ATFM model for FSFS and proportional fairness. The framework is able to solve the ATFM problem under both fairness paradigms under less than an hour (with an average less than 30minutes).

In this section, we evaluate the computational performance of the model introduced in Section 3.3 on randomly generated instances. The size of each instance depends on the number of aircraft requiring maintenance, the number of activities to be executed, the width of the time windows within which to execute each activity and the number of resources that can be utilized for the execution of each activity. We consider instances whose number of aircraft ranged between two and four, with either 30, 60 or 90 activities to be executed for the maintenance of each aircraft, and different level of resources. In our analysis, resources are teams of workers that can handle some specific activities. Therefore, the capacity of each resource is set to one for each time period.


                        Table 4
                         reports the computational results of the framework on four aircraft and 60-activity instances. For each group of instances, identified by the level of resources considered (first column of Table 4), the following statistics are reported: average computation time to solve the ten instances forming each group, the optimality gap of the solution and the number of branch-and-bound nodes visited. For the last two statistics, we report both the average value and the third quartile of the distribution.

Our framework solved to (near) optimality most of the instances, as indicated by the small values of the third quartile of the optimality gap’s distribution. Only few instances, more precisely one for each group with 30, 27 and 21 resources, were solved with an optimality gap greater than 10%. Finally, the small number of branch-and-bound nodes visited to solve the instances – indeed, for most of the instances the solver did not branch at all – validates the strength of the underlying polyhedral structure.

We next evaluate the tradeoffs between computational time and solution quality of the iterative procedure (of Section 2.6) applied as follows: we first scale durations using

                         for comparison) and leave the time windows unchanged. In the second iteration, we then scale using

In Table 5
                        , we compare the performance of the standalone framework and the iterative procedure we described above using 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    L
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              =
                              2
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    L
                                 
                                 
                                    1

                        . We find that the iterative framework improves on the running times (sometimes substantially) with a small reduction in the quality of solutions.


                        Fig. 5
                         quantifies the performance of the iterative procedure relative to the framework for the instances reported in Table 5. As expected, there is an intrinsic tradeoff between efficiency and optimality. By increasing the scaling parameter, there is a progressive improvement in the running times at a cost of increase in the objective function. The striking observation is that for 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    L
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              =
                              2
                           
                        , the cost is quite close to the optimal cost obtained from the framework (less than 1% on average) with a significant improvement in the running times (45% reduction on average). Similarly, for 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    L
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              =
                              4
                           
                        , there is another level of improvement in running times (90% reduction on average). But, this comes at a relatively higher increase in the cost from the optimal (around 10%).

In this section, we present the computational experience on JSP. We report the performance of our framework on the widely-studied FT10 instance (Giffler & Thompson, 1960) for both objectives of minsum and makespan. We remark that for the minsum (average completion time) objective, we are not aware of any local-search based procedure for JSP. We have found that a single application of our framework was not sufficient to find high quality solutions, so we report the performance of our framework applied in an iterative fashion.

The specific implementation of the iterative framework of Section 2.6 for both minsum and makespan objectives for the FT10 instance is as follows: in the first iteration,

                        Table 6 reports the best (as well as average over multiple runs) cost found for the minsum and makespan objectives from our iterative procedure and the best known bounds in the literature. Fig. 6
                         plots the progress of the iterative procedure (as a function of the iteration number) for the best cost obtained for both minsum and makespan objectives. There are significant gains in the objective cost after first few iterations (around five), but the objective still continuously improves in the many subsequent iterations. This highlights the utility of the iterative procedure, and implies that a single iteration (standalone framework) is not enough for this difficult instance.

The number of branch-and-bound nodes visited to solve the instances are mostly less than double-digit. In fact, the solver did not branch at all for the majority of the runs. This shows the strength of the underlying polyhedral structure.

We now study the sensitivity of the best objective cost to the starting parameter 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    L
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                        . A smaller value of this parameter gives an advantage of working with more exact combinatorial problem at hand (e.g. 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    L
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              =
                              1
                           
                         gives the exact original instance). The downside is that a small neighborhood parameter would span a relatively smaller feasible region (because the overall search space is large). In contrast, a larger value of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    L
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                         leads to a much smaller overall search space, but the combinatorial details are increasingly lost (e.g. 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    L
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              =
                              ∞
                           
                         would make all durations 1 for any starting instance). Thus, it is expected at the outset that intermediate values of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    L
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                         would lead to the best performance. This intuition is validated in Fig. 7
                         (which plots the best minsum and makespan obtained across multiple runs which are randomized in the same way as described earlier) as the best minsum corresponds to

                         (note that for the FT10 instance,

                         can lie between 1 and 99).

We now summarize the insights gained from the computational results. The strength of the framework is evident from the fact that for all the three problems, it spends little time in branch and bound. This is an important factor that corroborates the tractability of the framework. The assertion is further validated from the fact that for all three applications, the framework takes less than an hour. In fact, for JSP, the computational times are less than 10minutes in all cases. For ACM, they are less than 30minutes in all cases. The utility of pursuing an iterative procedure is evident from the following two observations:
                           
                              1.
                              For JSP, the standalone framework remains far off from optimality. Thus, for JSP, the iterative algorithm is drastically better in finding higher quality schedules (at a relatively small increase in computational burden).

In contrast, for ACM, the iterative algorithm is still able to find high-quality solutions but with much shorter running times.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have presented a binary optimization framework for modeling a broad class of dynamic resource allocation problems. The key advantages of our framework are (a) modeling flexibility; (b) wide applicability; and (c) tractability. Furthermore, we developed an optimization-based iterative procedure to further improve upon its efficiency and/or optimality.
