                  In this paper, we address a basic production planning problem with price dependent demand and stochastic yield of production. We use price and target quantity as decision variables to control the risk of low production yield. The value of risk control becomes more important especially for products with short life cycle where high losses are unbearable in the short run. In this cases, optimization of a solely scalar function of profit is not sufficient to control the risk. We apply Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) measure to model the risk preferences of the producer. The producer is interested in shaping the risk by bounding from below the means of α-tail distributions of profit for different values of α. The resulting model is nonconvex. We propose an efficient solution algorithm and present a sufficient optimality condition.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper, we consider production planning problem under random yield for a risk averse decision maker. In our setting, a producer sets price before the realization of yield. This is a common practice for products with long production cycle such as vaccines and electronic chips. Both of them also have random yield. The yield of production of a variety of products is random in different industries ranging from agricultural to manufacturing. This could be as a result of such different factors as production process, the quality of raw materials, or natural phenomena. Random yield is also present in procurement from suppliers either due to supply disruptions or their products not meeting quality standards. Random yield imposes high risk on producers. Therefore, controlling the risk in advance is of high value for them.

Nowadays, one important feature of many products is their short life cycle. This could be due to fast technological changes, such as in the case of semiconductors, or perishability and large inventory cost, such as in the case of biological and agricultural products. Therefore, it is unreasonable to use criterion like the expectation of profit to compare different policies. The expectation specifically is equal to the average long term profits and gives decisions which are optimal on average. Whereas products with short life cycle do not have opportunity to be sold in the long-run. Furthermore, it is possible that a few successive run of large losses, for example due to low demand, makes it impossible for a firm to stay in the market. Therefore, considering other measures other than mean becomes necessary.

Risk is an important factor in decision making of many industries. Risk sources are diverse and include any phenomenon that can not be predicted with certainty. Phenomena such as natural disasters, change of regulations, strikes, terrorist attacks and a lot more. Risk can not be defined without associating it with an attribute which is important for the decision maker. For example, for a firm, profit is an important attribute. Moreover, risk associated with profit can not be described just by one number such as variance, mean, quantile and etc. That is the very reason that in financial markets a lot of measures are used to make decision as to whether or not one portfolio is better than another. Perhaps the best way to describe the risk is to use the probability distribution of its associated attribute. We can not claim that probability distribution exactly describes the risk but it is at least our subjective description of the risk. So if we accept the distribution as the description of the risk, the next step is to compare distributions associated with alternatives (actions, policies or strategies) to find the best alternative. For example, consider profit as our desired attribute. Under different policies the distribution function of profit changes accordingly. One important question arises in this situation as to how to compare distributions. It depends on what aspects of the risk is more important to us. We know that the distribution function has all information about the risk associated with profit, but we need to know how to measure one aspect using the distribution function. If we use several measures, it is probable that at the end we can not come up with a single best distribution. Therefore, we usually use a few measures. In the case of one measure, we obtain complete order of distributions. In this paper, we deviate from usual practice in inventory problems and use more than one risk measure to compare distribution functions in a relatively easy but fundamental problem setting. For more study on risk notion, the reader may refer to Arrow (1971); Kahneman and Tversky (1979); Machina (1987).

The expected utility criterion is usually used for modeling the risk aversion of a decision maker but there are serious pitfalls associated with this measure in practical decision making. First, and most importantly, it is hard to elicit utility function of a rational decision maker. Second, the utility values are not sensible in practice. One can compare several alternatives based on expected utility, but can hardly tell exactly how much one is better than another. The utility theory as a general descriptive model of behavior has long shown its weaknesses (e.g., Refer to Kahneman & Tversky (1979)). However, it is a sensible model for description of rational behavior or in other words as a normative model.

In this paper, we use a risk measure called Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). This risk measure has been popularized by Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000, 2002). Its popularity comes from its convexity property and its relation to Value-at-risk (VaR), a widely used risk measure in finance. Moreover, CVaR is in the class of coherent risk measures (Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, & Heath (1999)). CVaR simply computes the conditional mean of the

                      percent of worst-case values of a continuous random variable X. Furthermore it is consistent with first and second order stochastic dominance. Since the introduction of coherent risk measures, a lot of variant classes of risk measures have been introduced for one-period decision problems (see e.g., Föllmer and Schied (2002), Rockafellar, Uryasev, and Zabarankin (2006); Ben-Tal and Teboulle (2007)).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the relevant literature. In Section 3 we study production planning problem under yield uncertainty. We use CVaR measure to control the risk of large loss at different risk aversion levels. Since, the constrained problem is nonconvex, we propose an efficient algorithm for finding local maxima based on envelope theorems. Finally, in Section 4, we provide a sufficient optimality theorem based on duality theory. It can assure the global optimality of the obtained solution from the proposed algorithm given some conditions are satisfied.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Yield uncertainty in inventory problems has been widely studied in the literature. Yano and Lee (1995) is an excellent literature review for past studies in this area. Tajbakhsh, Zolfaghari, and Lee (2007) reviews the literature on supply uncertainty in inventory problems. They classify supply uncertainty into three types: uncertainty in quantity, uncertainty in supply timing, uncertainty in purchase price. They further classify supply uncertainty in quantity into random yield, random supplier availability, and random capacity. Wang, Gilland, and Tomlin (2010) introduces similar classification using random disruption term instead of random supplier availability. They also add another source of supply uncertainty namely financial default. Random disruption model can be considered as a special case of random yield model with Bernoulli or binomial distribution. Due to its importance and prevalence, it has received separate consideration in the literature (e.g., Dada, Petruzzi, and Schwarz (2007); Tang, Musa, and Li (2011); Tomlin (2006)).


                     Cho and Tang (2011) consider a game setting in which a risk neutral supplier with random yield sells flu vaccines to a risk neutral retailer. They investigate the value of advance selling compared to other selling strategies in different game settings. Advance selling (also referred to as advance booking, pre-booking) means setting price before realization of demand and supply. They also extend their work to multiple retailers. Both for one retailer and multiple retailers they consider linear stochastic demand function. Deo and Corbett (2009) investigate influenza vaccine’s market in the presence of competition. They employ random yield model and deterministic demand. Tang and Yin (2007) employ linear deterministic demand model and discrete random yields. They compare advance selling policy (they call it nonresponsive pricing) to spot selling (they call it responsive pricing, i.e., selling after realization of uncertainties). Their advance selling model differentiates from our model in two ways. First, they use linear demand function. Second, their model does not consider risk aversion. Li and Zheng (2006) study similar model as ours in multiperiod setting with stochastic demand function for a risk neutral decision maker. In their model all unmet demand is backlogged allowing them to find a concave representation for profit function. Bakal and Akcali (2006) consider a reverse supply chain where End-of-Life products are recovered for their valuable parts and material. The yield of recovery is random. They numerically investigate the effect of random yield on expected profit in different settings.

Risk aversion has been studied extensively in inventory problems with uncertain demand. But comparatively, it has received much less attention in inventory problems with uncertain yield. Modeling risk by coherent risk measures is most recent in this area of research compared to modeling of risk by utility functions. Tomlin and Wang (2005) compare different sourcing strategies for a risk averse decision maker in a multiproduct newsvendor problem when resources have random yield. They use CVaR and loss-averse

                        A loss-averse decision maker gives more weight to loss than gain as is introduced by Kahneman and Tversky (1979).
                      risk measures to quantify risk. They assume that the selling price of products are fixed. Their model is a two stage model which in the first stage the sourcing strategy is decided and in the second stage the allocation of the realized resources to each product. Kazaz and Webster (2011) is one of the few papers which consider risk aversion in the presence of yield uncertainty. They use a two stage model for obtaining optimal production and pricing decisions for agricultural products with yield dependent cost. The pricing decision is made after realization of yield. In their model demand is deterministic. Their work is different than ours in two ways. First we consider joint optimization of price and quantity before realization of yield and second we use a coherent risk measure to capture risk aversion attitude. Xu and Lu (2013) discuss the effect of yield randomness on optimal solution for a price-setting firm with random yield of production using stochastic dominance analysis. Eskandarzadeh, Eshghi, Yazdi, and Bahramgiri (2014) investigate price setting and production quantity setting of influenza vaccines in advance for an influenza vaccine producer. Influenza vaccines have random yield. The paper addresses one dimension of risk aversion of a producer by optimization of CVaR of the profit. Our work differs from theirs since we consider multiple dimensions of risk aversion by incorporating risk constraints.

Another stream of research related to our work is the literature on risk-averse newsvendor problems. They model risk preferences of decision makers by VaR or chance constraints (e.g., Gan, Sethi, and Yan (2005); Özler, Tan, and Karaesmen (2009)), mean-CVaR objectives (e.g., Lau (1980); Xu and Li (2010)), mean-variance constraints or objectives (e.g., Albéniz and Simchi-Levi (2006); Gan et al. (2005), Choi, Li, and Yan (2008)), expected utility objectives (e.g., Agrawal and Seshadri (2000); Eeckhoudt, Gollier, and Schlesinger (1995); Gan et al. (2005); Gaur and Seshadri (2005); Lau (1980)). To control the risk, they use operational instruments individually or in combination such as selling price, production or order quantity, and risk-mitigating contracts (e.g., Albéniz and Simchi-Levi (2006); Gaur and Seshadri (2005)). Gotoh and Takano (2007) investigate newsvendor problem under CVaR and Mean-CVaR criteria. They extend their model to multiproduct case but in the finite scenario space. Chen, Xu, and Zhang (2009) study the newsvendor problem under CVaR measure. Their paper has similar settings as ours. But, they consider the uncertainty on demand side as opposed to our paper which considers the uncertainty on supply side. They also do not take into account the multifaceted aspect of risk. Moreover, we take a different solution approach than Chen’s paper by introducing a change of variable. We take the demand as a factor of the target production quantity. This enables us to greatly simplify the analysis. Xu (2010) adopts a similar setting as Chen et al.’s with additionally considering emergency purchase option after demand realization. Choi, Ruszczyński, and Zhao (2011) study multiproduct newsvendor problem. They find optimal orders under correlated and uncorrelated demand distributions. They use coherent risk measures to account for risk aversion. Their paper also has a very good literature review on risk aversion in inventory problems including papers using coherent risk measures to model risk preferences.

Our paper is the first work that uses a coherent risk measure to model multiple risk preferences in production planning problem with general price-dependent demand and yield uncertainty. In our model both selling price and production quantity are set before the realization of yield. The model turns out to be non-convex.

In this section, we consider a producer selling a single product. The life cycle of the product is one period and the unsold units of the product have zero salvage value at the end of the selling period. Moreover the yield of production,

By target quantity, we mean the maximum quantity of production that will be realized. The demand function, D(p), is a strictly decreasing function of price. There is production cost, c, per each unit of target quantity. We use CVaR as the risk measure. Depending on its parameter value, denoted by α, CVaR for an arbitrary random variable is defined as the mean of

                      by using CVaR measure for different values of α. To simplify the analysis, we define q ≔ kD(p). We call the new variable k the production factor as it shows what multiple of demand will be produced. So, the optimization problem can be written as

                      is a desired threshold associated to αi
                     . Rockafellar and Uryasev (2002) were the first to introduce CVaR as a measure to control the risk at different confidence levels. They provide a real example in financial market and show that adding CVaR constraints reduces the underperformance of chosen decision vector in terms of objective function value.

To proceed, we need to compute function ϕα
                     (p, k). For this purpose, we go over some properties of CVaR which was denoted by φ
                        α
                     (.). It has been proved that 
                        
                           
                              φ
                              α

The second equality is immediate from conditions 1, 4 and 5. There are different formulation to find α-CVaR of an arbitrary random variable. We use the one based on the following function (e.g., Föllmer and Schied (2004))

                           0 and the second inequality follows from the demand function being decreasing.□

It immediately follows from Lemma 2 that the optimal price can not be less than p
                     0. The conclusion is valid for all differentiable and strictly decreasing demand functions.

Therefore, constraint ith is redundant. Problem

                        A quasiconcave program is a problem with convex constraint set and quasiconcave objective function.
                      Thus, it is not an easy task to find its global optimum. In the following, we first provide some properties of problem 
                        P
                      and then propose an efficient search algorithm for finding its local maximum solutions. In cases there exist a unique local maximum, our proposed algorithm finds it in polynomial time.

To be able to present a search algorithm for finding the optimal solution of h(k), we need to find the set of subgradients of h(k). Since function h(k) is one-dimensional, the set of all subgradients at point k is equal to the interval

We use envelope Theorem A.1 to find the right and left derivatives of h(k). First, we need to show that the set of saddle points is not empty. We use Theorem A.3. Lagrange function l(p, k, λ) is quasiconcave on p for all k, λ ≥ 0 thereby having a unique local maximum. The proof of quasiconcavity is similar to that of Lemma 3 and we skip it. The optimal solution of

                            is regular or equivalently speaking it satisfies C.Q. conditions. From regularity, it follows that the optimal solution should satisfies KKT conditions. We need to show at least one type of constraints’ qualification conditions hold at global optimum point. If for example the Jacobian matrix of binding constraints of

                           . So, the set of saddle points is not empty. Rockafellar (1970) in Lemma 36.2 finds another characterization for the set of saddle points. Following the Rockafellar’s Lemma, the set of saddle points given not empty is equivalent to the set of all points (p, λ) in the product set P

                     Theorem 1 provides us with a tool to develop a search algorithm which converges to a local maximum given it starts from a feasible solution. Later, we prove a sufficient condition for global optimality of a given local maximum.

We define V to be equal to an upper bound for value of 
                        
                           max

                           h

                     0 to be equal to an upper bound for length of domain of function h(k). Furthermore, let k
                     0 be a defined solution, i.e., function h(k) assigns a value to it. Being defined at a given point for function h(k), is translated to the constraint set of problem 
                        
                           Q

                              0
                           
                           )
                        
                      being nonempty. In the following, we present a bisection algorithm for finding a locally ε-optimal solution

                      of function h(k). The algorithm converges to global optimal solution if h(k) is concave.

Assume the time complexity of computing h(k) is equal to B. The time complexity of Algorithm 1 for reaching a locally ϵ-optimal solution within Δ

                        N

                      If function h(k) is strictly quasiconcave, it converges to a point in Δ
                     0/(2
                        N
                     ) neighborhood of optimal point. Finally, if function h(k) is quasiconcave it converges to a point in Δ
                     0/(2
                        N
                     ) neighborhood of a locally optimal point (i.e., remember that a locally optimal point is a point, say x, with the condition that 0 ∈ ∂h(x)). To evaluate function h(k) at a point, we need to solve a quasiconcave program. In our special case whose constraint set is an interval we can easily develop a specialized algorithm. In general case, to find the optimal solution, a series of convex optimization problems are solved. For more elaboration on quasiconcave optimization refer to Boyd and Vandenberghe (2004).
                  


                     Algorithm 1 only gives us a locally ϵ-optimal solution. But, we are interested in an ϵ-optimal solution. As we alluded to before, it is not an easy task to find assumptions under which the uniqueness of local optimal solutions is assured. We adopt another approach and find a sufficient optimality condition for checking global optimality of a found local optimal solution from Algorithm 1. The path taken toward our goal, is the same path as when we wanted to prove some uniqueness result. But, as you will see, even for this closer goal, the analysis is somewhat tedious. To proceed, we need some preparations.

For proof we consider functions wi

                           (k). They have the same properties as functions ui
                           (k) in the sense of assertions of the theorem.

The elasticity of demand, ϵ(p), which is defined as ϵ(p) ≔ pD′(p)/D(p), is nonincreasing, i.e., ϵ′(p) ≤ 0.


                     Assumption 5 holds for all demand functions in Table 1 with positive parameter values.

We are now in a position to present our sufficient optimality condition based on duality theory. If at one feasible solution of problem 
                        
                           P
                           ,
                        
                      the sufficient optimality condition holds then the duality gap is zero and that point is the global optimal solution. Since the problem is non-convex it is indeed possible that the duality gap is not zero.

                           *) is the unique solution of the Lagrange Problem for the associated Lagrange vector λ
                           *. We know that the optimal solution for problem max (p, k) ≥ 0
                           L(p, k, λ
                           *) is interior. Therefore, the first order optimality conditions are necessary and sufficient for being local extrema. Thus, we have

We need to show function f(k) has a unique root. If we prove function f(k) is strictly decreasing on its domain and it has at least one root then uniqueness follows.For this purpose, We take first derivatives of functions f
                           1(k) and f
                           2(k). Note that functions a(k), b(k) and r(k) have zero derivative everywhere except at ki
                           s which their derivatives are undefined. But expressions

                           df
                           2(k)/dk is clearly non-positive. If the numerator of df
                           1(k)/dk is negative everywhere as well, thereby df(k)/dk is negative everywhere and we are done. We denote the numerator of df
                           1(k)/dk by function h(k). The first derivative of h(k) is

We showed that f(k) is decreasing. So it can at most have one root. At the other hand we know that k
                           * is a root of f(k).Thus f(k) has a unique root. Using the strong duality Theorem A.2, the given local optimum (i.e., (p
                           *, k
                           *)) is indeed global optimum.□

                     We can find the efficient frontier by changing v. The efficient frontier for this producer is shown in Fig. 1.

We picked four solutions on the graph to compare. The characteristics of these solutions are presented in Table 2.

Solution A is for a risk neutral person since it is the highest achievable expected profit. Other solutions are for risk averse persons. The more a person is risk averse, the more he tries to avoid high losses. The purpose of the risk constraint is to limit this risk. The higher the risk threshold (i.e., v), the lower the expected value at the optimal solution (i.e., ϕ
                     0(p
                     *, k
                     *)) as it is apparent in the solutions B,C, and D. Let us compare solutions A and B. A risk averse decision maker prefers Solution B to A since the risk of low profits is much lower. To be exact, CVaR at level 95 percent is about 4.6 millions for solution B compared to about 1.7 million for solution A. It is about 2.7 times that of A. On the other hand, this comes at the price of losing some high profits. The expected profit decreases from about 20 millions to 16 millions (i.e., about 19 percent). Histograms shown in Fig. 2 give you a nice perspective on the various aspects of risk implications of solutions A to D. The red and black lines (i.e., left and right vertical lines respectively) denote the expected profit and conditional expected profit at level 95 percent, respectively.

As we go from A to D the probability of high losses decreases, at the same time the probability of high profits decreases too.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we investigated production planning problem with pricing under random yield for a risk averse decision maker. We used CVaR measure to shape the distribution of profit function according to preferences of decision maker. One of the advantages of using CVaR is that it can easily deal with different risk aversion levels in a coherent way. In another word, as we showed in our model, we can incorporate several aspects of risk aversion of a decision maker without considerably increasing computational burden of the problem and without losing the coherency in tackling the risk. For solving our model, we developed an efficient inexact solution algorithm. We also proposed an important saddle point theorem (Theorem  A.3) which its usage is far beyond this paper. This theorem enabled us to characterize the set of saddle points by KKT conditions. Having the characterization of the set of saddle points of a Lagrangean function is a requirement in using envelope theorems.

If x
                           * is a regular local maximum of problem (A.1), then there is a Lagrange multiplier vector λ

                           * satisfies the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker(KKT) conditions (e.g.,Bertsekas (1999)). In other words,

                         the product kD(p) remains constant and thereby both righthand side of constraints as well as the objective function increase. In other words we find another feasible solution with better objective function which is a contradiction.

Case 2:
                           
                              
                                 k

                              D
                              
                                 (
                                 
                                    p
                                    *
                                 
                                 )
                              
                              =
                              0
                              .
                           
                        
                     

In this case, the feasibility of the optimal solution requires that all vi
                        ’s are nonpositive. If at least one vi
                         is positive then this case does not happen. In this case, the objective function and the righthand side expressions are zero. Since Assumption 1 holds, there exists point 
                           
                              (
                              
                                 p
                                 l
                              
                              +
                              ϵ

                              ϵ

                         for sufficiently small ϵ in such a way that it meets all constraints and has positive objective value. This is against our assumption that (k
                        *, p
                        *) is optimal.

To prove p
                        * > p
                        0, we only need to partially write down KKT necessary optimality conditions (since we assumed (p
                        *, k
                        *) is regular, KKT conditions are necessary optimality conditions):

We know from the definition of p
                        0 (Refer to Lemma 2) that (pD(p))′ is positive on (0, p
                        0). Due to this fact and the negativity of D′(p), the left hand side of inequality B.1 will be positive on (0, p
                        0) which is a contradiction. Thus the optimal price can not be less than p
                        0.
