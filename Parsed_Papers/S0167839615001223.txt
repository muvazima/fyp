                  In the paper two new approaches for construction of parametric polynomial approximants of a unit circle are presented. The obtained approximants have better approximation properties than those given by other methods, i.e., smaller radial error, symmetry, and exponential error decay.

A circle arc is a basic object in CAGD and in many applications. Conics are the oldest curves, and are used in architecture, robotics, and in many other fields. The unit circle has a nice parameterization

                      In CAGD, parametric polynomial and rational curves and splines are fundamental objects. A circle arc does not have a parametric polynomial representation, however, it can be represented by using a quadratic rational Bézier curve. The whole circle can thus be represented by a quadratic rational spline, e.g. as a NURBS. A natural question is, whether it is possible to obtain a good parametric polynomial approximation of a circular arc.

A lot of papers study good approximation of circular segments with the radial error as the parametric distance. Quadratic Bézier approximants are considered in Mørken (1991), and their generalizations to the cubic case can be found in Dokken et al. (1990) and Goldapp (1991). The quartic case is systematically studied in Ahn and Kim (1997), Kim and Ahn (2007) and Hur and Kim (2011), and quintic Bézier approximants are derived in Fang (1998, 1999). Recently, quartic

                      approximants were analyzed in Kovač and Žagar (2014).

General results on Hermite type approximation of conic sections by parametric polynomial curves of odd degree are given in Floater (1995, 1997). The results hold true only asymptotically, i.e., for small segments of a particular conic section. Hermite approximation of ellipse segments by cubic parametric Bézier curves is studied in Dokken (2003) and also in Dokken (1997).

In recent years some quite surprisingly good approximations of the whole circle were obtained. An approach based on Taylor approximation was improved by idea of geometric interpolation and a construction of polynomial approximants for all odd degrees was obtained in Lyche and Mørken (1994). The construction that covered also even degrees was presented in Jaklič et al. (2007a). By looking at the problem from a different perspective, it turned out that the obtained construction was just one of several solutions of a nonlinear problem, and that there exist better solutions. In Jaklič et al. (2013), the best such solution was presented, which gives a good approximation of a conic section. It has many nice properties, it is symmetric, shape preserving, it gives a high order approximation of the whole circle 
                        c
                     , and for higher degrees it circles the circle several times before it deviates from 
                        c
                     . Furthermore, it is given in a closed form.

In this paper, a novel parametric polynomial approximant for the whole circle is presented, that gives a better approximation. It has many desired properties, such as symmetry and high order approximation. Another approach is presented that yields even (slightly) better results. Since solving of nonlinear equations and systems are involved, unfortunately the solutions could not be given exactly.

                      Unfortunately this solution does not give a good approximation of the circle (see Fig. 3
                     ).

One of promising ways is to use the equation of an ellipse in the polar form

                              t
                              ,
                              a
                              )
                              =
                              
                                 1

                                    t
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                      and take 
                        ϵ
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      as Taylor expansion of 
                        
                           
                              r
                              (
                              t

                        −
                        1
                      up to degree 2n. The results of such a choice are good, but another choice will give even better results.

In this paper, we will tackle the case 
                        ϵ
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        =
                        a

                        )
                     , where 
                        0
                        <
                        a

                        1
                      is an unknown parameter. Best solutions for 
                        n
                        ≤
                        9
                      are obtained. They can be given in a closed form, but computation of the optimal parameter a requires solving a nonlinear equation. It will be shown, that the solutions can be improved. A way how to choose an optimal polynomial ϵ will be shown, and thus slightly better approximations for small n will be presented.

Firstly, let us recall the main idea for solving the equation (1) in Jaklič et al. (2013). Solving the equation (1) is equivalent to solving
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    x
                                 
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                              (
                              t
                              )
                              +
                              
                                 
                                    y
                                 
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                              (
                              t
                              )
                              =
                              1
                           
                        
                      in the factorial ring 
                        R
                        [
                        t
                        ]
                        /
                        ϵ
                        (
                        t
                        )
                     . But since there are additional restrictions on degrees, the problem cannot be tackled by classical algebraic tools.

But the special form of the equation enables an approach that straightforwardly yields all the solutions.

                           the error will be small for small

                     , the functions on the left- and right-hand side of (6) are shown for

                        4
                     . The smallest positive intersection yields the parameter a for the best polynomial approximant. This requires solving a nonlinear equation, and high precision arithmetic is needed for larger n.

In the presented approach, we exploited nice approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials. However, here the radial error does not reach the same absolute value at extremal points (so-called equioscillation). A better approximation can be obtained by using geometric interpolation in the following way.

                      we can obtain the best possible Chebyshev-like solution.

This approach requires solving a system of nonlinear equations, solving a nonlinear equation, and bivariate minimization. Best approximants for small n will be given in the next section.

A natural question is whether the radial error is the best choice. Since there is not an equivalent theory of polynomials of best approximation in the parametric setting as far as I know, some other measure of error could perhaps yield better results.

First, let us consider the case

                        n
                        =
                        5
                      are shown, and in Fig. 8
                     , their curvature profiles are presented. The latter approximant is indistinguishable from the circle.

The parametric polynomial approximant circles around the unit circle several times, before deviating from it for larger degree n, see Fig. 9
                     . Such a behavior was observed also for approximants in Jaklič et al. (2013).

The best parametric polynomial approximants of the circle of low degree are presented in Table 2
                     .

Now let us consider uniform approximation. Solutions for 
                        n
                        =
                        3
                        ,
                        4
                        ,
                        …
                        ,
                        8
                      are given in Table 3
                     , together with radial error. Parameter values for the best solution of the previous approach give good initial values for numerical computations that need to be done. In particular, we used the choice 
                        
                           
                              t
                           
                           
                              n
                           
                        
                        =
                        1
                      and 
                        a
                        =
                        
                           
                              a
                           
                           
                              ′
                           
                        
                        ⋅
                        
                           
                              2
                           
                           
                              2
                              n
                              −
                              1
                           
                        
                     , where 
                        
                           
                              a
                           
                           
                              ′
                           
                        
                      is the value of a from Table 1. It turns out that the best solution is not unique, there are infinitely many of them.

For 
                        n
                        =
                        3
                      and 
                        n
                        =
                        4
                      the solutions are shown in Fig. 10
                     . In Fig. 11
                     , radial error for the approximant for 
                        n
                        =
                        8
                      is shown. Note that for larger n, this approach yields solutions with error just slightly smaller that in the previously presented approach. Thus the previous approach could be used for theoretical study of error decay.

The results improve approximations of the unit sphere in Jaklič et al. (2012) (see Fig. 12
                     , where quintic approximants are used for construction of parametric polynomial approximation of the unit sphere, and yield the radial error 0.000529953).
