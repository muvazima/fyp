                  Hierarchical clustering technique is an effectual topology control methodology in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). This technique is used to increase the life time of the network by reducing the number of transmissions towards the base station. We propose and validate a new routing protocol termed as Sleep-awake Energy Efficient Distributed (SEED) clustering algorithm. We divide the network sensing field into three energy regions because in SEED cluster heads are communicating directly with the base station. The cluster heads of the high energy region are communicating with the base station through a longer distance and paying extra energy cost as compared to the cluster heads of the low energy region. Same application base sensor nodes form sub-clusters to decrease the number of transmissions towards the base station. In every round, one node from these sub-clusters nodes awake and transmit the data and the rest of them sleep to save available resources. We select six criteria to check the performance of our algorithm. The simulation results show that SEED achieves longer network life time and high throughput as compared to the existing clustering protocols.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can present the distinctive benefits and flexibility with respect to low-power and economical fast deployment for many applications [1]. A WSN can be homogeneous [2] or heterogeneous [3,4]. A homogeneous WSN consists of sensors with similar technical characteristics i.e., initial energy and data rate. Whereas, a heterogeneous WSN consists of sensor nodes having different initial energy and data rate. The nodes in WSNs are usually battery-operated sensor nodes with limited energy resources and replacing the batteries of these sensor nodes is not an option. However, we can use good energy management schemes to save energy of individual nodes as discussed in [5,6]. Designing energy efficient routing protocol is important for prolonging the life time of the network.

There are three types of routing protocols namely, direct communication [7], minimum transmission energy [8], and clustering protocols [9–11]. In direct communication, sensor nodes directly communicate with the base station. However, as the size of the network increases, more energy is required for communication, causing the sensor nodes to die very quickly. In case of minimum transmission energy, when the node senses data to transmit, it may find the shortest possible route consisting of several hops to the base station. Optimal routes help to save the energy of the network [12]. However, the nodes closer to the base station forward more packets as compared to the distant nodes. In this way, the power of the sensor nodes closer to the base station will be drained very quickly.

Many energy efficient schemes are defined in [13–17], among these schemes cluster based routing is found to be a more energy efficient and scalable way to organize sensor nodes. The whole sensing field is divided into small clusters. In every cluster, a cluster head (CH) is selected on the basis of different parameters, such as energy or distance from the base station. A cluster head is responsible for transmitting any gathered information sensed by the nodes in its cluster. The cluster head may aggregate and diffuse [11] the data before transmitting it to the base station. However, this additional responsibility results in a higher rate of energy drainage for the cluster heads. However, selecting the optimal number of cluster heads is a good way to increase the life time of WSNs [18]. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is the most popular clustering mechanism [1]. LEACH addresses the problem of energy by probabilistically rotating the role of cluster head among all the nodes. Each node has equal probability to become a cluster head. In this way, low energy sensor nodes are selected as cluster heads and this may degrade the performance of LEACH. Stable Election Protocol [4] introduces a two-level heterogeneous network, which contains two types of nodes i.e., normal nodes and advance nodes. These nodes have different initial energy levels. Rotating epoch of SEP is directly interrelated with the initial energy of sensor nodes. However, SEP performs weakly in multi-level heterogeneous networks.


                     Our contribution: Following the thoughts of clustering which reduces the number of transmissions to prolong the life time of the network. We proposed a routing protocol to reduce redundant transmission towards the base station in application base heterogeneous WSN. Same application base nodes form sub-clusters and in these sub-clusters only one sensor node transmits data and the remaining sensor nodes remain in sleep mode to save energy. The rotating epoch and election probability is correlated with the remaining energy. Only high energy sensor nodes belonging to a region have greater probability to become cluster heads. In this work, the cluster head also avoids the same data coming from different nodes to move towards the base station. In this way, the redundant data is avoided which reduces the consumption of energy. All the nodes are not constantly monitoring the sensing field; only one awake node from a sub-cluster monitors the field in allocated time slots. The remainder of the nodes is in sleep mode to save the resources. The main contributions of the proposed model are summarized as
                        
                           •
                           We divide the network sensing field into three energy regions for even energy distribution.

In SEED, the data transmission phase is a longer phase. So, one node can communicate with the base station twice in a round in the data transmission phase.

We introduce sub-clustering in SEED to decrease redundant data transmission towards the base station.

The propose model utilizes sleep-awake awareness to save the available power.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: We review the previous approaches for WSN clustering in Section 2. In Section 3, we discuss the heterogenous network nodes deployment strategy of SEED algorithm and we describe our proposed routing protocol with the concept of sub-clustering among the sensor nodes with the same applications to reduce the redundant data flow towards the base station. Simulation results for network stability, network throughput, packet drop rate, and cluster head selection are discussed in Section 4. Finally, the conclusion is drawn in Section 5.

In [19,20], the authors proposed threshold based energy efficient hierarchal routing protocols. Reactive routing is used in these protocols. In these protocols, a hard and soft threshold value of data is defined for non-cluster head nodes in a cluster. The lower value of the threshold is soft threshold and the upper is hard threshold. In a cluster, the cluster head defines and sends these threshold values to their member nodes. Due to defined value of thresholds the number of transmissions are reduced and energy is saved. However, the cluster head selection process is poor and inefficient and as a result most of the time sensor nodes remain idle and have no cluster heads for communication.

Static clustering is used in AZR-LEACH [21] for optimal number of cluster heads selection. The authors divided the sensing field into equal size clusters and four such clusters form a zone. The zones are used to enhance the communication efficiency of the network. They deployed the base station in the center of the network and clusters closer to the base station are termed as advance clusters. The advance cluster head is responsible to forward the data of approximately 48 nodes and at the same time sense its own field. However, these sensor nodes are equipped with the same energy as normal nodes. This may cause the rapid depletion of the battery of advance cluster head nodes, making the network unstable and decreasing the network life time.

Centralized Energy Efficient Clustering (CEEC) is discussed in [7]. In CEEC, the base station is the central entity which selects the cluster heads for each round on the basis of energy and distance from the base station. They defined a strategy for deploying nodes in the sensing field for the optimal number of cluster heads formation. They identified three types of nodes: normal, advance, and super nodes. Then they divided the sensing field into three regions on the basis of initial energy of the nodes. The cluster heads communicate with the base station through single hop communication. However, they assigned the same initial energies for all type of nodes. The cluster heads sending data from distant regions deplete their batteries soon which effects the life time and stability of the network.

Energy Efficient Sleep Awake Aware (EESAA)[2] is an intelligent routing protocol for WSNs which introduced a technique of pairing among nodes. Among these pairs only one member node awakes in each round to forward sensed data while the other member node remains in sleep mode to save the energy resources. EESAA works in rounds and each round contains 4 phases such as: Advance Coupling Network Model (ACNM), Network Settling Phase (NSP), Network Transmission Phase (NTP), and Node Mode Setup Phase (NMSP). The EESAA is designed for homogenous networks and it elects cluster heads on the basis of remaining energy. However, some nodes remain active during whole life time of the network, while pair nodes toggle between sleep and awake modes. So, active nodes rapidly run out of batteries and decrease the network stability.

In [22], Jiguo et al. proposed a non-uniform node distribution cluster-based routing algorithm for WSNs, termed as Energy Aware Clustering Algorithm (EADC). This algorithm first divides the sensing area into even size clusters on the intra-communication range to balance the energy among the entire network. Then they used the cluster-based routing algorithm which also manages inter and intra-communication ranges of cluster heads to overcome the problem of imbalanced energy load caused by non-uniform node distribution. Each cluster head advertises again and again its status to maintain the routing tree. However, each node computes individually to become a cluster head for the current round which increases the computational complexity of the network.

A Decentralized energy efficient Hierarchical Cluster-based Routing (DHCR) algorithm is discussed in [23]. The DHCR algorithm’s main focus is to save the energy resources of the network by reducing the number of control packets. The cluster heads are independently selected on the basis of remaining energy and distance parameter. So, there is a chance that the nodes closer to the base station are more likely selected as cluster heads. Multi-hop communication is used between cluster heads to send data at the base station. The cluster heads closer to the base station are forwarding the data of other cluster heads. This increased data load on the cluster heads next to the base station causes cluster heads deplete their batteries soon and make the network unstable.

Clustering techniques for WSNs proposed in the literature can be generally classed based on the overall network architectural, the operation model, the objective of the node grouping process including the desired count, and properties of the generated clusters [24,25]. We compare the proposed model with different state-of-the-art techniques in Table 1
                     . We also discuss the different attributes of the clustering techniques in Table 2
                     . According to the objectives, the desired cluster properties and clustering process defined in Tables 1 and 2, we found that SEED has overall good clustering attributes as compared with the state-of-the-art techniques.

In this section, we describe the network model of our proposed routing algorithm. We suppose that there are N sensor nodes, which are uniformly distributed in a square region of area M × M. We divide our sensing field into three regions on the basis of energy levels as depicted in Fig. 1
                     . The low energy region, which is closer to the base station has all normal nodes.

The intermediate region is next to the first region in which all nodes are advance nodes. The third region is far away from the base station which contains super nodes and is the highest energy region. We divide our sensing field into three regions because the cluster heads are communicating directly to the base station. Thus, the distant cluster heads are communicating with the base station through a longer distance and need more energy as compared to the cluster heads which are placed closer to the base station. The deployed sensor nodes always sense information and transmit this information to the base station. We place the base station outside the sensing field in any arbitrary position. To reduce frequent transmissions and receptions of sensor nodes, the concept of sub-clustering is introduced in our model as shown in Fig. 1. The cluster head selection, cluster formation and data transmission for SEED is shown in Fig. 2
                     . In the cluster head selection process, different cluster heads are selected from each region and only the Cluster Members (CMs) from that region are joined with these cluster heads to form clusters. In each cluster, a cluster head is selected on the basis of remaining energy. The function of the cluster head is to aggregate the data from all the sensor nodes within a cluster, perform fusion function to reduce the correlated data, and forward it towards the base station.

In this section, we present our clustering protocol SEED in detail. The deployed sensor nodes are application based and forward the same data towards the base station. This redundant data is overall a waste of resources. To tackle this problem, in our proposed routing algorithm two or more sensor nodes form sub-clusters with the same application and in transmission range of each other. In a sub-cluster, only one sensor node awakes and forwards its data to the cluster head and the rest of the sensor nodes remain in sleep mode to save the power resources. Since all sensor nodes sense the same data and there is no need for repeated data at the base station. The comparison of phases in each round for the proposed clustering protocol with EESAA [2], EADC [22], and DHCR [23] are discussed in Fig. 3
                        . The data transmission phase is the main phase in which the sensed data is sent towards the base station. The proposed model has a longer data transmission phase as compared to all other discussed models. The variables with their specific meanings used in our algorithm, for calculation purpose, are defined in Table 3
                        . In the next subsection, we discuss the working of our proposed clustering algorithm in detail.

In the beginning of the network, each sensor node sends Hello message to its neighbors. These Hello messages contain node
                              _
                           ID, application type, number of neighbors, and its location. In this way, all sensor nodes maintain their tables and form sub-clusters on the basis of application type and communication range.

After the initialization phase, each node decides itself to become a cluster head or not for the current round. This decision is made by the node ni
                            choosing a random number between 0 and 1. If the chosen number is less than a threshold T(si
                           ), then the node ni
                            becomes a cluster head for the current round. For uniform energy distribution among all nodes in SEED protocol, the rotating epoch
                            is selected on the basis of remaining energy of the nodes. The threshold is selected as

                                 In SEED, time complexity for cluster head selection is O(1) for each node and for the entire network of N nodes is O(N).

In cluster head selection process, each node generates a random number between 0 and 1. It compares this number with threshold value Tsi
                                  computed using Eq. (1). If this number is less than given threshold, then that node elects itself as cluster head. This whole procedure for cluster head selection is done during a predefined time. So, the time complexity of one node for cluster head selection is O(1). Thus, the time complexity for cluster head selection in SEED clustering algorithm is O(N).□

After the cluster head selection, each non-cluster head node decides to which cluster head it will associate for this round. The selection of the cluster head is made on Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) of the advertisement received from the cluster heads. The energy consumption of a non-cluster head node in cluster formation process is

                                 In SEED, time and message exchange complexity for cluster formation is O(1) for each node and for entire network of N nodes is O(N).

In cluster formation process, each node in the network either broadcasts a cluster head advertisement message or joint request merely. So, the message exchange complexity of one node is O(1). Therefore, the message exchange complexity for cluster formation in SEED clustering algorithm is O(N). For cluster formation, every node in the network is required to process

The time complexity of one node for cluster head selection is O(1). Thus, the time complexity for cluster formation in SEED clustering algorithm is O(N).□

After the non-cluster head nodes associate themselves with a cluster head, the cluster head allocates Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) slot to each member node. In the assigned time slot, cluster members can communicate with the associated cluster head. The energy consumed by a cluster head from any region for TDMA slot allocation is given as

The data transmission phase starts once the cluster heads are selected and the TDMA schedule is fixed. After sensing their fields, nodes wait for their allocated time slots. As their time slots begin, they transmit their data to the associated cluster head. The energy consumed by a non-cluster head node during transmission of a data frame is computed by the following equation:

The three kinds of nodes include super nodes, advance nodes, and normal nodes with the initial energy of 0.75 J, 0.5 J, and 0.25 J, respectively. The base station is positioned at any arbitrary place outside the sensing field. All values of the parameters taken for these simulations are defined in Table 4
                     . The sensor nodes sense the data at a fixed rate, and these sensor nodes always have some data to send. This work also assumes a simple radio energy model as discussed in [23]. The transmitter consumes energy to run radio electronics and power amplifier. The receiver also consumes energy to run radio electronics. When a node sends message of L bits through a distance of d, the node expends ETx

We perform simulations to check the performance of SEED clustering algorithm. We use MATLAB as a simulator to analyze the performance of SEED in comparison with AZR-LEACH [21], HEER [19], CEEC [7], DHCR [23], and EADC [22]. We select these models because these schemes are relative to our proposed algorithm and most recent in the literature of WSNs. There are many evaluation criteria defined for performance evaluation. However, we select six criteria: network life time, network stability period, cluster head selection, network throughput, packet drop rate, and effect of area on the number of transmissions to assess the performance of our algorithm. These evaluation criteria are elected because these criteria are widely used in the WSNs literature. These selected criteria are defined below in detail.


                        Network life time: From the start of the operation of the sensor network to the battery depletion of the last node is the network life time. The comparison of the network life time for the proposed algorithm with CEEC, HEER, and AZR-LEACH is shown in Fig. 4
                        (a). The network life span of the proposed routing algorithm is 4219 rounds, while the life time of CEEC, HEER, and AZR-LEACH is 3114, 2204, and 1530 rounds, respectively. Consequently, the life time of SEED is almost 27%, 48%, and 64% greater than CEEC, HEER, and AZR-LEACH, respectively. We analyze the performance of our algorithm on different energy levels.

The network life time of SEED against CEEC, HEER, and AZR-LEACH with assigning equal total energy of the network is revealed in Fig. 4(b). Hence, the performance of SEED always remains consistent on each energy level. SEED saves energy by switching their nodes to sleep mode before and after sending their data to the appropriate cluster heads. The normal nodes having less initial energy are closer to the base station and communicating through less distance, while the advance and super nodes are communicating through greater distance so, we maintain their energies high to keep balance in energy in the whole network. The network model of the proposed algorithm equally distributes the energy load among the whole network, as a result the heterogeneity equally effects the network life time of SEED as depicted in Fig. 4(b). However, in case of CEEC the nodes in all energy levels contain an equal amount of initial energy. So, the nodes communicating through a larger distance run out of batteries soon and reduce the network life time. This unequal distribution of energy heterogeneity has no effect on CEEC. In AZR-LEACH, the selection of cluster heads is not optimal and advance nodes are working as relay nodes. The advance cluster heads are forwarding the data of almost 48 nodes in a round. As the initial energy of advance nodes is the same as normal nodes, so, these advance cluster heads die very soon and make the network unstable. The network life time comparison between SEED and its competitors for random deployment of 300 nodes over simulations of 5 WSNs is depicted in Table 5
                        . Results declared in Table 5 clearly demonstrate the positive effect of the proposed algorithm for decreasing the number of dead nodes while the rounds proceed, hence, increase the network life time.


                        Network stability period: From the network beginning till the first node depletes its battery is known as stability period. Stability period is also referred as “network stable region”. In the stability period, the network has maximum throughput and reliability, after that the unstable region starts in which the throughput of the network decreases gradually until the end of the network. Fig. 5
                         represents the behaviors of AZR-LEACH, HEER, CEEC, and SEED. The first node of SEED dies after 1947 rounds, although for AZR-LEACH, HEER, and CEEC it is 480, 752, and 991 rounds, respectively. The stable region of SEED is 75%, 61%, and 50% greater than AZR-LEACH, HEER, and CEEC respectively.

SEED has greater network stability because only the selected node in a sub-cluster communicates with the cluster head for data transmission. So, only useful information travels towards the base station and less transmission saves the available resources. While in the case of AZR-LEACH cluster size is very big and multi-hop communications between cluster heads decrease the stability of the network. Round history of the dead nodes over simulations of 5 WSNs (with 300 nodes) is shown in Table 6
                        . Results depicted in the table significantly shows that SEED outperformed as compared to EADC, DHCR, and EESAA. A good protocol should have a longer stable region and a shorter unstable region because in the stable region the protocol has maximum reliability and throughput. The proposed algorithm has a longer stable region as compared to its competitors. However, EESAA and DHCR have almost equal stable and unstable regions.


                        Cluster head selection: The nodes are deployed in the sensing field through distributed algorithm in WSNs. Although, the optimal number of cluster head selection is an issue to be solved. We restrict SEED to select the number of cluster heads according to the desired percentage. The cluster head selection of SEED is smooth and remains around 5%–10% of cluster heads per round. The selected number of cluster heads is optimal in SEED. Cluster head selection comparison of SEED against CEEC, HEER, and AZR-LEACH is depicted in Fig. 6
                        . Whereas, cluster head selection of CEEC and HEER is fluctuating around 3%–25%. However, AZR-LEACH has a fixed number of cluster heads. The optimal number of cluster head selection plays a key role in increasing the life time of the network. The cluster head selection criteria used by CEEC, HEER, and AZR-LEACH is not very accurate.

Consequently, the network life time of CEEC, HEER, and AZR-LEACH is suffering due to this selection criterion.


                        Network throughput: The rate at which cluster heads sent data packets to the base station or the number of packets that arrived at cluster heads from non-cluster heads is called the throughput. Fig. 7
                        (a) describes the throughput comparison between SEED and its competitors. The throughput of SEED is 71%, 50%, and 33% greater than AZR-LEACH, HEER, and CEEC, respectively. We know that the throughput of proactive routing protocol is directly related to the network life time, the greater the network life time results the greater the throughput. As the life time of SEED is greater than its opponents, so, it has greater throughput which is clearly mentioned in the Fig. 7(a). However, the AZR-LEACH has very less throughput because the communication distance between cluster heads is greater so it has a larger packet drop rate as compared to SEED, HEER, and CEEC. While in the case of HEER which is a reactive routing protocol and throughput in reactive protocols is inversely proportional to the network life time or its stability period, so, it has lesser throughput. Fig. 7(b) illustrates the comparison of packets successfully received at the cluster heads of SEED, CEEC, HEER, and AZR-LEACH. The proposed model out performs in the case of throughput at cluster heads as compared to CEEC, HEER, and AZR-LEACH. The total number of received data packets at the base station over simulations of 5 WSNs is described in Table 7
                        . The throughput of SEED remains greater throughout the network life time as compared to EADC, DHCR, and EESAA which is clearly mentioned in the table. Performance of SEED remains consistent in both stable and unstable regions while for others they have good throughput in the stable region. However, their performance does not remain remarkable after the death of first node.


                        Packet drop rate: Packet drop rate comparison between SEED, CEEC, HEER, and AZR-LEACH is shown in Fig. 8
                        . Among these four routing protocols the SEED has the lowest packet drop rate. SEED has 5%, 6%, and 4% lower packet drop rate as compared to CEEC, HEER, and AZR-LEACH, respectively. The HEER and CEEC have greater packet drop rates because of the uneven distribution of cluster heads. Whereas AZR-LEACH has lower drop rate as compared to CEEC and HEER for the reason that it utilizes multi-hop communication.


                        Effect of area on energy consumption: The total energy consumed in the system increases as the network diameter increases. To check the effect of area on the performance of SEED algorithm we increased the network size from 100 m x 100 m to 200 m x 200 m. Then we found that as the network size is increased from 100 m x 100 m to 200 m x 200 m the energy consumption of the radio electronics also increased from 100 nJ/bit to 200 nJ/bit for the same message size. In energy efficient protocols, the size of the network and change in topology do not have any effect on the behavior of the protocols. Fig. 9
                        
                         depicts the behavior of the proposed protocol remains the same when the network size or topology is changing. The behavior of EESAA remains consistent up to a 150 m x 150 m. As we further increase the size of the network the energy consumption is increased which is clearly mentioned in the Fig. 9 (a). In case of DHCR, its behavior remains the same up to a 100 m x 100 m network size and after that the energy consumption is gradually increasing with increasing sensing area as shown in Fig. 9 (b). However, the energy consumption of the proposed model remains the same with the increasing size of the sensing field.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have described SEED, a sleep-awake energy efficient distributed clustering protocol for heterogeneous WSNs. In our heterogeneous network model, we have distributed nodes in three regions on the basis of energy. In the proposed clustering algorithm, each sensor node separately elects itself as a cluster head based on its remaining energy. We introduced sub-clustering in our proposed model to overcome the problem of repeated number of transmissions towards the base station to save the available power resources. We restricted SEED to select the number of cluster heads according to the desired percentage. The cluster head selection of SEED is smooth and remains around 5%–10% of cluster heads per round. Extensive numbers of simulations are performed to analyze the performance of the proposed clustering protocol. We selected six different criteria: network life time, network stability period, cluster head selection, network throughput, packet drop rate, and effect of area on the number of transmissions to validate our model. From this series of experiments, we found that energy consumption of SEED is significantly less as compared to CEEC, HEER, AZR-LEACH, EADC, and DHCR. In future work, SEED can be further enhanced by taking into consideration the energy harvesting scheme to increase the network life time.
