                  Suppose customers need to choose when to arrive to a congested queue with some desired service at the end, provided by a single server that operates only during a certain time interval. We study a model where the customers incur not only congestion (waiting) costs but also penalties for their index of arrival. Arriving before other customers is desirable when the value of service decreases with every admitted customer. This may be the case for example when arriving at a concert or a bus with unmarked seats or going to lunch in a busy cafeteria. We provide game theoretic analysis of such queueing systems with a given number of customers, specifically we characterize the arrival process which constitutes a symmetric Nash equilibrium.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

When customers are faced with the decision of when to arrive to a queueing system with some desired service at the end, the first issue to consider is avoiding congestion. This disutility is typically modelled as a waiting time cost. Such a model was first considered by Glazer and Hassin (1983). They assumed that the number of customers arriving to the queue is a Poisson random variable, which as it turns out makes the analysis easier than the deterministic case, or any other distribution. However, customers may also be interested in being served at an early time. Such an example is driving home from work, where commuters wish to avoid traffic but are not willing to stay at work until midnight in order to achieve this. This type of disutility has been modelled as a tardiness cost that increases the later one is admitted into service. Some recent research has been carried out on this model by Haviv (2013) and by Juneja and Shimkin (2013). The first considered a Poisson number of customers and studied the equilibrium properties when limiting the allowed arrival period. The latter considered a general number of customers and focused on a rigorous characterization of the Nash equilibrium, and the proof of convergence to a fluid limit. Both also presented fluid approximation models which are technically less cumbersome, and often provide insight on the discrete stochastic case.

In many queueing scenarios customers are not actually worried about tardiness, but rather about the number of customers who arrived ahead of them. This is the case in a concert or flight with unmarked seats, when there is no actual penalty for tardiness unless other customers have arrived and taken hold of the better seats. Equivalently, one can consider situations where the actual value of the service deteriorates with every service completion, for example a repair machine which depreciates with every use. Other examples can be found in Myrick Freeman and Haveman (1977) who find an optimal toll for the use of a facility in which the demand is a decreasing function of the aggregate level of facility use, and in Cicchetti and Kerry Smith (1973) who model the demand for wilderness recreation using a congestion model that users suffer disutility because of recreation of other users in the same area, and also provide empirical support for the model. This brings us to the focus of this work, which is to present a model where one’s cost is not necessarily time based, but rather dependent on the number of prior arrivals. If this is the only disutility assumed in the model, then obviously all customers arrive as early as possible. However, if there are also waiting costs, customers may improve their utility by not arriving in close proximity to others, which leads to a more interesting analysis of their strategic behaviour.

In the remainder of this section we introduce the model and review some related literature. Our analysis commences in Section 2 by illustrating an example of a two customer game, and comparing it to the known results for the tardiness model. We show that the support of the symmetric equilibrium arrival distribution is infinite if there is no closing time for the server, as opposed to the finite support obtained in the tardiness model. In particular, the equilibrium distribution is uniform prior to the opening time, and exponential after it. We further show how the equilibrium is adjusted if early birds are not allowed, and when the server has a closing time. All solutions for the two customer game are explicitly derived. In Section 3 we consider a general model with any number of customers. The explicit solution is not tractable for the general model, but we characterize the equilibrium properties and dynamics, accompanied by a numerical technique to compute it. We also provide an analysis of the tail behaviour of the arrival distribution, and prove that it is exponential. Numerical analysis also suggests that the tail of the arrival hazard rate equals exactly to the exponential rate found in the two customer case, regardless of the population size. We then examine how an immediate generalization can be made to a model with both order and tardiness costs. We further provide bounds on the cost incurred by any single customer in equilibrium, in the general setting. In Section 4 we present the symmetric equilibrium for a random number of customers, which follows a Poisson distribution. In Section 5 we briefly discuss the social optimization problem and explain how the existing literature relates to the model we have presented. Finally, in Section 6 we summarize the results and discuss possible extensions and future work.
                        Remark
                        Much of the “essence” of the model is captured in the two-customer analysis of Section 2. Section 3 is a more technical generalization. The main results are stated in Theorems 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, and numerical examples for the general model are presented in subSection 3.4.

Suppose that 
                           
                              N
                              +
                              1
                           
                         customers wish to obtain service. We assume that a single server provides the service according to a First Come First Served regime, and that service times are independent and exponentially distributed with rate 
                           
                              μ
                           
                        . If multiple customers arrive at exactly the same time, then they are admitted in a uniformly randomized order. The customers incur a delay cost of 
                           
                              α
                           
                         per unit of time, a tardiness cost of 
                           
                              β
                           
                         per unit of time until their admittance into service and an index of arrival cost 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         for every customer that has arrived before them. We denote the closing time by 
                           
                              T
                              >
                              0
                           
                        , where 
                           
                              T
                              =
                              ∞
                           
                         means there is no closing time. For most of this work we assume that 
                           
                              β
                              =
                              0
                           
                        , and analyse the model with only waiting and order costs. Where possible, we also consider 
                           
                              β
                              >
                              0
                           
                         for the sake of comparison and generalization.

In Juneja and Shimkin (2013), the equilibrium for a general N customer was characterized under the assumption that customers are limited to arrival distributions F such that: ”For each F, the corresponding support can locally (i.e., on any finite interval) be represented as a finite union of closed intervals and points”. They proved that under this assumption, the equilibrium arrival profile is unique and symmetric. We focus here only on distributions that satisfy this assumption.

The symmetric equilibrium mixed strategy is defined by a cdf denoted by 
                           
                              F

                        . We also denote the density function 
                           
                              f

                              t
                              )
                              =

                              t
                              )

                         is continuous and differentiable. We seek a cdf F such that if the other N customers arrive according to F, then the last customer is indifferent between arriving at all points of the support of F, and does not prefer any point outside of the support.

                           Remark
                           The majority of our analysis assumes that the size of N is common knowledge. It is important to note however, that all results may be generalized to any prior distribution on N in a fairly straightforward manner. The special case of the Poisson distribution has simplifying properties which we shall elaborate on in Section 4.

                        , i.e. customers only incur waiting and index costs. This special case of the model has several unique equilibrium properties which will be used throughout our analysis. We state these properties in the following two lemmata and their subsequent corollary.

In 1969 Vickrey published his seminal paper “Congestion Theory and Transport Investment” (Vickrey, 1969), which presented a fluid model for congestion dynamics. In particular, equilibrium arrival dynamics where characterized for a bottleneck model. This model was studied and developed in various directions in the following decades, among many others by Arnott, Palma, and Lindsey (1993), Verhoef (2003) and Otsubo and Rapoport (2008). The latter is the most closely related to this work because they assume a discrete (non-fluid) number of customers. However, they also assume a discrete action space, i.e. the arrivals take place at predefined unit intervals.

Most of the research on the strategic behaviour in queues, deals primarily with models with a discrete action space, such as whether to join a queue or not or choosing between several queues. Furthermore, the analysis is often focused on the steady state equilibrium properties. The book by Hassin and Haviv (2003) presents many results in this field and surveys the existing literature. As mentioned above, the first to examine a model where customers choose their arrival time to a queue were Glazer and Hassin (1983). In Glazer and Hassin (1987) they extended this analysis to a server with bulk service, for example a bus that can carry many customers at once. The main technical differences in this kind of model are the continuous action space, and the transient analysis of the queueing process, rather than stationary. In recent years there have been several developments in the research of these models. Among them are the above mentioned works by Haviv (2013) and Juneja and Shimkin (2013). In the fluid setting, models with non-homogeneous customer types were studied by Jain, Juneja, and Shimkin (2011) and Honnappa and Jain (2010) for a queueing network. An additional fluid model with a random volume of arrivals was analysed in Juneja, Raheja, and Shimkin (2012). Hassin and Kleiner (2011) studied a model with opening and closing times, and no tardiness cost. In Haviv and Ravner (2013) examine a multi-server system with no queue buffer, where customers are interested in maximizing the probability of obtaining service. Honnappa, Jain and Ward characterize the general properties of a single server queue with individual customer arrivals in Ward Harsha Honnappa and Jain (2012), along with finding the transient fluid and diffusion limits of the process. Haviv, Kella, and Kerner (2010) analyse a model where customers observe their order of arrival, but the decision variable is still binary: join or balk. Rapoport, Stein, Parco, and Seale (2004) conducted an experimental study of the queueing arrival game and compared the behaviour of the subjects to that predicted by the equilibrium of a discrete time queueing arrival game with waiting costs, but no tardiness or index costs. Our aim is to add to this body of work by introducing a new cost structure which takes into account the order of the arrivals.

Let

                     , which means each customer knows there is only one other customer. We will present explicit equilibrium solutions for several scenarios and compare them to the known result of the tardiness cost model.

                        . In Juneja and Shimkin (2013) the two customer case was explicitly solved. They showed that the symmetric equilibrium arrival distribution F has a density f which is uniform before time zero and linearly decreasing after:

Now we consider the case where the waiting cost is the same as above, but instead of the tardiness cost a customer incurs a cost of

                         if the other customer has arrived before him. From Corollary 1.3 we know that any equilibrium arrival distribution in this case is given by a continuous cdf F defined on a support interval

Suppose, without loss of generality, that the first customer arrives according to some distribution with cdf G and density g. The following analysis establishes conditions such that playing G is a best response for the second customer, i.e. that there exists some constant

Note that also in this case, f has a downward discontinuity at zero. This can be argued by a few algebraic steps showing that the following two inequalities are equivalent:

This constant will appear again in the numerical analysis part of Section 3, where we will show that although the general equilibrium arrival distribution for any number of customers is not exponential, the hazard rate approaches this very same rate (which is independent of the number of customers).

Suppose now that there is no option to queue before the server commences operation. We assume the same index cost function as in the previous subsection. First we argue that in a symmetric equilibrium, customers arrive at time zero with some positive probability, denoted by

                        . For if this was not the case, then any customer could reduce her own cost to zero by arriving at time zero with probability 1. Recall that if both customers arrive at the same time then they are admitted into service in a random order.

                              , which means that the equilibrium cost of both customers decreased when the opportunity to arrive early was taken away. Overall, we have shown that not allowing early birds increases social welfare.

We overlook the possible existence of non-symmetric equilibria of the form: customer 1 arrives at zero and customer 2 arrives at some time T such that her cost is lower than

We now wish to combine the two previous scenarios and consider an arrival game where arrivals are only allowed during a finite interval

                        . We first seek a condition for the strategy of arriving at time zero with probability one to be an equilibrium. This is the case if when the other customer arrives at time zero, the cost of arriving at zero too is lower than arriving at the closing time:

The conclusion from the above corollary is that limiting arrivals to an interval 
                           
                              [

                         a lower cost can be achieved by setting an early enough closing time. This is an interesting observation in light of the previous case, without early birds, where enforcing a closing time always leads to a higher cost.

Suppose now that 
                        
                           N
                           +

                      customers require service, and that there are no tardiness costs. In this section we characterize the symmetric equilibrium arrival distribution and discuss its properties. As it turns out, many of the observations made for the two customer game are true for any population size. In particular, we remind the reader that according to Lemma 1.2 there can be no ”holes” in the distribution, except for the case with no early birds, where there is one such ”hole” that we have fully described. In Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 we summarize the equilibrium properties for 
                        
                           T
                           =
                           ∞
                        
                      and 
                        
                           T
                           <
                           ∞
                        
                     , respectively, for both the case where early birds are allowed and for the case where they are not. In Theorem 3.3 we state the symmetric equilibrium cdf, explicitly for 
                        
                           t
                           <

                      and as a functional differential equation for 
                        
                           t
                           ⩾
                           0
                        
                     . This is followed by a generalization to a model with both tardiness and order costs. We will also provide methods for the computation of the equilibria and present some numerical examples.

Suppose the server has no closing time and customers are allowed to arrive as late as they wish. In the following Theorem we present the properties of the equilibrium under this assumption. Specifically, we show that the support of the equilibrium arrival distribution is either infinite or a single atom at time zero, which should not come as surprise in light of the two customer game analysis. We also show that if there is no closing time, then the customer’s individual equilibrium cost is

                      in the case where early birds are allowed, and at most

The proof of properties (1) and (2) relies on the same continuity argument used in Lemma 1.1: any customer can ensure a cost almost as low as

                            by arriving late enough, and this is lower than the equilibrium cost for any finite support. Property (3) is a direct result of property (2): at time

                            the cost is

We now impose a finite closing time for the server, after which customers can no longer arrive. Customers who have arrived before this time will be served even if they are still in service or in the queue at closing time. The next Theorem presents the equilibrium properties of this scenario. Clearly the arrival distribution has a finite support in this case, and the individual equilibrium cost is higher than

We have thus far characterized the equilibrium arrival distribution up until time zero. In Lemma 1.2 we showed that the distribution can have no holes or atoms in the interior of the support. Therefore, we seek a continuous distribution defined by a density function

                        , but we were unable to explicitly prove this limit. We will provide an outline of how more accurate analysis of the tail behaviour can be conducted in the future.

We first prove a supporting lemma that states that if the tail of the hazard rate is increasing, then the distribution is light tailed. We then proceed to show that the equilibrium arrival distribution characterized in Theorem 3.3 satisfies this condition.

Consider the approximation of the tail given in (3.19):

                         given that the queue is not empty. The limit of this term can then be seen, after slight modification, as a quasi-stationary distribution (see van Doorn & Pollett, 2013). In other words, as the limit probability of being in a transient state conditioned on the fact that the absorbing state has not been reached. Another point of interest in this context is characterizing the time until absorption, which in our setting is the time until all customers have arrived and have been served. The reason that the standard results which are surveyed by van Doorn and Pollett (2013) cannot be applied here, is that the process at hand is not homogeneous in time. There are methods for dealing with stationary distributions of non-homogeneous Markov chains, such as the ones presented by Abramov and Liptser (2004), which may yield more accurate analysis of the tail behaviour of the process of interest in this work. We leave these avenues for future research.

Suppose now that customers may incur both tardiness and index costs;

We can therefore conclude that the equilibrium solution is of the same functional form for both the tardiness cost model and the tardiness and index costs model. The key differences are that the index only model has an infinite support, and the boundary condition is known (i.e.

The RHS of (3.32) (and the LHS of (3.33)) is trivially true for it is the cost of a customer arriving last and facing a full queue. Further the inequality is strict because assuming an equality will lead to an immediate contradiction to the equilibrium assumption. This is clearly a coarse bound, which we only use in order to bound the search range in the numerical procedure presented in the next section.

The LHS of (3.32) is of more interest and requires a more technical proof, which follows similar steps as the proof of Lemma 10 in Juneja and Shimkin (2013), where a respective bound is established for the model with no index costs.

We applied the numerical procedure presented above in order to compute the equilibrium arrival distribution for several examples. First of all for the case with no tardiness cost (
                           
                              β
                              =
                              0
                           
                        ), in Fig. 6
                         we see four arrival densities, for different population sizes. In all four examples the service rate is 
                           
                              μ
                              =
                              20
                           
                         and the waiting cost is 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0.1
                           
                        . By keeping the product 
                           
                              N

                         constant at a value of one, in all of the examples, we also keep the individual equilibrium cost constant (and equal to one). This also implies that the lower bound of the support remains constant at

                              =
                              -

                                    α
                                 
                              
                              =
                              10
                           
                        . The only change is the shape of the distribution which becomes more “spread out” as the population size increases. It is evident that for a larger number of customers the decrease in the arrival rate is not exponential at first, but rather starts moderately and is only exponential in the tail.

In Fig. 7
                         we show the tail behaviour of the hazard rate for increasing population sizes when all other parameters are kept constant. For 
                           
                              N

                              1
                           
                         the hazard rate is not constant, but as we have shown in Lemma 3.5 it approaches a constant rate. The numerical examples suggest that this constant rate is the same as in the case of 
                           
                              N

                        , which equals 
                           
                              μ

                                          α
                                       
                                       
                                          γ
                                          μ
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        . In other words, the tail behaviour of the arrival distribution is dependent on the cost parameters, but not on the population size.

The next examples were computed for the same sets of parameters as in Fig. 6, with an addition of a tardiness cost: 
                           
                              β
                              =
                              0.1
                           
                        . These computations are shown in Fig. 8
                        . In this case, the support is finite: 
                           
                              [
                              
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                                 
                                    a
                                 
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                                 
                                    b
                                 
                              
                              ]
                           
                        . Increasing the population now makes the support ”spread out” in both directions, with customers starting to arrive earlier, and with a more moderate decrease after time zero.

A common model assumption in queueing arrival games is that the number of customers arriving to the system follows a Poisson distribution with some parameter 
                        
                           λ
                        
                     . Although this assumption might seem to make the model more complicated, it actually simplifies quite a few of the calculations. Namely, if each customer believes that the number of other customers is 
                        
                           N
                           ∼
                           Poisson
                           (
                           λ
                           )
                        
                     
                     
                        5
                        It turns out this is consistent with assuming the overall number of customers

                     Unsurprisingly, the equilibrium solution is of the same functional form as in Glazer and Hassin (1983) and Haviv (2013). If

                     , the arguments of Lemma 1.1 still hold. To be specific, any customer can ensure an expected cost of no more than the expected number of customers times the order penalty. Therefore, the equilibrium cost is

                     . This means that the computational advantages discussed in the precious section are still valid in the Poisson case.

When considering the goal of minimizing the total cost inured by the customers, thus maximizing social welfare, then the inclusion of index costs has no impact on the optimization problem. The order of admittances does not matter because there is always a first customer, last customer and so on. If there are

                      is the total socially optimal expected waiting and tardiness cost. We will review two examples of social optimization for this model, the first a scheduling policy when there are no tardiness costs and the second a dynamic policy for the general model.

If there are no tardiness costs, then the socially optimal schedule is one that minimizes the expected queue size at arrival times. This problem is only relevant when there is a closing time T, for otherwise a central planner could ”spread out” the customers as much he wants and achieve a cost of zero.

                            shows exact computations of the PoA for several model parameters. When the index cost parameter is large, relative to the waiting cost parameter then the price of anarchy is lower, as expected since the central planner has less impact on the total cost. Moreover, the PoA can be very close to one when the index parameter is the dominant factor in the cost function.

For a general number of customers, finding an optimal schedule for this problem is a hard global optimization problem, and typically can only be solved using heuristic or approximation algorithms. Examples of such algorithms can be found in Pegden and Rosenshine (1990) or Stein and Côté (1994). More recently Hassin and Mendel (2008) presented an optimization procedure in the context of patient scheduling, when some proportion of the customers do not show up. An alternative formulation of the social optimization problem is suggested in Hassin and Kleiner (2011): The central planner may not specify individual arrival times to the customers, but rather a distribution for all customers to randomly draw their arrivals from. They provide an approximation algorithm for finding the socially optimal distribution, using time discretization, which indicates that the optimal solution is a uniform distribution.

A strict lower bound of 2 for the PoA was established in Juneja and Shimkin (2013), along with convergence to the bound when the number of customers increases. They do this by comparing the equilibrium cost to an optimal schedule where the central planner observes the system and can send a new customer each time a service is completed. This dynamic policy is still optimal when index costs are included and then by definition (5.1) we get:

We can conclude that even though the central planner cannot reduce the total index costs, the price of anarchy is still always greater than two, as in the model without them. This is another property that holds when generalizing the standard model to include index costs.

We have introduced a new cost model for the queueing arrival game, which penalizes late arrivals for their order of admittance, instead (or in addition) to the previously modelled tardiness costs. We have shown that there are several differences between these two models. In particular, if just order costs are assumed, than the arrival rate decreases exponentially, but does not reach zero at any finite time. Furthermore, we have shown that the equilibrium cost, in this case, depends solely on the order penalty parameter. We have also shown how the equilibrium behaviour changes when limiting the customer arrival interval, by not allowing to queue before opening time or by setting a closing time. The equilibrium arrival process characterized here is qualitatively similar to the standard tardiness model (Juneja & Shimkin, 2013; Haviv, 2013), i.e. a uniform arrival distribution before the server opens and a decreasing arrival density (with the same functional form) afterwards. However, the index model is easier to compute numerically because the initial conditions of the distribution are derived directly from the model assumptions. The role of the tardiness cost assumption has been motivated in the literature as an indirect proxy for an index cost, for example in the concert example. We have shown here how to take this cost into account directly. This new model assumption of order penalties, or equivalently deteriorating service value, has many applications in varied economic scenarios, from seating in a plane or concert hall to the demand for wilderness recreation during a summer vacation.

There are a few avenues for further research on this model: considering non-linear cost functions, populations with non-homogeneous cost parameters or a general service distribution. In the case of non-linear waiting and order costs, necessary equilibrium conditions may be developed using the techniques presented here. However, it is hard to provide general sufficient conditions for the uniqueness or even existence of a Nash equilibrium. This analysis may be carried out for special cases, such as a quadratic cost function. It is reasonable to assume that customers differ in their utility functions, and so the analysis of non-homogeneous customer types is very much called for. This has been considered lately in a queueing context by Guo and Hassin (2012), and in the closely related queueing arrival game in Jain et al. (2011). The latter studies the equilibrium arrival pattern in the fluid setting, and extending this analysis to discrete customer models like the one presented in this paper is an interesting research challenge. An additional question that stems directly from this work is that of characterizing the quasi-stationary distribution of the queueing process, as defined in van Doorn and Pollett (2013), for the infinite support equilibrium arrival distribution of the index only model. The results presented here may also be used for empirical research, such as the previously mentioned work of Rapoport et al. (2004). We have presented a general framework for comparison between models, which may include index and/or tardiness costs along with restrictions on the opening and closing times of the server. The index model also has computational advantages, while maintaining the equilibrium properties of the more general model, and this may be useful for conducting a simple experiment and comparison. Considering a discrete time version of our model may also be necessary in order to compare to experimental results. The author believes that the analysis of the discrete time model should be straightforward using the tools presented here, and that the main properties of the index model will remain the same; an equilibrium arrival distribution with a cost determined by the order penalty parameter and population size, and the solution will require a discrete version of the numerical procedure we have presented in Section 3.3 using the known initial conditions given by the order parameter.
