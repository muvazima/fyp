                  Recently, Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) has emerged as a potential modality that utilizes natural and intuitive human mechanisms of thinking process to enable interactions in CAD interfaces. Before BCI could become a mainstream mode of HCI for CAD interfaces; fundamental studies directed towards understanding how humans mentally represent and process the geometry are needed. The outlined work in this paper presents an objective user study to understand shape recognition process in the humans. Specifically, we focus on the fundamental task of fragmentary shape identification. The problem of fragmentary shape recognition can be defined as follows: given a partial and incomplete minimalistic representation of a given shape, can one recognize the actual complete shape or object? In user studies, each subject was progressively (in stages) shown more informative fragmented images of an object to be recognized. During each stage of the experiment, the brain activity of users in the form of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was recorded with a BCI headset. The recorded signals are then processed to objectively study the fragmentary shape recognition process. The results of user studies conclusively show that the measured brain activities of subjects can serve as a very accurate proxy to estimate subjects fragmentary shape recognition process.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

For many years, the prototypical interactive system for 3D modeling has been WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer) interfaces. The user interaction in WIMP based 3D modeling interfaces is non-intuitive, as the 3D modeling subspace has to be mapped to the 
                        x
                      and 
                        y
                      axes of input devices such as a mouse. This process is inherently and cognitively complex because one needs to switch between 3D and 2D subspaces, thereby disconnecting the input space from the modeling space. A creative alternative to WIMP based interactions is to develop interactions that mimic human–human interactions such as spoken language (speech), gestures and thought processes.

Recently, Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) has emerged as a potential modality that utilizes natural and intuitive human mechanisms of the thinking process to enable interactions  [1,2]. BCI based interfaces for 3D modeling could be considered as a more user-centric approach. Before BCI could become a mainstream mode of HCI for CAD interfaces; fundamental studies directed towards understanding how humans mentally represent and process the geometry are needed. Answering the following question–How the human mind perceives and understands images and shapes?–is key to utilizing the full potential of BCI in CAD interfaces. The study outlined in this paper is a step in this direction.

Specifically, we focus on a fundamental task of fragmentary shape identification. The problem of fragmentary shape recognition can be defined as follows: given a partial and incomplete minimalistic representation of a shape, can one be able to recognize the actual complete shape or object? Consider the fragmented images of a shape shown in Fig. 1
                     . Initially, it is hard to recognize and categorize the actual shape. But as progressively more information is added to the images one is able to recognize the shape. The recognition of object happens with only fragments of the overall shape being displayed! In their daily lives, humans perform fragmented shape identification most of the times, as an example if an object is occluded by other objects or texture fields. Moreover, the images in Fig. 1 are not presented as full-colored textured image but instead as a simplified line drawing. Once sufficient information (even though fragmented) is presented, it is only with rare exceptions that an object fails to be rapidly and readily identified.

This simple exercise ascertains that human cognition system needs only a minimalistic representation of a given object, rather than storing every little detail associated with it to recognize the object. The study presented in this paper is probably the first attempt to objectively examine how the humans’ brain activities and thinking process can be used to draw useful inferences about the fragmentary shape recognition problem. Some of the primary research questions addressed include: How can one objectively study the human thinking process of fragmentary shape recognition? Can the incorporation of BCI help in this regard? What essential characteristic brain activity information can be reliably obtained by processing human brain signals during fragmentary shape recognition process?

To answer the research questions posed above, we have performed a set of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved experimental studies. In each experiment, a subject was progressively (in stages) shown more informative fragmented images of an object to be recognized. During each stage of the experiment, the brain activity of users in the form of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was recorded with a BCI headset. The recorded signals are then processed to objectively study the fragmentary shape recognition process.

There are two key issues that need to be addressed for performing systematic fragmentary shape recognition experiments. First, there are possibly infinite sequences of displaying progressively more informative fragmentary images. Hence, there is a need for structured approaches to generate a sequence of images to be displayed. Second, there is a need for metrics based on processed brain signals that indicate the identification of an object. In this paper, we outline two structured methods of displaying progressively more informative fragmentary images and also discuss the metrics used for objective assessment. In addition to CAD field, we believe that this research study could be beneficial to shape processing, computer vision, and cognitive physiology communities too.

In Section  2, we briefly review research related to the outlined study. Essential theoretical concepts related to our work are discussed in Section  3. Section  4 discusses experiment details and methods. Section  5 discusses main results of the experiments. Section  6 concludes our paper and outlines future research work.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

Three related areas of research: (1) Human perception of shapes, (2) Computational shape abstraction, and (3) Partial shape recognition studies are briefly reviewed in this section.

Geometric abstraction and recognition of shapes through 2-D representations is well studied. Prior studies state that human mind visualizes the shapes as functions to estimate the complexities of shapes  [3]. An attempt to differentiate between representation and description of the object was carried out by Nackman and Pizer  [4]. Nackman and Pizer showed that there is a subtle but very essential difference in the information provided during object recognition. The cognitive studies of human image understanding and works related to Recognition-by-components (RBC) for object recognition are inspirational to this work  [5,6]. The research carried out by Biederman et al. focuses on recognition of shapes and its effects on the relation between the human mind, brain, and humans’ thinking abilities  [6–8].

The RBC studies represented objects with the arrangement of simple convex parts (geons) and studied the relations among them so as to address the effect of cognitive human perception. The issue of generic identification of three dimensional objects with the help of geons is also discussed in a recent work  [9]. If geons form the basis of shape representation, then studies also conclude that human perception is robust to ambiguities arising due to shape orientation  [10,11].

Mi et al.  [12] presented an approach to abstract the two dimensional shapes in terms of parts. Mi et al. use holistic features of the shape part, local characteristics of the shape boundary, and global aspects of shape organization to arrive at simplistic representation. Other 2D shape abstraction attempts include topology based abstraction  [13], user interaction in building a parametric model  [14], a shape simplification method by set of rules  [15] and progressive mesh techniques  [16,17]. Desbrun et al. used curvature flow method to make blunt features from sharp ones to simplify the shapes  [18]. Lucchese et al. employ two Hidden Markov Model (HMM) systems, one for recognition and another for generating visual feedback to recognize touch based gestures for mobile devices  [19].

Three dimensional shape abstraction has also been addressed in existing literature. One of the related work attempts to approximate the given 3D shape with parametric parts  [20]. Such an approach can be used to create different kinds of abstractions, but there may be a loss of semantic information about the shape after abstraction  [21]. Mehra et al. developed an approach for the abstraction of man-made 3D shapes using characteristic curves and contours  [22]. Mehra et al. used vectorized representation of objects to extract the high-level structure of shapes. Along the similar lines, Yumer et al. developed a co-abstraction technique to generate a set of possible abstractions from a collection of objects  [23]. Yumer et al.’s method of shape abstraction considers relations of shapes in the collection and produces the simplified abstractions accordingly. In the three dimensional shapes representation domain, Wu et al. attempted fitting of parametric geons for qualitative object recognition  [24,25].

Saber et al. proposed a partial shape recognition algorithm based on sub-matrix matching that makes use of feature points and distance matrices  [26]. The method aims to find correspondences for determining partial similarities between a template and candidate shape region. Another technique used for two dimensional partial shape recognition is based on Normalized Interval Vertex Descriptors (NIVD)  [27]. NIVD analysis consists of sub-template matching and a renormalization process for recognition purpose.

Sketch-based shape and image retrieval studies have garnered a great attention in the recent years. Eitz et al. developed a 3D object retrieval system with the help of a sketch as input  [28]. The developed method uses bag-of-features approach for objective evaluation and retrieval of shapes. The works related to sketch-based image retrieval have also been carried out along with the development of efficient shape descriptor systems  [29,30]. Recognizing shapes in sketches is a challenging task. Oltmans  [31] tackle challenge with a visual recognition approach based on a representation of a sketched shape in terms of the visual parts it is made of.

Most of the work in the domain of shape abstraction and recognition simplify the shapes to obtain their compact representation or enable ease of recognition. Studies related to human perception of shape focus on decomposing shapes in a given image into smaller parts and assessing humans’ abilities to recognize the shapes formed by various arrangements of such smaller parts (RBC based cognitive studies). Existing work is limited in terms of using human cognitive and perception abilities for identification of fragmentary and incomplete shapes. The current work addresses this limitation. Fragmentary shape recognition study presented in this paper is different from and complimentary to existing work discussed above.

This section discusses the main theoretical concepts related to the work presented in this project report.

The geon theory broadly relates to human image understanding concepts and its impact on visualization of the objects. It comprises of a cognitive shape recognition study in accordance with the human brain, mind, and interaction with intelligent machines. Geon theory assumes the existence of some generalized core components called “Geons”. These geons can be then used to represent any given shape  [5]. Fig. 2
                         depicts major categories of geons such as cuboid, cylinder, tapered cylinder, ellipsoid, curved cuboid, curved cylinder, and tapered cuboid  [6]. As many of the shapes are made up of various combinations of geons, if a representation of two or three geons is recovered from any shape, it can be recognized quickly even when it is occluded or considerably distorted. We use this property to display progressively more informative images of an object. For generating a sequence of shapes, we adopted the technique to segment the objects in terms of partial geons that are derived from the representations of Biederman’s geons in a two dimensional space. We primarily make use of the non-accidental relations (collinearity, curvilinearity etc.) that are responsible for the existence of geons  [5].

Shape description and representation techniques represent the shapes in the digital data format to enable various shape analysis and synthesis tasks. Shape description looks for effective and perceptually important shape features based on shape boundary information or boundary plus interior content. Various descriptors have been designed, including shape signature, signature histogram, shape invariants, moments and curvature, shape context, shape matrix, spectral features, etc. Such shape descriptors are often evaluated by how accurately they allow one to retrieve similar shapes from a designated database  [32].

In this project, only two dimensional shapes were considered for the recognition experiments. So, shape features of the two dimensional shape descriptors were utilized for the experimentation purposes. Specifically, we use shape context descriptor in our studies  [33]. Shape Context is one of the robust local shape descriptors which is used to find correspondences and local similarities between the shapes. Using the shape contexts for the different points on the shape, one can identify local features that then could be used for shape comparison.

A representation in the form of a histogram of relative coordinates of the 
                           n
                           −
                           1
                         points is defined as the “shape context”. The histogram bins are uniform in a 
                           l
                           o
                           g
                           −
                           p
                           o
                           l
                           a
                           r
                         space, which makes the shape context more sensitive to positions of nearby points than to those of points farther away. The shape context descriptor stores the histogram of the relative polar coordinates of all other points relative to the reference point  [33]:

                           p
                        , each bin of this histogram contains a count of all other sample points on the shape falling into that bin.

Cognition can be defined as the acquisition of knowledge and reasoning, and it is greatly related to the humans’ understanding of visualizations by interpreting the images  [34]. Cognitive load signifies the efficiency of visualization and efforts of the human brain while doing a specific task. The cognitive load takes into account the working memory that relates to the aspect of short term memories for image and shape retention, processing and integration of visual data  [34,35]. Working memory is quite significant in various cognitive activities  [35].

The cognitive load theory focuses on the relation between working memory capacity and cognitive attributes of specific tasks  [36]. The manner in which the visual information is provided about the shape and image can affect the users’ cognitive load levels. According to the theory, the cognitive load comprises of three different types. 
                           
                              1.
                              Germane Cognitive Load: According to the cognitive load theory, the germane load is the capacity of load involved in learning the new cognitive schema  [34,36]. This schema could be comprehended as the internal descriptions formulated in the learning procedures relevant to various tasks  [34].

Extraneous Cognitive Load: The design of the tasks or experiments plays an important role in the measurement of the additional load on subjects, which is the Extraneous load  [37]. Extraneous load can be controlled by providing clear information about the designed tasks.

Intrinsic Cognitive Load: The cognitive load theory describes that Intrinsic load relates to the capacity of working memory generated by complexities in the examination of provided information. The analysis of visual tasks and information gathered through such tasks by the human thinking activities play an important part in this type of cognitive load  [34]. The intrinsic cognitive load might be affected greatly by the difficulties in the tasks and experimental designs.

In each experiment, a subject was progressively (in stages) shown more informative fragmented images of an object to be recognized. A single stage of experiment comprises of displaying a single image. During each stage of the experiment, the brain activity of users in the form of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was recorded with a BCI neuroheadset. Two key issues need to be addressed to carry out structured experiments: (1) Approach for displaying gradually more informative fragmented shapes, and (2) Objective assessment of when the users are able to identify the full shape or object. To address the first issue, two different approaches have been used to generate a sequence of progressively more informative images for which the users’ shape identification understanding is analyzed.


                     
                        
                           •
                           Top to Bottom Approach: This approach is dependent upon the idea of non-accidental relations and partial geons identified in a given shape (basics discussed in Section  3.1 and more details are outlined in Section  4.1).

Bottom to Top Approach: In this approach images in each stage consists of specific fragments of shapes. The fragments of shapes to be shown are decided by the sequence of salient points acquired through the use of shape context descriptor (basics discussed in Section  3.2 and more details are provided in Section  4.2).

To address the second key issue, the experimental studies incorporate BCI techniques to objectively assess the fragmentary shape recognition process (more details in Section  4.3). Specifically, the brain activity of the user in the form of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was recorded and analyzed with the Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset.

Three two dimensional shapes were chosen for the top to bottom approach experiments. The shapes were simple line drawings or silhouettes of a watering can, lamp, and flashlight (Fig. 3
                        (A)). The original images were first converted into the binary images. Pixels having values 1 (white) represented background and pixels having values 0 (black) captured the silhouettes of object/shape in the image. After getting the binary image, the 
                           x
                         and 
                           y
                         co-ordinates of the points comprising the overall shape were found out. For the experiments, the shapes were segmented into a number of parts (i.e. segments) according to the non-accidental relations and partial 2D geons.

The segments of overall shapes are in the forms of curved and collinear lines, parallel lines contributing to a shape of partial cylinder, circular and rectangular shapes, and conical segments. Segmentation of two dimensional shapes is carried out using k-means algorithm. A user-defined numbers of segments (four to five) are decided. Based on the decided number of segments, centers (
                           x
                         and

                         co-ordinates) for segments of the shape were randomly generated. Then, the k-means algorithm with a metric of Euclidean distance is applied in an iterative fashion on the initial random centers until convergence is achieved to get different segments. As the number of two dimensional points in the images is large in the original shape, the k-means algorithm gave fairly good segmentation results. The segmentation in most cases matched the non-accidental relations and partial geons. The segments that were different from non-accidental relations and partial geons were split and merged with other segments to get desired segments of the shape. The segmentation of shapes was kept simple (Fig. 3(B)) to avoid complications that could lead to an increase in complexity of experiments. The chosen shapes and their final segmentations achieved through k-means clustering (and sometimes splitting and merging) are displayed in Fig. 3(B).

Images of three shapes US map, New York City skyline, and dragon were chosen for carrying out the bottom-to-top image sequence experiments. The selected images were in the form of either line drawings or silhouettes of specific shapes. The original images were first converted into the binary images (Fig. 4
                        ). Pixels having values 1 (white) represented background and pixels having values 0 (black) captured the silhouettes of object/shape in the image. With the coordinates of points on the shape obtained, saliency (importance) of points were decided by applying the shape context descriptor. Since, the shape context is a local shape descriptor, the salient (highest ranked) points in the shape were more discriminative and thus influential towards representing the overall shape. This resulted in ranking of points on the shape and helped in deciding the sequence of points to be displayed.

The total number of points were stored in 14 bins (for New York City skyline), 21 bins (for Dragon) and 22 bins (for the map of United States). The first bin stored the highest ranked points where as the last bin stored the lowest ranked points. During the experiment, the points in bins (ascending order) were cumulatively displayed to create the image sequence. This resulted in the image sequence of 14, 21 and 22 images for aforementioned three shapes showing “gradual emergence” of the actual shape and hence the term “bottom-to-top”. The number of images reflects the number of bins in which the points were stored for a specific shape. Fig. 5
                         shows the image sequence of one of the shapes shown to the users during an experiment. Essentially, in the bottom-to-top approach the overall image emerges from several disconnected parts of the shape allowing us to display more complex shapes through the use of bins.

During each stage of the experiments, the brain signals of the subjects were continuously collected with the help of Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset. The EPOC is a Human–Computer Interface (HCI) which also provides a software development kit (SDK) for data analysis and processing. The brain sensors of the Emotiv EPOC are placed according to the international 10–20 channel locations convention. The EEG data is acquired from the 14 channels placed on users’ scalps (Fig. 6
                        ). These channels are AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4. The sampling rate for data collection was set to 128 Hz. Markers from the Emotiv EPOC SDK were used for each of the trials during the experiment to indicate the start and end of each trial. Use of markers allowed analysis of brain signals power during each segment of the experiment. A similar procedure for EEG signals collection was used with both of the aforementioned recognition experiments.

Most of the times, the EEG data collected during the experiments is affected by various artifacts. The preliminary artifacts are blinking and closing of eyes, and movements of eyes and muscles. The muscle movements related artifacts are considered as Electromyography (EMG) and the ones related to eye movements are Electrooculography (EOG). Data cleansing is necessary to obtain uncontaminated EEG data.

The muscle movement related artifacts (i.e., EMG), which mostly lie in the frequencies of order higher than 30 Hz, are removed by applying a simple low pass filter. A

                           th order Butterworth filter was used to filter the data. Cutting frequencies were set to 1 and 30 Hz. The collected EEG data at each sensor is the difference between the electric potential from a source to the channel location and the reference electrodes.

                           . EEG signals are cleaned by removing the artifact related IC. But, complete removal of the selected ICs can lead to the loss of EEG data. So, EMD is used to clean only the artifacts and keep the EEG data untouched. EMD decomposes the contaminated EEG sources into a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). It uses a user-defined threshold to remove artifact related components in that IC  [39]. A criterion of the ratio of standard deviation (SD) was used to remove artifact related components. The sequence of the IMFs is in descending order of frequency, i.e., first IMF is associated with local highest frequency and last one with green lowest frequency. Also, the EOG components have smaller frequencies and larger amplitudes. So, the IMFs of EOG components will usually have larger SDs than EEG related IMFs. So, it is suggested that the SD of an IMF is larger than 1.5 times (the threshold used for experimental studies) the first IMF; then that IMF is a blink related artifact component  [38]. Remaining IMFs are then summed together to form artifact-free sources from which we get the artifact-free EEG signals.

After removal of contaminated EEG signals, Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the EEG data collected from each of the channels was computed.

                            is the fast Fourier transform.

PSD represents how the power of an EEG signal is distributed over different frequencies. PSD was calculated by computing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the EEG signals. FFT was used to convert the collected data that was originally in the time domain to the frequency domain. The collected brain signals during each trial of the experiment were segmented into four frequency bands:- (1) Theta (4–7 Hz), (2) Alpha (8–13 Hz), (3) Lower-beta (14–21 Hz) and (4) Upper-beta (22–30 Hz). During the experiments, users’ brain activity was collected at each stage of the experiment. Along with the aforementioned frequency bands, the EEG data was segmented according to each segment of the experiments through the use of markers.

The PSDs of the brain signals are a very good measure of human brain power and energies generated during humans’ thinking process. Significant energies are usually observed in the PSDs of alpha and beta frequencies whenever humans concentrate on a specific task  [40,38,41]. The brain maps based on PSDs are excellent indications of the human brain activities during tasks that require concentration, deep thinking, and attention to details. The fragmentary shape recognition experiments involve such characteristics until the stage of identification of an object. The visualization of PSD also gives significant understanding about the drop in concentration, relaxation, and ease of thinking. The PSD distribution for the desired brain channels over the time span of the experiment also gives useful insights into high brain activities during significant events. The importance of PSD is also observed in the computation of the cognitive loads of users during the tasks. The concept of cognitive loads, their calculation and significance are detailed in later sections.

The analysis primarily looks for the EEG signals collected through channels of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes of the brain. The sensors in temporal lobe play an important part in the retention of visual memories and their processing in regard with shape recognition  [40,41]. The parietal lobe integrates sensory information with the visual system, and occipital region consists of primary visual cortex. So, the main focus was on the power and distribution of subjects’ brain signals in the aforementioned regions, which consist of channels F3, F4, FC5, FC6, F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8, O1, and O2 of the Emotiv neuroheadset.

To measure subjects’ cognitive load, it is necessary to analyze the spectral characteristics of the collected EEG data  [34]. As suggested in  [42,34], analysis of the most significant frequency bands of regions 
                              α
                            (8–13 Hz) and 
                              θ
                            (4–7 Hz) is necessary. These frequency bands have been found to measure the cognitive and memory performance of humans. As described earlier, the FFTs were used to decompose the brain signals into the time–frequency representation and the EEG data was separated for each stage of the experiments with the use of markers.

From the EEG data of each session, the data related to individual 
                              α
                            and 
                              θ
                            frequencies were extracted and analyzed. Similar to an efficient method suggested in  [34], the procedure used in this study also finds the individual mean frequencies in both 
                              α
                            and 
                              θ

As there were no rest or idle periods during the experiments, only the mean frequencies during the tasks were taken into account. It was found that the working memory and cognitive performances decrease during task related stimulations  [42,34]. These phenomena are represented by a decrease in 
                              θ
                            powers and a simultaneous increase in 
                              α
                            powers. Hence, the computation of cognitive loads is done as follows taking into account the combination of power and frequency changes in 
                              α
                            and

Twelve subjects (nine males and three females) participated in the internal review board (IRB) approved partial shape recognition experiments. All the subjects were in the age range of 22–26. The subjects had minimal previous experience with shape recognition and human cognition and object perception experiments. The subjects were briefed about the experiments just before the experiments began. The experiments were carried out in a span of a week on various days at different times of a day with the users for three shapes. The overall length of the experiments varied between 5 and 10 min.

The users, were not informed about the nature of shapes in the study beforehand. The shapes were shown only during the experiments. So, the effect of users’ prior knowledge or familiarity with the shapes was not taken into consideration for the analysis. The subject verbally confirms the identification of the shape after s/he has recognized the shape.

In this section, we discuss the results of fragmentary shape recognition user studies. We begin by showing quantitative (PSD plots) results of fragmentary shape recognition experiments described in previous section. Given the extracted features Theta (4–7 Hz), Alpha (8–13 Hz), Lower-beta (14–21 Hz) and Upper-beta (22–30 Hz) from each participant’s EEG data, the analysis attempted to elicit cortical brain activities in the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes of the brain. The key focus was on observing the patterns of brain activity and identify when these patterns were markedly different from the brain activity in the same area. We also report some general patterns that were found during the experimentation and discuss the general results derived from the experiments.

In top to bottom approach subjects were progressively (in stages) shown more informative fragmented images of three objects–watering can, lamp, and flashlight–to be recognized (Section  4.1, Fig. 3). One such sequence is shown in Fig. 7
                        (a). The brain activity in the form of PSD during each stage of a given experimental session was derived (Fig. 7(b)). The derived PSD for all the twelve subjects for three different objects led to similar observations. There were two distinct phases that were identified in all the experiments.


                        
                           
                              1.
                              
                                 Pre-recognition phase: In the pre-recognition phase, when an additional segment of the shape was displayed keeping the previous one/s on the screen, the subjects concentrated vigorously on the arrangements of segments. This was reflected by the generation of much higher power brain activity (Fig. 7(a) and (b) (i–iv)). The brain maps indicate the mean brain activity over six seconds for a given stage of the experiment. Specifically, higher energies were observed in the alpha frequency region stating focus and intrigue towards the identification of the partial shapes.


                                 Post-recognition phase: Post-recognition phase occurs when the subjects have identified the actual shape visually by looking at the arrangement of segments displayed on the screen. As soon as the subjects recognized the to be recognized shape, the PSD energies of very less magnitudes were observed in the brain maps indicating a large drop in concentration, focus, and deep thinking about the task at hand (Fig. 7(a) and (b) (v)). Specifically, once the identification has occurred, the subjects did not produce significant alpha frequency powers, and the brain activity was tending towards minimum PSDs.


                        Fig. 8
                         depicts the shape segments and brain maps for pre-recognition and post-recognition phase for lamp shape experiments. The six brain maps show the mean brain activity during each second for which the subject was trying to recognize the shape from displayed arrangement of segments of lamp shape. The results are exactly the same for all other users too! As stated earlier, the PSD activities in the subjects’ brain maps showed very less energies during the post-recognition phase as compared to pre-recognition phase. Once the overall shape has been identified during an experiment, there is a significant difference between brain activity during the recognition phase and pre-recognition phase. The visual recognition of shapes was found to be in tandem with the PSD activities of the human brain signal. Hence, it can be conclusively said that brain PSD activities can serve as a very accurate proxy to estimate subjects’ fragmentary shape recognition process.

The fragments of shapes in post-recognition phase (when the subject has identified the shape) for three shapes and three different subjects are shown in Fig. 9
                        . It is observed that different users require a different amount of information to identify the shape.

In bottom to top approach subjects were progressively (in stages) shown more informative fragmented images of three objects–US map, NY city line, and Dragon–to be recognized (Section  4.2, Fig. 4). One such sequence with select images is shown in Fig. 10
                        (a) for shape of United States map. The brain activity in the form of PSD during the corresponding stages of a given experimental session was derived (Fig. 10(b)). Similar to the top to bottom experiment two distinct phases were also observed in the bottom to top approach across all the subjects ((Fig. 11
                        )). It was observed that different subjects identified the shapes at different stages of experiments having different arrangements of shape segments ((Fig. 12
                        )). The fragments of shapes in post-recognition phase (when the subjects have identified the shape) for five (out of 12) different subjects are shown in Fig. 13
                        . Note that two users recognized the shapes during similar stages of experiments.

As mentioned before, the users’ brain activity in the 
                           α
                         frequency region (8–13 Hz) is essential and it was observed that subjects have high PSD activities in 
                           α
                         frequency region in the pre-recognition phase due to high focus and concentration on the shape recognition task. The PSD magnitudes and distributions of one of the subjects’ brain activity in 
                           α
                         frequency region are shown in Fig. 14
                        . As can be seen in Fig. 14 (Upper), the activities in the individual frequencies of the 
                           α
                         band show large magnitudes of PSDs for a set of images during the pre-recognition phase. The figure depicts measured PSD of the 14 channels in the neuroheadset with respect to 8–13 Hz frequencies. Fig. 14 (Lower) depicts the PSD activity for 
                           α
                         frequency region during the latter stages of the experiment (recognition phase).

While analyzing the subject’s brain activity for each segment of the experiment (a single image), it was also observed that the addition of certain specific features (i.e., segments of shapes) to the previous images in bottom to top approach triggers more attention and vigorous thinking from the subject indicating deep focus on the recognition task. Once these “special features” are present in a given stage of the experiment, the brain maps of the users show high PSDs generated continuously for the whole span of viewing that image. For special feature identifications, we observe highest energies in the regions near channels FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, T8, P8, and FC6.

Observation of specific features leading to higher PSDs in subjects leads to following questions: (1)  What are the most informative fragments or features in the overall shape? (2)  Is it possible to isolate and identify specific informative shape features that give rise to higher attention (PSDs) in subjects? To answer the posed question, we further investigated the relationship between specific shape features and subjects’ brain activities. Specifically, we measured the cognitive load of a subject during each stage of the experiment to elicit shape features that lead to higher brain activities in subjects. We detail the results of cognitive load measurements in next subsection.

In this study, the key idea was to get the indication of subjects’ cognitive load to identify specific informative shape features that give rise to higher attention (PSDs). We investigated how the users’ cognitive load varied during each stage of experiments by computing cognitive load (Section  4.3.3) of a subject during a given stage of experiment from collected EEG data (subjects’ brain signals) and PSD features. Cognitive load calculation at each stage of the experiment was used to generate cognitive load pattern over the whole experiment. The computation of cognitive load pattern formed a basis for identifying the informative features of the overall shape.


                           Fig. 15
                            shows the cognitive loads measurements for each session of the experiments for five different subjects for the shape of the map of United States of America. For the US map, there was a total of 22 stages (Images) in the experiment showing the gradual emergence of the overall shape. One important thing to note is that every person (every subject) has different cognitive abilities. Cognitive ability variability caused different subjects to recognize the same shape in different numbers of stages. We stop processing the data once the subject has identified the overall shape. To better represent this aspect we have added a dotted red line after we stop processing the data. The addition of red dotted lines allows us to have the same range in the 
                              X
                           -axis same for all the experiments in Fig. 15. The 
                              Y
                           -axis plots the measured cognitive load during each stage of the experiment.

One can observe that visualization of different shape features during each stage of the experiment leads to varying amount of cognitive load. The subjects’ cognitive loads either increased or decreased after visualizing a particular shape feature during a given stage of the experiment. For example, for subject 1, the magnitude of cognitive load is very high for some stages as compared to the immediate previous stage. Increase in cognitive load during these stages indicates that the subjects’ concentration and focus increased tremendously after the addition of–what users thought as intuitive–important shape features during such stages. Similarly, the some shape feature displayed in the next stage/image did not add any further useful information to what the subject actually had from the previous stage with high cognitive information. Hence, the cognitive load decreased drastically indicating loss of focus and deep thinking, and relaxation during that stage. Such higher cognitive loads (i.e. critical information) for users were prominently observed during the stages/images that displayed the northeastern parts and the peninsula of Florida of the map of the USA. This is indicated in Fig. 16
                           .

The presented work objectively studies two dimensional fragmentary shape recognition process through the use of BCI. The non-accidental relations and partial geons are used in the first approach. The second approach involves the use of shape descriptor techniques to get information about the essential features of the shape. Incorporation of BCI in the recognition process is a new and emerging concept, and the results show that BCI will play a critical role in the related future studies.

The investigation of users’ brain signals monitored during the experiments shows that, whenever a partial shape is represented in the form of specific non-accidental relations, certain regions of brain produce significantly high energies (PSDs) due to high levels of concentration and focus towards the task of identification. These PSDs are observed in the EEG signals related to the 
                        α
                      frequencies. The results also estimate that as soon as the subjects recognize the actual shape in its fragmentary representation, the previously generated high energies decrease drastically due to drop in the focus and intrigue levels, hence indicating the shape recognition.

Similar results were obtained for the recognition using a set of images showing the gradual emergence of shape from noisy images. An understanding about how humans interpret the objects better with their important features is assessed with the collected EEG data analysis. The examination of cognitive loads during the sessions of the experiments gives an insight into the features of shapes which proved useful for users’ understanding. Higher cognitive loads were observed for such features. Some of the features that did not add much visual information for the users incurred lesser cognitive loads due to drop in focus and thinking.

In future, establishing a larger user database would be a useful idea. Since generalization of the obtained results in the BCI studies is a skeptical issue, a larger collection of EEG data is always welcome. Another future direction could include classification of non-accidental relations with the help of collected EEG data (PSD metric) and the machine learning techniques. This will help in the automatic segmentation of shapes and may play a very useful part in the cognitive human interaction with smart systems. The PSD metric could serve as an accurate proxy to recognize certain shapes  [38], interaction commands  [2], and enable mutual disambiguation  [1]. Metrics like PSD combined with machine learning techniques could pave the way for developing new interfaces and interaction methods.

One of the major future directions includes an extension of the presented partial shape recognition study to the three dimensional objects and shapes. In this study, only the two dimensional shapes were taken into consideration. But extending this concept to 3D would help in the proper segmentation of objects in their primitive parts or 3D geons. Even the users will be able to identify the 3D objects in a better manner because humans are very much familiar to 3D objects in their day to day lives.

Another study could incorporate the use of more complex shape descriptors to obtain the essential features of the shape. It will be interesting to see how such different kinds of features affect the human thinking abilities about the shapes and how can these features help humans identify the objects. Additionally, the presented study assumed that the user is familiar with the shape used in the study. The results could be different if the user has not seen the shape before. Studying the effect of the familiarity or dis-familiarity of the shape with respect to the fragmentary shape recognition process is another avenue of future research.
