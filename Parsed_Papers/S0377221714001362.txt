                  The goal of factor screening is to find the really important inputs (factors) among the many inputs that may be changed in a realistic simulation experiment. A specific method is sequential bifurcation (SB), which is a sequential method that changes groups of inputs simultaneously. SB is most efficient and effective if the following assumptions are satisfied: (i) second-order polynomials are adequate approximations of the input/output functions implied by the simulation model; (ii) the signs of all first-order effects are known; and (iii) if two inputs have no important first-order effects, then they have no important second-order effects either (heredity property). This paper examines SB for random simulation with multiple responses (outputs), called multi-response SB (MSB). This MSB selects groups of inputs such that—within a group—all inputs have the same sign for a specific type of output, so no cancellation of first-order effects occurs. To obtain enough replicates (replications) for correctly classifying a group effect or an individual effect as being important or unimportant, MSB applies Wald’s sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). The initial number of replicates in this SPRT is also selected efficiently by MSB. Moreover, MSB includes a procedure to validate the three assumptions of MSB. The paper evaluates the performance of MSB through extensive Monte Carlo experiments that satisfy all MSB assumptions, and through a case study representing a logistic system in China; the results are very promising.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Whereas real-world experiments typically have only a small number of factors (less than ten?), simulation experiments may involve numerous factors or inputs; e.g., the ecological case study by Bettonvil and Kleijnen (1997) has 281 inputs. Screening is defined as searching for the really important inputs among the many inputs that may be changed in a simulation experiment; this is based on the so-called Pareto or sparsity-of-effects principle. We also refer to the general review of design and analysis of simulation experiments by Kleijnen, Sanchez, Lucas, and Cioppa (2005). This search should also cure the so-called “curse of dimensionality”, so that after the screening phase the analysts can apply classic metamodels such as low-order polynomial regression and Kriging models.

There are several screening methods, including classic two-level designs, frequency domain experimentation, supersaturated designs, and aggregated designs, detailed by Kleijnen (2008). A recent publication on screening is Moon, Dean, and Santner (2012), assuming deterministic simulation (not random, discrete-event simulation), only two stages (not fully sequential), and a Kriging metamodel (not a polynomial metamodel). In this paper, however, we focus on the screening method called sequential bifurcation (SB), because it seems the most efficient and effective method—if its assumptions are satisfied. Several case studies illustrate that these assumptions may be realistic; see Kleijnen, Bettonvil, and Persson (2006); Wan, Ankenman, and Nelson (2010) and the case study in Section 4.

SB is a sequential aggregated design. By definition, sequential designs select the input combinations (also called design or inputs points) as the experimental results become available; i.e., sequential methods learn from preceding experimental results. Aggregated designs imply that some individual inputs are treated as a whole; i.e., if the aggregate changes from one value to another value, then all its individual inputs do so. SB’s first step aggregates all inputs of the simulation model into a single factor, and tests whether this factor has a significant first-order effect. Depending on this test outcome, SB either discards the aggregated factor in case of a non-significant main effect or splits this factor into two subfactors; this splitting is called bifurcation. If there is a next step, then SB tests whether the two smaller subfactors have significant main effects; next, SB splits a significant subfactor into smaller subfactors. Finally, SB estimates the main effects of all significant individual inputs.

The first paper on SB is Bettonvil and Kleijnen (1997); that paper assumes deterministic simulation. Next, SB is extended to random (stochastic) discrete-event simulation by Cheng (1997); Cheng’s method is modified by Yaesoubi, Roberts, and Klein (2010). SB for random simulation is also discussed by Kleijnen et al. (2006), illustrating SB through a supply-chain case study with 92 inputs. Wan, Ankenman, and Nelson (2006) combine Bettonvil and Kleijnen’s (1997) SB with a hypothesis-testing procedure, to control the type-I and type-II error probabilities; next, Wan et al. (2010) generalize their procedure to improve its efficiency and efficacy. Shen and Wan (2009) develop a controlled sequential factorial design (CSFD) that combines a traditional factorial design with sequential hypothesis testing; Shen, Wan, and Sanchez (2010) further improve the efficiency by combining CSFD and the design in Wan et al. (2010).

Based on the preceding literature survey, we conclude that SB is a relatively new method that has attracted the attention of several researchers. However, none of these researchers examines SB—or other screening methods—for simulation with multiple responses (outputs, performance measures). In practice, a simulation model does provide multiple responses; e.g., a supply chain management case study with multiple simulation outputs is Shi, Liu, Shang, and Cui (2013).

Naive SB for simulation with multiple outputs applies SB to each type of output successively (even if the simulation model has a single type of output, experimenting with this simulation model will generate several observations on this output for different input combinations; for brevity’s sake we write “output” instead of “type of output” if no confusion seems likely). We, however, propose multi-response SB (MSB). Our main conclusion will be that MSB may be more efficient (fewer simulated input combinations and replicates, so less computer time) and more effective (higher probability of finding important inputs). Note that efficiency is crucial for computationally expensive simulation.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 extends SB to multiple outputs, using similar assumptions as SB does. Because an individual input may increase some output and decrease another output, MSB selects groups of inputs such that—within a group—all inputs have the same sign for a specific output. We detail MSB for only two output types. To determine the number of replicates, MSB applies a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). This section also gives a procedure to validate the three assumptions of MSB. Section 3 compares the performance of MSB and SB through Monte Carlo experiments that satisfy all SB or MSB assumptions; this section also includes a more efficient rule for selecting the initial number of replicates per stage. Section 4 evaluates the robustness of MSB through a case study representing a logistic system in China; MSB turns out to require fewer simulation observations than naive SB. Section 5 presents the main conclusions. Appendixes are published as a single Online Supplement.

The basic idea of our MSB is inherited from SB; i.e., MSB contains a sequence of steps in which the main effects of input groups are estimated and tested. Specifically, if a group is declared to be non-significant, then all inputs in the group are classified as unimportant and discarded in the next steps. However, if a group is declared significant, then this group is split into two subgroups for further evaluation. A basic MSB rule is to declare a group of inputs to be important if at least one of the (multiple) outputs shows significant changes. Moreover, the unique feature of MSB is its attempt to estimate the main effects of groups for all outputs, while minimizing the experimental effort compared with SB for a single output; details are given in the next subsections. We give the major MSB symbols and their definitions in Table 1
                     , in which the superscript and subscript denote the output and input respectively (superscripts use parentheses, so superscripts are not interpreted as power coefficients); in SPRT, we follow Wan et al.’s (2010) symbols as closely as we can. This table will be explained in the next subsections.

We use the following three basic assumptions for MSB, which Bettonvil and Kleijnen (1997) also use for SB.

                         makes the input effects scale-free so they are comparable when determining the important inputs. To estimate the main effect in (1), it is efficient to select only two values per input. In practice, the users of the underlying simulation model should provide these values and ensure that these values are realistic extreme values, given the goal of the simulation model.

                        Assumption 2 is a basic assumption of all group-screening methods, because this assumption avoids cancellation of individual first-order effects within the group effect. In practice, Assumption 2 may indeed hold, as the case studies mentioned in Section 1 illustrate.
                           Assumption 3
                           If two inputs have no important first-order effects, then they have no important second-order effects either.


                        Assumption 3 is the so-called “heredity property” discussed in Wu and Hamada (2009).

                        . The definition applies the so-called foldover principle, which was originally developed for real-life experiments—with a few factors—so that two-factor interactions do not bias the estimators of the main effect (Montgomery, 2007). In SB and MSB the foldover principle ensures that second-order effects (two-factor interactions and purely quadratic effects) do not bias the first-order estimators—which we prove as follows.

The metamodel assumed in (1) implies that

Now we define a “group” of inputs such that there is no cancellation of individual effects within the group. Table 2 gave an example of two groups with group 1 containing inputs 1 through 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                         so both outputs increase and group 2 containing inputs 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              +
                              1
                           
                         through K so output 1 increases and output 2 decreases. This gives the following definition.
                           Definition 5
                           A group of inputs has either all n outputs increase or all n outputs decrease when changing all the individual inputs in this group from −1 to 1.

                        Fig. 1
                         gives some details for the case of two outputs and two groups. The case of two outputs with only one group is very straightforward, so we present its details in Appendix B. The case of more than two outputs is of less interest because most practical simulation models (e.g., our case study) give only two outputs; anyhow, details on the general case of n outputs are presented in Appendix C, and this case is also listed under future research.

In this subsection, we concentrate on MSB in the simple and practical case of only two outputs (so 
                           
                              n
                              =

                         in group 1 increase both outputs, whereas the inputs

                         through K in group 2 increase output 1 and decrease output 2. Fig. 1 details the MSB procedure for this situation; we shall detail the SPRT (mentioned in this figure) in Section 2.4.

In Appendix B we detail two special cases of 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              2
                           
                         outputs; namely, there is a single group of inputs so 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              =
                              K
                           
                         because (i) each input makes both outputs increase, or (ii) each input makes one output increase and the other output decrease.

To test the significance of the estimated main effects of groups of inputs or individual inputs, we follow Wan et al. (2010). Those authors give a testing procedure that is meant to control the type-I or 
                           
                              α
                           
                         error probability of the whole procedure and to control the type-II or 
                           
                              β
                           
                         error probability of each step. We claim that ideally their procedure should also control the type II error probability over the whole procedure with its sequence of steps; also see De and Baron (2012) for an interesting discussion of so-called familywise error probabilities, albeit in the context of clinical testing. We therefore consider Wan et al.’s (2010) SB and our MSB as heuristics that are better than apriori assuming that the majority of potentially important individual inputs are unimportant and experimenting with a small group of inputs that are subjectively assumed to be important.

Like Wan et al. (2010), we assume that the simulation outputs

Instead of applying the classic Student t statistic, Wan et al. derive a test based on Wald’s SPRT (the latter test is also discussed by Kleijnen (1987, pp. 54–55) in a simulation context, and recently by De & Baron (2012)). In general, SPRTs add one replicate at a time, and terminate as soon as a conclusion can be reached. Wan et al. (2010) apply their SPRT each time when they test a group effect (in the early stage) or an individual effect (in the final stage). Their SPRT adds one replicate at a time to the group being tested and may use CRN (also see our Theorems 1 and 2). Let r denote the current number of replicates when estimating

                         may be smaller in the early stages because those stages estimate the sum of the positive main effects of bigger groups so the signal–noise ratio is larger (this estimate uses four observations, except for the very first stage—called stage 0—which uses only two different observations); we shall detail our rule for selecting the initial sample size, in Section 3.

                        ; we expect that the resulting new estimates do not deviate much from the old estimates.

If this polynomial is accepted as valid, we test the remaining two assumptions; namely, known signs of all first-order effects in this polynomial, and heredity. If this validation procedure suggests that the MSB assumptions do not hold, then we need to look for a different screening method; see again Kleijnen (2008). Details follow in Section 4. Note that the second-order polynomial for the important inputs can be used after the screening phase, to optimize these inputs through response surface methodology (RSM).

To evaluate the performance of our MSB, we first use a Monte Carlo laboratory (later, we use a case-study in Section 4). The reason is that MSB is based on specific assumptions defined in Section 2.1, so we should start our evaluation with situations that do satisfy these assumptions; our “laboratory” fully satisfies the assumptions. Note that realistic applications may be extremely expensive; i.e., a single simulation run may take hours or days; in the Monte Carlo lab a “simulation” run (an observation) takes only (micro) seconds, depending on the computer hardware and software.

MSB is a “black-box” method; i.e., it selects a combination of the K inputs

                      (next MSB uses all available I/O data to estimate the group effects, etc.). Our Monte Carlo lab, however, is a “white box”; i.e., we select specific values for the coefficients of the second-order polynomial in (1) and the variances of the replicates (which equal the variances of the residuals); moreover we make the replicates normally, independently, and identically distributed (NIID).

Wan et al. also use a Monte Carlo lab to evaluate their SB, but they consider a single output type and 
                           
                              K

                         inputs (in Subsection 3.2 we shall consider two output types and 
                           
                              K
                              =

                         inputs). Because the selection of parameter values in a Monte Carlo experiment is rather unlimited, we follow Wan et al. as closely as we consider acceptable for our MSB. Since only one output is discussed in this subsection, we omit the superscript “

Like Wan et al. (2010, p. 488) we call inputs “unimportant” if they have main effects not exceeding

                        . Note that these rather big standard deviations require many replicates (as we shall illustrate in Table 3
                         and Fig. 3). Furthermore, like Wan et al. we select the type-I error probability 
                           
                              α

                         and the power

                        . In Monte Carlo experiments with additive noise

                        , CRN would generate a linear correlation coefficient with the extreme value 1; we therefore do not use CRN in these experiments. Like Wan et al., we resample the values for the two-factor interactions, and we select the performance measure of the Monte Carlo experiment to be the estimated probability of declaring an individual input to be important, symbolized by

Note that the final number of replicates tends to increase as the group size decreases (from stage to stage, the signal/noise ratio decreases). The conclusion of this subsection is that the new pilot-sample rule increases the efficiency of SB and MSB.

                                 Clustering of effects; the more clustered the individual important main effects are, the more efficient SB and MSB are expected to be. When there are four important inputs and they are clustered, then the important inputs are 1, 2, 99, and 100 (e.g., row 1), and the non-clustered inputs are 1, 10, 91, and 100 (e.g., row 2); when there are eight important inputs, then the clustered inputs are 1, 2, 3, 4, 97, 98, 99, 100, and the non-clustered inputs are 1, 10, 20, 30, 71, 81, 91, and 100.

Because we experiment with two levels per characteristic, there are 16 combinations. These combinations are shown in the first three columns of Table 4. In all 16 combinations there are 
                           
                              q
                              =
                              2
                           
                         groups: the 
                           
                              ±
                           
                         signs in this table mean that all important main effects are positive for output 1 and some important main effects are negative for output 2; e.g., in combination 1 the four important inputs 1, 2, 99, and 100 have positive main effects for output 1, but the inputs 99 and 100 have negative main effects for output 2.

Like Wan et al. do in their Monte Carlo experiments, we use 1000 macroreplicates. We report the average number of replicates per stage, which quantifies the efficiency; see the last two columns of this table. Both MSB and SB require increasing number of replicates for higher number of important inputs, variability of effects, noise of simulation outputs, and lack of clustering of important inputs. For example, combination 14—with 
                           
                              σ
                              =
                              10
                           
                        , eight important inputs with different values and even spread—requires the maximum number of replicates (namely, 1723 for MSB), whereas combination 3—with 
                           
                              σ
                              =
                              5
                           
                        , only four important inputs and much clustering—requires the minimum number of replicates (namely, 119 for MSB). MSB requires only approximately half the number of replicates needed by SB; i.e., input combinations applied for one output in MSB are again used when screening for the other output. Therefore, we conclude that MSB requires fewer input combinations and number of replicates than SB does.

Besides the efficiency, we also study the efficacy quantified through

In combination 14, MSB gives rates of 0.04 and 0.05, which are not significantly higher than the SB rates, which are 0.02). So, both MSB and SB give appropriate type-I error rates and power.

                        ; also see combination 14 (south-eastern corner). Our explanation is that an input that is unimportant for one output has a chance to be important for the other output, so the probability of declaring this input to be important increases.

In addition, we conduct another set of experiments in which the two outputs do not have effects with same magnitudes; i.e., the magnitudes for output 1 are doubled for output 2. It is realistic that the thresholds for the two outputs also differ; i.e.,

In this section we discuss a case study concerning a Chinese third-party logistics (TPL) company that wants to improve its just-in-time (JIT) system for its customer, a car manufacturer. Appendix E shows a flow chart which depicts the flow of parts, truck scheduling, etc. Given China’s rapid economic growth, Feng, Zhang, Zhang, Fu, and Zhang (2010) estimate that the Chinese car market will grow 10–15% over the next decade. To satisfy this demand, the TPL customer expects to open another assembly plant. When this new plant becomes operational, the current TPL capacity will not meet the logistic needs. Management wants to maintain the current logistic performance, measured through the average cycle time (CT) of a part and the number of throughput (NT) per month (30days). A long CT conflicts with the JIT philosophy. NT is the sum of the shipments collected at the part suppliers and delivered to the assembly plants within a production cycle of 30days. Therefore, our goal is to identify important inputs, and to make the outputs CT and NT satisfy desired values.

Our simulation model has 26 inputs that may affect CT or NT. These inputs together with their low and high values are detailed in the appendix. All inputs are quantitative, except for one input; namely, the queue discipline. The appendix also shows that only the inputs 1 through 5 have the same signs for both outputs. So we form two groups; namely, group 1 with inputs 1 though 5 and group 2 with inputs 6 through 26.

The appendix shows that SB requires 238 and 117 replicates for CT and NT respectively. So, altogether SB requires 355 replicates, whereas MSB requires only 233 replicates. SB and MSB identify the same inputs as being important; SB identifies the inputs 4, 5, 14, 17, and 20 for CT and input 17 for NT. Note that MSB and SB do not use the same input combinations in every stage.

Finally, we validate the MSB assumptions. We use a CCD for the five inputs that MSB declares to be important (Wan et al. also use a CCD, but that CCD covers all 20 inputs in their case-study). This CCD enables the estimation of the 21 individual effects in the second-degree polynomial. We obtain

                      replicates for each combination in the CCD, after considering the numbers in the last stages of Fig. 5. The unimportant quantitative inputs we fix at their coded value 0. The one unimportant qualitative input we set to +1, which denotes FIFO and is the current queueing rule of the TPL company. We use CRN.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the resulting I/O data shows that the second-order polynomials for CT and NT have high

                     . So, the second-order polynomials are much better, and we can indeed use them to predict the outputs; i.e., Assumption 1 holds for the important inputs; also see (1).

Given that the two second-order polynomials for the five important inputs are valid, we now discuss their individual estimated coefficients which are given in the appendix. These coefficients show that the signs of the estimated main effects of the important inputs agree with the assumed signs; namely, inputs 4 and 5 have minus signs for both CT and NT, whereas inputs 14, 17, and 20 have opposite signs for these outputs. So we conclude that Assumption 2 (known signs of all main effects) holds for the important inputs. This assumption and Assumption 3 (heredity) are now further examined.

To test that all first-order effects and second-order effects of all unimportant inputs are zero, we select

We use LHS with uniform sampling of values between −1 and 1 for all 25 quantitative inputs, and sampling the two values −1 and 1 for the qualitative input; this LHS is detailed in the appendix.

                     , so we accept the two metamodels. We conclude that all three MSB assumptions hold in this case study.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we presented a novel method for factor screening in (random) discrete-event simulation with multiple response types; we call this method “multiple sequential bifurcation” (MSB). This MSB assumes (i) a second-order polynomial is a valid metamodel of the I/O function of the simulation model; (ii) the first-order effects have known signs; and (iii) the “heredity” property applies. These three assumptions may indeed hold in realistic simulation models, as our case-study shows.

MSB extends sequential bifurcation (SB), originally published by Bettonvil and Kleijnen (1997). Later on, Wan et al. (2010) extended this SB to random simulation, using a SPRT to determine the number of replicates in each stage such that the type-I and type-II error rates be controlled. In this paper we derived a more efficient rule for determining the initial number of replicates needed to start their SPRT. Moreover, we extended this SPRT to simulation with multiple responses, using Bonferroni’s inequality.

More specifically, MSB uses groups of inputs such there is no cancellation of main effects for any output type. Moreover, MSB includes a novel procedure to validate the three assumptions of SB and MSB. Finally, MSB takes advantage of the characteristic that running a simulation model gives observations on all output types; i.e., when screening for one output, all the other output types become available “for free”.

Our Monte Carlo experiments ensure that all three assumptions of SB or MSB are satisfied. The first experiments—inspired by Wan et al.’s (2010) experiments—show that MSB requires fewer replicates than Wan et al.’s SB; i.e., MSB is more efficient. Our next experiment considers two outputs, a hundred inputs in two groups, and four problem characteristics; namely, the effects’ sparsity, signal–noise, variability, and clustering. This experiment shows that—compared with SB—our MSB is again more efficient (fewer observations), and more effective (better control of the two error rates).

Our case study concerning a Chinese third-party logistics company has two outputs and 26 inputs that form two groups. MSB finds the same important inputs as SB, but requires fewer observations. The validation procedure accepts all three assumptions used in MSB and SB. So MSB seems a robust screening method.

Future research may focus on our SPRT, following De and Baron (2012) with many recent references—albeit not in a simulation context; also see Haridy, Wu, Lee, and Bhuiyan (2013). Because we focused on two outputs and only outline our MSB for more than two outputs, future research may examine more than two outputs. Future case studies should confirm the robustness of MSB. Finally, future research may compare our MSB with other screening methods mentioned in the introduction; e.g., Shen et al.’s (2010) hybrid screening method.
