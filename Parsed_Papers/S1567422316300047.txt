               Abstract
               
                  Mobile Internet has developed rapidly, and various types of mobile Internet services have changed people’s lifestyles profoundly. Consequently, there is a broad market for mobile Internet service providers. To provide better service and attract users, service providers must understand their users’ behavior patterns. This study proposes a framework to model users’ mobile online behavior based on a multi-state model and a hidden Markov model; this study also extracts typical sequential behavior patterns through clustering methods. The results of the experiments display several characteristic behavior patterns that can guide service providers in application designing, operating, and marketing.
