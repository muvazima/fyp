                  This paper presents two new dynamic programming (DP) algorithms to find the exact Pareto frontier for the bi-objective integer knapsack problem. First, a property of the traditional DP algorithm for the multi-objective integer knapsack problem is identified. The first algorithm is developed by directly using the property. The second algorithm is a hybrid DP approach using the concept of the bound sets. The property is used in conjunction with the bound sets. Next, the numerical experiments showed that a promising partial solution can be sometimes discarded if the solutions of the linear relaxation for the subproblem associated with the partial solution are directly used to estimate an upper bound set. It means that the upper bound set is underestimated. Then, an extended upper bound set is proposed on the basis of the set of linear relaxation solutions. The efficiency of the hybrid algorithm is improved by tightening the proposed upper bound set. The numerical results obtained from different types of bi-objective instances show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The multi-objective integer knapsack problem (MOIKP) is one of the most widely studied multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems where every solution is evaluated according to two or more objectives (Ehrgott, 2005). Most real-life decision problems have to deal with several conflicting criteria which must be optimized simultaneously. MOIKPs can be encountered in a wide range of applications such as capital budgeting (Klamroth & Wiecek, 2000; Kwak, Shi, Lee, & Lee, 1996; Rosenblatt & Sinuany-Stern, 1989), selection of different investment projects (Alanne, 2004; Bas, 2011; Teng & Tzeng, 1996), or relocation issues arising in nature conservation (Kostreva, Ogryczak, & Tonkyn, 1999), or pollution issues for remediation planning (Jenkins, 2002).

A MOIKP can be defined as follows. Consider a knapsack capacity, W, and a set of n items where each item 
                        
                           j

The problem consists of determining the number of copies for each item such that the overall weight does not exceed W and the total profits are maximized in a Pareto sense. The MOIKP can also be stated as a multi-objective integer linear programming model as follows:

In a multi-objective combinatorial optimization context, the computational effort for identifying the PF is large because the problem of determining whether a given objective vector (outcome) is dominated or not is 
                        
                           NP
                        
                     -hard (Serafini, 1986) even though the underlying single objective optimization problem can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time. For a given number of objectives, a multi-objective optimization with 0-1 decision variables is much easier to handle than the problem with general integer variables because the problem structure of the former is simpler and combinations of the decision variables for the former are fewer. Therefore, algorithms for solving the 0-1 multi-objective knapsack problem (MOKP) are relatively abundant when compared with algorithms especially designed for the MOIKP.

The 0-1 MOKP as well as the MOIKP fall into the category of multi-objective integer problems. Thus, the resolution of the MOIKP can benefit from the algorithmic developments of both the 0-1 MOKP and the multi-objective integer problem. The literature in the field includes exact and approximate approaches. The former are targeted to find the exact PF while the latter aim at approximating the PF. Exact approaches include dynamic programming (DP) algorithms (Bazgan, Hugot, & Vanderpooten, 2009a; Captivo, Clímaco, Figueira, Martins, & Santos, 2003; Delort & Spanjaard, 2010; Figueira, Tavares, & Wiecek, 2010; Figueira, Paquete, Simões, & Vanderpooten, 2013; Rong & Figueira, 2013; Rong, Figueira, & Pato, 2011; Villarreal & Karwan, 1981), branch-and-bound (BB) algorithms (Florios, Mavrotas, & Diakoulaki, 2010; Mavrotas & Diakoulaki, 2005; Mavrotos, Figueira, & Antoniadis, 2011; Ponte, Paquete, & Figueira, 2012; Visée, Teghem, Pirlot, & Ulungu, 1998), and other exact methods as for example the following ones: exact algorithms that exploit the development for multi-objective linear programs (Jolai, Rezaee, Rabbani, Razmi, & Fattahi, 2007), greedy optimal algorithms (Gorski, Paquete, & Pedrosa, 2012) for a special class of multi-dimensional knapsack problems with binary weights, exact algorithms based on a partition of the search space (Dhaenens, Lemestre, & Talbi, 2010) and algorithms (Laumanns, Thiele, & Zitzler, 2006; Mavrotas & Florios, 2013; Özlen & Azizoğlu, 2009; Przybylski, Gandibleux, & Ehrgott, 2010; Sylva & Crema, 2004, 2007; Zhang & Reimann, 2014) resorting to the scalarization techniques (Ehrgott, 2005) such as weighted-sum method and

                     -constraint method as well as a general approach for preserving the lexicographic order of efficient solutions in the decision space (Schweigert & Neumayer, 1997). Approximate approaches include polynomial approximation schemes (Bazgan, Hugot, & Vanderpooten, 2009b), tailored heuristics (Zhang & Ong, 2004; Mavrotas, Figueira, & Florios, 2009; Köksalan & Lokman, 2009), and metaheuristics (Alves & Almeida, 2007; Aytgˇ & Sayin, 2009; Ben Abdelaziz, Kirchem, & Chaouadi, 1999; Gandibleux & Fréville, 2000; Gomes da Silva, Clímaco, & Figueira, 2006, 2004; Gomes da Silva, R Figueira, & Clímaco, 2007; Jaszkiewicz, 2004). The interested readers can also be referred to several comprehensive surveys (Ehrgott & Gandibleux, 2000; Jones, Mirrazav, & Tamiz, 2002; Ulungu & Teghem, 1994) for both exact and approximate approaches.

Research on multi-objective integer problems dates back to more than three decades ago when Villarreal and Karwan (1981) proposed both basic and hybrid DP approaches. These authors also proposed for the first time the concept of bound sets for the hybrid approach. A bound set consists of a set of bounds, which helps in discarding dominated outcomes in multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems. Very recently, an operational way to compute bound sets has been devised based on the convex hull of the image of solutions in the objective space (Ehrgott & Gandibleux, 2007; Sourd & Spanjaard, 2008). For the 0-1 bi-objective knapsack problem, Delort and Spanjaard (2010) and Ponte et al. (2012) applied the concept of bound sets to develop a DP algorithm and a BB algorithm respectively. Similarly, Figueira et al. (2013) applied the concept of bound sets to improve the solution efficiency for DP algorithms.

However, for the MOIKPthe upper bound set was only defined conceptually in Villarreal and Karwan (1981) and there was no efficient operational way to compute the upper bound set. Overall, the algorithm development for the MOIKP advances much more slowly when compared with the 0-1 MOKP. In Klamroth and Wiecek (2000), conceptually DP network approaches for different variants of MOIKP were proposed. In Figueira et al. (2010), an implementation of the generic labeling algorithm for the MOIKP and several network models were considered. Very recently, several reduction techniques were introduced in Rong and Figueira (2013) for improving the solution efficiency for the bi-objective integer knapsack problem.

The current research aims at generating the exact PF for the bi-objective integer knapsack problem (BOIKP) using bound sets in the DP algorithm context. Different from Delort and Spanjaard (2010), the bound sets are applied with the multi-objective DP algorithm for solving the original BOIKP directly instead of using the single-objective DP algorithm for solving a sequence of weighted-sum problems in a two-phase framework. In addition, the way of designing bound sets is different. Delort and Spanjaard (2010) did not directly use the set of feasible solutions (the solution of the problem refers to the outcome in the objective space throughout the paper) as a lower bound set considering the non-convexity of the PF. The authors extended the set of feasible solutions to increase the threshold of discarding partial solutions so that promising partial solutions can be kept. The current study directly uses the set of feasible solutions as a lower bound set and guarantees that the promising partial solutions can be kept by extending the set of linear relaxations (upper bound set).

The contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows. First, the numerical experiments showed that for a given partial solution associated with a non-dominated outcome of the problem (promising partial solution), the bound set estimated by the set of linear relaxation solutions of the subproblem cannot always provide a proper upper bound set to guarantee that it is kept during the solution process. Then an extended upper bound set is proposed on the basis of the set of linear relaxation solutions. Second, a property of the traditional DP algorithm for the MOIKP is newly identified in the current research. The first new DP algorithm is developed by directly using the property. The main difference between the new and the traditional DP algorithms (the best algorithm in Figueira et al. (2010)) is that the new algorithm can reduce significantly the number of nodes to aggregate at the last time-consuming aggregating stage. Usually, for the multi-objective DP algorithm, the complete non-dominated set for the problem cannot be obtained at a single node. In stead, it needs to be obtained by a union operation of the outcomes for the nodes at the last stage of the DP process (Figueira et al., 2010). The second hybrid algorithm is developed by using the property in conjunction with bound sets. The property is used to reduce the number of the recorded nodes during the DP process and the above proposed bound set is tightened by controlling the extent to which the linear relaxation solutions are extended.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces a property of the DP algorithm for the MOIKP. Section 3 discusses the bound sets for the BOIKP. Section 4 describes the DP algorithm using the bound sets. Section 5 reports the numerical results for the bi-objective instances. A comparison with different benchmark algorithms is provided.

DP (Bellman, 1957) is an optimization approach that decomposes a complex problem into a sequence of simpler subproblems. It can be considered as a recursive process, which interprets an optimization problem as a multi-stage decision process. Associated with each stage of the optimization problem are the states of the process. The state is a way to describe a solution of the subproblem, which contains enough information to make future decisions without the need for checking how the process reached the current state. Finally, a recursion optimization procedure is set up to describe the transition from state to state so that the solution of the problem can be obtained by solving multi-stage subproblems sequentially. There are different representations of the states as well as the transitions between the states for the MOIKP, see Klamroth and Wiecek (2000) and Figueira et al. (2010). Below the basic sequential DP (BDP) network is discussed, which is in essence the same as the network model IV in Figueira et al. (2010) without considering the source node ‘s’. In later sections, the hybrid DP algorithm using the bound set is developed on the basis of the BDP procedure.

                         nodes need to be considered. For the BDP procedure, the computational effort of the aggregate stage accounts for a large portion of solution time. Thus, applying Corollary 2 can improve the solution time efficiency of the traditional BDP algorithm significantly without increasing the memory requirements, especially when the items are ranked according to a non-increasing order of item weight.

                         illustrates the BDP network, where the nodes in grey at each stage are dominated nodes. However, these nodes have to be generated in sequence because the non-dominated outcomes of the stage are derived on the basis of these nodes. At the aggregate stage, only the last two nodes at stage 3 with positions larger than

                         need to be considered for the improved BDP procedure. In addition to improving the solution time efficiency of the BDP procedure, Theorem 1 can help to reduce the number of nodes stored in hybrid DP algorithm using the bound set (refer to the later discussion).

The concept of bound sets for the multi-objective combinatorial optimization can be viewed as an extension of the concept of upper and lower bounds for the single objective optimization. Bound sets consists of a set of bounds, which help to prune partial solutions that cannot lead to a new non-dominated outcome of the multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem (unpromising partial solutions).

In this paper, the vmax combinatorial optimization problem is considered. The operator vmax means vector maximization. The vmax problems arise when more than one objective function is to be maximized over a given feasibility region (Geoffrion, 1968). In this context, the lower bound set is relatively easy to obtain because the feasible solutions of the problem can be used to form a lower bound set. However, it is not easy to compute an effective upper bound set considering the non-convexity of the PF. Ehrgott and Gandibleux (2007) and Sourd and Spanjaard (2008) proposed the idea of using linear relaxation of the problem to compute an upper bound set.

Though the set of linear relaxation solutions for the original problem allows to define an upper bound set for the non-dominated set, numerical experiments with the BOIKP instances showed that a promising partial solution can be discarded sometimes during the solution process if the linear relaxation solutions of the subproblem associated with the partial solution are directly used to estimate an upper bound set. It means that the upper bound set is underestimated or not properly estimated. A properly estimated (or proper) upper bound set should guarantee that all the promising partial solutions are kept while unpromising partial solutions are discarded as many as possible. Nevertheless, a majority of non-dominated outcomes can be generated using such an upper bound set. Therefore, the set of linear relaxation solutions remains a basis for estimating a good upper bound set for the BOIKP if it is extended properly.

In the following, the definitions of the bound sets are first reviewed. Then an illustrative example is provided. Next, the example is used to illustrate the process of computing a bound set according to the linear relaxation solutions of the subproblem as well as the insufficiency of the bound set (Section 3.2.2) as a proper upper bound set. Then a scheme (Section 3.2.3) is presented to obtain an effective upper bound set by extending the set of linear relaxation solutions. Finally, an algorithm for computing bound sets of the subproblem is given.

Here a simple definition of bound sets is given by summarizing the results in Villarreal and Karwan (1981), Ehrgott and Gandibleux (2007) and Sourd and Spanjaard (2008).

In addition, the bound sets should be defined in coordination, e.g., for the vmax combinatorial problem, if the lower bound set does include the elements dominating those in

                        , then it is not possible to have effective bounding principles to prune unpromising partial solutions. Accordingly, bound sets for the vmin combinatorial problem should be defined in a similar manner. In practice, lower and upper sets should be estimated properly to prune unpromising nodes consistently without losing any non-dominated outcome. The bounding principles for the vmax optimization problem, which will be presented formally and rigorously in formula (MBP) in Section 4.1, are briefly stated as follows. A partial solution will be discarded if all the elements in the upper bound set are dominated by the elements in the lower bound set while it should be kept if there exists at least one element in the upper bound set, which is not dominated by the elements in the the lower bound set.

For the algorithm using bound sets in the current study, motivated by the concept that the non-dominated set itself can serve as a lower bound set, the lower bound set is designed to be the feasible solutions of problem, which is used to approximate the non-dominated set of the problem, instead of using the polyline

The linear relaxation solutions can be obtained by solving a sequence of weighted-sum functions using either a general algorithm as in Ehrgott and Gandibleux (2007) or a special algorithm as in Gomes da Silva, Clímaco, and Figueira (2008). For a given weighted-sum function, the linear relaxation solution is determined by the two items with the largest profit-to-weight efficiencies, called efficient pair. It means that the item with the second largest efficiency is always the break item for the problem regardless of the capacity of the knapsack. The algorithm presented in Gomes da Silva et al. (2008) can be used to generate all the efficient pairs according to the break item.

During the DP process, usually the upper and lower bound sets of the problem are estimated according to the residual problem of the nodes. For a given node

The residual problem in each stage of the DP process contains the same items but have different residual capacities 
                           
                              W
                              -
                              t
                           
                         according to different node weights t. It means that the efficient pairs only need to be computed once in each stage. For a given residual capacity, the linear relaxation solutions are obtained by placing as many (integer) copies of the first item in each efficient pair as possible with the remaining capacity (if any) occupied by the second item.

Therefore, if several efficient pairs have the same first item (e.g., two efficient pairs 
                           
                              (

                              962
                           
                        ) and the residual capacity (e.g., 9620) happens to be a multiple of the weight for the first item, then linear relaxation solutions contain zero copies of the second item. In this case, several linear relaxation solutions coincide and the number of relaxation solutions for the residual problem is smaller than the number of efficient pairs. Generally speaking, the linear relaxation solutions are less sensitive to the residual capacity when compared with the non-dominated set of the BOIKP.

In the DP process, to estimate the upper bound set for the problem, linear relaxation solutions need to be computed only for stages 
                              
                                 α

                           . For the last stage n, only one item n is left and the upper bound set can be trivially computed (refer to Steps 7 and 8 of Algorithm 1).

                            are non-dominated outcomes. It can be seen that the set of linear relaxation solutions for the original problem (formula (8)) does provide a proper upper set for the problem according to Definition 3. However, it does not offer much help in pruning unpromising partial solutions. In the DP process, an estimated upper bound set according to the residual problem of a partial solution should play a role in helping to generate the non-dominated outcomes effectively and efficiently by discarding unpromising partial solutions properly.

In the following, let us check whether an estimated bound set according to linear relaxation solutions of the residual problem for node

                            should be discarded without losing any non-dominated outcome according to the bounding principles mentioned in Section 3.1 because all the elements in formula (9) (points ‘

                                 (

                            (point ‘+’ in Fig. 3) has to be generated on the basis of the partial solution 
                              
                                 (

                           . This contradicts the assumption. To guarantee that 
                              
                                 (

                                 3244
                                 )
                              
                            is not discarded, there should exist at least one element in the estimated upper bound set, which cannot be dominated by the elements in the lower bound set according to the bounding principles. It means that the set of linear relaxations need to be extended.

The idea of full-range extension is similar to the idea of calculating the lower bound set of the bi-objective 0-1 knapsack problem presented in Delort and Spanjaard (2010) and Figueira et al. (2013). If a subset of the non-dominated outcomes is known, then the lower bound set can be estimated as the staircase curve illustrated in sub-figures (b) of Fig. 2. The lower bound set is justified because it is possible to have new non-dominated outcomes within the right triangles derived from the two known consecutive non-dominated outcomes. Similarly, if it is known that some non-dominated outcomes are lost according to the upper bound set calculated directly based on linear relaxation solutions of the residual problems and a subset of lower bounds (possible non-dominated outcomes of the problem) is known (e.g., points ’
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           ’ in Fig. 3), then the lost non-dominated outcomes should be located within some right triangles derived from the two consecutive outcomes according to linear relaxation solutions as illustrated in Fig. 4
                            (e.g., within triangle CJD). Then the upper bound set with full-range extension is estimated as the staircase curve AHBICJDKELFMG in Fig. 4. Points H and I are not shown in the figure and they are the vertices of the right angles for the triangles derived from points A and B as well points B and C, respectively. N is the point for the controlled extension as discussed later.

For randomly generated instances considered in the experiments of the current study, the following results were obtained if the set of the linear relaxation solutions for the residual problem was used to estimate the upper bound set of the original problem.

                            uncorrelated unconflicting (weight and profit objectives are not correlated and two profit objectives are positively correlated) instances can be solved correctly while 
                              
                                 10
                                 %
                              
                            of the remaining uncorrelated (two profit objectives can be either uncorrelated or negatively correlated) and more than 
                              
                                 70
                                 %
                              
                            of correlated conflicting instances (two profit objectives are negatively correlated and weight and profit objectives are positively correlated) will lose some non-dominated outcomes.

It seems that the above results are related to ratio

                           . The larger the ratio, the larger probability the instances will lose non-dominated outcomes. The 
                              
                                 |

                            depends on n and correlation relations between weight and profit objectives as well as between the profit objectives. It means that the degree of the extension for linear relaxation solutions should be related to the correlation relations among the items. For a given instance, the correlation relations among the items can be determined by a statistic measure called correlation coefficient as discussed by Rong, Figueira, and Klamroth (2012). Therefore, it is not difficult to single out correlated conflicting and uncorrelated unconflicting instances before the solution process starts.

Note that the extension of the upper bound set is equivalent to the extension for the set of linear relaxation solutions. Fig. 4 can be used to illustrate the profile of linear relaxation solutions for the residual problem if the partial solution

                            is generated. The new objective vectors together with the linear relaxation solutions form a full-range extended upper bound set as illustrated in Fig. 4. In most cases, the above full-range extended upper bound set is too large to eliminate the unpromising partial solutions effectively. Thus, it is necessary to tighten the upper bound set. Then the controlled extension scheme is given below.

As described in Section 2, in the sequential DP process, the items are processed stage by stage, one item in each stage. Conditions (b) and (d) mean that the currently processed item 
                              
                                 α
                              
                            is one of the items in the efficient pair. Condition (c) describes the situation when at least one of the criteria coordinate of two consecutive relaxation solutions has a big jump while the magnitude of the jump is kept within a certain range, e.g.,

Fathoming criteria (bounding principles) are fundamental to apply the bound sets for developing the algorithm for the multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. Unlike single objective case, a set of upper and lower bounds are used to provide the bounds for the non-dominated set of the problem instead of a single upper and lower bound. Some aspects of bounding principles have been discussed and applied in Section 3 for the illustrative purpose. In this section, bounding principles are presented formally to facilitate algorithm description and algorithm implementation.

                         can be seen in the following formula (MBP) for the bounding principle. If the left-hand side of formula (MBP) is equal to an accomplished lower bound, then the corresponding partial solution is discard. If the left-hand side is equal to a predicted lower bound, then the corresponding partial solution should be kept.

The algorithm presented here is designed for the BOIKP because the bound sets are explored for the bi-objective case. Algorithm 2 gives the procedure for computing the nodes at stage

                        , using the bound sets and Algorithm 3 gives the DP procedure using the bound sets. In the algorithm, the items are arranged in a non-decreasing order of weight. There are two advantages for such arrangement. First, for randomly generated instances, there are more efficient items with smaller weight. The algorithm may terminate earlier before stage n and a ‘flag’ used to control the termination of the algorithm (Steps 13 to 16 of Algorithm 3). Second, tighter upper bounds can be obtained when the node position

The reduction problem is obtained by a preprocessing procedure to eliminate the dominated items (Rong & Figueira, 2013). On the average, the processing time of the preprocessing procedure is much smaller than the solution time of the reduction problem. Therefore, the processing time of the preprocessing procedure is neglected. One benchmark is the

The numerical experiments were associated with the following four types of instances, similar to those for the 0-1 bi-objective knapsack instances (Bazgan et al., 2009a; Rong et al., 2011).

For a given instance, if the recorded solution time of the algorithm is zero, then the instance is solved repeatedly a sufficient number of times (e.g., 1000) and total (non-zero) time is recorded. Then the solution time of the instances is the recorded time divided by the number of repetitions. However, if the size of the reduction problem is 1, the solution time is zero and no repetitions are done. In this situation, the processing time of the preprocessing procedure should be larger than the solution time of the reduction problem. However, the former has been neglected as mentioned in the beginning of the section.

It can be seen that the preprocessing procedure can result in a more significant size reduction for uncorrelated (types A, B and C) instances than for correlated conflicting instances (type D). Overall, the size reduction can improve the performance for all the algorithms (see Table 2

In the current study, the performance improvement of the new algorithm is focused instead of reduction.

                         for uncorrected instances and worse for correlated conflicting instances for both the original and the reduction problem. This is mainly due to the fact that the upper bound set is easy to tighten for uncorrected instances but difficult for correlated conflicting instances as discussed in Section 3. Another factor is that the DPB algorithm (refer to Algorithm 3 in Section 4) can terminate earlier for uncorrelated instances.

Another phenomenon is that the relative performance of the DPB over the

                         has tendency to degrade as n increases for instances of types A and D for the reduction variant. This is due to the fact that the problem reduction causes two changes. On the one hand the performance of the

                         is improved because of the reduced size. On the other hand the room for applying the bound sets to achieve further reduction is decreased because some dominated items are removed beforehand.

Consequently, reduction gains more remarkable improvement over solution time for uncorrelated instances than for correlated conflicting instances. Avg and Max time in the table refers to the average and the maximal solution time on the 30 instances.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper presented two improved DP algorithms for the bi-objective integer knapsack problem according to two techniques. One is a property of the traditional DP algorithm for the multi-objective integer knapsack problem newly identified in the current research. The other is the concept of the bound sets. The first algorithm was developed by directly using the property and the second algorithm was a hybrid DP algorithm by using the property in conjunction with the bound sets.

The main challenge of the hybrid algorithm is to construct a proper upper bound set considering the non-convexity of the PF. Numerical experiments showed that a promising partial solution can be sometimes discarded if the solutions of linear relaxation of the subproblem associated with it are directly used to estimate an upper bound set. It means that the upper bound set is underestimated. However, a majority of non-dominated outcomes can be generated using such a bound set. Therefore, an extended upper bound set with the mechanism of controlling the extent of the extension was proposed on the basis of the set of linear relaxation solutions. The way of designing bound sets can be viewed as a dual approach to that used by Delort and Spanjaard (2010) in the sense that (Delort & Spanjaard, 2010) extended the set of feasible solutions (lower bound set) while the current study extended the set of linear relaxation solutions (upper bound set).

The numerical results obtained with different types of bi-objective instances showed the effectiveness of two new DP algorithms. The first algorithm is suitable for dealing with correlated conflicting instances (weight coefficients and profit objectives are positively correlated and two profit objectives are negatively correlated) while the hybrid algorithm is suitable for dealing with uncorrelated instances (weight coefficients and profit objectives are not correlated and the relations between two profit objectives can be either uncorrelated or correlated).

The hybrid DP algorithm for the current study can be viewed as the bi-objective version of the hybrid DP algorithm (Marsten & Morin, 1978) using bounding techniques. As commented by Dyer, Riha, and Walker (1995), the algorithm in Marsten and Morin (1978) can be viewed as a specialized breadth-first Branch and Bound (BB) tree search which uses fathoming by dominance as well as by bound. The comparisons of the current hybrid DP algorithm with this variant of BB algorithm for the bi-objective case are left for the future work.
