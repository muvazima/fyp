               Abstract
               
                  This paper explores the use of digital 3D models of museum artefacts in a creative context. It investigates how creative engagement with digital 3D models of heritage artefacts can stimulate learning and foster new forms of engagement with digital heritage artefacts. This paper is illustrated with examples of creative works from a case study undertaken in collaboration with the National Museum Cardiff.
