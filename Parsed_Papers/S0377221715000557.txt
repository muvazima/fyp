                  The paper deals with the definition and the computation of surrogate upper bound sets for the bi-objective bi-dimensional binary knapsack problem. It introduces the Optimal Convex Surrogate Upper Bound set, which is the tightest possible definition based on the convex relaxation of the surrogate relaxation. Two exact algorithms are proposed: an enumerative algorithm and its improved version. This second algorithm results from an accurate analysis of the surrogate multipliers and the dominance relations between bound sets. Based on the improved exact algorithm, an approximated version is derived. The proposed algorithms are benchmarked using a dataset composed of three groups of numerical instances. The performances are assessed thanks to a comparative analysis where exact algorithms are compared between them, the approximated algorithm is confronted to an algorithm introduced in a recent research work.

The multi-objective multi-dimensional binary knapsack problem consists in packing a subset of J into a container with limited capacity over the dimensions I. This must be done while maximizing a profit according to a set of objectives K = {1, …, p}. For this, a profit

This problem has received a lot of attention, see e.g.
                        Fréville (2004), Varnamkhasti (2012), Lust and Teghem (2012) for recent surveys. It is used for representing various practical problems as capital budgeting, allocating processors (Kellerer, Pferschy, and Pisinger, 2004; Martello and Toth, 1990; da Silva, Clímaco, and Figueira, 2004). For example, Clausen, Hjorth, Nielsen, and Pisinger (2010) consider a special case of two-dimensional knapsack for the problem of assigning seats in a train for a group of people traveling together.

Many particular cases of this problem have been studied, and all of them are

We will omit the number of dimensions and/or the number of objectives in this notation whenever p = 1 and/or m = 1. In the following, we will make a particular distinction between the single-dimensional (m = 1) and the multi-dimensional (m > 1) case. Indeed,

                         problem is also one of the most studied multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems. A number of methods have been proposed for its exact solution (Bazgan, Hugot, and Vanderpooten, 2009; Delort and Spanjaard, 2010; Jorge, 2010; Ulungu and Teghem, 1997; Visée, Teghem, Pirlot, and Ulungu, 1998).

                         problem as pointed out by Fréville (2004). In the multi-objective case, instances of this problem are often used as a benchmark to compare metaheuristics (Ishibuchi, Hitotsuyanagi, Tsukamoto, and Nojima, 2009; Jaszkiewicz, 2004; Tricoire, 2012; Zitzler and Thiele, 1999). However, this problem has received less attention in an exact context (Florios, Mavrotas, and Diakoulaki, 2010; Lust and Teghem, 2012; Mavrotas, Figueira, and Antoniadis, 2011). To our knowledge, only one exact method has been proposed for the specific

As we consider here multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems, several classes of efficient solutions need to be distinguished. Supported efficient solutions are optimal solutions of a weighted sum single objective problem (Geoffrion, 1968)

                        . Nonsupported nondominated points are located in the interior of the convex hull of Y. In the particular bi-objective case, nonsupported nondominated points are located in the interior of triangles the hypotenuse of which is defined by consecutive supported nondominated points with respect to z
                        1. The set of nonsupported efficient solutions and nondominated points are denoted respectively by X
                        NE and Y
                        NN.

Finally, we can distinguish two classes of supported efficient solutions. The set of extremal supported efficient solutions X
                        SE1 is a subset of X
                        SE the corresponding point of which is an extreme point of convY. Y
                        SN1 ≔ z(X
                        SE1) is the set of nondominated extreme points. X
                        SE2 ≔ X
                        SE∖X
                        SE1 and Y
                        SN2 ≔ Y
                        SN∖Y
                        SN1 are respectively the sets of nonextremal supported efficient solutions and nondominated points. The computation of the set Y
                        SN1 can be easily done in the bi-objective context using the algorithm by Aneja and Nair (1979), under the assumption that the corresponding single-objective problem can be solved efficiently in practice.

Bounds on the optimal value of a single-objective problem are crucial to design efficient solution methods in the single-objective case. Their generalization to the multi-objective case called bound sets 
                        (Ehrgott and Gandibleux, 2001) are used to bound YN
                        . Several definitions of bound sets have been proposed, we use the definition proposed by Ehrgott and Gandibleux (2007). Contrary to the single-objective case, the definitions of upper and lower bound sets are not symmetric. A lower bound set for YN
                         is generally given by a set of known feasible points filtered by dominance. Upper bound sets for YN
                         (or for any subset of points in

The dominance relation between bound sets is transitive. Nevertheless, if we can always compare bound values in the single-objective case, dominance between bound sets does not necessarily occur (Fig. 1
                        ). Computing several upper bound values in the single-objective context, the smallest defines naturally the tightest bound. Proposition 1 provides a way to merge upper bound sets.

It is interesting to note that the simultaneous use of several upper bound sets can thus be a way to obtain a particularly tight upper bound set (Fig. 2
                        ). We provide some additional explanations based on Figs. 1 and 2. We consider here polyhedral upper bound sets U defined by a set of extreme points {y

                        7 is not an extreme point of any of these later bound sets. This later point may not be feasible for the used relaxation, and even if it is, its importance is highlighted only when considering U
                        1 and U
                        2 simultaneously.

The surrogate relaxation 
                        (Glover, 1975) is a well known relaxation that can be used to compute an upper bound on the optimal value of

Several approximation methods for this problem have also been provided (see Wilbaut, Hanafi, and Salhi (2008) for a recent survey, and Boyer, Elkihel, and Baz (2009); Fleszar and Hindi (2009); Puchinger, Raidl, and Pferschy (2010) for recent contributions on the 0–1 multi-dimensional knapsack problem).

The surrogate relaxation can also be considered for the multi-objective case, we obtain thus an instance of

                        1, …, um
                        ). By transitivity, it is thus also an upper bound set for YN
                        . This last upper bound set has been used by da Silva et al. (2004) and Perederieiva (2011).

In the following, we will consider upper bound sets of the kind (convYSN(u1, u2))N for the specific bi-objective bi-dimensional case 
                           
                              (
                              2
                              O

                        . This kind of upper bound set will be called convex surrogate upper bound set (CSUB). As multipliers take only non-negative values, we can divide both multipliers u
                        1 and u
                        2 by (u
                        1 + u
                        2), so that their sum becomes equal to 1. In other words, only one multiplier u becomes necessary in order to specify a particular CSUB, that will be denoted by CSUB(u) ≔ (convYSN(u))N. The same way, surrogate relaxations will be denoted 
                           
                              (

                              u

                         and their sets of (extreme supported) efficient solutions and nondominated points will be denoted respectively XE
                        (u) (X
                        SE1(u)) and YN
                        (u) (Y
                        SN1(u)).

The purpose of this paper is to first to characterize and next to determine the tightest possible bound set for YN
                         using CSUBs for the specific

                         problem. This upper bound set will be defined in Section 2.1. An attempt of adaptation of a classical dichomotic method will be proposed in Section 2.2, with some unexpected difficulties. In Section 3, theoretical foundations about the differentiation of CSUBs depending on the used multiplier are provided. Based on this, an original approach enumerating all CSUB is proposed in Section 4. Afterwards, an improved algorithm based on dominance relations between CSUBs is proposed in Section 5, and a derived heuristic algorithm in Section 6. Numerical experiments are finally provided in Section 7.

The goal is to determine (efficiently) the tightest possible upper bound set that can be obtained for 
                           
                              (
                              2
                              O
                              2
                              DKP

                         using CSUBs. In other words, we aim to propose a generalization of the dual surrogate problem for the bi-objective case.

As stated in Section 1.2 two upper bound sets are not necessarily comparable, this is in particular true for CSUBs defined using different multipliers. Perederieiva (2011) has used Proposition 1 to merge a number h of incomparable CSUBs, and thus to obtain a tighter upper bound set.

                               is a valid upper bound set and it dominates any of the bound sets (convYSN(ui))N used in the intersection.

Obviously, considering a larger set of CSUBs in Proposition 2 allows to obtain a tighter upper bound set. Ideally, we would like to consider all possible CSUB. Since the number of feasible solutions of problems of the kind 
                           
                              (

                              )
                              )
                           
                         is finite, then the number of possible CSUBs is also finite. Therefore, Proposition 2 can be applied to merge all CSUBs. We can thus give a first generalization of the dual surrogate problem.

                               is the tightest upper bound set based on the convex surrogate relaxation and the number of multipliers to consider in order to obtain it is finite. It is denoted the optimal convex surrogate upper bound set (OCSUB).

Using the same arguments, another generalization of the dual surrogate problem is possible. Using Proposition 1 in order to merge bound sets of the kind YN
                        (u), we can obtain the tightest upper bound set based on the surrogate relaxation.

                               is the tightest upper bound set based on the surrogate relaxation and the number of multipliers to consider in order to obtain it is finite. It is denoted the optimal surrogate upper bound set (OSUB).

The computation of the OSUB would be particularly expensive as it would require the solution of a number of 
                           
                              (
                              2
                              OKP
                              )
                           
                         problems. This is why our aim is restricted the computation of the OCSUB.

From Definition 3, we can deduce that the upper bound set OCSUB verifies the following properties: 
                           
                              (

                              )
                           
                         is convex and 
                           
                              (
                              OCSUB

                                 R
                                 ≧
                                 2
                              
                              )
                           
                         is a polyhedron. A first natural idea for the computation of the upper bound set OCSUB is to use the existing algorithms for the solution of the single-objective case. Indeed, the following result can be used.

                        . Obviously, this upper bound set will be tighter if we solve the dual surrogate problem for each considered weighted sum problem.

                         defining the normal to each edge of OCSUB. Therefore we can compute OCSUB by solving exactly the dual surrogate problem associated with each of these weighted sum problems. However, we do not know these directions initially.

This problem seems similar to the computation of the convex relaxation (convYSN)N of a bi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. Indeed

                         is a polyhedron and its computation can be done by a dichotomic algorithm (Aneja and Nair, 1979). It seems thus very natural to apply the same algorithm with a minor modification: the exact solution of the weighted sum single-objective problem 
                           
                              (

                         would be replaced by the solution of the corresponding dual surrogate problem. Nevertheless, some difficulties will immediately appear.

We initialize the dichotomic method with the directions λ
                              1 = (1, 0) and λ
                              2 = (0, 1). For λ
                              1 = (1, 0), the optimal solution obtained solving the dual surrogate problem (Fréville and Plateau, 1993) is x
                              1 = (1, 0, 1, 0, 0) with z(x
                              1) = (30, 22). For λ
                              2 = (0, 1), the optimal solution obtained solving the dual surrogate problem is x
                              2 = (0, 1, 1, 1, 0) with z(x
                              2) = (34, 28). We can immediately note that x
                              2 dominates x
                              1. Using these two points is thus inappropriate in order to define a direction to continue the application of the dichotomy. Thus, we can only conclude that

However by using the direction λ
                              3 = (3, 7), we can improve the bound set (see Fig. 3
                              ). Indeed, the optimal solution obtained solving the dual surrogate is then again x
                              1 = (1, 0, 1, 0, 0) with z(x
                              1) = (30, 22). Finally, there is no immediate way to guess this direction using a dichotomic principle.

The idea behind the attempt of dichotomic method is, knowing an appropriate direction defining an edge of the OCSUB, to deduce the associated multiplier. However, Example 1 shows that these directions are not straightforward to find. In the following, we will consider another approach based on the computation of CSUBs.


                     Definition 3 shows that the computation of the OCSUB can be done by an enumeration of a finite set of CSUBs. A finite set of multipliers can therefore be used to compute these CSUBs. In this section, we study the association of multipliers to CSUBs. Ideally, we would like to obtain a multiplier-set decomposition with a one-to-one correspondence between subsets of multipliers and CSUBs. Such a decomposition would guarantee an exhaustive enumeration of all CSUB, without redundancy.

Differences between feasible sets of surrogate relaxations

                         for u ∈ [0, 1] are crucial in the differentiation of CSUBs. In this subsection, we consider individually solutions that are feasible for a problem 
                           
                              (
                              2
                              OSP
                              (
                              u
                              )
                              )
                           
                         where u ∈ [0, 1]. To shorten the notations, this kind of solution will be called u-surrogate feasible. An u-surrogate feasible solution x respects the constraint u 
                        w
                        1(x) + (1 − u) w
                        2(x) ≤ u 
                        ω
                        1 + (1 − u) ω
                        2. Hence, two cases are possible: either x respects both constraints of 
                           
                              (
                              2
                              O

                              DKP
                              )
                           
                         or x respects only one of them (if x does not respect any of the constraints, it does not respect this constraint neither).

In the first case, x is feasible for 
                           
                              (
                              2
                              O

                         and is thus u-surrogate feasible for any u ∈ [0, 1].

In the latter case, x is u-surrogate feasible for any u ∈ [0, 1] such that u 
                        w
                        1(x) + (1 − u) w
                        2(x) ≤ u 
                        ω
                        1 + (1 − u) ω
                        2. This can be equivalently written u (w
                        1(x) − w
                        2(x) − ω
                        1 + ω
                        2) ≤ ω
                        2 − w
                        2(x). Next, we have necessarily w
                        1(x) − w
                        2(x) − ω
                        1 + ω
                        2 ≠ 0. Indeed, w
                        1(x) − w
                        2(x) − ω
                        1 + ω
                        2 = 0 would imply w
                        1(x) − ω
                        1 = w
                        2(x) − ω
                        2, i.e. either none or both constraints are satisfied (and we make the assumption that only one is satisfied). The constraint can thus be rewritten

                        v is therefore a particular multiplier associated with x. Indeed, it defines one of the extremities of the interval of multipliers u such that x is u-surrogate feasible.

                                    A critical multiplier u is a multiplier such that there exists at least one solution x that is u-surrogate feasible but not u − ε-surrogate feasible or not u + ε-surrogate feasible, for any ε > 0. The solution x and the critical multiplier u are called associated.

The stability interval of a solution x is the interval of all multipliers u such that x is u-surrogate feasible.

Finally, there are three kinds of stability interval:

Two CSUBs are different if their sets of extreme points are not identical. It comes obviously from particular differences between the feasible sets of corresponding problems

The converse of Lemma 1 is not true. Indeed, if the solution x
                              1 used in the proof of this lemma is not uj
                              -surrogate feasible, there may exist another solution x
                              2 such that x
                              2 is uj

                              1) = z(x
                              2).

Consequently to Lemma 1, the differences between CSUBs come only from the (in)feasibility of extreme supported solutions of corresponding surrogate relaxations. Thus, only critical multipliers associated with these solutions will be of interest.

Given two multipliers u and u′, the proof of Lemma 1 provides an analysis of the reason why a solution x associated with CSUB(u), is not necessarily associated with CSUB(u′): either this solution is not u′-surrogate feasible or

                           Let x be a solution associated with a CSUB, if x is u-surrogate feasible and x∉X
                              SE1(u) then x is called u-masked. More precisely, if there is a u-surrogate feasible solution x′ such that x′ dominates x, we will say that x is u-masked by x′. If there are two u-surrogate feasible solutions x′ and x′′ such that z(x) is weakly dominated by a point in (z(x′), z(x′′)), we will say that x is u-masked by the pair of solutions x′ and x′′. More generally, a solution that is u-masked for all u in a set U will be called masked on U.

Knowing the list of all multipliers associated with all possible CSUB, Proposition 4 allows to find a finite set of multipliers in order to compute the set of all CSUBs.

                           Proposition 4
                           Suppose we know the list of all multipliers associated with all CSUBs, then the list of all CSUBs is given by the following enumeration:

                                 
                                    (i)

                                             0
                                             )
                                          
                                        and

For all interval defined by two consecutive critical multipliers: 
                                          
                                             CSUB

                                             u
                                             )
                                          
                                        for a multiplier u in the relative interior of this interval;


                                       
                                          
                                             CSUB
                                             (
                                             u
                                             )
                                          
                                        for all multiplier u that is simultaneously 0M and M1.


                              Lemma 1 implies that CSUB(u) is identical for all u ∈ (v
                              1, v
                              2) where v
                              1 and v
                              2 are consecutive critical multipliers. It is thus useless to consider two multipliers in such an open interval (v
                              1, v
                              2). On the contrary, CSUB(u) and CSUB(u′) such that u and u′ belong to the interior of different intervals given by consecutive critical multipliers, implies that CSUB(u) and CSUB(u′) may be different (but are not necessarily as the converse of Lemma 1 is not true). Knowing CSUB(u) for u multiplier in the interior of all interval defined by consecutive critical multipliers is thus necessary to guarantee an exhaustive enumeration of all CSUBs (item (ii)). If 0 and 1 are not critical multiplier, one multiplier must also be considered in the interval [0, u
                              min ) and (u
                              max , 1] where u
                              min  and u
                              max  are respectively the smallest and the greatest critical multiplier, CSUB(0) and CSUB(1) are appropriate choices. Nevertheless, it is not sufficient to obtain an exhaustive enumeration of CSUBs. Indeed if we consider a multiplier v that is simultaneously 0M and M1, and a small number ε > 0 such that there is no other critical multiplier in [v − ε, v + ε]. As v is 0M then CSUB(v) may be different to CSUB(v + ε), and as v is M1 then CSUB(v) may be different to CSUB(v − ε). The computation of CSUB(v) is thus also necessary (item (iii)). For the same reason, the computation of CSUB(0) (respectively CSUB(1)) is also required if 0 is a 0M multiplier (respectively 1 is a M1 multiplier). Computing CSUB(0) and CSUB(1) is therefore required in all cases (item (i)).□

The multiplier set-decomposition described by Proposition 4 does not exactly give a one-to-one correspondence between subsets of multipliers and CSUBs (as the converse of Lemma 1 is not true) but guarantees the determination of all CSUB. However, a way to obtain the set of all critical multipliers is necessary in order to use this last statement. Proposition 5 is based on an assumption that is easier to verify: only a subset of CSUBs with their associated critical multipliers are known. In this context, there may exist unknown solutions associated with unknown CSUBs, that are either u-masked or not u-surrogate feasible for each multiplier u considered so far. In order to determine these unknown solutions, we must find multipliers u such that these solutions are potentially u-surrogate feasible and not u-masked. A characterization of the intervals of multipliers S on which a solution is masked is provided by Proposition 5.

                           Proposition 5
                           Suppose we know some CSUBs, with their associated solutions and critical multipliers. Let x be an unknown solution associated with a CSUB, then x is u-masked for all u ∈ U where U is an union of intervals. The possible patterns for these intervals, relies on the stability interval of x.

We suppose first that x is u′-masked by one solution x′ for a given multiplier u′, then x is u-masked for all multiplier u such that x′ is u-surrogate feasible. In other words, if we denote by S the stability interval of x′, then x is masked on S. The interval S is either of the kind [0, v

We suppose next that x is u′-masked by the pair of solutions x′ and x′′ for a given multiplier u′, then x is u-masked for all multipliers u such that both solutions are u-surrogate feasible. In other words, if we denote the stability interval of both solutions by S
                                       1 and S
                                       2 then x is masked on S
                                       1∩S
                                       2. If both solutions are associated with 0M critical multipliers v
                                       01, v
                                       02 then x is masked on [0, min (v
                                       01, v
                                       02)] (pattern (i)). If both solutions are associated with M1 critical multipliers v
                                       11, v
                                       12, then x is masked on [max (v
                                       11, v
                                       12), 1] (pattern (ii)). If one solution is associated with a 0M critical multiplier v
                                       0 and the other one is associated with a M1 critical multiplier v
                                       1, then x is masked on [v
                                       1, v
                                       0] (pattern (iii)).

We assume that the stability interval of x is [0, v] where u is a 0M critical multiplier. In order to find the possible pattern for this second case, we just need to compute the intersection of [0, v] with the pattern enumerated in the case (1). For the pattern (1)(i), we necessarily have [0, v
                                       0]∩[0, v] = [0, v
                                       0] with v > v
                                       0 (pattern (i)), otherwise x is u-masked for all u in its stability interval. For the pattern (1)(ii), we either have [v
                                       1, 1]~∩~[0, v]~ = ~[v
                                       1, v] with v ≥ v

                                       1, 1]∩[0, v] = ∅ if v < v
                                       1. For the pattern (iii), we have either [v
                                       1, v
                                       0]∩[0, v] = [v
                                       1, v
                                       0] (pattern (iii)) with v
                                       1 < v

                                       1 ≤ v since solutions associated with v
                                       0 and v
                                       1 are a pair masking x).

The proof is symmetric to the case (2).


                              □

Given a unknown solution x associated with a CSUB, the (disjoint) union of intervals U on which x is masked by known solutions, is composed of zero or one interval of type [0, v
                              0] (or [v, v
                              0] for the case (3)), zero or one interval of type [v
                              1, 1] (or [v, v
                              0] for the case (2)) and zero or several disjoint intervals of type [v
                              1, v
                              0].

The exact computation of the union of intervals U would require to know the solution x. Nevertheless, Proposition 5 only gives the patterns of intervals on which an unknown x is masked. However, as the boundaries of these intervals (except v) are defined by known multipliers, it will be possible to deduce particular multipliers u such that potential unknown solutions associated with CSUBs are not u-masked by known solutions or pairs of solutions.

In this section, we describe a first enumerative algorithm for the computation of the OCSUB. The main idea of this algorithm is to determine first the set of all multipliers associated with all possible CSUB (line 2 of Algorithm 1
                     ), and next to deduce the set of all CSUBs (line 3 of Algorithm 1). The OCSUB can finally be computed by an application of Definition 3.

In order to initialize our enumeration, we start by computing CSUB(0) and CSUB(1) and deducing their associated critical multipliers (line 2 of Algorithm 2
                        ). The computation of these CSUBs is indeed required in all cases according to Proposition 4. Another interesting property about these two multipliers is given by Lemma 2.

                           Lemma 2
                           All solutions associated with any CSUB are either 0-surrogate feasible or 1-surrogate feasible or both.

We already know that the stability interval of solutions associated with CSUBs are of three kinds: [0, u], [u, 1], [0, 1]. The statement follows.□

Consequently to this lemma, the union of intervals on which an unknown solution x (associated with an unknown CSUB) is masked by a known solution cannot be empty after this initialization.

According to Lemma 1, a way to enumerate new CSUBs is to consider multipliers u such that at least one solution associated with a known CSUB is no longer u-surrogate feasible. In other words, we need to consider multipliers u outside of the stability interval of known solutions. There will be two cases to consider, a solution is associated with a 0M multiplier or a M1 multiplier (there is nothing to do in the case of a solution the stability interval of which is [0, 1] as it is u-surrogate feasible for all u ∈ [0, 1]). In the case of a 0M multiplier v
                        0, any multiplier u > v
                        0 will guarantee that the solution(s) associated with v
                        0 is (are) no longer u-surrogate feasible. Symmetrically, any multiplier u < v
                        1 will guarantee that the solution(s) associated with a M1 multiplier v
                        1 is (are) no longer u-surrogate feasible.

In an iteration of the procedure (line 5–12 of Algorithm 2), a critical multiplier v is considered individually (a multiplier simultaneously 0M and M1 is here considered as two different multipliers) to define a multiplier u the value of which is as near as possible to v. Ideally, there must not be any critical multiplier between v and u. Thus, appropriate values u are defined by u ≔ v + ε if u is a 0M multiplier, and u ≔ v − ε if u is a M1 multiplier, where ε > 0 is a small value (see Appendix A for an upper bound on ε). CSUB(u) is next computed; and its associated multipliers are deduced.

All CSUBs computed during the execution of this algorithm are merged using Proposition 2 (line 4,12 of Algorithm 2).

                           Proposition 6
                           
                              Algorithm 2 finds all critical multipliers associated with all possible CSUB.

Let u be a critical multiplier associated with a CSUB. We denote by x a solution associated with u. If u is associated with CSUB(0) or CSUB(1), then u is found during the initialization. If u is not associated with either CSUB(0) nor CSUB(1), then we show that v is found in an iteration of Algorithm 2. We consider thus an iteration of this algorithm and suppose that v has not been found in a preceding iteration. Proposition 5 states the pattern of intervals U the union on which x is masked by known solutions. According to Lemma 2, there is at least one interval U defined by Proposition 5 on which x is masked. The interval U has either a left-extremity defined by a M1 multiplier v
                              1 or a right-extremity defined by a 0M multiplier v
                              0 or both. Algorithm 2 considers the computation of all CSUBs of the following kind: CSUB(v
                              0 + ε), CSUB(v
                              1 − ε), with possible new solutions and critical multipliers found. There are two possible conclusions: u is one of these new critical multipliers or not (i.e. all solutions associated with u are still masked). In the latter case, new critical multipliers allow to perform new iterations. Again, u will be found or not. By repeated computations of CSUBs, u will be finally found in a finite number of computations of CSUB, as the number of critical multipliers is finite and as multipliers v such that x is not v-masked by known solution(s) can always be deduced.□

After the first part, all critical multipliers associated with all CSUBs are known. Thus, Proposition 4 can be used in order to compute all CSUBs. We summarize the CSUBs computed in the part 1:

                           
                              (i)
                              CSUB(0) and CSUB(1) in the initialization;

CSUB(u + ε) for all u 0M multiplier;

CSUB(u − ε) for all u M1 multiplier.

Items (ii) and (iii) of the enumeration above imply that at least one multiplier has been used in the interior of intervals defined by consecutive critical multipliers such that the left hand side is 0M or the right hand side is M1. To complete Item (ii) of Proposition 4, it remains thus to use one multiplier in the interval the left side of which is M1 and the right side of which is 0M. If we denote by u the left hand side of this last kind of interval, the multiplier u + ε is an appropriate choice for the computation of a CSUB.

In conclusion, to achieve the enumeration of all CSUBs, it remains to compute:

                           
                              •
                              CSUB(u + ε) for all interval of consecutive critical multipliers [u, u
                                 0] such that u is M1 and u
                                 0 is 0M (Item (ii) of Proposition 4);

CSUB(u) for all multiplier u that is 0M and M1 (Item (iii) of Proposition 4).


                        Algorithm 3
                         summarizes this final computation.


                        Example 1 (continued) The TotalEnumerative algorithm is performed on the instance of (2O2DKP) referred as Example 1. To facilitate the understanding of the output, Table 1
                         reports all solutions associated with at least one CSUB and their stability interval.

The solutions are represented in objective space on Fig. 5
                        a. The stability intervals of the solutions are represented on Fig. 5b. On the representation of the stability interval of a solution xi
                        , the dashed parts correspond to the interval of multipliers on which xi
                         is masked.

The execution of the algorithm is presented in Table 2
                        . The OCSUB is defined by the set of extreme points (rounded to 10−2) {(30,22); (27.43,28)}. In checking Fig. 5a and Table 2, a number of obtained CSUBs, outcomed of the TotalEnumerative algorithm, appears dominated by other CSUBs. Such a situation may appear in general, and these dominated CSUBs are therefore useless for the computation of the OCSUB. The next section gives an analysis of the dominance relation between the different CSUBs.

The dominance between CSUBs is based on the following lemma, illustrated by Fig. 4 (in Section 3.1 Page 11).

Dominated CSUBs do not contribute to the computation of the OCSUB. It is therefore useless to determine such CSUBs. However, it is difficult to know that a CSUB is dominated by another one before its computation. In the following, we provide a characterization allowing to know without additional computation that some CSUBs are dominated.

Given a known critical multiplier u, we consider CSUB(u − ε) and CSUB(u + ε) with ε small enough such that u is the only critical multiplier associated with a CSUB in the interval [u − ε, u + ε]. Suppose u is 0M and not M1, then there exists at least one solution associated with CSUB(u − ε) which is not u + ε-surrogate feasible. Since u is not M1, there does not exist a solution associated with CSUB(u + ε) that is not u − ε-surrogate feasible. Thus, by application of Lemma 3, either CSUB(u + ε) dominates CSUB(u − ε), or CSUB(u + ε) = CSUB(u − ε) (case of equivalent solutions). In both cases, the computation of CSUB(u − ε) is useless. We will say that CSUB(u + ε) weakly dominates CSUB(u − ε).

We can do the symmetric analysis in the case u is M1 but not 0M and a similar one if u is both 0M and M1. Proposition 7 summarizes this result.

If 0 is a critical multiplier, then 0 is 0M and Proposition 7 holds, except that we ignore the comparison with CSUB(0 − ε) which is not defined. Similarly if 1 is a critical multiplier, it is M1 and CSUB(1 + ε) is not defined.


                        Proposition 7 is illustrated in Fig. 6
                        , an arrow from CSUB(uj
                        ) to CSUB(ui
                        ) means that CSUB(uj
                        ) weakly dominates CSUB(ui
                        ).


                        Proposition 7 allows only a local analysis around critical multipliers. We will say that we can know a priori that a CSUB is weakly dominated. In the following, we apply the result of this proposition on the set of all critical multipliers associated with any CSUB, to obtain a stronger result.

                           Let L be a list of critical multipliers sorted by increasing values. We call 0M–M1 interval in L any pair u
                              0 − u
                              1 of successive critical multipliers in L∪{0, 1}, such that u
                              0 is 0M and u
                              1 is M1 and u

                              1. 0 and 1 are respectively considered as 0M and M1 multipliers.

We denote by Lall
                               the list of all critical multipliers associated with all CSUBs. The only CSUBs that are not weakly dominated a priori are

We consider all possible types for a pair of critical multipliers u
                              1 and u
                              2 and we analyze the dominance relation between the CSUBs around these two critical multipliers. We only present the case for which u
                              1 is 0M (but not M1). The proof is similar if it is M1 or, 0M and M1. As u
                              1 is 0M, Proposition 7 implies that CSUB(u
                              1 + ε) weakly dominates CSUB(u

                              1 − ε). As there is no critical multiplier between u

                              1 + ε) = CSUB(u
                              2 − ε). The question is next whether CSUB(u
                              1 + ε) is weakly dominated or not by CSUB(u
                              2 + ε) or CSUB(u
                              2). In all cases, the answer comes from the application Proposition 7 for the multiplier u
                              2.

                                 
                                    1.
                                    If u
                                       2 is 0M and not M1, then CSUB(u
                                       1 + ε) is weakly dominated by CSUB(u
                                       2 + ε).

If u
                                       2 is M1 and not 0M, then CSUB(u
                                       1 + ε) weakly dominates CSUB(u
                                       2 + ε).

If u
                                       2 is 0M and M1, then CSUB(u
                                       1 + ε) weakly dominates CSUB(u
                                       2).

The only cases for which CSUB(u
                              1 + ε) = CSUB(u
                              2 − ε) is not dominated a priori, happen when u
                              2 is M1.

Suppose 0 is not a critical multiplier, and we denote the smallest critical multiplier by u
                              min. The same CSUB is therefore obtained for CSUB(u) for u ∈ [0, u
                              min). Depending of the type of u
                              min, CSUB(u
                              min − ε) is weakly dominated (u
                              min  is 0M) or not (u
                              min  is M1). The case of the multiplier 1 is symmetric.□


                        Fig. 7
                         illustrates Propositions 7 and 8. Dominance between CSUBs is again represented by an arrow, and the CSUBs that are not dominated a priori are denoted in solid black.

The 0M–M1 interval algorithm is based on Proposition 8 which states that the only multiplier u such that CSUB(u) is not dominated a priori are in the interior of the 0M–M1 intervals in L
                        all. Obviously, the direct use of this result requires to know L
                        all. Knowing only a subset of CSUBs with their associated solutions and critical multipliers, Proposition 5 defines an union of (patterns of) intervals U such that an unknown solution associated with a critical multiplier v is masked on U. To find such an unknown solution x, it is necessary to compute CSUB(u) for u ∈ S∖U where S is the stability interval of x. According to Proposition 5, U is composed of zero or one interval of type [0, v
                        0] (or [v, v
                        0] if v is a M1 multiplier), zero or one interval of type [v
                        1, 1] (or [v
                        1, v] if v is a 0M multiplier) and zero or several disjoint intervals of type [v
                        1, v
                        0] where the multipliers denoted v
                        0 and v
                        1 are known 0M and M1 multipliers. It is interesting to note that the set S∖U is an union of 0M–M1 intervals defined by a subset of known multipliers, with the exception of at most one interval for which the extremities are a known critical multiplier and v (unknown).

The 0M–M1 algorithm (Algorithm 4
                        ) is based on these observations. An iteration of the algorithm is performed as follows: given a 0M–M1 interval u
                        0 − u
                        1 in the list of known multipliers, CSUB(u
                        0 + ε) is computed and the new critical multipliers are stored. We call this operation the exploration of the 0M–M1 interval. Since the exploration of a 0M–M1 interval is based on the 0M multiplier, we store the 0M multiplier for each explored 0M–M1 interval, in order to avoid repetitive computations of a same CSUB. Indeed, new multipliers may be found with the computation of a new CSUB. If a new M1 multiplier is inserted between a pair of 0M and M1 multiplier, a new 0M–M1 interval is defined, but its exploration is done by computing the same CSUB.

The initialization is reduced to the computation of CSUB(0). Indeed CSUB(1) is either dominated or redundant with the exploration of a 0M–M1 interval.

In this part we prove the correctness of the 0M–M1 interval algorithm. In this proof, we denote by L
                        alg the list of known critical multipliers at the end of Algorithm 4. This proof is decomposed in two propositions, its main idea is to show that the list L
                        alg contains at least the minimum number of critical multipliers to guarantee that the OCSUB is obtained as an output of the algorithm. As Algorithm 4 computes CSUB(u
                        0 + ε) for each 0M–M1 interval u
                        0 − u
                        1 in L
                        alg, it is necessary for L
                        alg to contain all 0M multiplier that defines a 0M–M1 in the list L
                        all 
                        (Proposition 9). Moreover to ensure that CSUB(u
                        0 + ε) is computed for all u
                        0 defining a 0M–M1 interval u
                        0 − u
                        1 in L
                        all, L
                        alg must also contain a M1 multiplier u
                        2 > u
                        0 such that there does not exist any 0M multiplier in (u
                        0, u
                        2) (Proposition 10).

We can note that for a same u
                        0 defining a 0M–M1 interval u
                        0 − u
                        1 in L
                        all, several M1 critical multipliers are appropriate to ensure the computation of CSUB(u
                        0 + ε). To illustrate this, we consider the example of Fig. 7. The CSUBs to be computed to guarantee that the OCSUB is found, are CSUB(u + ε) with u = u
                        2, u
                        5, u
                        6, u
                        7, u
                        10. L
                        alg must therefore contain these 0M critical multipliers. The M1 critical multiplier that may cause the exploration of the 0M–M1 interval u
                        2 − u
                        3 (in L
                        all) can be either u
                        3 or u
                        4. Indeed there does not exist any 0M critical multiplier in (u
                        2, u
                        3) or in (u
                        2, u
                        4), thus the explorations of u
                        2 − u
                        3 and u
                        2 − u
                        4 are the same: CSUB(u
                        2 + ε). The other M1 multipliers to find are u
                        6, u
                        7 and, u
                        8 or u
                        9.

                           Proposition 9
                           
                              Algorithm 4 finds all multiplier u
                              0 such that there is a 0M–M1 interval u
                              0 − u
                              1 in Lall
                              .

Let u
                              0 − u
                              1 be a 0M–M1 interval in L
                              all, and x
                              0 be a solution associated with u
                              0. We show in the following that x
                              0 (and thus u
                              0) is found by Algorithm 4. If x
                              0 is associated with CSUB(0), then x
                              0 is found with the initialization. If x
                              0 is not associated with CSUB(0) then it is 0-masked (since x
                              0 is 0-surrogate feasible). By Proposition 5, the union of intervals on which x
                              0 is masked is composed of zero or one interval [0, v
                              0], zero or several intervals of the kind [v
                              1, v
                              0], and zero or one interval of the kind [v
                              1, u
                              0], where the multipliers denoted v
                              1 and v
                              0 are respectively M1 and 0M multipliers in L
                              alg. Since x
                              0 is 0-masked, it is in particular masked on one interval [0, v
                              0]. Consequently, x
                              0 is surrogate feasible and not masked by known solutions on a nonempty union of zero or several (v
                              0, v
                              1) open intervals, and zero or one (v
                              0, u
                              0] interval. The computation of CSUB(u) for u in the interior of one of these intervals, performed in the context of Algorithm 4, necessarily guarantee to obtain x
                              0. Otherwise new solutions masking x
                              0 would be found with their associated critical multipliers, and this contradict the assumption that L
                              alg is the list of known critical multipliers at the end of Algorithm 4.

                                 
                                    •
                                    If the first kind of interval (v
                                       0, v
                                       1) exists, v
                                       0 and v
                                       1 are respectively a 0M and M1 multiplier in L
                                       alg. Hence, there is a 0M–M1 interval (in L
                                       alg) in [v
                                       0, v
                                       1] and this 0M–M1 interval is explored during the algorithm.

If the second kind of interval (v

                                       0] exists, we prove next that there is a 0M–M1 interval in L
                                       alg such that the 0M part is in [v

                        Example 1 (continued) 
                        Algorithm 4 is applied on the instance of (2O2DKP) introduced as Example 1. At the beginning multipliers contains the M1 multiplier 1. The first bound set to be computed is CSUB(0) = B
                        1. x
                        1 and x
                        2 compose this bound set. Then

                         (of type 0M) are added to multipliers.

The only 0M–M1 interval in multipliers is

                        . This is composed of x
                        7 and x
                        8. Thus the multiplier

The list of critical multipliers of the 0M–M1 interval algorithm can be initialized using the dichotomic algorithm we presented in Section 2.2. We showed that this algorithm does generally not allow to determine the OCSUB and that it may stop prematurely, however it allows to determine surrogate-feasible solutions that defines edges of the OCSUB with their associated critical multipliers. The early knowledge of these critical multipliers allows next to avoid the enumeration of weakly dominated CSUBs. Finally, each step of the dichotomic method consists in solving the dual surrogate problem for 
                           
                              2

                         which is less time consuming than to compute a CSUB according to our observations.

The next section presents a heuristic derived from the 0M–M1 interval algorithm, and a heuristic from the literature.

We describe here a method to compute an approximation of the OCSUB, based on the 0M–M1 interval algorithm and called 0MM1H. This heuristic works the same way as the 0M–M1 interval algorithm, initialized by the dichotomic method, except that the number of iterations is limited to h. Thus all 0M–M1 interval will generally not be explored. Hence we have to define how we choose the 0M–M1 interval to explore at each iteration. If there are several 0M–M1 intervals u

                        1 to explore, then we choose the one for which u
                        1 was part of the most 0M–M1 intervals previously explored. In case of equality we choose the lowest u
                        0. The idea is to explore improving CSUBs immediately.

If there does not exist any 0M–M1 interval to explore, then the method stops even if the maximum number of iterations is not achieved. Indeed the OCSUB is found, any additional computation of CSUB is therefore useless.

An alternative and more intuitive heuristic, with a lower running time per iteration since it does not analyze the critical multipliers, is now presented.

The SurrogateFamily heuristic (SF) has been introduced in the master thesis of Perederieiva (2011). The author has developed a dynamic programming based algorithm to find all efficient solutions of a 
                           
                              2
                              O

                        . The upper bound set defined in this algorithm is based on the linear and surrogate relaxations. The resulting upper bound set is obtained by application of Proposition 1, where the upper bound set associated with the linear relaxation and the one based on surrogate relaxations are merged.


                        SurrogateFamily has not been designed with the aim to compute the OCSUB, its purpose is to compute an upper bound set in a short computational time. Thus, there is no guarantee to determine the OCSUB using this method, even with a large number of iterations.

For our numerical experiments, the part related to the linear relaxation is disabled; only the part related to the surrogate relaxation is computed and compared with 0MM1H. The principle of SurrogateFamily is simple. It computes h CSUBs: {CSUB(u
                        1), ~…, ~CSUB(uh
                        )} where the multipliers {u
                        1, …, uh
                        } are equidistant in the interval [0, 1]. Obviously if we increase the value of h, a tighter upper bound set will be computed, but with a larger computational cost.

In SurrogateFamily, the choice of the multipliers is completely static. No information is used to avoid the computation of dominated CSUBs. In particular, even if the OCSUB is obtained, SurrogateFamily will continue its execution until the last iteration.

The numerical experiments aim (1) to show experimentally the performances of proposed algorithms, (2) to observe if an algorithm presents in general better performances than its competitor, (3) to examine the behavior of the algorithm when the number of variables increases, and (4) to note, if it exists, the influence of correlations between the values of the instances on the behavior of the algorithm. To discuss about those factors, four descriptors are elaborated. The two first concern the exact algorithms (TotalEnumerative and 0M–M1 interval),

                                 Descriptor 3. Quality of the approximation. The quality assessment of an approximated bound set will be stated in comparison with the OCSUB. Here, an area measure (called

                                 -metric) is proposed and reported in terms of percentage. A small

All our implementations require to fix a value for ɛ (small positive number used in Algorithms 2, 3 and 4). The smallest value manageable by our solver’s implementation is ɛ = 10−9 (the recommended value returned using the computing method described in Appendix A is smaller). Next, the methods approximating the OCSUB require to fix a value for the parameter h. The following values have been used: 10, 50, 100.

The computer used for the experiments is equipped with a Intel Core i7 2640M 2.8 Ghz processor with 8 GB of RAM, and runs under Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5. All algorithms have been implemented in C++. The binaries have been obtained using the compiler GCC version 4.2.1. with the optimizer option − O3. Combo from Martello et al. (1999) has been used to solve single-objective single-dimensional knapsack problems.

All algorithms have been evaluated on a dataset composed of 28 instances available on the MCDMLib,

                                 .

In this section, we compare the two methods that determines the OCSUB. In order to measure the impact of its initialization, the 0M–M1 interval algorithm is tested with and without its initialization. All results are summarized in Fig. 10
                        . In this figure, we denote by respectively TotEnum, 0MM1 and 0MM1 + init, the TotalEnumerative algorithm, the 0M–M1 interval without initialization, and the 0M–M1 interval algorithm using the initialization.

In Fig. 10, the y-axis is reported on a logarithmic scale for all graphics. The left column reports the numbers of computed CSUBs (descriptor 1), and the computational times (descriptor 2) are on the right column. The line on the top, the middle and the bottom correspond respectively to instances of Groups 1, 2 and 3.

For all three groups of instances, the two versions of 0M–M1 interval are always faster than TotalEnumerative. The profile of the curves of time are similar. The difference of execution time increases with the size of the instance. This especially allows 0M–M1 interval without initialization to determine the OCSUB for ZTL500 and ZTL750 instances with less than 700 seconds of CPU time, while TotalEnumerative is unable to compute it in less than 1 hour.

The additional cost of the initialization in the 0M–M1 interval algorithm is largely balanced for most instances. The only exceptions concerns small instances which solution time is particularly low with or without initialization (less than 0.1s). Moreover, the benefit of the initialization increases significantly with instance size, as can be seen in Fig. 10(b).

For Groups 2 and 3, an obvious correlation appears between the required computational time and the number of CSUBs to compute. On the other hand, there is no particular difficulty for the algorithms to deal with numerical instances presenting various correlations. For four particular instances (D2, D3, D4 and tube-asyn), TotalEnumerative algorithm computes a large number of CSUBs, while 0M–M1 interval only computes 1. This difference is of course reverberated on the computational time.

In conclusion of the analysis, 0M–M1 interval outranks TotalEnumerative, and shows no particular difficulty to deal with instances with correlations. The initialization procedure allows to largely reduce the computational time for large instances. The recommended algorithm for computing the OCSUB is thus the 0M–M1 interval algorithm with initialization. However, the computational time of the OCSUB remains far to be negligible, in particular for big instances. A better trade-off between computational time and quality of the obtained upper bound set should be used, to be embedded as a component of an implicit enumeration algorithm aiming to generate a complete set of efficient solutions for a

                        .

In order to evaluate the quality of the heuristics, we define a quality indicator. It aims to measure the gap between a heuristic upper bound set and the OCSUB. According to Definition 1, an upper bound set B for YN
                         should verify

                         illustrates the definition of this indicator. The OCSUB is composed of b extreme points {p
                        1, …, pb

                        1 is common to all possible upper bound set H and to the OCSUB, thus we do not need to consider it in the measure. The same statement holds for pb

                        This quality indicator has the effect to highlight with large values the difference between bound sets.

The results are summarized in Figs. 12–14 respectively for instances of Groups 1, 2, and 3. In each figure, the graphics (a), (b) and (c) compare both heurstics according to descriptor 3 for respectively h = 10, h = 50 and h = 100. The y-axis is logarithmic. For an instance and a heuristic, if a bar is not visible, it means that the obtained upper bound set is the OCSUB or so close to it that the difference is insignificant. The graphics (d) present the computational times in six curves (descriptor 4), the names of the curves are composed by the name of the heuristic and the parameter h. To read this graphics, it is important to notice that, for a same heuristic, the curve for a given value of h cannot be lower than the one for a smaller value of h (h is the maximum number of iterations allowed). Thus in graphics (d), for a same heuristic, the curve at the bottom corresponds to h = 10 and the one at the top to h = 100.

For all groups of instances, both algorithms behave the same way in terms of computational time. Generally the computational time of 0MM1H is slightly larger than for SurrogateFamily, because of the initialization and the analysis of the critical multipliers. For some instances, essentially from Group 2, 0MM1H appears faster. This is due to the early obtention of the OCSUB by 0MM1H. Consequently, this heuristic stops its execution, while SurrogateFamily continue its execution until the final iteration.

In 85 percent of the cases 0MM1H performs better than SurrogateFamily, according to descriptor 3. When 0MM1H is performed with h = 100, the OCSUB is obtained for 16 of the 28 instances, doing less iterations than h.

The quality of the upper bound set found by 0MM1H does not seem to be related to the size of the instances. Indeed in Group 1, the performance of 0MM1H is outranked by SurrogateFamily for the instances of size 105 and 750 variables, however the opposite occurs for the instances of size 250 and 500. For the instances of Group 2, 0MM1H gives upper bound set of good quality in a smaller number of iterations than SurrogateFamily, except for two instances (A1 and A3). The difference between both heuristics is also important for several other instances (for example A2), in favor of 0MM1H. In Group 3, both heuristics are almost equivalent in terms of descriptor 4. Finally, the best heuristic for an instance is not necessarily the same for every value of h. The instance tube1-1800 is an example of this phenomenon: for h = 10 both heuristics are equivalent, for h = 50 SurrogateFamily performs better and the opposite occurs for h = 100.

The difference of behavior can be explained by the use of uniformly distributed multipliers in SurrogateFamily. Therefore, the obtained bound set is constructed from various CSUBs. In 0MM1H, the values of the multipliers are determined with the purpose to improve locally the bound set. Thus, with a low number of computed CSUBs, we obtain a bound set that may be very tight locally but not globally. This explanation is confirmed by the results collected for Group 2. In conclusion of the analysis, 0MM1H is competitive for every size of instances and every tested h, except for some rare instances. A deep analysis of those instances may allow us to find a better order for the exploration of the 0M–M1 intervals. The heuristic using this order could provide better results.

The optimal convex surrogate upper bound (OCSUB) is the tightest bound set that it is possible to define and to compute with the convex surrogate relaxation. This paper gives a formal definition of the OCSUB, introduces two exact algorithms for computing the OCSUB, and demonstrates their correctness. A heuristic version is also introduced for a use when the computational time is limited. The numerical experiments clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm called 0M–M1 interval, using the initialization procedure, for the computation of the OCSUB, and show that the algorithm is not sensitive to the presence of correlation in the numerical instances.

The OCSUB finds its usage naturally in the context of an implicit enumerative method for solving a bi-objective bi-dimensional binary knapsack problems (
                        
                           2
                           O
                           2
                           DKP
                        
                     ). For example, OCSUB is ready to be embedded in an evaluation component aiming to prune or not a node of a branch-and-bound algorithm, or a state in dynamic programming algorithm. However, it is not surprising to note that the computation of the OCSUB may require a significant CPU time, even for mid-size numerical instances. Due to this fact, and in the state of knowledge, it is currently not reasonable to consider such an usage of the OCSUB. The introduction of a heuristic variant for the computation of the OCSUB is therefore justified. The quality of the resulting measured approximation, even for a short CPU time, shows the practical interest of the heuristic algorithm to compute an approximation of the OCSUB. Thus, it appears as a powerful component to encapsulate in an implicit enumeration method, in particular to solve instances of 2O2DKP. 0MM1H seems to be a good choice to determine an approximation of the OCSUB, even if its efficiency drops for some rare instances. However there remain several possible improvements that may change favorably this situation.

The following prospects allow to expect interesting improvements in terms of the OCSUB computation time, and on the use of the 0MM1H in an implicit enumeration method. It is linked to the use of these algorithms in an implicit enumeration method, following a re-optimization principle, e.g. between two levels of the enumeration tree. The idea aims to avoid to repeat computations between two successive OCSUBs (or approximations), while the two nodes in the tree vary only by a small subset of variables changing from a free status to fixed. These ideas are currently under research.

In all the algorithms presented here, ε is added to critical multipliers u such that u + ε ≠ u and there does not exist a critical multiplier u′ with u < u′ ≤ u + ε or u + ε ≤ u′ < u. In those conditions we can find all critical multiplier associated with CSUB.

Our purpose is here to find ε > 0 such that it is smaller than the smallest difference between two different critical multipliers.

To find a valid value for ε, we consider u and u′ two different critical multipliers, such that the difference between u and u′ is the smallest differencebetween two different critical multipliers. x is a solution associated with u and x′ is a solution associated with u′. We have shown in Section 3.1 that
