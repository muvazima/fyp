                  A main requirement for achieving high efficiency in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is that all charges and electrically generated excitons should be employed for emission. We fabricated blue phosphorescent OLEDs with four types electron transporting layers, which were doped with lithium quinolate (Liq) from 0% to 10%. A series of blue devices consisted of indium tin oxide (ITO, 180nm)/4,4-bis[N-(naphthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl (NPB, 50nm)/N,N′-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene (mCP, 10nm)/iridium(III)bis[(4,6-di-fluoropheny)-pyridinato-N,C2] picolinate (FIrpic) doped in mCP (8%, 30nm)/1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazole-2-yl)benzene (TPBi, 20nm)/TPBi mixed with Liq (20nm)/Liq (2nm)/aluminum (Al, 100nm). The blue OLED doped with 5% Liq, which demonstrated a maximum luminous efficiency and external quantum efficiency of 17.64cd/A and 8.78%, respectively, were found to be superior to the other blue devices.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recently, the development of high efficient blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has attracted considerable interest due to their practical applications in flat panel display and solid-state lighting [1–3]. Researchers have studied phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) in order to realize a high efficiency using charge trapping and exciton confinement by a high triplet exciton blocking layer inserted between the emitting layer (EML) and hole transport layer (HTL). Also, systematic studies on carrier injection and transport are very important for achieving high efficiency in OLEDs [4–7]. Thus, all charges and electrically generated excitons have to be used to maximize their performance in EML. Due to this fact, it is necessary to improve the carrier transport using interface modification. Hung et al. reported a bilayer structure of Al/LiF as an interface to enhance the electron injection and the electroluminescence (EL) efficiency. The use of Li metal as an interface between aluminum and the organic layer is also reported to lower the driving voltage [8–10].

In this study, we demonstrated efficient triplet exciton confinement in high efficient blue PHOLEDs using combination with various electron transport layers (ETLs), which were doped with lithium quinolate (Liq). Doped ETLs have good electron injection and electron transport properties. Both N,N′-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene (mCP) and 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazole-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) as electron blocking layer (EBL) were able to confine exciton efficiently.

The ITO on glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 10Ω/sq was used as a transparent anode. The ITO glass was chemically cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using the following sequence: acetone, methanol, de-ionized water, and isopropyl alcohol. Afterwards, pre-cleaned ITO glass was treated by oxygen plasma with the power of 125W for 2min under a low vacuum of 2×10−2
                     Torr. Organic layers, Liq, and cathode were deposited with thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.3–0.5Å/s, 0.1Å/s, and 10Å/s, respectively. The evaporation rates were controlled using a quartz crystal monitor. The size of the emitting region in the pixel was 3mm×3mm. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OLEDs were measured using a source-measure unit (Keithley 236) with a DC voltage. The optical and electrical properties of the devices, such as the luminance (L), EL efficiencies, Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates, and EL spectra characteristics, were analyzed using CHROMA METER CS-1000 instruments. All measurements were carried out under ambient conditions at room temperature.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#


                     Fig. 1
                     (a) shows the energy level diagrams of the blue PHOLEDs with the double ETL. A series of blue devices were prepared with the structure of ITO (180nm)/4,4-bis[N-(naphthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl (NPB, 50nm)/mCP (10nm)/iridium(III)bis[(4,6-di-fluoropheny)-pyridinato-N,C2]picolinate (FIrpic) doped in mCP (8%, 30nm)/TPBi (20nm)/TPBi mixed with Liq (0, 3, 5, and 10%, 20nm) (we defined each device as Devices A, B, C, and D according to the concentration of Liq, respectively)/Liq (2nm)/aluminum (Al, 100nm). NPB, mCP, and FIrpic were used as a HTL, EBL, and a blue dopant in EML, respectively. Device A has the pure TPBi over the whole ETL region. Other devices with a double ETL consist of a first layer with pure TPBi (20nm) as exciton blocking layer and a second layer with a mixture of TPBi and Liq (20nm). When the Liq doped in TPBi, electrons can be easily injected from the cathode into the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) rather than the TPBi alone.


                     Fig. 1(b) shows the molecular structure of Liq as the key material used in this study. Generally, Liq is one of the organometallic complexes that have been demonstrated to assist electron injection. This is owing to the low binding energy between Li and the quinolate ligand [6,11,12]. In addition, when the Liq layer exists in a thin layer between the ETL and the cathode, it is possible to tunnel of injected carriers.

On the contrary to that, thick Liq layer reduces carrier transport because it has an insulating property with a high dielectric constant. However, we expected that a little Liq doped in the ETL would easily lead to the efficient injection of electrons from the cathode to the ETL as shown in Fig. 1(a).


                     Fig. 2
                      shows possible triplet energy transfer path for emitters in mCP layer. mCP and TPBi were inserted in between HTL and EML and between EML and ETL for efficient triplet exciton confinement [4,5], because the T
                     1 of both mCP (2.90eV) and TPBi (2.80eV) is higher than that of FIrpic (2.65eV). It means that efficient exothermic energy transfer was maintained in EML [1,13–15].


                     Fig. 3
                      shows the luminance versus voltage characteristics of blue PHOLEDs with a variety of ETLs. The doping concentration of the Liq in second ETL was controlled from 0% to 10%. The driving voltage of devices B, C, and D was lower than that of the device A. It means that the Liq doped in the second ETL reduces the driving voltage, and it was also assumed to have good interfacial contact between cathode and the second ETL. The luminance of devices B, C, and D were higher than that of device A. From a definition of luminance, it can be known that a charge balance with holes and electrons was improved by Liq doping effects in EML. The effects of the exciton confinement were also increased because of mCP and TPBi. Inset of Fig. 3 shows the current density versus the voltage characteristics. As shown in the energy band diagram (Fig. 1), easier electron injection from the cathode was expected for the Liq-doped ETL than for the non-doped ETL because of the low LUMO level of Liq. It means that Liq is capable of adjusting charge injection. These results showed Fig. 4
                     , which a charge balance between holes and electrons was enhanced by doping a suitable Liq in EML [16].


                     Fig. 4 shows various EL efficiency. It can be known that device C has the highest efficiencies. When the Liq was doped into the second ETL, it helped to migrate the electrons from the cathode into the second ETL. Device C has a maximum luminous efficiency (LE), external quantum efficiency (EQE), and power efficiency (PE) of 17.65cd/A, 8.78%, and 7.86lm/W, respectively. However, heavy doping of 10% Liq causes a charge unbalance between holes and electrons in EML. EL performance of fabricated blue OLEDs was summarized in Table 1
                     . Consequently, a blue PHOLED with an optimum Liq doping concentration in the double ETL structure was realized.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We demonstrated that the electrical properties of blue PHOLEDs, such as the driving voltage and efficiencies, were improved by using a double electron transport layer and efficient exciton confinement system within EML. The low electron injection barrier was due to good interfacial contact between the cathode and organic layer. The higher triplet states of mCP than that of FIrpic also led to efficient exciton confinement. Consequently, the device C with 5% Liq doped in the second ETL has an improved EL performance than other devices and this better property can be explained by above mentioned (i) smooth electron injection to EML, (ii) efficient exciton confinement, and (iii) improved charge balance within EML.
