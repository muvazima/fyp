                     Objective: Although the use of temozolomide in chemoradiotherapy is effective, the challenging clinical problem of pseudo progression has been raised in brain tumor treatment. This study aims to distinguish pseudo progression from true progression.
                  
                     Materials and Methods: Between 2000 and 2012, a total of 161 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were treated with chemoradiotherapy at our hospital. Among the patients, 79 had their diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data acquired at the earliest diagnosed date of pseudo progression or true progression, and 23 had both DTI data and genomic data. Clinical records of all patients were kept in good condition. Volumetric fractional anisotropy (FA) images obtained from the DTI data were decomposed into a sequence of sparse representations. Then, a feature selection algorithm was applied to extract the critical features from the feature matrix to reduce the size of the feature matrix and to improve the classification accuracy.
                  
                     Results: The proposed approach was validated using the 79 samples with clinical DTI data. Satisfactory results were obtained under different experimental conditions. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.87 for a given dictionary with 1024 atoms. For the subgroup of 23 samples, genomics data analysis was also performed. Results implied further perspective on pseudo progression classification.
                  
                     Conclusions: The proposed method can determine pseudo progression and true progression with improved accuracy. Laboring segmentation is no longer necessary because this skillfully designed method is not sensitive to tumor location.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly invasive disease, and its recurrence at sites distant from the core of tumors is the main cause of its high mortality. The current standard of care is surgical resection, followed by radiation therapy (RT) and concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy [1].

Pseudo progression (PsP) is a phenomenon showing changes of subacute imaging data in human glioma subsequent to chemoradiotherapy suggestive of progression [2]. The incidence of tumor PsP ranges from 28% to 66% in all GBM patients undergoing chemoradiation and typically occurs within three months after the completion of concurrent radiation and TMZ chemotherapy [3]. PsP has been associated with a variety of nontumoral processes, such as treatment-related inflammation [1], postsurgical changes, ischemia, and radiation necrosis [4,5].

PsP is detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as contrast-enhanced regions that can mimic early tumor progression. However, PsP is difficult to identify by conventional MRI and morphologic MRI features [1,6,7]. Currently, the only method to distinguish PsP from early progression is by follow-up examinations on patients [2]. Differentiation between PsP and tumor progression is critical because PsP is an indication of that the current therapy is effective and should be continued, in which group the patients have a better chance of survival, whereas tumor progression indicates that the current therapy is not effective and should be altered if possible. Developing advanced techniques and approaches to distinguish between PsP and true progression in GBM is important [2,6].

Advanced MRI techniques, such as perfusion imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), have been introduced into the GBM treatment response analysis [8,9]. Different modalities of MRI can provide additional information and novel aspects to improve the distinction. For example, DTI is based on the movement of water molecules that diffuse more rapidly in the direction aligned with the internal structure. Different metrics, such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) [10], can be computed from DTI, which characterizes tissue integrity and describes the physical attributes of neuronal fibers in the brain. In [8], these values were observed to be significantly different in regions having or close to pathological changes. Therefore, these metrics can potentially be used for distinguishing PsP from early tumor recurrence.

However, previous studies mostly focused on extracting bio-features or morphologic features from the scans and identifying the presence of PsP by comparing the value of the features with certain discriminative criteria [1,11]. The performance of such approaches cannot meet the precision required for the clinical management of patients. The authors were perplexed about the tumor progression and stated that advanced techniques are necessary.

Consequently, researchers have started to apply machine learning approaches [12,13], such as support vector machine (SVM) [9], to improve the analysis of perfusion images. Eight parameters derived from multiple MRI sequences are used to compose the feature vector for classification. This approach directly uses the extracted morphological features without further analysis. The region-of-interest (ROI) should be segmented for each set of MRI sequence beforehand, but this step is labor intensive and introduces much ambiguity. A more complicated tumor growth model was developed as the metric of therapy response [14]. A score called Days Gained was computed by this model to distinguish PsP from true progression. This approach requires follow up of image data of patients. Segmentation cannot be avoided either. Generally, improvements to these approaches are greatly needed, particularly with the use of advanced analysis.

This study focuses on DTI sequence and uses extracted volumetric FA images as the key measurement. The dictionary learning (DL) approach is applied to the image sequence to obtain sparse representations. DL is a powerful image analysis method based on sparse representation techniques. DL methods have various forms derived from different application problems, such as image denoising [15], image in-painting [16], and image compression [17,18]. However, most of these attempts are based on two-dimensional (2D) images. In the present study, we extend this approach to discriminate volumetric subjects. ROI segmentation is no longer needed in the DL approach. Therefore, the proposed method is more efficient and accurate. Then, the feature matrix is composed by the sparse representation with a specially designed permutation, which could solve the location divergence of tumors. Finally, a small group of features is selected from the feature matrix, and the subjects are classified using the SVM approach.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

Between 2000 and 2012, a total of 161 patients [19] with GBM were treated with chemoradiotherapy after surgical resection at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. Along with chemoradiotherapy, the patients underwent MRI/DTI scans every two or three months after each stage of therapy for monitoring. MRI/DTI data; treatment schemes, such as date of surgery, type of surgery, RT dose, concurrent chemotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy agents, and patient information, such as date of birth, date of death, ethnicity, and gender, were fully available. Different treatment schemes could lead to different therapy results, including PsP, which could be identified by the proposed image analysis approach. However, the image analysis approach itself is essentially irrelevant to the treatment schemes. The doctor's diagnosis of PsP was made on the basis of clinical and imaging data and the clinical experience of the treating physician. Biopsy could be performed when necessary. For each patient, we selected the DTI sequence that was obtained when the patient was first diagnosed with PsP or true progression. Both PsP and true progression were assumed to have just occurred, and the time was the earliest for diagnosis by using imaging. Under this condition, 79 samples with qualified DTI data were selected and used, including 23 pseudo and 56 true progression samples, which were all collected after 2005. Among 79 samples, 23 samples possessed genomic data. The composition of the two datasets is shown in Table 1
                     . The study protocol was approved by the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center review board.

The DTI data sequences were processed with MRIcron [20] and FSL [21,22]. Each DTI sequence of the DICOM images was transformed into a 4D image with the gradient information using the MRIcron. Then, the FSL software was used to correct for eddy current-induced distortions and subject movements. Afterwards, non-brain tissue such as skin was removed [23]. The FA value of each voxel was computed by the FSL. Each reconstructed brain volume was linearly registered to the standard brain template FMRIB58 [24]. As a result, all the registered volumetric FA images had the same number of slices and the same resolution. Thus, the same voxels across different patients were properly registered to one another. Fig. 1
                         shows two randomly selected samples with one slice of the DTI raw data, the FA image, and the registered FA image, respectively. The figure also shows that the position and head shape are registered accurately.

With the trained dictionary D and the obtained sparse representation, one image patch x can be successfully expressed as a sparse linear combination of the atoms in D and its corresponding sparse expression α as shown in Fig. 2
                        D. For each patient, the collection of sparse representation is a matrix

                         indicates the pattern of the corresponding image patch x

                        , and thus carries the attributes of the corresponding brain tissue.

As each image patch relates to a certain area of the brain tissue, the direct comparison of the sparse representations of each patch among patients actually involves location information. We developed the following method illustrated in Fig. 3
                         to reshape the sparse representation matrix and compose the feature matrix, which are free from the location information. For each patient, the sparse representation matrix

                         made in different patients. For example, the feature – that is composed of the second-highest value in γ
                        
                           k
                         of each patient holds the second-highest contribution that d
                        
                           k
                         has made to each patient, and it can be associated with different image patches. Each atom d
                        
                           k
                         stands for a certain character, as atoms are considered to carry the fundamental information of brain tissue. For example, a certain d
                        
                           k
                         is mainly used for the constitution of image patches in the ROI of PsP. The corresponding sparse representation should be high in these image patches. The absolute value could vary in different patients. However, for each patient, the image patches falling under the ROI of PsP must relate more to the higher coefficients of d
                        
                           k
                         than the patches of other tissues. By sorting the coefficients β
                        
                           k
                        , we arranged the patches of each patient by how likely they contain pseudo progressive symptoms.

The length of column, 
                           K
                           ×
                           S
                        , is a huge number. Aside from the high computational cost, too many features can introduce noise and decrease the accuracy. Therefore, we need to reduce the dimensionality of F using a feature selection scheme called the index-based approach, proposed by [25]. In this approach, an index (DX score), which can be considered as a type of signal-to-noise ratio, is used to evaluate the discriminating capability of each feature. A top-ranking subset of these features was selected to build the SVM classifier. DX is defined as follows:
                           
                              (3)

                         are the standard deviation of the selected features in the two groups, respectively. We selected the set of top-ranking features that give the highest prediction accuracy. The index score is equal to the feature score (scaled by a constant) given by the feature selection tool of LIBSVM. The feature selection result obtained by this index score is comparable with the SVM-RFE (recursive feature elimination) algorithm. This approach is more advanced than the SVM-RFE in computational complexity and is especially suitable for the project because of the large feature size.

@&#EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS@&#

The DTI data of 79 patients were studied in this experiment. The volumetric FA image of each patient was extracted, and then registered to a standard volumetric space with a dimension of 
                        182
                        ×
                        218
                        ×
                        182
                     . Two examples are given in Fig. 1. The resolution of each slice was 182× 218. Each registered volumetric image had 182 slices. We selected 1 every 4 slices because it was dense enough. Thus, 46 slices were selected for every patient. Each slice was cut into 128× 160 because the object was located centrally.

In the DL step, 8× 8 image patches were extracted from each slice. Each image patch was represented by a 64× 1 vector, the elements of which were the gray scale of the pixels. The number of atoms K was set to 512. Therefore, the dimension of D was 64×512. Corresponding to one image patch, the dimension of sparse representation α was 512×1. A total of 512 atoms had a size of 64×1, which indicates an 8×8 image patch. An image patch from the slices could be expressed as the linear combination of the 512 atoms, as shown in Fig. 2D. Each slice was decomposed into 18513 patches by using the sliding mode with a gap of 1 pixel. Each volumetric image was decomposed into 851598 patches. As the large number, 29440 patches were randomly selected from each patient at the same position to train the dictionary D. Consequently, for one sample, the dimension of the sparse expression matrix was 512×851598. The dimension was reshaped to form the 
                           
                              
                                 (

                                       }
                                    
                                    
                                       k
                                       =
                                       1
                                    
                                    
                                       K
                                    
                                 
                                 )
                              
                              
                                 T
                              
                           
                         matrix, in which only the top 100 values were used in each row. Then, the dimension was converted to compose the feature matrix, which had a size of 51200×79.

We applied our Index-based feature selection [25] approach to the feature matrix F. We finally selected the top 37 features that gave the highest prediction accuracy. The values of the 37 features are shown in Fig. 4
                        (a). Each column represents one patient, and each row represents a feature. The first 23 columns are the patients with pseudo progression. The other 56 columns are patients with true progression. The features corresponding to pseudo progression and true progression groups, respectively, had values in different scales. This finding demonstrates that PsP patients corresponded to a certain range of FA values [26]. Based on the difference, the features could classify the two symptoms.

The clinical information of the 79 patients is presented in Fig. 4(a). The gray bar gives the diagnosis of the patients concerning pseudo progression. The dark gray bar indicates that the patient has pseudo progression. The light gray bar indicates the patient has true progression. The yellow bar indicates whether the patient died of GBM. The dark yellow bar indicates that the patient did not die of GBM, whereas the light yellow means that the patient died of GBM. With respect to the yellow bar, only a few patients in the pseudo progression group died of GBM, consistent with the current observation that PsP is the signal that the patient responds to the chemoradiotherapy. Thus, the mortality rate was lower in this group. Fig. 4(a) clearly demonstrates that the performance of DL is consistent with the clinical information.

5-fold cross-validation was applied to validate the classification performance. We randomly selected 80% of the samples of both types as the training set, and the remaining 20% samples was indicated as the testing dataset. The SVM classifier was built with the selected top features. The features in the testing set with the same order number as the top selected features were extracted. The classification result of the testing set was recorded in Table 2
                        . The process was repeated 10, 30, and 100 times. The DL-based SVM classifier was shown to be stable. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and the precision recall (PR) analysis based on the 79 samples are shown in Figs. 5
                        (a) and (b). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.84.

The number of atoms in the dictionary can be given according to the required accuracy and efficiency. Generally a large number of atoms would provide better accuracy but more time consuming. A trade-off between the accuracy and efficiency should be made. We have applied the method with different dictionary size other than K=512.

Let K be equal to 1024, the dimension of D is 64×1024. The sparse representation matrix is 1024×851598 when each volumetric image is decomposed to 851598 image patches. The formed feature matrix F is 
                           102
                           ,
                           400
                           ×
                           79
                        .

With the Index-based feature selection approach, the top 25 features, which indicate the highest prediction accuracy, are selected from the feature matrix. The values of the 25 features are visualized in Fig. 4(b). The 23 columns on the left correspond to the patients with PsP. The pattern of features is the same as in Fig. 4(b). 5-fold cross-validation has been applied as well. With K=1024, the ROC and PR curve of 79 samples are shown in Figs. 5(c) and (d) respectively. The AUC is 0.87 comparing 0.80 in [14]. The classification accuracy is reported in Table 2. The relationship between the size of the dictionary and the AUC of ROC and PR curves is shown in Fig. 6
                        . The experimental results show that the AUC increased when the size of dictionary increase, and the DL approach is stable when K is large enough, given that similar results are obtained when K=512 and K=1024. We prefer K=1024 in our project.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The samples in Dataset 1 provide another perspective to further explore the problem of diagnosing PsP, as these samples have genomics data aside from image data. Sample 1–9 in Dataset 2 are PsP samples in Dataset 1. Samples 24–37 in Dataset 2 are true progression samples in Dataset 1. In the previous experiments, samples 1 and 4, which are in Dataset 1 as well, were usually misclassified, the features of which were slightly different from most of other PsP samples shown in Fig. 4. We excluded the misclassified samples in the image analysis, and used the rest patients for the genomics analysis. We obtained 189 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a p-value 
                           <
                           0.005
                         using the Limma [27] package. Like image feature, gene expression level can reflect the dynamic and physiologic interplay of cells [28]. To assess the association of the image features with gene expression, we calculated the Pearsons correlation coefficients (PCC). For the top 25 image features shown in Fig. 4(b), we calculated the PCC to DEGs and used the corresponding p-values less than 0.05. The image–gene feature pairs with strong correlation (PCC of above 0.7) were selected to be informative of image feature. We found 21 genes that are associated with 11 image features. For example, image feature 
                           V
                           1
                         is correlated with six genes, including ERCC1, which are important in DNA nucleotide excision repair [29]. Glioma patients present significantly different genotype of ERCC1, which may increase the risk in comparison with normal controls [29,30]. However, patient groups are difficult to distinguish by basing only on one image feature and the correlated gene set. Fig. 7
                         shows that the combination of features 
                           V
                           1
                         and 
                           V
                           18
                         are more powerful for clustering. Features 
                           V
                           1
                         and 
                           V
                           18
                         are discriminative coefficients with the corresponding atoms between the two symptoms. Specifically, among the non-zero coefficients of the two corresponding patches, features 
                           V
                           1
                         and 
                           V
                           18
                         are the unique selected features, respectively. Furthermore, corresponding patches that are identified by selected features 
                           V
                           1
                         and 
                           V
                           18
                         are located in the pathological area. Therefore, the intensity (that is, FA value) differences between two symptoms can be reconstructed by the identified 
                           V
                           1
                         and 
                           V
                           18
                         with their corresponding atoms. The image features are outlined on top in Fig. 7, and the expression patterns of the corresponding gene sets are distinguished. These gene sets can reveal the physiologic basis of image features and act as potential biomarkers.

As PsP is a challenging clinical problem in GBM, researchers have shown intensive interest in this area. Two methods can represent the trends of studies and report better results. The first method [9] uses SVM to classify PsP and tumor recurrence. In this study, eight modalities of the MRI sequence were used: contrast-enhanced T1, T2, FLAIR, PD, ADC, rCBF, rCBV, and MTT. The features were extracted from each voxel in an ROI. The features were processed (e.g., normalization), and the feature vector was formed for each voxel. SVM was then applied to identify the PsP. This approach requires eight modalities of MRI for all patients, which improves the patients' medicare cost and takes a long time to scan. Furthermore, this approach requests segmentation of the ROI, which is a time-consuming task. Eight sequences have to be segmented for one patient. This step not only exponentially increases the burden but also requires reliable registration across eight sequences. Although this application has an AUC of 0.94, it is not really practical in clinical application.

The second method [14] is an advanced version of the aforementioned approach. A model was developed to calculate the Days Gained score, which estimates the amount of time a given therapy delays tumor growth. As PsP increases the survival rate, the Days Gained score is significantly different in terms of the true progression and PsP cohorts. Therefore, the score can be used to identify PsP from true progression. Compared with the first method, the second method reduced the data complexity using the T1 and T2 sequences only. However, segmentation could not be avoided in this study. Overall, the AUC of this method is 0.8, which is lower than that in the present study. Another obvious shortcoming is that the score cannot aid in diagnosis at the earliest time because the classification depends on the survival time.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this study, we developed and validated a new method to evaluate true brain tumor progression in contrast to PsP. This method was helpful in clinical decision making. DTI, as a promising method for characterizing microstructural changes or differences in neuropathology and treatment, was used in this approach. FA was extracted as the key measurement of PsP. PsP of patients were successfully identified using the proposed image analysis approach. The labor-intensive and time-consuming segmentation of the ROI was no longer needed. Furthermore, the proposed approach solved the location restriction with a skillfully composed feature matrix. We also explained the misclassified samples and the features.

In future works, we will consider involving more measurements extracted from DTI data, such as the mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity values. This additional information describes the different properties of the DTI data and provides more diagnostic value.
