                  A problem of decision making under uncertainty in which the choice must be made between two sets of alternatives instead of two single ones is considered. A number of choice rules are proposed and their main properties are investigated, focusing particularly on the generalizations of stochastic dominance and statistical preference. The particular cases where imprecision is present in the utilities or in the beliefs associated to two alternatives are considered.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In decision making under uncertainty, it is not uncommon to encounter situations with vague or conflicting information about the probabilities or the utilities associated to the different alternatives. We may think for instance of conflicts among the opinions of several experts, limits or errors in the observational process, or simply partial or total ignorance about the process underlying the alternatives. In any such case, the elicitation of a unique probability/utility model for each of the alternatives may be difficult and its use, questionable.

One of the solutions that have been proposed for situations like this is to consider a robust approach, by means of a set of probabilities and utilities. The use of this approach to compare two alternatives is formally equivalent to the comparison of two sets of alternatives, those associated to each possible probability-utility pair. Hence, it becomes useful to consider comparison methods that allow us to deal with sets of alternatives instead of single ones. However, the way to compare of sets of alternatives is no longer immediate: we may compare all possibilities within each of the sets, or also select some particular elements of each set, to take into account phenomena of risk aversion, for instance. This gives rise to a number of possibilities. Moreover, even in the simpler case where we choose one alternative from each set, we must still decide which criterion we shall consider to determine the preferred one.

There is quite an extensive literature on how to deal with imprecise beliefs and utilities when our choice is made by means of an expected utility model (Aumann, 1962; Nau, 2006; Ríos Insua, 1992; Seidenfeld, Schervish, & Kadane, 1995). However, the problem has almost remained unexplored for other choice functions. In this paper we focus mostly on two different optimality criteria that serve as an alternative to the expected utility model: stochastic dominance and statistical preference. The former is based on the comparison of the distribution functions associated to the alternatives, and has been applied in economics (Denuit, Dhaene, Goovaerts, & Kaas, 2005; Goovaerts, Kaas, Van Heerwaarden, & Bauwelinckx, 1990); the latter can be seen as a robust alternative to expected utility which is based on the median instead of the mean as a location parameter, and was introduced in De Schuymer, De Meyer, De Baets, and Jenei (2003), as an equivalent and graded version of the method presented in Boland, Hollander, Joag-Kev, and Kochar (1996); it is also a counterpart of the expected utility model when the rewards of the different alternatives are expressed in a qualitative scale (Dubois, Fargier, & Perny, 2003). We shall recall the basic aspects of these two criteria in Section 2.

In Section 3, we define a number of choice models for sets of alternatives starting from some binary relation, based on earlier work on this problem carried out in Montes, Miranda, and Montes (2013), and apply them to the particular cases where this relation is the one associated to stochastic dominance or statistical preference. Then we consider two particular cases: first, in Section 4 we deal with the case where we have precise information about the beliefs but imprecise one about the utilities. We model this situation by means of multi-valued mappings, or random sets (Dempster, 1967) which, under the epistemic interpretation considered in Kruse and Meyer (1987), can be seen as collections of random variables imprecisely specified. We show that under some conditions the comparison can be simplified using the lower and upper probabilities induced by the random set. Secondly, we consider in Section 5 the case where we have precise utilities but imprecise beliefs, and show that there are two additional notions that may be more useful in such a scenario.

The different conditions and their properties are illustrated by means of an example in Section 6. We conclude the paper by giving a number of additional remarks in Section 7.

Let us review the basics about the two optimality criteria for decision making under uncertainty we shall consider in this paper. To clarify our set up, we consider a problem where we must choose between alternatives X, Y whose utilities depend on the values ω of the states of nature. We assume that we have probabilistic information about these states of nature, so that X, Y are defined as variables from a probability space 
                        
                           (
                           Ω
                           ,
                           A
                           ,
                           P
                           )
                        
                      and taking values on an utility space Ω′. For the most part, we shall assume that Ω′ is a bounded subset of the reals; however, in the case of statistical preference we may have qualitative utilities, and then Ω′ may correspond to an ordered qualitative scale.

The notion of stochastic dominance between random variables is based on the comparison of their corresponding distribution functions. Assume that our utility scale is Ω′=[0,1] (the results in this section generalize immediately to the case where Ω′ is any bounded interval of real numbers). Distribution functions are thus defined in the following way:
                           Definition 1
                           A cumulative distribution function on [0,1] is a function F: [0,1]→[0,1] satisfying the following properties:
                                 
                                    •
                                    
                                       x
                                       ⩽
                                       y
                                       ⇒
                                       F(x)⩽
                                       F(y) ∀x,y [Monotonicity].


                                       F(1)=1 [Normalization].


                                       F(x)=lim
                                          ∊↓0
                                       F(x
                                       +
                                       ∊) ∀x
                                       <1 [Right-continuity].

Any F satisfying the properties of monotonicity and normalization is associated to a finite additive probability measure, and we shall call it a finitely additive distribution function.

One of the most popular methods for the comparison of cumulative distribution functions is stochastic dominance (Levy, 1998):
                           Definition 2
                           Given two cumulative distribution functions F and G, we say that F stochastically dominates G, and denote it F
                              ⪰FSD
                              
                              G, if F(t)⩽
                              G(t) for every t in [0,1], and given two random variables X, Y taking values on [0,1], we say that X stochastically dominates Y, and denote it X
                              ⪰FSD
                              
                              Y when its associated distribution function F
                              X stochastically dominates F
                              Y, where
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             F
                                          
                                          
                                             X

In the literature, this notion is sometimes called first degree stochastic dominance, in order to distinguish it from a number of weaker conditions called second, third,… degree stochastic dominance (Levy, 1998). This is the reason of the notation ⪰FSD. Occasionally the notation ⪰
                           st
                         is also employed (see for instance Müller & Stoyan, 2002).

This definition induces a partial order in the space 
                           
                              F
                           
                         of cumulative distribution functions, from which we can derive the notions of strict stochastic dominance, indifference and incomparability:

                                 F. This holds if and only if F

                         constitutes a preference structure (Roubens & Vincke, 1985).

Stochastic dominance is commonly used in economics and finance (Denuit et al., 2005; Goovaerts et al., 1990 ) and can be given the following interpretation: F
                        ⪰FSD
                        
                        G means that the choice of F over G is rational, in the sense that we prefer the alternative with greater probability of providing a utility above a certain threshold t, and this for all possible t. The notion has also been used in other frameworks such as reliability theory, statistical physics, and epidemiology. We refer to Levy (1998), Müller and Stoyan (2002) for more information, and to Batur and Choobineh (2012), Dupacova and Kopa (2013) for recent works in the context of decision making. It is characterized by the following property:

                              Given two random variables X and Y it holds that: X
                              ⪰
                                 FSD

We next introduce the notion of statistical preference. One of its advantages is that it is applicable to variables X, Y taking values on any ordered qualitative scale Ω′, which need not be numerical. It is based on the notion of probabilistic relation.

                        then it is easy to see that Q is a probabilistic relation. The value Q(X,
                        Y) can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of our preference of X over Y. Statistical preference can then be introduced as a decision criterion based on this probabilistic relation:

                              Y. Hence, we can see statistical preference as a natural generalization of the expected utility model to the case of qualitative utilities.

Statistical preference is also applicable when we are dealing with quantitative utilities and the utility scale Ω′ is a subset of the reals; in that case, statistical preference is related to a location parameter: the median. This is detailed in Montes, Martinetti, Díaz, and Montes (submitted for publication, Theorem 5).

More generally, the idea of statistical preference is to consider X preferred to Y when it provides greater utility the majority of times. As such, it is close to the rule of majority in voting systems; taking into account Condorcet’s paradox (see Condorcet, 1989) it is not surprising then that the binary relation associated to statistical preference is not transitive: it is possible to find random variables X, Y and Z satisfying X

To conclude this part, we discuss briefly imprecise probability models. This is the generic term used to refer to all mathematical models that serve as an alternative and a generalization to probability models in cases of imprecise knowledge. It includes possibility measures (Zadeh, 1978), Choquet capacities (Choquet, 1953–1954), belief functions (Shafer, 1976) or coherent lower previsions (Walley, 1991), among others.

In this paper, we shall use imprecise probability models because we shall deal with a set 
                           
                              X
                           
                         of alternatives, each with its corresponding probability distribution; we obtain thus a set 
                           
                              P
                           
                         of probability measures. This set can be summarized by means of its lower and upper envelopes, which are given by:

In the following, we propose a number of comparison methods for pairs of sets of variables which are based on performing pairwise comparisons of elements within these sets. We shall first give our definitions for the case where the comparisons of the elements are made by means of a binary relation, and later apply them to the particular cases where this binary relation consists of stochastic dominance or statistical preference. Some of the ideas within this section are similar to those put forward in Montes et al. (2013) when extending stochastic dominance in order to deal with imprecise information.

The ideas in the above definition are somewhat similar to those in the field of robust ordinal regression (Greco, Słowiński, Figueira, & Mousseau, 2010; Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012a, Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012b): in that case we consider a set of additive value functions compatible with our partial preferences, and the problem of considering a choice function that is robust with respect to this information is considered. In particular, in Kadziński et al., 2012a the best and the worst expected rewards for any alternative with respect to the set of value functions are considered. This could be embedded into our formulation above, provided that: (a) our binary relation is that associated to expected utility and (b) the set of alternatives corresponds to the conjunction of an alternative with a set of value functions. See also Section 5 later on.

Observe that for any binary relation ⪰, its extensions ⪰2 and ⪰3 are quite similar: both compare the best alternatives within each set

                     . The difference between them lies on whether there is a maximal element within each of these sets or not. A similar comment (this time in terms of the worst alternatives) can be made for ⪰5, ⪰6. Taking this into account, we can easily give a necessary and sufficient condition for the equivalences

Next we investigate which of the properties of the binary relation ⪰ are also satisfied by its extensions ⪰1,…,⪰6. Obviously, when ⪰ is not reflexive (resp., antisymmetric, transitive), neither are its extensions ⪰i,
                     i
                     =1,…, 6. Conversely, we can establish the following:

                                    If ⪰ is antisymmetric, so is ⪰

                                    If ⪰ is transitive, so are ⪰

                                    =
                                    
                                    1, 2, 3, 5, 6.
                                 

First of all, if ⪰ is reflexive, X
                           ≡
                           X for any random variable X, and applying Definition 5 we deduce that 
                              
                                 X
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       ⪰
                                    
                                    
                                       i
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                 X
                              
                            for any i
                           =3, 4, 6 and any set of random variables 
                              
                                 X
                              
                           .

Secondly, assume that ⪰ is antisymmetric and that two sets of random variables 
                              
                                 X
                                 ,
                                 
                                 Y
                              
                            satisfy 
                              
                                 X
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       ⪰
                                    
                                    
                                       1
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                 Y
                              
                            and 
                              
                                 Y
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       ⪰
                                    
                                    
                                       1
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                 X
                              
                           . Then, X
                           ⪰
                           Y and Y
                           ⪰
                           X for every 
                              
                                 X
                                 ∈
                                 X
                              
                            and 
                              
                                 Y
                                 ∈
                                 Y
                              
                           , and by the antisymmetry property of ⪰, we deduce that X
                           =
                           Y for every 
                              
                                 X
                                 ∈
                                 X
                                 ,
                                 Y
                                 ∈
                                 Y
                              
                           . But this can only be if 
                              
                                 X
                                 =
                                 {
                                 Z
                                 }
                                 =
                                 Y
                              
                            for some random variable Z. As a consequence, ⪰1 is antisymmetric.

Finally, assume that ⪰ is transitive, and let us show that so are ⪰i for i
                           =1, 2, 3, 5, 6. Consider three sets of random variables

The transitivity of ⪰5, ⪰6 is proved similarly to that of ⪰2, ⪰3, respectively. □

In addition, it is easy to check that reflexivity, antisymmetry and transitivity do not hold for definitions different than the ones of statements (a), (b) and (c), respectively.

Another interesting property in a binary relation is that it is complete, in the sense that given any two elements, either one is preferred to the other or they are indifferent, but they are never incomparable. From Proposition 2, it follows that the incomparable pairs with respect to an extension ⪰i are also incomparable with respect to the stronger extensions. The following result shows that if ⪰ is a complete relation, then its weakest extensions (namely, ⪰3, ⪰4 and ⪰6) also induce complete binary relations:

                           . But since ⪰ is a complete relation, this means that Y

The proof that ⪰6 also induces a complete relation is analogous. □

Although in this paper we shall focus on the particular application of Definition 5 to the relation ⪰ associated to stochastic dominance or statistical preference, there are other cases of interest. Perhaps the most important one is that where the comparison between pairs of random variables is made by means of their expected utility:

                           it is not difficult to see that Definition 5 gives rise to some well-known generalizations of expected utility that are formulated in terms of lower and upper expectations. Consider two sets 
                              
                                 X

                            and assume that the expectations of all their elements exist. Then with respect to definition ⪰1 it holds that:

In this subsection, we explore in some detail the case where the binary relation ⪰ is the one associated to the notion of stochastic dominance we have introduced in Definition 2, i.e., the relation ⪰ is defined by ⪰FSD. We shall assume that the utility space Ω′ is [0,1], although the results can be immediately extended to any bounded interval of real numbers.

From Montes et al. (2013, Example 1), we can see that the converse implications in Proposition 2 do not hold in general. With respect to the other results, since the relation ⪰FSD is reflexive and transitive, we can apply Proposition 3 and characterize the equivalences between

                         we want to compare. Moreover, we can deduce from Proposition 5 that

                                          FSD
                                       
                                       
                                          i
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                         is reflexive for i
                        =3, 4, 6 and transitive for i
                        =1, 2, 3, 5, 6. On the other hand, since two different random variables may induce the same distribution function, ⪰FSD is not antisymmetric.

Since ⪰FSD also complies with Pareto dominance (Eq. (6)), we deduce from Proposition 4 that when the sets 
                           
                              X

                         to compare have both a maximum and a minimum element, we can easily characterize the conditions 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    ⪰

                                          i

                        =1,…, 6 by comparing these maximum and minimum elements only.

Finally, note that ⪰FSD is not a complete relation, because there are distribution functions F,G such that F
                        ⪰FSD

Since stochastic dominance compares the alternatives by means of their associated distribution functions, this extension to an imprecise context may be made in terms of the comparison of sets of distribution functions, which can be equivalently represented by means of their associated p-boxes.

Note that the second part of this result can be seen now as a consequence of Propositions 3 and 4.

Next, we provide an alternative characterization of imprecise stochastic dominance in terms of the equivalent formulation given in Theorem 1. Recall that given two random variables X and Y, it holds that X

                        E(u(Y)) for every non-decreasing function u. When we compare sets of random variables, we must replace these expectations by lower and upper expectations. For any given set of distribution functions

We consider next the case where the basic binary relation to generalize is that associated to statistical preference, as given in Definition 4. Hence, we shall assume in general that the utility space Ω′ is an ordered set, which need not be numerical.

Hence, Proposition 3 does not apply in this case; indeed, we can use statistical preference to show that Proposition 3 cannot be extended to nontransitive relationships:

We showed in Theorem 8 that the generalizations of stochastic dominance towards sets of variables are related to lower and upper expectations. Next, we establish a similar result for the generalizations of statistical preference. The result shall be established in terms of lower and upper medians, and for this we shall require that our utility space Ω′ is numerical. Let us consider two sets of alternatives

                         with values on Ω′, and let us introduce the following notation:

                              The result follows from this equation together with Definition 5 and the above definitions of lower and upper median. □

Taking into account the properties of the median, we conclude from this result that statistical preference may be seen as a more robust alternative to stochastic dominance or expected utility in the presence of outliers.

Since the binary relation associated to statistical preference is complete, we deduce from Proposition 6 that so are the relations

                           . Complete relations are interesting because they mean that we can always express a preference between two sets of alternatives

                           . Another way of deriving a complete relation when we make multiple comparisons is to establish a degree of preference for every pairwise comparison, and to aggregate these degrees of preference into a joint one. This is possible to do by means of an aggregation operator.

All these properties are interesting when aggregating the profile of preferences into a joint one: symmetry implies that all the elements in the profile are given the same weight; idempotence means that if all the preference degrees equal r, the final preference degree should also equal r; monotonicity assures that if we increase all the values in the profile of preferences, the final value should also increase; and self-duality preserves the idea behind the notion of probabilistic relation in Definition 3, since for a self-dual aggregation function

                                                      )
                                                      .
                                                   
                                                
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              

It is not difficult to see that all the aggregation functions F
                           
                              i
                            above are monotonic and comply with the boundary conditions F
                           
                              i
                           (0,…,0)=0 and F
                           
                              i
                           (1,…,1)=1; they are thus instances of aggregation operators. They are moreover idempotent. On the other hand, only F
                           1 and F
                           4 are symmetric, and none of them is self-dual.

We can also use these aggregation operators to deduce the relationships between the different conditions established in Proposition 2 in the case of statistical preference: it suffices to take into account that F
                           1
                           ⩽
                           F
                           2
                           ⩽
                           F
                           3
                           ⩽
                           F
                           4 and F
                           1
                           ⩽
                           F
                           5
                           ⩽
                           F
                           6
                           ⩽
                           F
                           4.

The above remarks suggest that other preference relationships may be defined by means of other aggregation operators F, and this would allow us to take all the elements of the profile of preferences into account, instead of focusing on the best or worst scenarios only. Next, we explore briefly one of these possibilities: the arithmetic mean F

In the next two sections, we shall show how the above results can be applied in two different scenarios of imprecision within a decision problem: the case where we have imprecise information about the utilities of the different alternatives, and that where we have imprecise beliefs about the states of nature.

Let us start with the first case. Consider a decision problem where we must choose between two alternatives X and Y whose respective utilities depend on the values ω of the states of nature. Assume that we have precise information about the probabilities of these states of nature, so that X and Y can be seen as random variables defined on a probability space 
                        
                           (
                           Ω
                           ,
                           A
                           ,
                           P
                           )
                        
                     . If we have imprecise knowledge about the utilities X(ω) associated to the different states of nature, one possible model would be to associate to any ω
                     ∈
                     Ω a set Γ(ω) which is sure to include the ‘true’ utility X(ω). By doing this, we obtain a multi-valued mapping 
                        
                           Γ
                           :
                           Ω
                           →
                           P
                           (
                           
                              
                                 Ω
                              
                              
                                 ′

                     , and all we know about X is that it is one of the measurable selections of Ω, i.e., that it belongs to the set

                     This interpretation of multi-valued mappings, as a model for the imprecise knowledge of a random variable is not new, and can be traced back to Kruse and Meyer (1987). This epistemic interpretation contrasts with the ontic interpretation which is sometimes given to random sets as naturally imprecise quantities (Dubois & Prade, 2012).

In this paper, we shall consider only multi-valued mappings satisfying a certain measurability condition:

Our comparison of two alternatives with imprecise utilities results thus in the comparison of two random sets Γ1,Γ2, that we shall compare by means of their respective sets of measurable selections S(Γ1), S(Γ2) determined by Eq. (8). For simplicity, we shall use the notation Γ

The result follows from Proposition 4, taking into account that statistical preference satisfies the monotonicity condition of Eq. (6) and that if Γ is a random set taking values on a finite space, then the mappings minΓ, maxΓ belong to S(Γ). □

In particular, we deduce that we can focus on the minimum and maximum measurable selections in order to characterize these extensions of statistical preference:

These two results are interesting because random sets taking values on finite spaces are quite common in practice; they have been studied in detail in Dempster (1967) and Miranda, Couso, and Gil (2002), and one of their most interesting properties is that they constitute equivalent models to belief and plausibility functions (Nguyen, 2006).

                     →
                     Ω′, and there is some uncertainty about the probability distribution P of the different states of nature ω
                     ∈
                     Ω, that we model by means of a set 
                        
                           P
                        
                      of probability distributions on Ω. Then we may associate to X a set 
                        
                           X
                        
                      of random variables, which correspond to the transformations of X under any of the probability distributions in 
                        
                           P
                        
                     ; and similarly for Y. We end up thus with two sets 
                        
                           X
                           ,
                           
                           Y
                        
                      of random variables, and we should establish methods to determine which of these two sets is preferable.
                        1
                        One particular case where this situation may arise is in the context of missing data (Zaffalon & Miranda, 2009). We may divide the variables determining the states of nature in two groups: one for which we have precise information, that we model by means of a probability measure P′ over the different states, and another one about which are completely ignorant, knowing only the values they take, and nothing more. Then we may get to the classical scenario by fixing the value of the variables in this second group: for each of these values the alternatives may be seen as random variables, using the probability measure P′ to determine the probabilities of the different rewards. Hence, by doing this we would transform the two alternatives X and Y into two sets of alternatives 
                              
                                 X
                                 ,
                                 
                                 Y
                              
                           , considering all the possible values of the variables in the second group.
                     
                     
                        1
                     
                  

In this situation, we may compare the sets 
                        
                           X
                           ,
                           
                           Y
                        
                      by means of the generalizations of statistical preference or stochastic dominance we have discussed in Section 3; however, we argue that other notions may make more sense in this context. This is because conditions ⪰1,…,⪰6 are based on considering a particular pair (X
                     1,
                     Y
                     1) in 
                        
                           X
                           ×
                           Y
                        
                      and on comparing X
                     1 with Y
                     1 by means of the binary relation ⪰. However, any X
                     1 in 
                        
                           X
                        
                      corresponds to a particular choice of a probability measure 
                        
                           P
                           ∈
                           P
                        
                     , and similarly for any 
                        
                           
                              
                                 Y
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           ∈
                           Y
                        
                     ; and if we use an epistemic interpretation of our uncertainty under which only one 
                        
                           P
                           ∈
                           P
                        
                      is the ‘true’ model, it makes no sense to compare X
                     1 and Y
                     1 based on a different distribution. This is particularly clear in case we want to apply statistical preference, which is based on comparing P(X
                     >
                     Y) with P(Y
                     >
                     X), where P is the initial probability measure.

To make this clearer, in this section we may denote our sets of alternatives 
                        
                           X
                           
                           ≔
                           
                           {
                           (
                           X
                           ,
                           P
                           )
                           :
                           P
                           ∈
                           P
                           }
                        
                      and 
                        
                           Y
                           
                           ≔
                           
                           {
                           (
                           Y
                           ,
                           P
                           )
                           :
                           P
                           ∈
                           P
                           }
                        
                     , meaning that our utilities are precise (and are determined by the variables X and Y, respectively), while our beliefs are imprecise and are modeled by the set 
                        
                           P
                        
                     . To avoid confusions, we will now write X
                     ⪰
                        P
                     
                     
                     Y to express that X is preferred to Y when we consider the probability measure P in the initial probability space. Then we can establish the following definitions
                        2
                        A similar idea can be found in Greco, Mousseau, and Słowiński (2008) in the context of robust ordinal regression; in that case, the set of additive value functions compatible with the available information is obtained and two binary relations between pairs of alternatives are defined, depending on whether an alternative is preferred to another one with respect to all or some of the value functions.

                           1 in all the die outcomes, we obtain

If the binary relation ⪰ we start with is complete, so is the weak

In what follows, we study in some detail the notions of weak and strong preference for particular choices of the binary relation ⪰. If ⪰ corresponds to expected utility, strong preference of 
                        
                           X
                        
                      over 
                        
                           Y
                        
                      means that X is preferred to Y with respect to all the probability measures P in 
                        
                           P
                        
                     , and is thus related to the idea of maximality (Walley, 1991); on the other hand, weak preference means that X is preferred to Y (i.e., it is the optimal alternative) with respect to some of the elements of 
                        
                           P
                        
                     ; this idea is close to the criterion of E-admissibility (Levi, 1980). See also Remark 3 and (Couso & Dubois, 2012, Section 3.2).

When ⪰ is the binary relation associated to stochastic dominance, we obtain the following:

In this section, we shall illustrate the previous results by means of an application to decision making. We shall consider two different scenarios: on the one hand, we shall compare two alternatives in a context of imprecise information about their utilities or probabilities, by means of the results in Sections 4 and 5; on the other hand, we shall consider the comparison of two sets of alternatives, by means of the techniques established in Section 3. Our running example throughout this section is based on Lui, Jin, Zhang, Su, and Wang (2011, Section 4).

Let us consider a decision problem where we must choose between n alternatives a
                        1,…, a
                        
                           n
                        , whose rewards depend on the values of the states of nature, θ
                        1,…, θ
                        
                           m
                        , which hold with certain probabilities P(θ
                        1),…,
                        P(θ
                        
                           m
                        ).

Let us start by assuming that there is uncertainty about these probabilities, that we model by means of a set of probability measures 
                           
                              P
                           
                        . Then, we shall compare any two alternatives by means of the concepts of weak and strong 
                           
                              P
                           
                        -preference we have considered in Section 5.
                           Example 7
                           A company must choose where to invest its money. The alternatives are: a
                              1-a computer company; a
                              2-a car company; a
                              3-a fast food company. The rewards associated to the investment depend on an attribute c
                              1: “economic evolution”, which may take the values θ
                              1 – “very good”, θ
                              2 – “good”, θ
                              3 – “normal” or θ
                              4 – “bad”. The probabilities of each of these states are expressed by means of an interval. The rewards associated to any combination (alternative, state) are expressed in a linguistic scale, with values S

Consequently, with respect to the strong preference, both the car company and the fast food companies are preferred to the computer company, and they are incomparable to each other. With respect to the weak preference, the car company is also preferred to the computer company, while the fast food company is indifferent to the car and the computer companies.

Let us assume next that we have precise information about the probabilities of the different states of nature but that we have imprecise information about the utilities associated to the different rewards. Let us model this case by means of a random set, as we discussed in Section 4.

                              Since again we have qualitative rewards, we shall use statistical preference to compare the different alternatives. Taking into account that the utility space is finite, we deduce from Proposition 15 that the comparison of the random sets associated to each of the alternatives reduces to the comparison of the greatest and smallest measurable selections. Moreover, since the utility space is finite,

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have presented a number of choice models for decision making under uncertainty when there is imprecision about the probabilities of the states of nature and the utilities of the different alternatives. By considering all the probability measures and utility functions compatible with the available information, any alternative becomes a set of alternatives, and therefore the choice functions between pairs of alternatives must be extended in order to be able to choose between sets of alternatives.

We have proposed a number of choice models that accommodate different attitudes towards risk, by focusing on particular alternatives within each of the sets. These extensions can be applied to any choice function between pairs of alternatives. We have focused in particular on two such choice functions: stochastic dominance and statistical preference. The first one has been applied extensively on economics, while the second one is interesting when the utilities are expressed in a qualitative scale. Both of them serve as an alternative to the expected utility model, for which we have commented briefly on some of its possible generalizations to an imprecise context; they may also be regarded as more robust: in the case of stochastic dominance, it is invariant under increasing transformations of the utility function; on the other hand, statistical preference is related to the median, and is less affected by extreme rewards of the alternatives.

We think that with these relationships we are now able to effectively choose between two alternatives in any of the possible scenarios of imprecision: in either the probabilities of the states of nature or the utilities of the different alternatives; for qualitative or quantitative utility scales; and for different attitudes towards risk, more or less conservative.

From our results, there are a number of open problems which may be of interest: the comparison of more than two sets of alternatives, by means of transitive choice functions; the study of the stochastic dominance of the nth order; the modeling of imprecise beliefs and utilities by means of random sets with an imprecise probability model on the initial space; and a deeper study of the connection with the work on robust ordinal regression.
