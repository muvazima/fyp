                  We have proposed a method in which the speed and accuracy can be integrated into one metric of human performance. This was achieved by designing a performance task in which the subjects receive feedback on their performance by informing them whether they have committed errors, and if did, they can only proceed when the errors are corrected. Traditionally, the tasks are presented without giving this feedback and thus the speed and accuracy are treated separately. The method was examined in a subjective experiment with thermal environment as the prototypical example. During exposure in an office, 12 subjects performed tasks under two thermal conditions (neutral & warm) repeatedly. The tasks were presented with and without feedback on errors committed, as outlined above. The results indicate that there was a greater decrease in task performance due to thermal discomfort when feedback was given, compared to the performance of tasks presented without feedback.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

There is a continuous and dynamic interaction between people and their surroundings that produces physiological and psychological strain on the person, which consequently lead to changes in health, well-being and performance (Parsons, 2000; Clements-Croome, 2006; Lan et al., 2010; Lieble et al., 2012), and this interaction has strong economic implications (Fisk, 2001; Mendell et al., 2002; Wargocki and Djukanovic, 2005; Wargocki and Seppänen, 2006). It is a concerted effort of researchers, engineers and practitioners to find out how to quantify the effects of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) on occupants' productivity so that they can consequently be included when calculating building costs; at present they are not considered at all. Better work performance has been assumed to be one of the indicators of improved productivity that result in increased profitability when performing such calculations as illustrated by several examples provided in the literature (Wargocki and Seppänen, 2006). Quantitative relationships have been proposed between indoor climate (ventilation rate, perceived air quality, and temperature) and human performance (Wargocki and Seppänen, 2006; Lan et al., 2011a) which can aid such predictions and calculations.

There are many factors among others like level of education, skills, genders, circadian cycle, emotional states and response bias etc. that should be considered when investigating the relationship between indoor climate and human performance (Parsons, 2000; Clements-Croome, 2006; Lan et al., 2009). One of the factors is the so called speed-accuracy tradeoff effect (Wickelgren, 1977). Accuracy and speed are the two distinct aspects of human performance. Accuracy is a measure of the quality of a behavior. Measures of accuracy include number correct, percent correct, and probability of correct detections (Gawron, 2000). In human performance studies, the response time and other time-related measures have been used to attain information on the speed of work. IEQ-productivity research has usually used metrics of work speed rather than metrics of work accuracy. For studies performed in call centers, the speed of work expressed as average time per call or average handling time was used as a measure of work performance (Niemelä et al., 2002; Federspiel et al., 2004; Tham, 2004; Wargocki et al., 2004). Laboratory studies typically assessed work performance by having subjects performing (cognitive) tasks that simulated aspects of actual work and by subsequent evaluation of the speed (response time) and/or accuracy (percent errors), e.g. characters typed per unit time, number of completed addition/multiplication units per unit time etc. (Wyon, 1974; Wyon et al., 1975; Wargocki et al., 1999, 2000; Bakó-Biró et al., 2004; Witterseh et al., 2004; Lan and Lian, 2009; Lan et al., 2009, 2010).

The importance of speed and accuracy may differ according to the type of task. In addition, subjects in experiments concerning measurements of work performance may have the capability to compromise accuracy for speed. It is consequently quite difficult to compare the task speed obtained under two different conditions and conclude that the condition with the lower speed is worse for performance unless we know that the error level under this condition was greater than or at least identical to that under another condition. It is reasonably safe, however to conclude that the performance is reduced in a condition in which speed is lower and there are more errors made (Wickelgren, 1977). Also in studies in which either accuracy or speed are not affected and thus do not create difficulty for interpreting the results, as in such a case either speed or accuracy can be separately used as measures of performance (Hancock and Vasmatzidis, 1998; Pilcher et al., 2002; Wargocki et al., 2004; Wargocki and Wyon, 2007a,b; Lan and Lian, 2009; Lan et al., 2009). The problem is more complicated if speed and accuracy go in two opposite directions, because within the capacity of a person, increased speed of work may eventually compromise the accuracy and vice versa (Wickens and Hollands, 2000). For example, Eysenck and Willett (1962) have shown that during high arousal level, subjects performed less well on the Tsai–Partington test by making more errors, while at the same time their speed of work increased. It is difficult to interpret such experimental results and use them, for example, to quantitatively predict the effects of indoor environmental quality on performance in real offices. Consequently, it would be useful to develop a procedure that would eliminate such interpretation dilemma, e.g. by developing the method in which the speed and accuracy are integrated into one measure defining the overall effect of environmental conditions on performance. Attempts to achieve this goal have been made in the past. For example, Bakó-Biró et al. (2004) measured separately speed and accuracy and then multiplied them with equal weights to create the overall performance index illustrating their results. Another approach was used by Tanabe and Nishihara (2004) and Tsutsumi et al. (2007) who used the correct answer speed in the addition task as a measure of overall performance which excluded errors and indicated the number of correct answers a subject could complete every minute.

In this paper an approach to measure human performance with one composite index integrating speed and accuracy was proposed and the method was checked experimentally with thermal environment as the prototypical example.

@&#METHODS@&#

A subjective experiment with thermal environment as the prototypical example was carried out. During the experiment, neurobehavioral tests and tasks typical of office work were presented to the subjects in two ways: (1) without feedback on their performance, i.e. that the subjects performed the tasks without receiving information on whether they commit errors or not, and (2) with feedback on their performance, i.e. that they received information on whether they have committed errors and could only advance in performing the tests when the committed errors were corrected.

The experimental study was carried out in an office (with a floor area of 18 m2 and a volume of 55 m3) adapted for experimental purposes (Toftum et al., 2004). Six females and six males with an average age of 23 ± 2 years who agreed to participate were randomly selected from a group of 30 subjects who had participated in another experiment using similar experimental procedures and had taken place immediately prior to the present study (Skwarczynski et al., 2009). The other experiment selected the subjects from the group who volunteered to participate in the experiments using an opportunity sampling. The subjects were all students from the Technical University of Denmark but of different nationalities; all tests were presented to them in English-the tests could be performed by people with the fluency in English required to take studies at the Technical University of Denmark. The subjects were exposed in the office to two thermal conditions created by setting the temperature at 22 °C and 30 °C; the clothing level of the subjects was 0.9 clo at both temperatures. The clothing level was selected to keep the subjects thermally neutral at 22 °C. 30 °C was selected to make sure that the two thermal conditions were sufficiently different, as the relationship derived by Seppänen et al. (2006) suggests that a temperature of 22 °C creates conditions for optimal performance while performance should be considerably reduced at 30 °C. The subjects subsequently reported that they felt thermally neutral at 22 °C and warm at 30 °C (Lan et al., 2011b). A noise level of 50 dB(A) (with no occupants in the office) and a ventilation rate of 10 L/s per person were kept constant independently of the temperature in the office.

The subjects were divided into 2 groups of 6 persons (3 males and 3 females). Each group was exposed to each temperature twice in a repeated-measures design balanced for order of presentation, i.e. one group was exposed in the following order: 22–30–30–22 and the other group in the following order: 30–22–22–30. The exposures took place in two successive weeks in the afternoon from 13:00 to 17:30; the actual exposure in the office lasted 4.5 h. Each group was exposed twice a week (Group 1 on Mondays and Wednesdays and Group 2 on Tuesdays and Thursdays) and on the same weekdays in the subsequent week. Although only 12 subjects participated, the repeated measures design with repetition ensured that the statistical power of the study was similar to the statistical power of the previous comparable studies on the effects of IEQ on performance in which 30 subjects were normally recruited, and the repeated measures design was used without repetition (Wargocki et al., 2000); the statistical power for both designs is 0.96 with the sphericity assumption and assuming equal medium effect size (ES = 0.25) (Faul et al., 2007).

During each exposure in the office, the subjects performed neurobehavioral tests and tasks typical of office work designed to assess different skills. The latter included text typing and addition (Wargocki et al., 1999). The former was a neurobehavioral test battery (Lan and Lian, 2009; Lan et al., 2009) including seven computerized tests: Mental re-orientation (a spatial orientation test), Grammatical Reasoning (a logic reasoning task), Digit Span Memory (a traditional test of verbal working memory and attention), Visual Learning Memory (a picture memory task measuring spatial working memory), Number Calculation (a mental arithmetical test in which the subject has to add, subtract or multiply numbers), Stroop (a test of attentional vitality and flexibility due to perceptual/linguistic interference), and Choice Reaction Time (a sustained attention task measuring response speed and accuracy to visual signals). The tasks were presented on a PC and were self-paced; the reaction/processing time was recorded by the computer clock.

All tasks were presented to the subjects without feedback on their performance, i.e. they did not receive any information on their performance and performed each task until the time available to perform the task elapsed or/and until the entire task was completed. Speed and accuracy were used as two separate measures of performance on the tasks presented in this way. Additionally a performance index (PI) was computed to assess the overall performance integrating speed and accuracy and giving equal weights to both measures: the mean processing/reaction time (i.e. time used to perform the task) was divided by the accuracy of responses (e.g. by correct characters typed per minute or correct units added per minute) (Equation (1)).

Additionally, text typing, addition, Stroop and Number Calculation were also presented to the subjects by providing them with continuous feedback on their performance. For example, for text typing, subjects were asked to type successive sections of text (approximately 10 lines at a time) that were presented to them on the screen, exactly as it appeared. The computer program checked every word as the text was completed to make sure it was typed without errors. If errors were present the subjects received feedback informing them that they had made errors and exactly which words were wrongly typed; they then had to correct these errors before proceeding to the new screen with new text. Similarly the feedback was given in the other three tasks presented with feedback on performance. Consequently, speed at which tasks were performed was used as the only measure of performance in these cases and thus speed and accuracy were integrated experimentally into one metric of performance; subjects who were less accurate had to use more time correcting their mistakes and thus their overall speed was reduced. The overall performance for tasks with feedback was expressed by the performance index (PI
                        f
                     ) as follows where the reaction time/speed at which the task was performed includes the time spent for the correction of errors (Equation (2)).

Physiological parameters and biomarkers were measured several times during the exposure to explore the mechanisms by which raised temperatures affect performance. On several occasions during each exposure in the office, the subjects reported perceived air quality, thermal comfort, Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) symptoms, willingness to exert effort while working, emotion, fatigue and workload. The detailed experimental procedure is described in Lan et al. (2011b).

The SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) program was used to perform the statistical analysis. The experimental data were subject to analysis of variance (ANOVA) in a repeated measures design; Huynh-Feldt statistics was used to adjust the violation of sphericity. The significance level was set to be 0.05 (P < 0.05). The effect size (ES) that measures the difference between the true value and the value specified by the null hypothesis and hence indicates whether the difference is of practical importance was calculated (Lan and Lian, 2010). Effect sizes with values of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.4 for the ANOVA indicate small, moderate and large changes (Cohen, 1988). The statistical methods were consulted for their validity.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The results of performance of tasks that were presented to subjects with and without feedback on their performance are reported in this paper. All other results are reported by Lan et al. (2011a; 2011b).

As shown in Table 1
                     , except for the performance of text typing, task performance decreased at 30 °C compared with 22 °C although for some tasks the decrease was not significant. The effect size was in many cases at least moderate, indicating that the observed effects were of practical importance. In the case of text typing without feedback, the subjects input more characters at 30 °C but at the same time they also made more errors; the effect size was small in this case and the effect was not statistically significant, suggesting that the observed effects occurred by chance and had no practical importance. In the case of text typing with feedback, the subjects performed less well at 30 °C compared with 22 °C. The effect was not statistically significant although the effect size was in this case moderate.

The change of task speed and accuracy between 30 °C and 22 °C relative to 30 °C indicates that there was a greater change in speed than in accuracy as a result of increasing the air temperature (Fig. 1
                     ). Except for the addition task, the change of the performance index calculated for tasks presented with feedback (PIf) integrating experimentally speed and accuracy, was affected to a higher degree than the change of the performance index calculated for tasks presented without feedback (PI) by arbitrarily multiplying speed and accuracy thus giving equal weights to both measures of performance. It should be noticed that the difference occurred even though there was a very low error rate for tasks presented without feedback (Table 1, Fig. 1).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

To infer differences in competence based on measures of performance, both speed and accuracy must be examined (Glickman et al., 2005). However, the speed-accuracy tradeoff recognizes that subjects sometimes may sacrifice accuracy to enhance their speed of responding, or vice versa (Wickelgren, 1977). Arousal level may also affect speed and accuracy differently under the same conditions. McMorris et al. (2011) concluded that increases in arousal result in increased brain concentrations of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, which may increase the speed of processing. However, these increases may well also result in neural noise, which would have a negative effect on accuracy. In the present experiment, arousal was estimated using the Tsai–Partington test but no differences in performance of this test were observed between the two conditions investigated, suggesting that the arousal level was not affected by the change of temperature (Lan et al., 2011b).

Fast but inaccurate responding is not easily comparable to slow but accurate responding, especially when one tries to quantitatively assess the IEQ effect on productivity in the office. Therefore, it seems necessary to integrate task speed and accuracy into one index measuring the overall effects of IEQ on human performance. A need for such an approach was also expressed by the experts in the Delphi survey performed prior to the above described experiment. Forty experts studied topics related to human productivity and cognitive abilities and had published on these topics were approached; fifteen experts responded. They expressed their opinion on the need to integrate speed and accuracy into one index and if so how it should be done (Fig. 2
                     ). Fourteen (93%) of them thought that it was interesting and useful to integrate task speed and accuracy. Most of them, up to 80%, thought that the weights should not be assigned arbitrarily, but instead should depend on the context. Only about half experts suggested that it was acceptable to assign equal weights to the two separate measures of human performance when attempting to integrate them into one measure to predict the overall effect of the indoor environment on the performance of office work for the purpose of general building design and operation.

Negative effects on human performance as a result of thermal discomfort due to raised air temperature were efficiently measured by designing the tasks in such a way that subjects could not proceed until they had corrected their mistakes i.e. by providing feedback on their performance. Performance of these tasks was negatively affected even though the performance of tasks without feedback was not affected. This may suggest that presentation of tasks to subjects with feedback may be more sensitive to changes in indoor environmental conditions than the approach used so far when no feedback on performance was given to subjects. An example can be the performance of Stroop which was not significantly affected by elevated temperatures when presented without feedback but a highly significant effect was found when feedback on performance was given (Table 1). Consequently, it may be proposed that unless it is important to test specific skills and how accuracy and speed are affected, performance tests in which feedback is continually given to subjects when tests are performed should be used in future experiments when investigating the effects of IEQ on office work. This approach seems quite rational and better reflecting real world situation because most of the typical office work is performed in this way where some time is usually used to check and correct for possible mistakes.

Similar to previous studies (Wyon, 1974; Wargocki et al., 1999, 2000; Lan and Lian, 2009; Lan et al., 2009), it was found that task speed was affected to a larger extent than accuracy by thermal discomfort (Fig. 1). One reason is most likely that people work at a speed leading to an acceptable error rate (Wickelgren, 1977). If low error rates are observed, the accuracy aspect may be ignored and speed (reaction time) can be used to estimate the effect on performance. This was done in some of the previous studies in which the effects of IEQ on the performance of office work were measured (Wargocki and Seppänen, 2006).

One important result shown in Fig. 1 is that for most of the tasks the effects on performance of tasks with feedback were greater or at least very similar, to task performance if no feedback was provided. It may suggest that the previous estimations of the effects of thermal discomfort on performance of office work (Wargocki and Seppänen, 2006) may have underestimated the true effect. Consequently, the potential costs for productivity of having employees complaining of thermal discomfort would be higher than the costs which were estimated previously. This may also explain why generally the effects on performance measured in field experiments that used normal work as a measure of performance are higher than in laboratory studies in which the tests simulating office work are presented to subjects without feedback on their performance (Wargocki et al., 2002, 2004; Tham, 2004). Besides the benefits for experimental methodology of measuring the effects on performance, the approach presented in this paper provides a useful tool for improving estimations in cost-benefit calculations pertaining to building design and operation which include costs/benefits due to effects on human productivity.

                           Presenting the tasks with continuous feedback on performance was found to be a useful tool for improving the methods for measurements of the effects of IEQ on performance.

A larger decrease in task performance was observed due to thermal discomfort when the tasks were presented with feedback (which integrated speed and accuracy), compared with the tasks presented without feedback on performance (in which speed and accuracy were measured separately).

Task speed was affected by thermal discomfort to a much greater extent than accuracy when the performance tasks without feedback were presented.

The human performance measurement approach presented in this paper provides a useful tool for quantifying the effects of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) on occupants' productivity. However, this method needs to be examined by studying the effects of other indoor environments like indoor air quality, noise. It would also be good to learn whether it is legitimate to integrate the speed and accuracy by giving equal weights to both measures.

The future studies on the effects of IEQ on performance should consider using tests providing continuous feedback on performance because it would feature much better the realism of working environment where people normally adjust the pace of work based on the error rate.
