                  The existence of positive and negative externalities ought to be considered in a productivity analysis in order to obtain unbiased measures of efficiency. In this research we present an additive style, data envelopment analysis model that considers the production of both negative and positive externalities and permits a limited increase in input utilisation where relevant. The directional economic environmental distance (DEED) function is a unified approach based on a linear program that evaluates the relative inefficiency of the units under examination with respect to a unique reference technology. We discuss the impact of disposability assumptions in depth and demonstrate how different versions of the DEED model improve on models presented in the literature to date.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Modelling production which takes into account any externalities in the process within a productivity framework has become a topic of growing interest over the last decade. The concepts of efficiency and performance in conjunction with issues of environmental sustainability are of almost equal importance in our gradually wealthier societies. As stated in Seiford and Zhu (2002), both desirable and undesirable output may be present in the production process. In the extant literature, different industries have been analysed taking into account negative externalities such as biological oxygen discharges and total suspended solids in the pulp and paper industry (Hailu & Veeman, 2001), the residue ratio (i.e., the ratio between material inputs and waste) in solid waste collection and sorting programs (Courcelle, Kestemont, Tyteca, & Installé, 1998), air pollutants (e.g., dust, NO
                        x
                      and SO2) in electricity production (Korhonen & Luptacik, 2004; Yang & Politt, 2010; Zhou, Ang, & Poh, 2008), environmental pressure indicators in industrial systems (Zhang, Bi, Fan, Yuan, & Ge, 2008), and noise and delays in the transport sector (Lozano & Gutierrez, 2011; Yu, 2004; Adler et al. 2012). This argument is equally relevant for input variables in particular with respect to transport and communications networks although accounting for positive externalities has been less developed in the published literature to date.

The common procedure adopted in the literature in order to measure environmental performance is to incorporate undesirable outputs in the traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework through data transformations. Koopmans (1951), Chung et al. (1997), Dyckhoff and Allen (2001), Sarkis and Talluri (2004), Seiford and Zhu (2002) and Gomes and Lins (2008) present different approaches to including negative externalities within a productivity framework. Scheel (2001) and Zhou et al. (2008) survey and discuss various DEA models that account for undesirable outputs. Most of the existing studies are based on the concept of radial efficiency measures despite Färe and Lovell (1978) who pointed out the shortcomings of radial measurements in this context. Radial measures of efficiency tend to overestimate technical efficiency particularly in the case of nonzero slacks present in the optimal solution. In order to consider slacks, the authors suggested the concept of non-radial measures such as an input-oriented Russell measure that minimises such input slacks. Similar issues were addressed by Charnes et al. (1985) which present an additive model that maximises the sum of both input and output slacks. The principal drawback of the latter approach is that input and output slacks are summed without accounting for the different measurement units. To overcome the problem, Lovell and Pastor (1995) develop the weighted additive model which ensures units and translation invariance by normalising the data. Tone (2001) proposes a slack based model that maximises normalised input and output slacks while Cooper, Park, and Pastor (1999) and Cooper, Pastor, Borras, Aparicio, and Pastor (2011) present respectively a range adjusted measure and a bounded adjusted measure that maximise input and output slacks in a non-oriented model. Fukuyama and Weber (2009) combine the directional distance function technology and the slack based measure in order to develop a generalised measure of technical efficiency. In this research we develop an additive type model that benchmarks the decision making units (DMUs) on a unique eco-environmental frontier taking into account the production of both positive and negative externalities. The directional economic environmental distance (DEED) function estimates the distance of each DMU to the efficient frontier given quantities and prices (costs), hence evaluates the potential monetary savings available were all DMUs to lie on the frontier. Prices and/or marginal damage costs are frequently available today because negative externalities are often given values through scientific research or international organisations such as the International Panel on Climate Change. Moreover, the growing interest in environmental issues has created markets for pollutants such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. However, we acknowledge that price information is not always available particularly when a market does not exist, therefore we also propose two alternative DEED approaches that do not require the use of prices, namely a range adjusted measure and a slack based measure.

As suggested by Dyckhoff and Allen (2001), the standard assumption that considers all inputs as resources to be reduced is no longer valid in an ecological context. From an eco-environmental perspective, ecological inputs (e.g., waste utilised in a power or recycling plant) ought to be maximised (Liu, Meng, Li, & Zhang, 2010; Sharp, Meng, & Liu, 2007). Moreover, following the same perspective, certain inputs may be increased to a limited extent in order to reduce the production of negative externalities and achieve greater eco-environmental efficiency. The idea of input increases was first presented in Cooper, Park, and Ciurana (2000), in which the computation of marginal rates and elasticities of substitution led to a modified additive model in which some of the input and the output slacks were allowed to be defined as positive or negative. Sueyoshi and Goto (2011) present a range adjusted measure incorporating the possibility of increasing input utilisation through a non-linear DEA model in which positive and negative slacks are present for the same input. However, the presence of a double slack per input creates problems in the definition of the efficient frontier and in particular in the selection of the benchmarks for the inefficient units. In the DEED model we therefore develop a unified approach that considers inputs which may be either decreased or increased (defined in this paper as flexible inputs) and inputs that may only be decreased (defined in this paper as standard inputs). Flexible inputs that may be increased will generally be limited depending on the context, for example by the potential increase of output production, thus accounting for budget or other resource restrictions. Our approach is based on a linear program which guarantees a feasible solution should one exist and solves the current problem of benchmark selection.

The aims of this paper are four-fold: (i) to clarify the impact of modelling choices on the technology set with respect to externalities because these concepts have not been clearly documented to date, (ii) to develop a DEA additive measure based model which, meeting the principal technology assumptions, includes the concept of flexible inputs within an eco-environmental efficiency analysis, (iii) to provide different methodological approaches as a function of the level of information available (i.e. price/cost information) and (iv) to compare the DEED framework with existing models in the literature thus highlighting the main advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we discuss the underlying assumptions and develop mathematical formulations for a variety of DEED models. In Section 3, we analyse the results of the model through a simple illustration and then compare the results to those of Sueyoshi and Goto (2011) and Sharp et al. (2007). The comparisons cover electric power production and a waste water plant, highlighting the versatility of the framework proposed. Finally, Section 4 concludes our research by summarising the potential advantages from applying a DEED approach and suggesting potential future directions.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

In Section 2.1 we discuss current approaches to modelling externalities and their respective assumptions in the DEA framework. Our aim is to clarify the impact of the different assumptions on the technology set because there is a lack of consensus surrounding these concepts. In Section 2.2 we present the generalised economic-environmental directional distance function by first describing the axioms (i.e. the mathematical constructs of the production possibility set and disposability assumptions) and then the complete model. In Section 2.3 we highlight the differences in the efficiency measure between the DEED model and the directional distance function approach. Finally, in Section 2.4 we adapt the potential paths to the frontier by applying slack-based, range-adjusted and bound-adjusted measures, none of which require price or marginal damage cost information.

Multiple models have been published in the literature to date with the intention of including negative externalities within a data envelopment analysis framework. Negative externalities may be introduced either (i) as input, (ii) as output to be reduced or (iii) through data transformation (Scheel, 2001). Consider an input vector 
                           
                              x

                        . As shown in Fig. 1
                        a, holding y constant and modelling negative externalities as input implies substitution between u and xS
                        . Moving along the frontier from point A to point C (i.e., on the input isoquant) implies a decrease in the original input in favour of an increase in negative externalities and vice versa while producing the same amount of output. This substitution effect is context dependent, for example investing in technology may lead to a reduction in pollution and increasing the number of hospital staff may lead to a reduction in hospital readmissions. However, it is not relevant when the two sets of variables are not substitutes, for example a reduction in fuel consumption is likely to lead to an equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions.


                        Fig. 1b presents the production possibility set defined by the negative externalities vector (u) and the output vector y holding xS
                        constant, as expressed in TI for a constant returns to scale (CRS) and a variable returns to scale (VRS) technology set. In the case of CRS technology, TI is a linear function crossing segment (0A) and upwards. In the case of a VRS technology, TI would be bounded by the segments (aA, AB) and the horizontal extension from B. This technology simply resamples an input–output set and, as noted in Färe and Grosskopf (2003), implies that u may be freely disposable producing a physically impossible unbounded extension to the right of observation B. Nonetheless, this unbounded extension is purely an artefact of the definition of the technology set and, as highlighted in Hailu (2003), the measures of productivity would not direct inefficient observations to this section of the frontier.

When modelling negative externalities as output, disposability is an axiom of particular interest. Assume that we use an input vector x in order to produce a vector 
                           
                              y

In summary, negative externalities may be evaluated either as an input or an output in a DEA framework. When introduced as an input (i) negative externalities and inputs must be substitutable and (ii) negative externalities create an unbounded extension to the reference set. When negative externalities are considered as output, it is necessary to consider the appropriate assumption (free or weak disposability) which is context dependent. In this research, we adapt the model to suit both approaches in order to develop a generalised framework.

Assumption (I) permits some variables to be zero, relaxing strict positivity. Assumptions (II)–(V) require that at least one input and one output is produced by at least one DMU. Assumption (VI) defines null-jointness which was first introduced by Shepard and Färe (1974). Null-jointness assumes that the outputs and negative externalities are jointly produced, which means that if there are no negative externalities, there is no production whatsoever. Finally, we introduce the disposability assumptions. If weak disposability of negative externalities (VII) and strong disposability of standard output (VIII) is assumed, then it holds that:

The formulation uses λj
                         as intensity weights to obtain the convex combination of DMUs j. Variable returns to scale is enforced by the restriction that λj
                         must sum to one. Free disposability of inputs and standard output is modelled through the inequality constraints. An equality constraint for undesirable output eliminates strong disposability hence imposes “no disposability”. Finally, the abatement factor θ is introduced to scale down both positive and negative externalities by the same fraction ensuring weak disposability. Based on the weighted additive model (Cooper et al., 2000; Färe & Grosskopf, 2010; Lovell & Pastor, 1995), we design a directional eco-efficiency distance function as a linear program, presented in Eqs. (1.1)–(1.7) satisfying technology set

                        . We note that the price vector translates the linear objective function into a weighted additive model which computes a final score expressed in monetary units.

The objective function (1.1) seeks to maximise the slacks of the specific DMU under examination, similar to that of the weighted additive model. When the estimated efficiency score ∂ assumes a value of 0, the DMU lies on the frontier and is deemed efficient, whereas a ∂ value greater than zero identifies an inefficient unit. Given the nature of the input and output slacks in this formulation (i.e. standard input slacks reduce costs, flexible inputs slacks could either increase or reduce costs, standard output slacks increase revenues and negative externality slacks reduce cost equivalents), the summed ∂ could be interpreted as a level of (monetary) “wastage” or the maximal savings (opportunity costs) attainable from moving an inefficient DMU to the Pareto frontier. By pricing externalities, we are implicitly assuming that the prices are both reliable and correctly balance the relative importance of the variables applied in the model. However, if the pricing is either incorrect or unreliable, it is possible to substitute the price vector P with ad hoc weights in order to express the relative importance of input and outputs appropriately. Finally, if an a priori weighting is not feasible, we also propose two alternative DEED models which do not require the use of prices or ad hoc weights as discussed in Section 2.4.


                        Eqs. (1.2) and (1.3) treat inputs using the same mathematical formulation. The differences between flexible and standard inputs are highlighted via the slack boundaries. In the DEED model, the flexible input slacks, αp, are free in sign, allowing for reductions (αp
                         > 0), increases (αp
                         < 0) or no change (
                           
                              
                                 α
                                 p
                              
                              =

                        ) in the input utilisation. Consequently, we identify potential increases in certain inputs that may simultaneously reduce the utilisation of standard input and the production of negative externalities. Flexible inputs are context-dependent and may draw from one of two categories: (i) as environmental variables (e.g., waste, effluent, etc.) which, given the technology, we are willing to increase or (ii) as non-environmental variables which may increase in a limited fashion in order to achieve improved eco-environmental efficiency. Standard input slacks (βq
                        ) describe a situation in which only the reduction (βq
                         > 0) or no change 
                           
                              (
                              
                                 β
                                 q

                              0
                              )
                           
                         in utilisation are permitted. Standard inputs can be interpreted as all those variables necessary for production that negatively impact the environment (e.g. fuel, chemicals, etc.). As assumed by the technology, constraint (1.4) incorporates the undesirable outputs as a weak disposable output to be reduced. Constraint (1.5) is the typical output constraint computing the slack regarding the possible expansion in the production. Constraint (1.6) is a typical variable return to scale (VRS) constraint. It should be noted that the model considering a constant return to scale (CRS) technology is presented in Appendix A and the model defining negative externalities as inputs is presented in Appendix B.

Increases in flexible input utilisation are limited by constraint (1.7). This constraint implies that a higher expenditure on flexible inputs (e.g. an increase in labour or capital) must be at most equal to the reduction in the social costs of the production of negative externalities. Constraint (1.7) must be adapted to the objectives of the application under investigation. In this case, we consider environmental inputs (e.g., waste, effluent, etc.). If there is no limitation on the potential increase in such inputs, the constraint could simply be deleted. For example, in a recycling station where the flexible environmental input represents waste and the negative externality is the CO2 produced by trucks, there are neither technological nor economic reasons for limiting the recycled waste to the reduction of CO2 hence constraint (1.7) would not be necessary. Furthermore, it is possible to limit the increase in the utilisation of a subset of flexible inputs to a decrease in the utilisation of other flexible inputs. This implies that any increase in expenditure must be compensated by at least an equal reduction in the levels of other flexible inputs. The constraint describing this restriction is defined as in (1.7b).

Additional alternatives include linking the increase in flexible input utilisation to the reduction of standard input consumption or to connect the input utilisation to the production of good outputs or, finally, to limit the increase in input to a predetermined value (e.g., a budget for new investments, a government incentive to move to greener technologies or a maximum or minimum threshold). It is important to note that constraint (1.7) impacts the distance function, limiting the maximum path towards the efficient frontier, without impacting the design of the production possibility set

However, the most common vector of directions in which outputs are scaled is

                        . Chen and Delmas (2012) and Chen (2014) discuss implementation issues caused by the directional distance function (DDF) in the presence of the weak disposability assumption. For specific direction vectors, the DDF may be non-monotonic, misclassify the efficiency estimate and derive strongly dominated projection targets. In Fig. 3
                        a we present a weakly disposable production possibility set in the output space bounded by 0ABCd. The inefficient units D and E will move along the directional vector ray in order to reach the boundary of the frontier. Thus, the measure of inefficiency β maximises the proportion of the vector g in order to reach the technology frontier (e.g., E′E/0gE). The DDF expressed as in (4) assigns 
                           
                              β
                              =
                              0
                           
                         to the efficient units A, B and C lying on the frontier. We note that in this case, DMU C is weakly efficient due to the presence of a slack with respect to the negative externalities. Using a directional distance vector as defined, it is possible to obtain a distance measure that (i) maintains the same mix of desirable outputs and negative externalities (ii) is expressed as the proportional increase (decrease) in desirable outputs (negative externalities) to reach the efficient frontier and (iii) lies between 0 and 1. In this case, the direction vector 
                           
                              g

                                    y
                                    G
                                 
                                 ,

                              )
                           
                         will be different for each of the DMUs under analysis.

As opposed to the directional distance function approach, the DEED model maximises the sum of the slacks identifying the furthest point on the frontier from the DMU analysed which follows the additive model city-block metric. Thus, the mix of variable utilisation/production is not necessarily preserved as in a radial approach. The DEED model does not impose directions to the frontier a priori rather identifies a section of the frontier to which the inefficient point ought to be projected. The projection point is exactly that point which maximises the weighted slacks. Furthermore, the DEED model as well as the additive model account for all sources of inefficiency. Consider DEED model (2) assuming prices equal to 1 for all variables. Fig. 3b presents the negative externalities/desirable output space where 0ABCd defines the same technology set as presented in Fig. 3a. In the case of the DEED model, inefficient unit E will move to the portion of the frontier defined by the E″AE′ section (i.e., decreasing negative externalities and/or increasing desirable outputs). Thus, DMU E is projected precisely to point E′, where 
                           
                              
                                 δ
                                 f
                              
                              +
                              
                                 γ
                                 r
                              
                           
                         reaches their maximum given the input level. Finally, the DEED objective function seeks the maximum sum of slacks identifying all possible sources of inefficiency per DMU as in the case of weakly efficient unit C which is projected onto unit B because the latter produces the same level of output with lower negative externalities. The measure of inefficiency is zero when the unit is efficient, and increases accordingly with the DMUs level of inefficiency.

Consider now the input/negative externality space shown in Fig. 4
                         where DMUs A, B and D lie on the frontier. In a standard additive model, DMU C maximises slacks by moving towards the section of the frontier defined by C′ and C″ i.e. lower input and negative externalities. The novelty of the DEED model is that DMU C is permitted to increase the input utilisation, x, if such an increase leads to at least an equal reduction in negative externalities (via constraint (1.7)). Thus, DMU C may be projected onto the sector of the frontier defined by C′C‴. The difference between the additive and the DEED models is the part of the projection that describes an increase in input utilisation, C″C‴. The horizontal component (an input increase), is equal to the vertical component (negative externality reduction) which is the maximum possible decrease in negative externalities for the DMU under consideration. The measure of efficiency maximises the slacks in order to reach the greatest reductions following a city-block metric. Despite the fact that B lies on the frontier, it is not efficient since the DMU is able to contract the negative externalities whilst consuming the same amount of input. Changing the vector of prices in the objective function and in constraint (1.7) directly impacts the possible projection area leading to a different choice in the path to the frontier. We would like to stress that the introduction of the flexible inputs does not impact the shape of the technology set.

Model (2) implicitly assumes prices or the costs of damage exists for the variables under analysis. Since such information is not always available, and given the managerial preference for efficiency scores to lie between zero and one, it is possible to adapt model (2) in order to obtain restricted efficiency estimates. The slack based model (SBM, Tone, 2001), range adjusted measure (RAM, Cooper et al., 1999) and bounded adjusted measure (BAM, Cooper et al., 2011) present alternatives to the additive (ADD, Charnes et al., 1985) approach. All these alternative models define the same Pareto frontier. The main differences draw from (i) the path to the efficient frontier (ii) the DMU estimated efficiency values and (iii) the properties satisfied. The path to the frontier is characterised by the objective function and whilst the BAM, RAM and ADD models maximise the sum of the (weighted) slacks, the SBM minimises the product of input and output inefficiencies. However, the BAM, RAM and ADD models apply different weights per slack and, as a result, the path to the Pareto frontier per inefficient DMU may change. For point (ii), the BAM, RAM and SBM models compute scores lying between 0 and 1 such that the relatively efficient DMUs obtain a score of 1. On the other hand, the ADD based models estimate a score of 0 per relatively efficient DMU and the greater the score, the greater is the inefficiency for the rest of the DMUs. For point (iii), we note that the models satisfy different properties. Only the RAM and BAM models are both translation and units invariant (Cooper et al., 1999, 2011). ADD is only translation invariant (Lovell & Pastor, 1995) hence, in order to ensure units invariance, it is necessary to normalise the slacks in the objective function. Finally, following Tone (2001), the SBM is units invariant but not translation invariant. Consequently, if translation invariance is not important, but minimising the path to the frontier is, the SBM would be most relevant model. If translation and units invariance is important, then the RAM model is relevant. If lack of discrimination is an issue, then the BAM model could replace the RAM, however this comes at the expense of individual weight restrictions per DMU.

The SBM proposes a measure of inefficiency based on input excesses and output shortfalls, i.e. the model is non-oriented. The original, fractional, SBM model is presented in Model (3).

Needless to say, the original SBM defines only standard inputs to be minimised and outputs to be maximised. As shown in Tone (2001) the model is units invariant and monotone but not translation invariant. We extend the SBM in order to permit the (constrained) increase in flexible input utilisation and to account for the presence of weak disposable negative externalities, i.e. with the reference technology defined as in

In the objective function of Model (4), we divide the slacks by the ranges described in Eqs. (5), as compared to the value of the original variables utilised in the SBM approach. We note that the ranges are the same as those adopted in the RAM approach. This ensures that in our approach (i) although the flexible inputs could increase, the proportions

Given the ranges defined in (5), only VRS technology is relevant since under constant returns to scale, the slack could be larger than the corresponding variable range value (Cooper et al., 2011). As in model (1),

                         means a decrease (increase) in flexible input utilisation. The negative externalities, ufj
                        , are introduced in the model as weak disposable output and their relative slacks appear in the denominator of the objective function. In Appendix C we present the DEED SBM model including negative externalities as input. As in model (2), we introduce a constraint that limits the increase in input utilisation to a reduction in output production. The discussion about this constraint in Section 2 remains valid for the fractional approach. An increase in flexible input utilisation (

                         leads to a decrease in the estimated level of inefficiency of the DMU. Although Model (4) is a fractional non-linear program, it may be transformed into a linear program as outlined in Tone (2001) and presented in Model (6).

(1.1b)) is only relevant under the assumption of variable returns-to-scale (under constant returns to scale the slack could be larger than the corresponding variable range value – Cooper et al., 2011).

Despite the fact that the BAM demonstrates greater discriminatory power (Cooper et al., 2011), given the nature of this measure, it is not implementable in its original form within the DEED formulation.

In this section, we first analyse a small numerical example in order to highlight the characteristics of the DEED formulation. Specifically, we discuss the impact of flexible inputs, whether constrained or not, and the impact of changing the price vector, as compared to a basic model. In Section 3.2 we present a comparison with the Sueyoshi and Goto (S&G, 2011) model in which power plants across Japan are benchmarked. Moreover, we highlight the S&G model problem of defining inefficient units as a target for other inefficient DMUs. Finally, in Section 3.3 we compare the DEED SBM approach with the modified slack based model (MSBM) presented in Sharp et al. (2007) in which water treatment plants are analysed.

A two input, one desirable output and one undesirable output production technology with 5 DMUs illustrates our model as presented in Table 1
                        . We apply four versions of the DEED model (2) formulation assuming the presence of:

                           
                              (i)
                              Two standard inputs (xS
                                 ) to minimise, a desirable output (yG
                                 ) to maximise and a weak disposable negative externality to minimise (u);

Two flexible inputs (xV
                                 ) constrained by (1.7), a desirable output (yG
                                 ) to maximise and a weak disposable negative externality to minimise (u);

Two flexible inputs (xV
                                 ) unconstrained, a desirable output (yG
                                 ) to maximise and a weak disposable negative externality to minimise (u);

Two flexible inputs (xV
                                 ) constrained by (1.7), a desirable output (yG
                                 ) to maximise and a weak disposable negative externality to minimise (u) given a vector price of (5, 1, 1, 1).

In Table 2
                         we present the relative efficiency estimates obtained from cases (i) to (iv), the reference sets and the slacks for each variable. The scores describe the distance from the efficient frontier such that a DMU obtaining a score equal to 0 is defined as efficient. We note that the higher the score, the greater the level of DMU relative inefficiency. The slacks columns describe the reductions (slack > 0) or the increases (slack < 0) of the relevant variable necessary for a DMU to reach the efficient frontier.

Under the standard DEA assumptions, case (i), all five DMUs are found to be relatively efficient. In all other cases, additional savings are available due to the greater flexibility in the modelling approach and the restricted Pareto frontier. We also note that due to the structure of the DEED framework and the single efficient frontier, all benchmarks draw from the efficient DMU subset which is not always true, for example in the Sueyoshi and Goto (2011) framework and other weight constrained DEA models.

The second point to note is the impact of constraint (1.7) which limits the permissible increases in input consumption. Comparing the unconstrained case (iii) and constrained case (ii), we note that the former chooses larger increases in both inputs than occurs in the latter case. Consequently, case (iii) permits a higher level of potential monetary savings for more DMUs, providing a model with greater power to distinguish between the DMUs. Furthermore, the desirable output increases substantially whilst at the same time reducing the negative externalities. This, of course, assumes that the greater output is desirable and that a market exists for the additional production.

Finally, we observe the impact of prices on the results of the DEED framework. The prices act as weights that, linked with the possibility of increasing input consumption, may change the choice of efficient units as well as the reference set and path to the frontier for relatively inefficient DMUs. By comparing the results of cases (ii) and (iv), in which the price of the first input increases from 1 to 5, the efficient set expands to include DMU E but drops DMU C. It is no longer worthwhile for DMU E to purchase an additional four units of input 1 and reduce input 2 (by two units) in order to produce 13 additional units of the desirable output together with a reduction in the negative externality level of 2 units. On the other hand, DMU C should now reduce consumption of input 1 and increase consumption of input 2 in order to increase output and decrease the negative externality simultaneously. Furthermore, DMU D changes its reference set from DMUs A and C to DMUs A and E, leading to greater total savings. Consequently, if prices are available, the efficiency analysis results may well change substantially.

In this section we compare Model (B.1) with the Sueyoshi and Goto (S&G, 2011) category II model. Model (B.1) is applied for purposes of comparability because the S&G model treats negative externalities as an input to be reduced. We note that this approach assumes a context dependent substitutability between negative externalities and input. The S&G model is presented as follows:

In order to undertake a comparison of the modelling approaches, we apply two versions of the DEED model namely constrained DEED1 and unconstrained DEED2. DEED1 is defined by Eqs. (B.1.1) to (B.1.7) hence limits the maximum sum of the increase in flexible inputs to the decrease in negative externalities. In DEED2, we remove constraint (B.1.7) that constrains any potential increases in the inputs, which is in line with the S&G approach. In order to compare the two methodologies, we apply 
                           
                              R

                         as price vectors, computed according to the S&G model. Thus, the variables considered are weighted equally ensuring comparability between the models, as presented in Table 4
                        . By applying a vector of weights, we compute the efficiency scores following the DEED RAM approach described in Eq. (1.1b), hence the results lie between one and zero.

We note that the very small weights in Table 4 reduce the variability between the results of the two DEED models. In Table 5 we present the results of the three models, namely the S&G category II model, DEED1 and DEED2 models, in columns 4 to 6 respectively. Finally, we present the benchmarks obtained according to the three models per DMU in columns 7 to 9 respectively.

All three models define Tokyo in 2007 and 2008 and Shikoku in 2007 as relatively efficient power companies for this dataset. DEED1 identifies an additional four power companies as relatively efficient (DMUs 8, 10, 14 and 18), whereas DEED2 only identifies DMUs 8 and 10 as relatively efficient. The additional units identified as efficient in DEED1 draw from the constraints that prevent DMUs 14 and 18 from expending greater levels of inputs in order to achieve higher levels of output generation and lower CO2 emissions.

When analysing the benchmarks, we observe that the DEED models overcome the problem with the choice of the reference set present in the S&G model. Specifically, given the coexistence of positive and negative input slacks, inefficient DMUs could be defined as targets for other inefficient DMUs in the S&G framework (e.g. DMU 8 is a benchmark for nine DMUs despite being defined as inefficient in column 4). The S&G model designs different frontiers for each combination of input slacks (namely:

                        ) and then selects the lowest score. Consequently, a DMU may be relatively efficient in some but not all frontiers and could be used as a target for other DMUs even if inefficient in the final score. The DEED framework overcomes this problem by designing a single frontier and defining benchmarks that draw only from the relatively efficient subset.
                     

In Table 6
                         we present the slacks computed per DMU across the three models. For the DEED1 and DEED2 models, a negative input slack represents an increase in the utilisation of the relevant variable, whilst a positive sign describes a necessary reduction in order to reach the efficient frontier. Based on the slacks presented in Table 6, we compute the overall savings potential per model by multiplying the slacks and the values computed in Table 4. The overall savings potential per variable for the nine companies over three years is shown in Table 7.
                     

Recalling that for flexible inputs, a negative (positive) value translates into an increase (decrease) in utilisation, it is interesting to observe that the results of the S&G model increases both of the inputs while the DEED models increase only input 1 while decreasing input 2 utilisation which is the most expensive. This is due to the fact that the S&G model maximises the inefficiency while the DEED model maximises the total savings. Thus, in the S&G model it is possible that in the extreme case, expenditure is higher than achievable gains. For example, the S&G model estimates an inefficiency score of 0.973 for DMU 10 whereas the DEED models define the unit as efficient. By multiplying Table 6 relative slacks by Table 4 weights, it is possible to observe that the suggested weighted increase in inputs is 0.0156 while the weighted gains in outputs are 0.0105 for DMU 10. Consequently, the S&G model proposes an optimal solution such that the increase in input utilisation is greater than the achievable gains in output production. Furthermore, different input mixes are used in the models in order to achieve the optimal result. In particular, the DEED models apply the lowest increase in inputs and achieve the lowest increase in good output production. Given this input combination, the results of the DEED models achieve a greater potential reduction in CO2 production as compared to the results of the S&G model. Differences between the results of the DEED formulations are all ascribed to DMUs 14 and 19 that are deemed relatively efficient in the constrained model (DEED1) and inefficient in the unconstrained version (DEED2). By removing constraint (B.1.7), DEED2 permits the DMUs to slightly increase utilisation of input 2 in order to achieve greater total savings. The DEED2 and S&G models assume the same perspective because neither constrains flexible input utilisation. However, DEED2 performs better than the S&G model by achieving higher overall savings as shown in Table 7.
                     

As in Chen, Cook, Li, and Zhu (2009), we apply the Spearman Rank Correlation test to compare the DMU ranking across the different models. The test shows a significant correlation of 85 percent between S&G and DEED1 and a significant correlation of 87 percent between S&G and DEED2. The DMU rankings are similar for the three models because the main differences in the results are (i) the reference sets and (ii) the changes in the choice of variables to be reduced or increased, i.e. the implementation path to the frontier. As proposed by Simar and Zelenyuk (2006), robust tests could be conducted in order to assess the differences in efficiency score distributions. Nevertheless, our primary aim is to focus on the purely technical differences between S&G and our approach. Thus, we leave the more sophisticated efficiency score comparisons for future research with more extensive datasets.

We note that requiring pre-assigned weights in the objective function creates conflicts with the SBM weights. Input and output slacks are double weighted by endogenous weights (

                        ) and exogenous weights (w and v), where the endogenous weights are per observation whereas exogenous weights are per variable. Hence, the effects of exogenous weights are different between variables and observations leading to issues of interpretation. Moreover, setting negative externalities with negative-in-sign values leads to the following two issues: (i) the productivity and technological meaning of negative data and (ii) the disposability assumptions. For the former point, the MSBM model minimises negative inputs to the lowest value whilst maximising negative outputs (e.g. an input consumption of −5 is better than an input consumption of −1, whilst a negative output production of −1 is preferred to a production of −5). Hence, the variables have to be transformed accordingly and the production possibility set result spans both positive and negative orthants which changes the connotation. At the same time, the interpretation of negative-in-sign variables is not clear (we note the on-going discussion in the literature and some explanation can be found in Sharp et al. and Portela, Thanassoulis, and Simpson (2004)). Furthermore, the discussion on disposability assumptions is missing, which renders the assumption of strong disposability disputable. In the DEED modelling approaches, we suggest that neither positive nor negative externalities need to be negative-in-sign thus avoiding the utilisation of negative orthants and simplifying the technology design. Finally, in our approach the disposability issues are better served by defining the negative externalities either as weak disposable outputs or inputs to be minimised, depending on the context.


                        Table 8
                         presents the data on 13 effluent processing plants presented in Sharp et al. (2007). The data set include two inputs, the cost to operate the plant and the effluent to be recycled which ought to be minimised, and three outputs including sludge and recycled water to be sold as well as carbon dioxide and methane pollutants.

We compare the Sharp et al. model with two DEED SBM approaches presented as follows:

                           
                              (i)
                              For the sake of comparison, we apply the same exogenous weights adopted in the Sharp et al. paper.

We define costs (I1) as a bounded flexible input such that increased costs must be covered by at least the same levels of pollution reduction.

The Sharp et al. method assumes that negative externalities and desirable output are both strongly disposable, which we continue here for purposes of comparability.


                        Table 9
                         presents the relative efficiency estimates of the three models whereby a score of 1 defines a relatively efficient plant. The joint, relative efficient set includes DMUs 3, 7, 8, 11 and 13 across all models. The main difference in efficiency results between Sharp et al. and the DEED approaches draws from the weights adopted (BAM vs RAM). Differences in the efficiency estimates between the DEED models case i and case ii are ascribed to the possibility of increasing the flexible input utilisation in order to achieve higher pollutant reduction. Given the characteristics of the sample analysed (i.e. the small number of observations, the low variable magnitude and the high number of efficient units), the impact of the flexible input on efficiency scores is small and restricted to DMU5. The DMU is able to increase the costs (input 1) in order to achieve a greater reduction in negative externalities. We applied a Spearman Rank Correlation test to analyse the differences in the DMU ranking and find significant correlations of 75 percent between MSBM and both DEED SBM (i) and DEED SBM (ii).

This article proposes a new DEA framework in order to compute efficiency from an eco-environmental point of view. The directional eco-efficiency distance (DEED) is a non-radial measure of efficiency based on additive models that account for the presence of input that can be increased and for the production of positive and negative externalities. Our approach is based on a linear program that benchmarks the DMU with respect to a single technology reference set. In a DEA framework, negative externalities may be introduced either as an input or an output to be minimised. We present DEED approaches which suit both possibilities, highlighting the main differences and the relevant disposability assumptions to consider. Given that cost and price information are not always available and managerial preference for efficiency scores to lie between zero and one, we also adapt the DEED model to suit the slack based, range adjusted and bound adjusted measures of inefficiency. Finally, we demonstrate how the DEED model out-performs similar models published in the literature and how DEED could improve on the existing methodology, such as the slack based measure, whilst preserving the original structure. The DEED model is particularly relevant in cases where pollutants have a market or regulatory value and where costs could be increased, provided the output generates higher profits for example.

Further research could focus on the modelling of the materials balance condition within a DEED framework. The materials balance conditions follow the first law of thermodynamics ensuring that matter cannot disappear. In order to introduce the materials balance condition, the first step would be to satisfy the balance equation (i.e., 
                        
                           u
                           =
                           a
                           x
                           −
                           b
                           y
                        
                     , where u is the pollutant, x the inputs, y the outputs and a (b) are the production (consumption) factors of z). The second step would consist of ensuring that all the unknown materials produced are considered (e.g., oxygen or other gases), which may be obtained, for example, by incorporating a residual term. Finally, if maximising the implementation path to the frontier is problematic, it may be possible to employ the Aparicio, Ruiz, and Sirvent (2007) approach to search for the shortest path to the frontier within the additive context.
