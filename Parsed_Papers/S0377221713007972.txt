                  In this paper we study a firm’s disposition decision for returned end-of-use products, which can either be remanufactured and sold, or dismantled into parts that can be reused. We formulate this problem as a multi-period stochastic dynamic program, and find the structure of the optimal policy, which consists of monotonic switching curves. Specifically, if it is optimal to remanufacture in a given period and for given inventory levels, then it is also optimal to remanufacture when the inventory of part(s) is higher or the inventory of remanufactured product is lower.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper we study a firm’s disposition decision for returned end-of-use products, which can either be remanufactured and sold, or dismantled into parts that can be reused. As an example, consider product recovery activities at IBM. In its remanufacturing facility, IBM remanufactures or dismantles returned servers and storage systems. While remanufactured products are sold at a restricted price to meet demand for used products, parts obtained through dismantling can be used to meet internal or external demand for spare parts (Ferguson, Fleischmann, & Souza, 2011).

Broadly speaking, the problem we study belongs to the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) literature; see Souza (2013) for a general review. In the CLSC literature, there is a significant stream of research on hybrid systems, where there are two supply sources (remanufacturing or buying new) for meeting a single demand stream for an item. In contrast to hybrid systems, our problem has a single supply source (returns) that can be used to meet multiple demand streams, specifically demands for remanufactured products, and for different parts. In other words, there are two disposition options for a return: remanufacturing, and dismantling. Several product disposition decisions are studied in the CLSC literature, including remanufacturing products that are perfect substitutes for new products, remanufacturing products that are imperfect substitutes for new products, dismantling for spare parts, and recycling for materials recovery (Thierry, Salomon, Nunen, & Wassenhove, 1995). Dismantling is different from other disposition options in that it yields multiple items, i.e. several distinct spare parts, each with its own independent demand stream. In the remainder of the literature review, we focus on the subset of the CLSC literature that includes dismantling as a disposition option.

One stream of literature considers dismantling as the single disposition option. Much of this literature assumes that demands for multiple parts, which are obtained through dismantling, are deterministic. These models only consider uncertainty on the supply side; see Krikke, Van Harten, and Schuur (1998), Spengler, Ploog, and Schröter (2003) and Jorjani, Leu, and Scott (2004) for more details. Our research is different in that there are disposition options (remanufacturing and dismantling), and demands for parts are stochastic. Next, we position our work relative to the stream of literature with stochastic demand.

The literature on dismantling with stochastic demand for parts can be categorized along two dimensions: number of periods (single-period vs. multi-period), and number of distinct parts obtained from dismantling (single part vs. multiple parts). In Inderfurth, de Kok, and Flapper (2001), there are multiple disposition options available in a multi-period setting, but each disposition option only generates one type of item with its own independent demand. Thus, one can interpret one of their disposition options as dismantling for a single part (unlike our model where dismantling yields multiple distinct parts). They build a dynamic program that minimizes the total expected discounted cost of product disposition and inventory, and propose a heuristic to allocate scarce returns into the multiple options according to their mean demand. Ferguson et al. (2011) study the profit-optimizing allocation of uncertain returns to two product disposition options, remanufacturing and dismantling, in two settings: (i) single period and multiple parts and (ii) multi-period and a single part. They show that the optimal policy balances the marginal expected profits across the disposition alternatives. In contrast to these two papers, our paper focuses on a multi-period, multi-part setting and contributes to the literature by providing the structure of the optimal disposition decision.

Consider a firm that can recover the value of a used product, or return, through two disposition options: remanufacturing or dismantling for parts. We assume that returns have been pre-graded, and have sufficiently good quality so that both remanufacturing and dismantling operations have perfect yield. The remanufacturing operation costs the firm c
                     
                        R
                      per unit, and results in one remanufactured product that can be sold in a secondary market at price r
                     
                        R
                     . The dismantling operation costs the firm c
                     
                        D
                     , and yields two spare parts, denoted as part 1 and part 2, that are sold separately at unit prices r
                     1 and r
                     2, respectively. Prices are exogenous, as it is common in other tactical decision models. In our context, remanufactured units and dismantled parts are priced relative to their new counterparts; hence the firm has little flexibility regarding price decisions.

The firm keeps the remanufactured products and spare parts in inventory to satisfy demand in a finite planning horizon. We assume that the planning horizon is divided into T periods that are short enough so that the firm gets at most one return per period. Periods are numbered backwards, and we denote t as the number of periods remaining in the planning horizon. The sequence of events in one period is as follows. At the beginning of each period, the firm reviews I
                     
                        R
                     , the inventory level of remanufactured products, and I
                     1, I
                     2, the inventory levels of parts 1 and 2, respectively. With probability λ the firm obtains a return and decides whether to remanufacture it or dismantle it for parts. (With probability (1−
                     λ) there is no return, and no subsequent actions are taken in that period.) After adding the remanufactured product or dismantled parts to its inventories, the firm experiences demand for at most one unit. This demand is for a remanufactured product with probability (w.p.) p
                     
                        R
                     , or for part 1 w.p. p
                     1, or for part 2 w.p. p
                     2. Unmet demand is lost, and leftover inventories of remanufactured products and parts are carried over to the next period.

At the end of the last period, there is a unit salvage value of v
                     
                        R
                     , v
                     1, and v
                     2 for any leftover inventory of the remanufactured product, part 1, and part 2, respectively. We assume that salvage values are large enough to cover the cost of dismantling or remanufacturing, that is, v
                     1
                     +
                     v
                     2
                     ⩾
                     c
                     
                        D
                      and v
                     
                        R
                     
                     ⩾
                     c
                     
                        R
                     .

Given our assumption that salvage values are large enough to cover the disposition cost, the firm in our model has no incentive to scrap a returned product. Practically speaking, scrapping may be warranted when there are large amounts of inventories of remanufactured products and/or parts. To capture this effect, we assume that there are limits on the inventories of the remanufactured product, and of each part. Let S
                     
                        R
                     , S
                     1, and S
                     2 be the maximum inventory of remanufactured product, part 1, and part 2 that the firm can keep. When inventory of an item k reaches its upper limit, the additional item(s) obtained by remanufacturing or dismantling are disposed with unit salvage value v

                     , then the incremental value of having one more unit of remanufactured product over having one more pair of parts is increasing in the inventory of parts, and decreasing in the inventory of remanufactured products. Similarly, the second and third properties indicate that the incremental value of one remanufactured product over either part is increasing in the inventory of the part, and decreasing in the inventory of remanufactured products. One would expect the value functions f

According to Corollary 1, the value functions f
                     
                        t
                     (·) belong to the set V
                     
                        Conc
                     . It follows that the marginal value of a remanufactured product or a part is decreasing in its own inventory, which is intuitive. In addition, the value functions f
                     
                        t
                     (·) belong to the set V
                     
                        RD
                     , as we expected. Hence, it follows that the incremental value of one remanufactured product over a part or a pair of parts is higher when there are fewer remanufactured products or more parts in inventory.

In addition to these intuitive properties, Lemma 1 also reveals interesting relationships among remanufactured products and parts, namely that f
                     
                        t
                     (·)∈
                     V
                     
                        Sup/Sub
                     , which we explain as follows. In our model, the inventory of remanufactured products compete with the inventories of parts for a common resource, namely the returns. When the inventory of a part, say, part 2, is high, this competition favors remanufacturing over dismantling the returned product. Consequently, when the inventory of part 2 is high, we are less likely to add to the inventory of part 1, which increases the marginal value of part 1’s inventory. Thus, having more of part 2 increases the value of part 1, that is, parts 1 and 2 are “complements” in the economic sense. This is captured mathematically by the property that f
                     
                        t
                     (I
                     1,
                     I
                     2,
                     I
                     
                        R
                     ) is supermodular in I
                     1 and I
                     2. Following the same logic, having more of the remanufactured product decreases the value of a particular part, say part 1. Hence, the remanufactured product and a particular part are “substitutes” in the economic sense. This corresponds to the property that f
                     
                        t
                     (I

                     The first line on the right-hand side (RHS) of (3) corresponds to the firm’s profit-to-go minus remanufacturing cost if the firm remanufactures. The second and third lines on the RHS of (3) corresponds to the firm’s profit-to-go minus dismantling cost if the firm dismantles. It follows that if Δg

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have provided the structure of the profit-maximizing disposition decisions (remanufacture or dismantle for parts) for an end-of-use returned product, when demands for the remanufactured products, and the two distinct parts originating from dismantling are stochastic. For ease of exposition, we have considered the case of two distinct parts, however, a similar structure is likely to be optimal in the case of more than two distinct parts originating from dismantling.

One can study further extensions, which might alter the optimal decisions in non-trivial ways. In particular, one could consider additional actions the firm could take when a product is returned such as immediately scrapping the product (without incurring any cost or collecting any revenue) or storing the returned product in inventory for future use. In our model, scrapping is never optimal because the salvage values of remanufactured products and dismantled parts are higher than the remanufacturing and dismantling costs, respectively. This assumption is realistic for many scenarios. For example, Ferguson et al. (2011) indicate that, for IBM, the salvage value of a remanufactured product is approximately equal to the remanufacturing cost. Also, our experience with engine remanufacturing at Volkswagen indicates that the salvage value of a remanufactured engine is higher than the remanufacturing cost (Momberg, 2010). However, there might be situations where the salvage values are low enough that scrapping a return is optimal. In this setting where the optimal disposition decision can now be one of three alternatives (scrap, remanufacture or dismantle), the problem is significantly more difficult and the structure of the optimal policy eludes us. Likewise, if the firm had the ability to store returned products, the firm might want to take advantage of this ability to wait and see how the demand unfolds. In that case, the state space would now include the inventory of returned products, thus making the optimal policy significantly more complex.
