                  Many biological processes depend on protein-based interactions, which are governed by central regions with higher binding affinities, the hot-spots. The O-ring theory or the “Water Exclusion” hypothesis states that the more deeply buried central regions are surrounded by areas, the null-spots, whose role would be to shelter the hot-spots from the bulk solvent. Although this theory is well-established for protein–protein interfaces, its applicability to other protein interfaces remains unclear. Our goal was to verify its applicability to protein–DNA interfaces. We performed Molecular Dynamics simulations in explicit solvent of several protein–DNA complexes and measured a variety of solvent accessible surface area (SASA) features, as well as, radial distribution functions of hot-spots and null-spots. Our aim was to test the influence of water in their coordination sphere. Our results show that hot-spots tend to have fewer water molecules in their neighborhood when compared to null-spots, and higher values of ΔSASA, which confirms their occlusion from solvent. This study provides evidence in support of the O-ring theory with its applicability to a new type of protein-based interface: protein–DNA.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Nature consists of a big number of biological systems, in the micro and macro scales, which interactions are the basis of endless processes. Proteins are one of its fundamental elements, acting as catalysts, carriers, providing mechanical support and immune protection, transmitting nerve impulses among others (Chothia and Janin, 1975; Janin, 1995; Jones and Thornton, 1996). The vast majority of proteins tend to bind and associate with other macromolecules, forming stable complexes that are the basis of many cellular functions. To that purpose protein–protein interactions (PPI), protein–DNA interactions (PDI) or protein–ligand interactions (PLI) are essential. The protein binding interface is composed of two large macromolecular surfaces that generally show good geometric and chemical complementary, and are governed by central regions with high binding affinities, the hot-spots (HS) (Clackson et al., 1998; DeLano, 2002; DeLano et al., 2000). HS, which are considered the most important residues for complex formation and for its stability, are defined as residues that upon alanine mutation generate a binding free energy difference (ΔΔG
                     binding) higher than 2.0kcal/mol; residues that cause a binding free energy difference lower than 2.0kcal/mol were defined as null-spots (NS) (Moreira et al., 2007c; Thorn and Bogan, 2001). The characterization of protein-binding interfaces has been achieved through computational techniques, mainly Alanine-Scanning Mutagenesis (Clackson et al., 1998; DeLano, 2002; DeLano et al., 2000; Huo et al., 2002; Massova and Kollman, 1999; Moreira et al., 2006a,b, 2007a). It was proposed by Guharoy, Chakrabarti and co-workers that the interface could be separated in two different regions: a core and a rim. The rim is formed of residues that have only partial accessibility to the solvent, similar to the protein's surface, having few HS; on the other hand, the core is formed by residues deeply buried in the interface and with a composition distinct from the rest of the protein surface, having a large number of HS. Moreover, they proposed a direct relation between the buried surface area of core residues and the contribution to the binding free energy (Bahadur et al., 2003; Chakrabarti and Janin, 2002; Guharoy and Chakrabarti, 2005). Effectively, years before, Bogan and Thorn proposed a similar theory in which HS would be surrounded by regions with higher packing density, more deeply buried. This leads to solvent exclusion around them and results in a lower local dielectric constant environment and enhancement of specific electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions. This region would be surrounded by another one formed by NS, whose role would be to shelter the HS from bulk solvent. This theory became known as the “O-ring theory” (since it resembled an O-ring) or the “Water Exclusion” hypothesis (Bogan and Thorn, 1998). This subject was later explored by many authors such as Li et al. that proposed a “double water exclusion” theory in which they accepted the existence of a ring surrounding the HS protecting them from the solvent, but stated that this ring of residues was itself water free (Li and Liu, 2009); and many others (Kosloff et al., 2011; Moreira et al., 2007b; Rajamani et al., 2004).

Nowadays it is generally accepted that water plays a crucial role in the protein interface due to its interaction with the energetically important residues, and that the O-ring theory is a well-established theory. But one could argue about the applicability of the O-ring theory to other interfaces, protein on non-protein related, since it was, to the best of our knowledge, only applied for protein–protein interfaces. The protein–DNA interface, for example, has as much biological interest as the protein–protein. However, the information regarding experimentally detected HS in protein–DNA complexes or the application of the alanine scanning mutagenesis method to this type of interface is still scarce. It probably occurs due to the difficulties in energetic characterizing of this type of system as it possesses a highly charged character. Regardless, it was observed the same organization of HS in the central region of the interface but with a different composition. For protein–DNA interfaces there is a higher occurrence of positively charged residues (Arginine and Lysine), as well as, a lower occurrence of hydrophobic and negatively charged residues (Ahmad et al., 2008). With this in mind, and to test the applicability of the O-ring theory to protein–DNA interfaces, we subjected ten different protein–DNA complexes to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent and measured different solvent accessible surface area (SASA) features for a set of HS and NS. Additionally we measured the radial distribution function of water to test its influence in the coordination sphere of those residues. This work enabled us to extend the applicability of the O-ring theory to protein–DNA interfaces.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

The PRONIT (Kumar et al., 2006; Prabakaran et al., 2001) database was used to select the protein–DNA complexes with a known X-ray structure, as well as, a meaningful number of alanine mutations and their corresponding ΔΔG
                        binding values. Ten different complexes (Fig. 1
                        ) for a total of 112 residues were studied in this work: (i) the Nuclear Protein EBNA1 and DNA (PDBID: 1B3T (Bochkarev et al., 1998)); (ii) the Gene-regulating protein arc and DNA (PDBID: 1BDT (Schildbach et al., 1999)); (iii) the C-Myb DNA-Binding Domain and DNA (PDBID: 1MSE (Ogata et al., 1994)); (iv) the High-Mobility Group Protein D and DNA (PDBID: 1QRV (Murphy et al., 1999)) complexes; (v) the complex between the MCM1 Transcriptional Regulator and MAT Alpha-2 Transcriptional Repressor and DNA (PDBID: 1MNM (Tan and Richmond, 1998)); (vi) the Pot1 protein and DNA (PDBID: 1QZH (Lei et al., 2003)); (vii) the TraI protein and DNA (PDBID: 2A0I (Larkin et al., 2005)); (viii) the nonhistone chromosomal protein and DNA (PDBID: 1J5N (Masse et al., 2002)); (ix) the human replication protein A and DNA (PDBID: 1JMC (Bochkarev et al., 1997)); and (x) the N-terminal domain of the Tn916 integrase protein bound to its DNA-binding site (PDBID: 1TN9 (Wojciak et al., 1999)). These comprises a group of DNA-binding proteins with different classes and motifs, such as the transcription factor alpha/beta (1MNM, 1TN9); transcription factor ribbon/helix/helix (1BDT); transcription factor (1JMC); transcription factor alpha helix (1QRV, 1J5N); supporting proteins (1MSE, 1B3T, 1QZH); and enzyme (2AOI). The protonation state of the different residues of the various proteins was determined using the PROPKA methodology (Bas et al., 2008; Li et al., 2005; Olsson et al., 2011).

Two types of force-fields are mainly used for the simulations of DNA based systems: CHARMM (Brooks et al., 1983) and AMBER (Case et al., 2006). Both treat protein, DNA, RNA and modified nucleic acids (Pérez et al., 2011). The AMBER force field was used efficiently in the past to calculate the thermodynamics of the binding of 40 protein–DNA systems (Jayaram et al., 2002), key feature for our work. Therefore, AMBER9 (Case et al., 2006) package with the AMBER force field ff99SB (Hornak et al., 2006) and an explicit solvent representation was used to perform the various MD simulations. Table 1
                         summarizes the composition of the systems under study. The explicit solvent simulations were used to study the dynamical behavior and interactions of the residues with water, which is the best approximation of the real medium as these are highly charged and polar interfaces. Each system was solvated with a box of TIP3P water molecules that extended 10Å from any edge of the box to the protein atoms (Jorgensen et al., 1983) and an appropriate amount of counter ions was used to neutralize the system. A minimization was performed prior to the production stage to remove any possible bad contacts, by steepest descent followed by conjugated gradient. Periodic boundary conditions were applied using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method (Darden et al., 1993) to treat long-range electrostatic interactions and the non-bonded interactions were truncated with a 10-Å cutoff. The systems were subjected to 2ns of heating procedure, gradually raised from 0 to 300K (NVT ensemble), followed by 8ns of production stage in NPT ensemble. The Langevin (Izaguirre et al., 2001; Loncharich et al., 1992) algorithm was used to regulate the temperature of the system, the bond lengths involving hydrogens were constrained using SHAKE (Ryckaert et al., 1977) and the equations of motion were integrated with a 2-fs time step.

@&#ANALYSIS@&#

RMSDs (root mean square deviations) were calculated for each of the systems, considering separately the protein and the DNA contribution, to assure their equilibration throughout the MD simulation. All 10 complexes were stable throughout the MD simulation with variations lower than 1Å. The different SASA and radial distribution function (RDF) calculations were carried out mainly with VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996) and the PTRAJ module from the AMBER9 package. SASA, as defined by Lee and Richards, is the area of the surface traced by the center of a probe sphere, whose radius is the nominal radius of the solvent, as it rolls over the van der Waals surface of the molecule (Lee and Richards, 1971). We measured SASA for the complex (SASAcpx) and the monomer (SASAmon). We have also calculated ΔSASA (1) and relSASA (2). It is important to distinguish between ΔSASA and relSASA, because relSASA allows the differentiation of residues with equal ΔSASA but different solvent exposure such as, i.e., a residue with a 50Å2 solvent accessibility in the monomer and 0Å2 in the complex from a residue that has a value of 150Å2 solvent accessibility in the monomer and 100Å2 in the complex. In both cases ΔSASA is 50Å2 but solvent accessibility importance is strikingly different between the two.

For all the residues analyzed in this work we have also measured their respective RDF, g(r), profile as well as the average number of waters within a given distance. G(r) gives the probability of finding an atom within a spherical shell of thickness Δr and central distance r from another atom, compared to the probability that is expected on a distribution of the same density in bulk solvent. It was calculated by compiling a histogram with a spacing of Δr
                        =0.02 and a range of 8Å. Occupancy of waters in the first coordination shell was calculated using the python language in tailor-made scripts, which take advantage of the ptraj module of the amber package. Geometric criteria (distances between heavy atoms=3, 4, 5 or 6Å) were adopted to define these contacts.

RDFs and SASA features’ calculations were also performed for two different sets of residues around the HS: (i) residues within the first 4Å; and (ii) residues between the first 4 and 8Å of the available HS. If a known HS was within this definition, it was not considered for the various calculations.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The X-ray crystallographic structures of complexes available at the RCSB Protein Data Bank, as well as the tridimensional structures that are the basis of the initial knowledge for this work are static and do not show the conformational changes that occur in the system over time. The correct comprehension of the phenomena that occurs within the protein–DNA interface such as the structural adaptability and the right binding mode can benefit greatly from the use of computational methods capable of generating information based, not on a single structure, but on an ensemble of conformations generated by MD simulations. It also makes possible to understand the structural and functional role of water around HS and NS, since the great majority of biological processes occur in an aqueous medium. Our dataset consists of 10 protein–DNA complexes that were previously described in the methodological section and a total of 112 interfacial residues (Table 2
                     ). They have the following distribution by amino acid, group type and their hot and null-spot character: Glu (7%), Phe (4%), His (3%), Ile (4%), Lys (20%), Leu (4%), Met (4%), Asn (5%), Gln (4%), Arg (17%), Ser (10%), Thr (5%), Val (4%) and Tyr (4%); 50% are charged residues, 29% polar and 21% nonpolar; 28% are HS and 72% NS. We have a predominance of charged residues, especially positively charged amino acids such as Lys and Arg, which is consistent with previous studies within protein–DNA interfaces that characterize them as highly charged interfaces (Ahmad et al., 2008).

The measure of the RDF profile of residues is a common procedure when dealing with a system formed with explicit solvent, since it allows the characterization of the interaction between the solute and the solvent molecules. Usually, a water RDF profile exhibits an oscillatory profile and a peak due to the presence of hydrogen bonds. We measured the RDFs for the 112 residues in our dataset. Fig. 2
                      shows two different RDF profiles that represent a HS and a NS. As it can be easily perceived, the exhibit behavior is quite different between the two. In Fig. 2b the peak located about 3Å is due to the strong interaction between the hydrogen atoms of water and the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group of the NS. Some other peaks can be perceived in the remaining plot, which are less defined, due to the interaction between the water molecules and the atoms of the amino acid residue, with the exception of hydrogen. On the other hand, as can be seen in plot (a) of Fig. 2, the peaks are less defined when we are dealing with a putative HS. Plots (c) and (d) show the average number of water molecules around the HS and the NS, which are clearly distinct. We also measured the average number of water molecules around each residue, using distance cutoff values of 3, 4, 5 and 6Å. Table 3
                      summarizes the results for each of the complexes under study and Table 4
                      the global results in terms of HS and NS. These results were plotted in a graphic and shown in Fig. 3
                      for a simpler analysis. It is perceptible that the average number of water molecules around HS is notoriously lower when compared to NS. This difference for a cuttof value of 3Å is not significant, but as we increase the cutoff value for 4, 5 and 6Å the difference increases. As some individual systems do not possess both HS and NS (due to the difficulties in finding experimental binding free energy values upon alanine mutation for these protein–DNA complexes) we also present global results for HS and NS, which allows a better understanding of the phenomenon of occlusion. For a NS, and at a 5Å distance, there are an average of 7 water molecules around it; instead for an HS, the average number of water molecules decreases to 5. The average number of water molecules around a HS and a NS varies from 0.70 to 7.92 and 1.13 to 12.64, respectively. At shorter distances both HS and NS present an average number of water molecules relatively small, with less than 2 water molecules, which gradually increases with the distance. As we have previously stated, the interface is generally distinguished in a core and a rim, and the HS are usually at the core. With this in mind, and for every HS in our dataset, we selected the residues within 4Å and between 4 and 8Å distances of our HS and calculated the average number of water molecules for each of these coordination spheres. In theory this would give us an idea of the environment surrounding each HS and act as a complement to the core and rim definition of the interface. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 4
                     . This figure lists for all the 31 HS, the average number of waters for the HS itself (brown), for the residues inside the first coordination sphere (orange) and for the residues inside the second coordination sphere (green). It should be noted that in this figure the stacked vertical bars offer for each HS the given percentage over the three analyzed data (HS, 4Å sphere and between 4 and 8Å sphere). As expected, for the majority of the analyzed HS the average number of water molecules within the first coordination sphere is lower than in the second. The residues that closely surround the HS, and belong to the core, are more buried and have less accessibility to the solvent. On the other hand when we advance to the next coordination sphere, which can be related to the rim region, we find more residues with higher solvent accessibility that account for the difference obtained. Nevertheless, some of the residues within the two solvation spheres seem to present a different behavior. We cannot exclude that may be influenced by the existence of a HS within those spheres. As mentioned in the methodological part, the known HS were excluded but ΔΔG
                     binding values were not available for all the residues of the analyzed interfaces.

The results we obtained, based on MD simulations of protein–DNA systems, clearly show that the average number of water molecules around a HS is much lower when compared to NS. This is in agreement with the O-ring theory and the fact that the HS are generally protected from the solvent. We also measured different SASA features for the complex and the monomers to complement the study as it allows a more profound characterization of the importance of the water molecules in the micro ambient of the HS and NS. ΔSASA and relSASA, that were previously described, were also measured. The results we obtained are summarized in Table 5
                      and Fig. 5
                     . Our results follow the tendency observed for PPI and indicate that a high value of ΔSASA and relSASA is a necessary condition for a residue to be considered a HS. However, these features are insufficient to make a clear distinction between HS and NS, as some NS also present a high value of ΔSASA. The type of amino acid plays a crucial role in the definition of the interface, so we have also opted to analyze the results according to the type of residue: charged (Asp, Glu, His, Lys e Arg), polar (Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln e Tyr), nonpolar (Val, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe e Trp) and aromatic (Phe, Trp, Tyr e His). Fig. 5 illustrates the different ΔSASA and relSASA values achieved for HS and NS. The difference between the two sets of residues is notorious, and for all the 112 residues analyzed we have obtained values of 35.03±4.31Å2 (ΔSASA) and 0.54±0.05 (relSASA) for the HS and 26.57±4.83Å2 (ΔSASA) and 0.30±0.05 (relSASA) for NS. An exception can be found for the nonpolar residues, which contribution is higher for the NS. This statistical result is influenced by the small number of nonpolar residues that act as HS, when compared to the number of NS. However, it should be noted that the average ΔSASA value for the nonpolar NS (31.08±4.92Å2) is within the expected value of a typical HS, which indicates that the nonpolar residues have low accessibility to solvent. Charged, polar and aromatic residues show a clear difference between HS and NS, with HS having higher ΔSASA and relSASA. We have to highlight that for charged, aromatic and polar residues the difference between HS and NS is significant, especially for relSASA in which the difference between HS and NS for charged and polar residues is more than the double. We took a similar approach as described to the RDF calculations. We have also measured the SASA characteristics of the residues inside the 4Å and between 4and 8Å spheres around the HS residues, and compared the results with the HS by themselves. The results were plotted in Fig. 6
                      (ΔSASA) and Fig. 7
                      (relSASA). Both plots, especially Fig. 7, show a similar and expected trend. The HS have the higher value of relSASA (or ΔSASA). As we advance for the first coordination sphere more residues are found with higher accessibility to solvent, and therefore there is a decrease in relSASA. It is more notorious when we considered the second coordination sphere that is formed almost by NS and residues with high solvent accessibility. Globally, we obtained on average 32.77±4.04Å2, 13.32±2.25Å2 and 12.67±2.00Å2 for ΔSASA on the HS itself, first coordination sphere and second coordination sphere, respectively; 0.54±0.05, 0.28±0.04 and 0.21±0.03 for relSASA on the HS, first and second coordination spheres, respectively. Together with the RDF calculations, the SASA features seem to confirm that the O-ring theory is applicable to protein–DNA interfaces. Nevertheless, we have to stress out that our dataset is composed of ten complexes, with a known X-ray structure that fulfills the conditions mentioned in the methodological part. As long as new experimental data becomes available the study should be extended. Enough experimental data could also allow the differentiation between the different types of protein–DNA interface: enzyme, transcription factor and supporting proteins.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the last years there has been an effort to understand the processes that govern the formation of biological complexes and the interactions that are behind them. The binding of proteins with other proteins, ligands or nucleic acids constitutes one of these processes that recently have been computational studied. For PPI it was proposed that only a small fraction of residues contribute significantly to the binding free energy – the hot-spots – which are protected from solvent molecules by null-spots. This theory later known as the O-ring theory also states that for a residue to be considered a HS it should have a low value of SASA. The O-ring theory has been the central aspect of a number of scientific papers, but the studies were mostly performed in PP complexes, and its study with other types of interfaces such as the PDI is missing. By measuring the average SASA features of the 112 residues of ten distinct protein–DNA complexes it was possible to obtain a clear perspective of the behavior of HS and NS. Radial distribution functions were also measured and helped to clearly distinguish between the two types of residues. Our results show that the HS tend to have fewer water molecules in their micro ambient and a higher value of ΔSASA. So, they are occluded from the solvent by the NS, which ones have more water molecules in their neighborhood.

In this work we were able to extend the applicability of the O-ring theory to protein–DNA complexes, since it was initially formulated in protein–protein complexes. We present evidence that the HS are indeed occluded from bulk solvent. Together with the previous works developed in protein–protein interfaces, it validates the O-ring theory.
