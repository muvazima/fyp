                  The performance of space–time adaptive processing (STAP) radar degrades dramatically when the target occurs in the training data. Traditional robust linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) STAP method uses magnitude constraint to maintain the mainlobe of the STAP beamformer. In this paper, a joint magnitude and phase constrained (MPC) STAP method is proposed with the phase constraint incorporated in the response vector of the beamformer. The explicit expression of the phase constraint is derived by exploring the conjugate symmetric characteristic of the adaptive weights. With joint magnitude and phase constraints imposed on several discrete points in the mainlobe region, the MPC-STAP approach has good robustness against target contamination. In addition, the linear-phase response can be guaranteed by the proposed method, which provides distortionless response in both spatial and temporal domains. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Moving target indication (MTI) with airborne radar systems is an important operational mode in providing continuous surveillance of both aircraft and ground moving targets. Space–time adaptive processing (STAP) method could suppress the ground clutter and interference by combining the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom (DOFs), which has tremendous potential for improving the detection performance of airborne radar systems [1].

In conventional STAP radar, the covariance matrix of clutter and interference is usually estimated with the training data collected from ranges adjacent to the range under test. It is usually assumed that the training data satisfies the identical independent distribution (IID) condition. Under this condition, the amount of training data required for proper estimation of the covariance matrix is between 2 and 5 times the number of DOFs of the processor [2]. This is particularly challenging for STAP radar with its DOFs equal to NK (N is element number and K is pulse number), especially in nonstationary or nonhomogeneous environments [3]. To maintain the performance of STAP radar with limited sample supports, some suboptimal STAP approaches have been proposed, such as [1,4,5]. Additionally, the performance degradation of STAP radar in practice may also be caused by the range dependence of clutter. In this situation, many effective clutter compensation techniques have been presented to mitigate range-dependent clutter [6–10]. However, none of these suboptimal STAP methods and clutter compensation techniques could overcome the performance loss due to the presence of target signal in the training data. In this case, the performance of STAP radar degrades severely [11,12].

The training data corrupted by target signal, referred to as target contamination, increases the nonstationary of the clutter since the range resolution of the radar systems becomes higher [12]. Meanwhile, the need of multiple ranges to estimate the clutter covariance matrix might also cause inter-target contamination effects. This might occur when multiple close targets are presented in the received data. Since the covariance matrix is obtained by using an unsupervised training method, this will cause the covariance matrix error and the resultant performance degradation. Errors increase the influence of target contamination and/or inter-target contamination, resulting in further performance degradation of STAP radar. Generally, there are two kinds of errors. One is the covariance matrix error which is caused by small sample support of the training data whereas the other is the target steering vector error which is induced by the uncertainty of target parameter including the direction-of-arrival and Doppler frequency mismatches, imperfect array calibration error and distorted antenna shape and so on. In practice, the assumption of a rough knowledge of target parameters is reasonable, especially in target tracking situations.

To overcome the performance degradation due to covariance error and steering vector error, a diagonal loading technique has been addressed in [13–15]. However, it is not clear how to choose the optimal diagonal loading factor. The target self-whitening is considered in [16–18] with a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming method proposed to mitigate the signal cancellation effect. A two-point quadratically constrained beamforming approach [19] robust against DOA mismatch is proposed, which can be viewed as an LCMV processor with response vector further optimized. The phase of the response vector is optimally determined in [19]. However, it is only suitable for the two-point constrained beamforming. Recently, several robust methods with clear theoretical background have been proposed [20,21], whose diagonal loading factor can be analytically determined. The designed processors are robust against target contamination and arbitrary steering vector errors. The magnitude constrained approach which is robust against a large steering direction is derived in [22] where the magnitude response is constrained within the lower and upper bounds. It can generate an approximately flat magnitude response in the mainlobe of the beampattern, which is suitable in adaptive digital beamforming. In [22], the array output power and magnitude response are transformed into linear functions of the autocorrelation sequence of the array weight. In order to calculate the solution, a semidefinite programming based method is proposed in [23] and an iteratively robust beamforming method is presented in [24]. In [25], a phase response constrained robust beamforming method is proposed, which generates flat magnitude response and linear-phase response in the mainlobe region. It has been pointed in [26,27] that the performance of beamformer can be improved by exploiting the conjugate symmetric characteristic of the weights. To alleviate the target contamination problem in STAP radar, a robust direct data domain (DDD) approach is proposed based on worst-case optimization in [28]. This method could sufficiently improve the target detection performance. In [29], the target contamination problem is addressed based on the iterative adaptive approach by utilizing a small number of training data adjacent to the range bin under test.

In STAP radar, the target detection performance suffers degradation when only magnitude constraint is adopted. In this paper, a novel joint magnitude and phase constrained (MPC) STAP approach is proposed, where both magnitude and phase constraints are imposed on several points around the mainlobe of STAP radar. By incorporating the phase constraint in designing the STAP beamformer, the performance is improved and the robustness against target contamination is enhanced. By exploring the conjugate symmetric characteristic of the adaptive weights, the explicit expression of the phase constraint is derived, which guarantees the distortionless response of STAP radar in both spatial and temporal domains. Besides, the magnitude constraint is determined based on the criterion that the mainlobe of STAP radar approaches that of the non-adaptive processor.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the signal model is presented and the magnitude constrained STAP method is formulated. In Section 3, the novel MPC-STAP method is proposed with explicit expression of the phase constraint derived. The linear-phase response property and the robustness against target contamination are studied. In Section 4, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The conclusions are given in Section 5.

                      being the received snapshot consisting of target, clutter and Gaussian noise. Generally, the range under test together with several adjacent ranges (known as “guard ranges”) is excluded. However, with the increase of range resolution, a target will expand into several range bins. Thus, the training support may be corrupted by the target. The traditional MVDR STAP method is sensitive to target contamination which causes target self-whitening. Moreover, the moving targets in other range bins may have similar angles and Doppler frequencies with the desired target, which will cause inter-target contamination effect.

To enhance the robustness of the STAP radar, the LCMV beamformer [16] addresses uncertainty in the mainlobe response by using a set of unity-gain constraints in a small spread of angles and Doppler frequencies. The LCMV-STAP beamformer can be expressed as

Actually, the phase of g is mismatched with the optimal space–time processor, which causes distorted response of the mainlobe in the STAP beamformer. In [22–24], magnitude constraint is considered to obtain flat magnitude response of the mainlobe, that is,

In this section, we propose a novel MPC-STAP method to maintain the mainlobe of the STAP radar. In contrast with the traditional LCMV-STAP method, we exploit the complex-valued response vector and mean to generate distortionless output in both spatial and temporal domains.

In order to approach the response of the non-adaptive processor in the region of interest, we adopt a sufficient approximation technique by choosing a set of uniformly-spaced discrete points in angle-Doppler plane. By incorporating the phase constraint in the response vector, we reconsider the STAP beamformer as

                      where the superscript asterisk indicates complex conjugate. The STAP response is desired to be distortionless in both spatial and temporal domains. The distortionless response is of critical importance in interferometric phase estimation and angle and Doppler estimation. Although there are many works developed concerning the magnitude constraint [16–19,22–24], the phase constraint is left unconsidered. In the following, we present the explicit expression of the phase constraint in order to implement distortionless response in the mainlobe. Moreover, the robustness against target contamination of the MPC-STAP approach is justified.

As we know, the frequency response of a length-N finite impulse response (FIR) filter is a linear function of the frequency when we consider the FIR filter with symmetric impulse response [30,31]. In STAP radar, when the adaptive weight is conjugated symmetric, the response of the STAP beamformer is a linear function of angle and Doppler frequency. Thus, in order to obtain linear-phase response, additional constraints should be imposed on the adaptive weights, that is,

In [26,27], this conjugate symmetric constraint is utilized to improve the performance and computation efficiency. In this work, we transform the conjugate symmetric constraints into the desired phase constraint of the response vector. Without loss of generality, we choose the first element and first pulse as reference. Thus, we obtain

                         Equation (20) is the explicit expression of the phase constraint in the response vector u in order to obtain linear-phase response with respect to angle and Doppler frequency. In other words, if the phase of response vector u is chosen as (20), the conjugate symmetric weight constraint can always be satisfied. Thus, the linear-phase response of the STAP radar can be guaranteed. Comparing the proposed MPC-STAP beamformer using phase constraint as (20) with the beamformer in (10), we can see that the proposed approach uses fewer DOFs. The number of constraints in (10) is

                         while the number of constraints in the proposed approach is reduced to PQ. By incorporating and properly settling the phase constraint, the STAP beamformer can provide distortionless response in both spatial and temporal domains.

The linear-phase response in separated domain is required in some scenarios, which can be obtained by using the aforementioned method in spatial or temporal domain. Here, we take the case in temporal domain as an example. The problem can be expressed as

By incorporating the phase constraint, the MPC-STAP approach can provide good robustness against target contamination. The SCNR loss factor is commonly used to assess the detection performance of STAP radar. It is defined as the ratio of clutter-limited output SCNR to the noise-limited output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR):

                         Recalling the Rayleigh quotient [32], we know that

In this subsection, a set of experiments is carried out and the target signal occurs in the training data. The maximum unambiguous velocity of the target in this example is 120 m/s. There will be a series of temporal steering vectors assumed to cover the whole Doppler range. In this example, the number of Doppler cells is 24 and the velocity corresponding to each Doppler cell is

                        ) and 90° (looking angle), respectively, while the actual target is from 92° and its radial velocity equals 32 m/s. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 20 dB and the snapshot number is 200. Other parameters can be found in Table 1.


                        Fig. 2
                         shows the magnitude response of the STAP radar in spatial and temporal domains. The pentagrams in these figures denote the position of the actual target. As the training data is corrupted by the target signal, the target is treated as interference by the traditional MVDR-STAP processor, which causes target self-whitening. The traditional LCMV-STAP method is robust against target contamination by imposing several magnitude constraints around the assumed point in angle-Doppler plane. As analyzed in Section 3, nine constraint points have been used in the mainlobe region. However, it is seen that the sidelobe of LCMV-STAP method is high, which would cause performance degradation. Besides, the LCMV-STAP method would induce high noise output and be susceptible to unknown interference due to high sidelobe [33]. Fig. 2(c) plots the magnitude response of the robust STAP method based on magnitude constraint in [22]. It is seen that the method in [22] is not suitable for STAP radar. The clutter cannot be sufficiently suppressed and the performance of STAP radar suffers. By using joint magnitude and phase constraints in the mainlobe, the magnitude response of the proposed MPC-STAP method is almost impervious to target as shown in Fig. 2(d). Therefore, the target-whitening effect is avoided and the performance degradation can be mitigated.

The phase responses in spatial and temporal domains of the MVDR-STAP method, traditional LCMV-STAP method, magnitude constrained method in [22] and proposed MPC-STAP method are plotted in Fig. 3
                        . The corresponding phase responses in separated spatial or temporal domain around the mainlobe of these methods are depicted in Fig. 4
                        . Because of the target self-whitening effect of the MVDR-STAP method, its linear region in the mainlobe is reduced. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 4, the linear-phase response of the MVDR-STAP method in spatial domain is severely destroyed. The phase response of the traditional LCMV-STAP is shown in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 4. It is seen that the phase response is nearly flat around the mainlobe, which destroys the distortionless response of the mainlobe. For the magnitude constrained STAP method as shown in Fig. 3(c), the linear-phase response cannot be guaranteed. In contrast, the linear-phase response of the proposed MPC-STAP method in spatial and temporal domains is well maintained, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 4. As mentioned in Section 3, the adaptive weights of the proposed method are complex symmetric, which guarantees the linear-phase response.


                        Fig. 5
                         shows the SCNR loss versus the input SNR. In low SNR region, the target signal is buried in noise and it cannot cause target self-whitening even when it occurs in the training data. In this case, the performance of MVDR-STAP method is perfectly maintained. However, with the increase of SNR, the performance of MVDR-STAP method degrades gradually. The reason is that the MVDR-STAP method misinterprets the target as interference and tries to suppress it. In contrast, the proposed MPC-STAP method can effectively overcome the target self-whitening problem. In low SNR region, the performance of the proposed method is slightly lower (about 3 dB lower than that of MVDR-STAP method), which is induced by the DOFs consumption due to multiple constraints. In high SNR region, the MPC-STAP method is robust against the target contamination and outperforms the MVDR-STAP method. As a comparison, the empirical results of the traditional LCMV-STAP method, magnitude constrained STAP method and worst-case STAP method are provided. As the phase constraint is unconsidered in the traditional LCMV-STAP method, its performance degrades substantially though the SCNR loss is approximately invariant with the input SNR. Moreover, the magnitude constrained STAP method cannot suppress the clutter effectively and suffers severe performance degradation.

As mentioned earlier, the Doppler range is divided into 24 segments and each segment covers 
                           
                              1

                         of the total unambiguous velocity. Similarly, the spatial frequency can also be divided into 24 segments and the beam is discretely steered to each corresponding direction. Fig. 6
                         gives the SCNR loss performance comparison of the traditional MVDR-STAP, the LCMV-STAP, the MPC-STAP, the worst-case optimization based STAP methods [21]. The SCNR loss curves are shown with either temporal steering vector error (Figs. 6(a) and (c)) or spatial steering vector error (Figs. 6(b) and (d)). For Figs. 6(a) and (b), we fix the input SNR at 20 dB and vary the velocity and angle errors. The velocity error is between 
                           −
                           5
                           
                           m/s
                         and 5 m/s, while the angle error is between 
                           −
                           3.8
                           °
                         and 3.8°. For Figs. 6(c) and (d), we vary the input SNR from 
                           −
                           10
                           
                           dB
                         to 30 dB and fix the velocity error and angel error at 3 m/s and 2°, respectively. The performance of the proposed method keeps approximately unchanged as illustrated in Figs. 6(a) and (b). The performance of the worst-case STAP method degrades when the velocity or angle error becomes larger, though its performance outperforms other methods with small errors. The performance of the MVDR-STAP method degrades dramatically even for a small mismatch between the assumed and actual targets. Furthermore, the performance loss of the traditional LCMV-STAP method is out of acceptable. It can be seen from Figs. 6(c) and (d) that the proposed method is more robust against input SNR.

By incorporating the phase constraint in the response vector, the mainlobe of the STAP beamformer can be well maintained. However, when the Doppler frequency of the assumed target is approaching that of the clutter ridge, the minimization of the total output power will conflict with the constraint condition, thus causing severe performance degradation. Fig. 7
                         shows the performance degradation of the proposed MPC-STAP around the clutter ridge. As it is clearly visible in this figure, the performance notch of the worst-case STAP method is much narrower than other techniques. The performance of MVDR-STAP method degrades due to target self-whitening and that of the LCMV-STAP method degrades dramatically because of the distorted mainlobe and high sidelobe. The proposed method outperforms other methods when the velocity of the target is not too small. In practice, the Doppler bins which are very close to the clutter are excluded in the detection procedure to reduce the false alarm probability [28]. By increasing the number of coherent pulses, the performance notch of the proposed method can be narrow enough to meet the requirement in practice.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this work, the phase constraint is incorporated in the response vector, resulting in the joint MPC-STAP approach. The proposed approach can be taken as an extended LCMV-STAP method with further exploration on the response vector. By exploiting the magnitude and phase constraints, the mainlobe of the STAP radar is well-maintained. Besides, the proposed method is robust against target contamination and improves the performance in terms of SCNR loss. Moreover, the conjugate symmetric characteristic of the adaptive weights is utilized to obtain the explicit expression of the phase constraint, which guarantees the distortionless response of STAP radar. Numerical simulations have verified that the proposed method is able to provide superior performance and robustness in target contamination situations.
