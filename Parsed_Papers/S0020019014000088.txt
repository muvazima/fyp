                  HIGHT is a block cipher designed in Korea with the involvement of Korea Information Security Agency. It was proposed at CHES 2006 for usage in lightweight applications such as sensor networks and RFID tags. Lately, it has been adopted as ISO standard. Though there is a great deal of cryptanalytic results on HIGHT, its security evaluation against the recent zero-correlation linear attacks is still lacking. At the same time, the Feistel-type structure of HIGHT suggests that it might be susceptible to this type of cryptanalysis. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap.
                  We identify zero-correlation linear approximations over 16 rounds of HIGHT. Based upon those, we attack 27-round HIGHT (round 4 to round 30) with improved time complexity and practical memory requirements. This attack of ours is the best result on HIGHT to date in the classical single-key setting. We also provide the first attack on 26-round HIGHT (round 4 to round 29) with the full whitening key.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

With emerging pervasive applications in mind such as sensor networks, RFID tags and medical devices, a variety of lightweight cryptographic algorithms have been lately proposed including the two block ciphers adopted as ISO/IEC standard for lightweight encryption: PRESENT [7] proposed at CHES 2007 and CLEFIA [8] proposed at FSE 2007. Many more lightweight block ciphers have been published since then. Even the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has very recently contributed to the trend with two lightweight block ciphers: Simon and Speck [1]. HIGHT [6] is another lightweight block cipher designed with governmental involvement – Korea Information Security Agency (KISA).

HIGHT was proposed at CHES 2006 and then adopted as ISO standard block cipher [9]. HIGHT has 32 rounds. It accepts a 64-bit block and a 128-bit key. Each round consists of four parallel Feistel functions. Whitening keys are applied before the first and after the last round. The security of HIGHT has been extensively evaluated. Zhang et al. [10] present an integral attack on 22-round HIGHT at CANS 2009 and the time complexity is then reduced by Sasaki and Wang [11] at SAC 2012. In the impossible differential cryptanalysis of HIGHT, to be able to cryptanalyze more rounds, most of the existing attacks do not consider the pre-whitening key except the attack on 27-round HIGHT given in [14] at AfricaCrypt 2012. Lu [12] gives the first impossible differential cryptanalysis against 25-round HIGHT. Then at ACISP 2009, Özen et al. [13] successfully mount an impossible differential attack on 26-round HIGHT. This result was then improved by Chen et al. [14] at AfricaCrypt 2012. Note that the attack on 27-round HIGHT with full whitening keys considered proposed in [14] has time complexity 2126.6 encryptions and 2120 memory accesses to a table of 2120 bytes, which can be considered marginal with respect to brute force. In the related-key setting, attacks on 28-round [12] and 31-round [13] HIGHT were presented using impossible differential attack and related-key rectangle attack on the full HIGHT was reported in [17]. Recently, independent biclique attacks – belonging to the class of polynomial advantage attacks – on the full HIGHT have been obtained in [15,16] with time complexities 2126.4 and 2125.9 encryptions, respectively.

Zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis proposed by Bogdanov and Rijmen in [4] is a novel promising attack technique for block ciphers which has its theoretical foundation in the availability of numerous key-independent unbiased linear approximations with correlation zero for many ciphers. (If p is the probability for a linear approximation to hold, its correlation is defined as 
                           c
                           =
                           2
                           p
                           −
                           1
                        .) Though the initial distinguisher of [4] had some limitations in terms of data complexity, they were overcome in the FSE 2012 paper [5], where the existence of multiple linear approximations with correlation zero in target ciphers was used to propose a more data-efficient distinguisher. In a follow-up work at AsiaCrypt 2012 [2], fundamental links of integral cryptanalysis to zero-correlation cryptanalysis have been revealed. Namely, integrals (similar to saturation or multiset distinguishers) have been demonstrated to be essentially a special case of the zero-correlation property. On top of that, a multidimensional distinguisher has been constructed for the zero-correlation property, which removed the unnecessary independency assumptions on the distinguishing side. At SAC 2013 [3], an FFT technique for speeding up the key recovery in zero-correlation attacks has been proposed, which resulted in increasing the number of rounds that can be cryptanalyzed for Camellia-128 and Camellia-192 in the single-key setting.

In this paper, we evaluate the security of HIGHT with respect to the recent technique of zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis. Our contributions can be summarized as follows.
                           
                              1.
                              We reveal 16-round linear approximations of correlation zero in HIGHT.

Based on those approximations, we propose a multidimensional zero-correlation attack on 27 rounds of HIGHT (round 4 to round 30) with all whitening keys. As mentioned above, in the single-key setting, the attack on the highest number of HIGHT rounds is the 27-round impossible differential attack of [14]. However, the latter provides only a marginal improvement over the brute force, given the enormous number of random accesses to a huge memory (see Table 1
                                 ). Our zero-correlation attack features a lower time complexity that does not involve expensive memory accesses and a significantly reduced memory complexity, which is in fact practical. Our attack is arguably the best non-exhaustive attack on HIGHT in the classical single-key setting.

We provide a key-recovery attack on 26-round HIGHT (round 4 to round 29) with all whitening keys. Note that all previous attacks on 26-round HIGHT ignored the pre-whitening key. To do this, we use the technique of multidimensional zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis. Thus, this attack of ours is the first one on 26-round HIGHT with all whitening keys in the single secret key setting.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes HIGHT and outlines the ideas of zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis. Section 3 presents our zero-correlation linear approximations that span 16 rounds of HIGHT. Section 4 illustrates our attacks on 26-round and 27-round HIGHT. We conclude in Section 5.

To discuss the linear approximations, we need a proper way to denote linear masks. Hence, in the rest of the paper, if a mask on one byte is zero or undetermined in all 8 bits, we denote it with a single ‘0’ or ‘?’, respectively. Otherwise, we will refer to this mask bit by bit where ‘0’, ‘1’ and ‘?’ stand for a zero, nonzero and undetermined single-bit mask value.

Based on properties of correlation for linear approximations over basic operations used in HIGHT such as linear map, XOR, branching, and modular addition proposed in [4,5], we derive a variety of zero-correlation linear approximations for 16-round HIGHT.

                        i

                      since this kind of linear approximations will be used in our attack.

In this section, we describe our attacks on 26 and 27 rounds of HIGHT. We use the key schedule of HIGHT to reduce the number of guessed bits in our attack. The number of guessed key bits is affected by several parameters including the zero-correlation linear property we choose (values of α and β), the position of the property (rounds spanned by zero-correlation approximations), and the number of rounds added before and after this property. To optimize the attack complexities, a proper choice of these parameters is needed. We have implemented the search for the best parameters in a computer program which counts the number of guessed key bits in the partial encryption/decryption phase for all possible combinations of the parameters. To reduce the time complexity, we choose parameters with the least number of guessed key bits.

As a result, we can attack 26-round HIGHT (round 4 to round 29) with the full whitening key by spanning rounds 9 to 24 with the 16-round zero-correlation linear property of Theorem 1 and adding five rounds before and after the property. Also we can attack 27-round HIGHT (round 4 to round 30) with the full whitening key if we add five rounds before and six rounds after the zero-correlation property. We provide our attacks on 26- and 27-round HIGHT in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.

The five initial rounds and five final rounds involved in the attack on 26-round HIGHT are shown in Fig. 1
                         and Fig. 2
                        , respectively. We need to encrypt and decrypt N 
                        
                           (
                           P
                           ,
                           C
                           )
                         pairs to the boundaries of those zero-correlation linear approximations. In Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, we only show those intermediate state values, the subkeys, and whitening keys computed or guessed in the partial encryption and decryption process. The guessed subkeys and whitening keys are denoted with their corresponding master key bytes. Then the key-recovery attack on 26-round HIGHT is proceeded with partial-sum technique from Step 1 to Step 16 as follows.

                         26-round encryptions. Then, we proceed Steps 4–13 shown in Table 4
                        . The second column stands for the master key byte or bit that should be guessed in each step and the corresponding subkey or whitening key is listed in the third column. The column headed as “#Bits” denotes the number of new guessed master key bits introduced in each step. The fifth column is the state value to be computed with the guessed key and known state value. We set up counters in each step to reduce time complexity. The counters we set are shown in column headed as “Counter” and its size is shown in the next column head as “Size”. The computational complexity of each step is shown in the last column, measured with 1/4 round encryption except those steps noted with ‘†’.

To be more clear we explain Step 4 of Table 4 in details. In Step 4 of Table 4, we set up a counter vector

As there are 32 master key bits that we haven't guessed, we do exhaustive search for all keys conforming to this possible key candidate. Only the right key value will survive if all possible key values are tested against a maximum of 3 plaintext-ciphertext pairs.

In this attack, we set the type-I error probability

                            key candidates survive in the wrong key filtration. These 287.1 key candidates are tested exhaustively against a maximum of 3 plaintext-ciphertext pairs along with the remaining 32 master key bits. The complexity of Step 16 is about 2119.1 26-round HIGHT encryptions which is also the dominant part of our attack. In total, the data complexity is about 262.79 known plaintexts, the time complexity is about 2119.1 26-round HIGHT encryptions and the memory requirement are 243 bytes for counters. This is the first attack on 26-round HIGHT considering full whitening key with practical memory requirements.

If we add one more round after the zero-correlation linear distinguisher for 16-round HIGHT, we could attack 27-round HIGHT (round 4 to round 30) with full whitening key taken into consideration. The initial five rounds encryption of our attack on 27-round HIGHT is the same as that described in Section 4.1 shown in Fig. 1. The final six rounds are illustrated in Fig. 3

Only the right key value will survive if each possible key value is tested against a maximum of 3 plaintext-ciphertext pairs.

                            27-round encryptions. The data complexity is 262.79 known plaintexts and the required memory is about 243 bytes. Compared with the previous best attack proposed in [14], our attack on 27-round HIGHT has a lower time complexity and successfully eliminates the requirements for unpractical memory.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we evaluate the security of HIGHT with respect to the novel technique of multidimensional zero-correlation cryptanalysis. As a result, we can attack 27 rounds of HIGHT in less time with a practical memory complexity. We also propose the first single-key cryptanalysis of 26-round HIGHT with all whitening keys. Thus, our 27-round attack improves upon the state-of-the-art cryptanalysis for HIGHT and is the best non-exhaustive single-key cryptanalysis of ISO standard HIGHT to date.
