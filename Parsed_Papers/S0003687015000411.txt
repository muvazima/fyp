                  The adverse effects of night-shift work and alcohol consumption on performance have received considerable attention. However, how night shifts and alcohol affect productivity in workers has not been quantified. This paper describes the experiments featuring multiple tiling tasks and patterns. The tiling quality performed by the graduate student participants in four different statuses was objectively evaluated by an edge-detection computer program. The results indicate that both night shift and alcohol significantly reduce the quality in general, and the effects of the factors on position and alignment-angle qualities were dissimilar in distinct areas due to tile patterns and size. Both night-shift and alcohol conditions affected the basic (−34.01% and −25.79%) and advanced tiling abilities (−40.14% and −26.16%), and night shift had a larger impact than alcohol. These results provide jobsite managers with usable information regarding how night shifts and alcohol affect workers' abilities to execute basic and advanced tasks.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Using night shifts (approximately 10 PM to 6 AM) is the most common approach employed to accelerate construction projects (Jun and El-Rayes, 2010). Night shifts have been suggested to provide more favorable work conditions than day shifts, such as reduced travel congestion, work interference, idle-machinery times, and temperatures (Arditi et al., 2007). However, the potential adverse effects of nighttime construction on worker productivity, safety, and health have also been widely reported (Hinze and Carlisle, 1990; Jun and El-Rayes, 2010; Price, 1986).

Night shifts disrupts a person's circadian rhythm and makes people drowsy and tired (Gillberg et al., 2003; Jay et al., 2006a), and thus impairs cognition and alertness (Åkerstedt and Wright Jr., 2009; Ohayon et al., 2010). Consequently, several studies have concluded that night shifts reduce performance and increase accident risks (Åkerstedt and Landström, 1998; Ullman et al., 2004). Night shifts have been reported to potently affect attention, memory, reaction times, decision making, motor skills, and higher-order cognitive processing in the workplace (Dorrian et al., 2005; Harrison and Horne, 2000; Jay et al., 2006b). These factors may explain the findings that night-shift workers make more errors and are less efficient at their work than are day-shift workers (Costa, 1996). Moreover, night shifts can also cause health, social, and family problems (Wright et al., 2013), which lead to a chronic reduction in competence at work.


                        Dorrian et al. (2003) determined that performance in the Psychomotor Vigilance Task deteriorated at a rate corresponding to the subjective sleepiness ratings provided by participants during a week of simulated night shifts. Andorre-Gruet et al. (1998) reported that supervisory activity was lower during night shifts than during day shifts in the control room of a chemical plant. Åkerstedt and Landström (1998) have summarized the studies related to the effects of night-shift work. Browne (1949) demonstrated that telephone operators connected calls considerably more slowly at night than they did during the day. Bjerner et al. (1955) observed that the number of errors in gas-meter readings at a gas company was higher at night than it was during the day. Hildebrandt et al. (1974) determined that train drivers failed to operate safety-alert devices more often at night than they did during the day.

Construction workers are consistently ranked the highest among workers in all occupations and industries in terms for illicit-drug use and heavy alcohol consumption (Larson et al., 2007). The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (2007) reported that the highest rates of heavy alcohol consumption occurred in the construction industry (15.9%); the rate was nearly twice the average of that in all industries (8.8%) combined in USA. Pidd et al. (2006) investigated alcohol consumption in Australia and found that the construction industry has a higher percentage of workers who drank amounts that were risky in the short- and long-term than do all industries. Regarding the long-term risk levels, the percentage in the construction industry (12.0%) is second only to that in the hospitality industry (14.6%). Alcohol abuse is the primary problem in the construction industry (Maloney, 1988), with the prevalence of alcohol dependence and abuse being roughly 25% in construction workers in USA (Mandell et al., 1992); approximately 12.4% of construction workers engage in heavy alcohol use in USA (Gerber and Yacoubian Jr., 2001). Moreover, approximately 19.1% of construction workers in Australia exhibit alcohol-related problems (Banwell et al., 2006), and nearly 20% of the construction workers consume alcoholic energy drinks regularly.

According to a survey conducted by Cheng et al. (2012), a high percentage (28.6%) of construction workers habitually consume alcoholic energy drinks, because construction work can be physically exhausting. Unlike in some Western countries in which alcoholic energy drinks are marketed to young adults, in Taiwan, alcoholic energy drinks are frequently targeted at manual workers and marketed as nutritional supplements that can combat drowsiness and fatigue at work. The two most popular energy drinks, Whisbi and Paolyta B, which contain alcohol as well as vitamin and caffeine, are approved and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration of Taiwan as “medicine,” and are therefore sold at pharmacies. Most construction workers questioned stated that consuming energy drinks can help relieve fatigue or eliminate drowsiness (Chang et al., 2009), which can explain why the workers consumed these energy drinks before or even during work. According to a report of The Council of Labor Affairs in Taiwan (1998), approximately 14% of all construction workers drank alcoholic beverages before work, and 22% of the workers drank the beverages during work.

Much like night-shift work, alcohol consumption in the workplace severely harms workers' physical and psychological wellbeing, diminishes job performance and productivity, and increases safety risks (Dave and Kaestner, 2002; Patussi and Mezzani, 2004). The other alcohol-related problems prevalent in the workplace are absenteeism (i.e., being either late or absent), increased use of sick leave, an increase in behavioral problems, and poor relationships with coworkers (French and Zarkin, 1995; Maloney, 1988).

The harmful effects of alcohol consumption on a person's work performance have been widely studied and demonstrated. Drinking alcohol adversely affects perceptual–cognitive and psychomotor abilities (Brumback et al., 2007) and also impairs information processing, memory, reasoning, visual-searching capability, attention, caution, reaction times, perception of space and movement, verbal expression, motor coordination, and recognition skills (Kim et al., 2007; Oxley et al., 2006).


                        Brumback et al. (2007) summarized the impact of alcohol at moderate-to-heavy BAC levels. BAC levels above 0.05% markedly impair performance in certain motor tasks such as tracking, tapping, reaction, and swaying. Dawson and Reid (1997) reported that performance on a tracking task decreased by 11.6% at a BAC level of 0.10%. Struik et al. (1988) indicated that information processing, perception, and motor abilities were substantially diminished at BAC levels exceeding 0.15%.

As discussed in this section, numerous studies have evaluated the effects of night-shift work and alcohol consumption on people's work efficiency and cognitive behavior; however, no study has focused on quantifying the effect of these factors on work quality, particularly in the construction industry. One reason that such quantitative analyses are lacking is that reliably measuring performance in real-life settings can be challenging (Gillberg et al., 2003). Furthermore, to quantify the impact of physiological statuses on productivity, studies must focus on using a simple and safe construction task whose quality can be measured objectively. Understanding how night shifts and alcohol consumption affect various quality measures of tasks of distinct types can help in managing construction work and workers and in avoiding poor work quality and unsafe working conditions caused by inappropriate work assignment.

In this study, our objective was to use experiments to quantify the impact of night shifts and alcohol consumption on tiling quality and task-executing ability. The tiling task, which was chosen because of its simplicity and safety, can be readily simulated and also repeated when cemented tiles are replaced with Velcro-attached tiles. Tiles of distinct patterns and sizes were designed and the quality of work was assessed based on the precision of tile alignment; this assessment included three measures that represented basic and advanced task-executing abilities.

To evaluate the impact of night-shift work and alcohol consumption on work quality and efficiency, we designed four experiments, each including the same set of five tiling tasks in five specified areas and three tiling patterns. Each participant was required to participate in all four experiments under distinct statuses: (I) normal, (II) inebriation, (III) night shift, and (IV) inebriation in night shift (Table 1
                        ). The participants completed each of the experiments on separate days to avoid experiencing residual effects of previous experiments.

In the normal status, participants completed the experiment during daytime without having consumed any alcoholic beverage. In the night-shift status, the participants started the experiments at 1:00 AM, after not having slept for at least 12 h prior to the experiments. Participants were required to not sleep for a minimum of 12 h to mimic the sleep deprivation caused by night shifts. Consider a night shift worker who works from 10:00PM to 6:00AM, and sleeps from 8:00AM to 2:00PM. By the middle of the shift, the worker will have not slept for 12 h, and will have not slept for more than 12 h by the end of the shift. To create the inebriation status, participants were asked to consume a 40%-alcohol Vodka drink 1 h before the experiments; the amount consumed was designed to reach a BAC level of 0.07% (Section 2.4). After the tiling tasks were completed, work quality was determined by photographing the tiles that were fixed and comparing them with a standard tiling alignment by using a computer program.

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (2013) evaluated the impairment caused by alcohol overdose based on BAC levels, which are expressed as a percentage of alcohol in the blood. In our experiments, we chose the BAC level of 0.07% as the inebriation status, which was reported to produce the adverse effects of impaired coordination, balance, attention, and memory. The Institutional Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital approved the protocol of these experiments.

Ten graduate students (eight males and two females) from the construction engineering and management program of National Chiao-Tung University volunteered to participate in the experiments. The average age of the students was 24.1 years (SD = 1.10 years). The average height and weight were 169.60 cm (SD = 6.48 cm) and 63.3 kg (SD = 14.74 kg), respectively. All students provided written informed consent before the experiments and were paid for their participation. Each participant completed the entire experiment (including preparation and rest times) over four nonconsecutive days, working for approximately 1.5 h in the normal and night-shift statuses and for 3 h in the case of the inebriation status.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

We chose tiling as the task for the experiments because it is simple and safe, and its quality measurement can be automated using a computer. To facilitate repetition, we erected a wall covered with flannelette and prepared tiles of distinct types that were glued using Velcro attached on the back of the tiles; thus, the tiles could be attached to the wall and later detached easily (Fig. 1
                        ).

The tasks involved attaching tiles according to three designated patterns (staggered brickwork, checkerboard, and diamond) in five tiling areas (as shown in Fig. 2
                        ) by using reference lines for guidance. Each experiment required the participant to attach 408 tiles, which takes approximately 1 h.

All participants were required to perform the tiling tasks under four statuses. When the tasks assigned for each status were completed, the participants had to wait for at least 1 day before starting the next experiment so as to avoid the effects of fatigue and hangover. The experimental procedure used over four nonconsecutive is shown in Fig. 3
                        . Experiments I and III were started at 9:00 AM and 1:00 AM, respectively, and represented the normal and night-shift statuses. The participants did not consume any alcohol in the case of the normal status and were required to consume alcohol for the inebriation status (i.e., in Experiments II and IV). We used an anthropometry formula based on the participant's weight, height, sex, and age, which was presented by Watson (1989), to calculate the alcohol dose required for each participant to reach the 0.07% BAC level. To induce the inebriation status, the participants were asked to drink the required volume of Vodka within 30 min, and they were then allowed to rest for 30 min so that the alcohol could be absorbed. We also used a Breathalyzer (detection range: 0.00–2.00 mg/L) to measure the BAC level of the participants.

The participants performed the tiling tasks in sequence from Area 1 to Area 5. The only restriction placed on the tiling tasks was that the tiles had to be positioned consecutively in the tested patterns, except in the case of the diamond pattern. Tiling consecutively ensures the mixed use of tiles that are colored distinctly, and this requires added attention during the tasks. The participants were allowed to hold as many tiles in their hands as they could and were allowed adjust each tile as many times as they desired. No time limitations were placed on completing the tasks.

To quickly induce fatigue during the tiling tasks, we positioned Areas 2–4 to be lower than Areas 1 and 5; thus, in these three areas, tiling could be performed only in a squatting position, without kneeling or sitting on the work platform. When participants experienced discomfort such as muscle pain or eye strain, they were allowed to stop tiling and rest on the platform.

To evaluate participants' work performance, we measured tiling quality. We used C++ to write an edge-detection program (Lin and Fang, 2013) that recognizes tile images by detecting the 4 corners of each tile on a wall. The quality was assessed based on the precision of tile alignment against the reference lines, and this assessment included three measures: tiling positions, gaps, and alignment angles. The tiling time required for each area was also recorded.

We used the three measures to determine work quality because we sought to include both absolute and relative perspectives. The tiling-position score measures the absolute deviation between the four corners of each tile in a participant's work and the reference line; in this measurement, the smaller the deviation, the higher the score.

Tiling may occasionally exhibit uniform gaps featuring deviated alignment angles or optimal alignment angles (i.e., tiles being upright relative to the floor) but uneven gaps between tiles (Fig. 4
                        ). Such deviations appear negligible and are often considered acceptable in practice if they cannot be detected by the human eye, and they incur a large penalty only when compared against the reference lines because the deviations accumulate. Therefore, we introduced the gap score to determine, without referring to the reference lines, whether the gaps were consistently within the designated 3-mm limit. Similarly, we used the alignment-angle score to measure whether the regression lines of two consecutive tiling columns or rows were parallel without having to check the reference lines.

The tiling-position measure determines how close the tiles are to the reference lines. Fig. 5
                            illustrates how the average deviation of a tile can be determined. Eq. (1) calculates the average of the deviations between the four corners of Tile
                              i,j
                            and the corresponding points of the reference lines. Eq. (2) calculates the average deviation of the tiles in a tiling area, and measures the quality of Area
                              k
                            in terms of absolute tiling position.

                           where i and j represent the indexes of columns and rows of tiles; m and n represent the numbers of tiles in the columns and rows; and k represents the tiling area.

The gap measure determines how close the gaps between tiles are to 3 mm. Fig. 6
                            illustrates how the gap measure was determined for a row of gaps. Eqs. (3) and (4) calculate the average gap deviations of a column and a row of gaps, respectively. Eq. (5) calculates the average gap deviation of a tiling area. Minimal gap deviation is obtained when the gaps between two consecutive rows and columns are exactly 3 mm.

The alignment-angle measure determines whether two consecutive lines of gaps are parallel to each other. Fig. 7
                            illustrates how the average deviation of alignment angles can be determined. Eqs. (6) and (7) calculate the deviation of the angles between two consecutive regression lines of each column and row of the gap between tiles. Eq. (8) calculates the average deviation of the alignment angles in the work area, and measures the quality Area

                            in terms of the relative alignment angle. Minimal deviation is obtained when the regression lines are parallel to each other, regardless of their angles relative to the reference lines.

To perform the analysis described herein, we converted the three measures of deviations into a score. Lin and Fang (2013) reported that Taiwan currently lacks a standard to measure work quality in tiling. The only indirect standard available is the quality control used when manufacturing tiles. The Public Construction Commission in Taiwan has provided a standard to determine the levelness of tiling workmanship, which can be used to measure whether tiles are installed and appropriately leveled (+3.175 mm in a 304.8-cm radius).

In the experimental setup used in this study, flawless work was infeasible because the Velcro surface does not allow tiles to be moved continuously. Because we were unable to identify appropriate reference standards to score the measures of positions, gaps, and alignment angles, the research-team members performed exactly the same experimental tiling tasks as those assigned to the participants and then set the highest tiling results obtained as a reference score of 100. Table 2
                            presents the deviation of the optimal work and indicates the acceptable deviation that is caused by system errors (i.e., by Velcro's discontinuity). Any deviation larger than the reference work resulted in a deduction of the score based on a percentage scale. For example, if the reference work displayed a deviation of 1.05 mm in the position measurement in the Checkerboard area, a sample work featuring a deviation of 1.176 mm would receive a score of 100 × [1 − (1.176/1.05 − 1)] = 88.

Eq. (9) calculates the general-quality score, which is a weighted average of the scores of the position, gap, and alignment-angle measures. The position score was weighted the most because it measures the correspondence of the work with the reference points, which were the only references that the participants depended on while tiling.

To adjust the performance to exclude the learning effect, we compared the tiling times and scores of Areas 1 and 5 and of Areas 2 and 4 to estimate the improvement that occurred in the work because of former experience. These areas were chosen because they shared the same tiling patterns, the amount of tiles, and participants' working postures. We used Crawford and Strauss's Model (1947) to calculate each participant's learning percentage of time. The average learning percentage of time of the four statuses of each participant was then used to calculate that participant's learning percentage of quality.

The quality in each tiling area was analyzed using descriptive statistics and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) featuring repeated measurements. Descriptive analysis ranked the tiling quality in terms of the four statuses. The two factors in ANOVA were “Shift” (day and night shifts) and “Alcohol” (BAC 0% and 0.07%). ANOVA was conducted to ascertain differences among the four statuses in terms of the variables of tiling quality (position, gap, and alignment angle). The Shapiro–Wilk test was applied to examine normality. Examining the sphericity was unnecessary because both the factors examined (shift and alcohol) featured only two levels. ANOVA was performed at a level of 95% statistical significance (p < 0.05).

@&#RESULTS@&#


                        Fig. 8
                         presents the average tiling quality and time of the participants under the four statuses. The ranking of the statuses in terms of quality score was I > II > III > IV (normal > inebriation > night shift > inebriation in night shift), and in terms of time was IV > III > II > I. The participants' quality of work was the highest in the normal status. Night-shift and alcohol statuses lowered work quality. On average, the night-shift status had a larger detrimental effect on work quality than did alcohol. Next, participants completed the tasks most quickly under the normal status. Lastly, whether in the day or night shift, participants required more time to complete the tasks when inebriated than when sober. Thus, the night-shift and alcohol statuses reduced work quality and increased the tiling time.

The results in Fig. 9
                         show that under all statuses, the unit times (i.e., seconds per tile) required for tiling the staggered patterns were all larger than those required for tiling other patterns. The quality scores of tiling staggered brickworks were also higher than other scores. This is because the rectangular tile used in the staggered patterns was heavier and approximately 5.6-times larger than the square tile: when the larger and heavier tiles were used, although the tiling speed per unit was lower than that in the case of the lighter tiles, the work quality was higher (in terms of the position-measure score) because aligning these tiles with the reference lines was easier than aligning the smaller and lighter tiles. Within each status, the performance in terms of quality and time in areas worked on later was better than that of areas worked on earlier (e.g., Area 5 vs. Area 1 and Area 4 vs. Area 2) even though the learning effect was deducted from the original scores and times.

To determine the influence of the shift and alcohol statuses in each area featuring staggered brickwork, checkerboard, and diamond patterns, repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted to determine if significant differences exist in terms of tiling quality (position, gap, and alignment angle). The tiling scores are shown in Table 3
                        . Tables 4 and 5
                        
                         show the combined mean values, illustrating the effect the night shift or alcohol exerts on quality decrease according to ANOVA results. Column Mean1 depicts the combined mean values for either the day shift or a BAC of 0%, whereas Mean2 shows the combined mean values for either the night shift or a BAC of 0.07%. For example, the first row of staggered brickwork in Table 4 indicates that the shift significantly (p = 0.045) reduced the position quality from a mean of 53.36 for the day shift to 39.68 for the night shift. The first row of gap quality for Area 5 in Table 5 indicates that regarding a BAC of 0% (no alcohol consumption), the shift significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the gap quality from a mean of 71.95 for the day shift to 43.07 for the night shift. However, we do not present the ANOVAs performed for time, most of which did not show statistically significant differences because no time limits were set in the experiments.

A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no significant interaction between shift (day and night) and alcohol (BAC 0% and 0.07%) in tiling quality (F
                           1,9 = 3.76, p = 0.084, partial eta squared = 0.295), which indicates the significant main effects of shift (F
                           1,9 = 15.58, p = 0.003, partial eta squared = 0.634) and alcohol (F
                           1,9 = 13.50, p = 0.005, partial eta squared = 0.600).

The tiling quality score was significantly decreased, by 31.31% and 23.82%, from day shift (M = 39.45) to night shift (M = 27.10) and from BAC 0% (M = 37.78) to BAC 0.07% (M = 28.78), respectively.

The interaction between shift and alcohol in terms of position, gap, and alignment-angle qualities was not significant. Night shift significantly reduced the position (F
                              1,9 = 5.41, p = 0.045, partial eta squared = 0.375) and gap qualities (F
                              1,9 = 19.52, p = 0.002, partial eta squared = 0.684), and alcohol significantly reduced the gap quality (F
                              1,9 = 16.36, p = 0.003, partial eta squared = 0.645). The main effects of shift were not statistically significant in alignment-angle quality, and the main effects of alcohol were not significant in position and alignment-angle qualities.

Position quality was significantly decreased, by 25.64%, from day shift (M = 53.36) to night shift (M = 39.68), and gap quality was significantly decreased, by 31.75% and 21.00%, from day shift (M = 50.61) to night shift (M = 34.54) and from BAC 0% (M = 47.57) to BAC 0.07% (M = 37.58), respectively.

The interaction between shift and alcohol in terms of position and alignment-angle qualities was not significant, but the interaction between shift and alcohol in gap quality was significant (F
                              1,9 = 11.52, p = 0.008, partial eta squared = 0.561). Night shift significantly reduced the position quality (F
                              1,9 = 10.70, p = 0.010, partial eta squared = 0.543), and alcohol significantly reduced the position quality (F
                              1,9 = 37.12, p < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.805). The main effects of shift and alcohol were not statistically significant in alignment-angle quality.

We analyzed the simple main effects of shift and alcohol on gap quality separately (Table 5). Under the BAC 0% and 0.07% conditions, night shift significantly reduced the gap quality (0%: F
                              1,9 = 55.89, p < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.861; 0.07%: F
                              1,9 = 27.47, p = 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.753). In the case of day shift, alcohol significantly reduced the gap quality (F
                              1,9 = 25.84, p = 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.742). The main effects of alcohol in the night-shift condition were not statistically significant.

Position quality was significantly decreased, by 34.01% and 25.79%, from day shift (M = 68.84) to night shift (M = 45.43) and from BAC 0% (M = 65.60) to BAC 0.07% (M = 48.68), respectively. Under the BAC 0% and 0.07% conditions, gap quality was significantly decreased, by 40.14% and 27.95%, from day shift (M = 71.95, M = 53.13) to night shift (M = 43.07, M = 38.28); in the case of day shift, gap quality was significantly decreased, by 26.16%, from BAC 0% (M = 71.95) to BAC 0.07% (M = 53.13).

The interaction between shift and alcohol in terms of position, gap, and alignment-angle qualities was not significant. Night shift significantly reduced the gap (F
                              1,9 = 40.94, p < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.820) and alignment-angle qualities (F
                              1,9 = 5.61, p = 0.042, partial eta squared = 0.384), and alcohol significantly reduced the gap quality (F
                              1,9 = 24.25, p = 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.729). The main effects of shift were not statistically significant in the case of position quality, and the main effects of alcohol were not statistically significant in position and alignment-angle qualities.

Gap quality was significantly decreased, by 35.80% and 25.37%, from day shift (M = 55.22) to night shift (M = 35.45) and from BAC 0% (M = 51.92) to BAC 0.07% (M = 38.75), respectively. Alignment-angle quality was significantly decreased, by 32.80%, from day shift (M = 49.97) to night shift (M = 33.58).

The interaction between shift and alcohol in terms of position, gap, and alignment-angle qualities was not significant. Night shift significantly reduced the gap (F
                              1,9 = 13.51, p = 0.005, partial eta squared = 0.600) and alignment-angle qualities (F
                              1,9 = 7.72, p = 0.021, partial eta squared = 0.462). The main effects of shift were not statistically significant in the case of position quality, and the main effects of alcohol were not statistically significant in all quality measures.

Gap and alignment-angle qualities were significantly decreased, by 30.87% and 27.44%, from day shift (M = 50.15, M = 49.97) to night shift (M = 34.67, M = 36.26).

The interaction between shift and alcohol in terms of position and gap qualities was not significant, but the interaction between shift and alcohol in alignment-angle quality was significant (F
                              1,9 = 5.49, p = 0.044, partial eta squared = 0.379). Night shift significantly reduced the gap quality (F
                              1,9 = 42.93, p < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.827), and alcohol significantly reduced the gap quality (F
                              1,9 = 23.51, p = 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.723). The main effects of shift and alcohol were not statistically significant in position quality.

We analyzed the simple main effects of shift and alcohol on alignment-angle quality separately (Table 5). Under the BAC 0% condition, night shift significantly reduced the alignment-angle quality (F
                              1,9 = 9.34, p = 0.014, partial eta squared = 0.509). The main effects of night shift under BAC 0.07% condition were not statistically significant. In the case of day shift, alcohol significantly reduced the alignment-angle quality (F
                              1,9 = 16.81, p = 0.003, partial eta squared = 0.650). The main effects of alcohol in the night-shift condition were not statistically significant.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

We expected the performance relating to quality and time would deteriorate as the participants progressed from Area 1 to Area 5. However, as shown in Fig. 9, the performance in Area 5 was better than that in Area 1, and the performance in Area 4 was better than that in Area 2. Video recordings and post interviews revealed that most participants started leaning against the wall at a late stage while they were tiling in the squatting position. We attribute this phenomenon to two possible physical and psychological reasons. First, the leaning position induced by the unsteadiness of squatting enabled the participants to perform the tiling while maintaining a more steady position than the squatting position alone, and this increased productivity and quality. Secondly, most participants exhibited improved performance in Area 5, which is likely because of the improvement in their disposition caused by returning from the exhausting squatting position used in Areas 2–4 to the standing position when tiling in Area 5.

The diamond pattern was deliberately designed to create complexity in the task, and thus performance was expected to be poorer in Area 3 than in other areas; this, however, did not occur. One possible explanation is that the task may not have been more challenging to the participants than the other tasks, because all the diagonal reference lines of the diamond pattern were provided.

We used the experiments presented herein to analyze how two factors, shift work and alcohol, affected tiling quality (position, gap, and alignment angle). Table 6
                      summarizes the ANOVA results obtained; these results, which, based on the difference in means and effect sizes, indicate that both night shift and alcohol had a statistically significant impact on most of the performance measures in terms of quality, and that night shift had a larger impact than did alcohol. The p values near the acceptable significant level (p < 0.05) were also treated as significant.

The effects of the two factors on quality measures in distinct areas were dissimilar. Unexpectedly, in the case of position quality, both factors had an impact only on the staggered patterns (i.e., in Areas 1 and 5), which required fewer and longer tiles than did other patterns (i.e., in Areas 2, 3, and 4) in which comparatively smaller, square tiles were used. Because these other patterns required more tiles than did the staggered pattern (112 and 120 tiles vs. 28 tiles), most participants performed poorly as the result of a ripple effect in which a few ragged alignments at the front end may have led to an increase in ragged alignments later if the alignments were not corrected precisely. The deviation was also enlarged in the case of the long tiles if they were not optimally aligned with the reference lines. Moreover, the impact of alcohol on Area 1 (p = 0.069) was less significant than that on Area 5 (p < 0.001), which could be attributed to the effect of alcohol increasing during its slow absorption.

In terms of gap quality, both factors had an impact on all areas. We noted that many of the participants tended to start leaning against the wall in Area 4 after remaining exclusively in the squatting position in Areas 2 and 3. In terms of alignment-angle quality, if we consider only the square tiles, the impact of both factors was significant or close to significant (p = 0.062) in all areas, except in the case of alcohol's effect on tiling in Area 2 (p = 0.126). This could also be attributed to the effect of alcohol strengthening as it is gradually absorbed.

With the use of rectangular tiles, no statistically significant impact was measured in either Area 1 or 5. This could have occurred because the alignment-angle score is calculated by comparing neighboring regression lines. Within areas of the same size, the small square tiles gave the participants considerably more opportunities to correct the alignment than did the large rectangular tiles. Moreover, using a long tile led to larger deviations from the reference line than did the use of a short tile.

Both night shift and alcohol tended to produce more statistically significant differences in the gap measure than in the alignment-angle measure. This is because in the alignment-angle measure, the regression methodology was used and this averaged out the participants' differences. In future experiments, discrimination could be enhanced by replacing the regression calculation with the average of the sum of angle deviation of each tile.

The position score measured the basic task-executing ability, whereas the gap and alignment-angle scores measured advanced abilities, which involved increased visual judgment and adjustment of tiles by hand. In summary, both night shift and alcohol affected basic and advanced tiling abilities. Although the effect was not statistically significant when considering the square tiles in both checkerboard and diamond patterns, and the basic ability (positioning) because of the ripple effect of accumulated deviations, the effect was significant in the case of rectangular tiles. Moreover, the gap measure appeared to be more discriminative than the regression-based alignment-angle measure was when examining the effects of the factors tested.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The adverse effects of night-shift work and alcohol consumption on work performance have received considerable attention. Although working night shifts and consuming alcohol-containing beverages such as energy drinks are common in the construction industry, how night shifts and alcohol affect productivity in construction workers has not been quantified. We designed experiments involving five tiling tasks and three patterns (staggered brickwork, checkerboard, and diamond). The quality of the tiling work completed by the participants under four statuses (normal, inebriation, night shift, and inebriation in night shift) was evaluated objectively by using an edge-detection computer program and three measures of tiling-work quality: position, gap, and alignment angle.

The results of our analysis indicate that work quality was adversely affected by both night-shift work and alcohol consumption. Whereas gap quality was affected by both factors in all of the five work areas, the effects of the factors on position and alignment-angle qualities were dissimilar in distinct areas. This difference may have arisen primarily from the use of distinct patterns and tile sizes. The long tiles enlarged the position deviation and thus increased discriminability. Although long tiles also enlarged the deviation in alignment angles, they did not increase discriminability as they did in the case of position deviation; this is because maintaining two neighboring regression lines at the same angle was too challenging for most participants. Moreover, because fewer long tiles than short tiles were required for tiling, the opportunities to correct the alignment were diminished when using the long tiles. By contrast, the use of more square tiles than other tiles resulted in statistically significant differences in the alignment-angle measure. However, the use of large numbers of square tiles also often led to ragged alignment because of the ripple effect, and this diminished the statistical significance in the position measure.

Comparing the differences between the front end and the corresponding later areas of the same pattern (e.g., Area 1 vs. Area 5 and Area 2 vs. Area 4) showed that the impact of alcohol measured for the front areas was weaker than that in later areas, which was because the effect of alcohol increased over time as the alcohol was absorbed gradually.

The position measure represents the basic task-executing ability, whereas the gap and alignment-angle measures represent advanced abilities. Both night-shift and alcohol conditions affected the basic and advanced abilities, and night shift had a larger impact than did alcohol: basic and advanced abilities were decreased maximally by 34.01% (partial eta squared = 0.543) and 40.14% (partial eta squared = 0.861), respectively, in the case of the night-shift condition, and by 25.79% (partial eta squared = 0.509) and 26.16% (partial eta squared = 0.742), respectively, in the case of alcohol.

The primary limitation of this research was the small number of participants. Many who were approached did not join the study because they were unwilling to participate in all four experiments, which took four nonconsecutive days to complete. The number of participants could be increased if the experiments can be redesigned to fit into nonconsecutive time slots within a single day.

In addition, finding night-shift workers to participate in these experiments was difficult because of the time involved. We attempted to reduce the effect caused by the difference between the students and night-shift workers by simplifying the tiling tasks and deliberately depriving the participants of sleep. However, although literature has indicated that sleepiness is common among night-shift workers, and the experiments described herein simulated such conditions by requiring participants to not sleep for at least 12 h before the experiments began, other common symptoms, such as accumulated fatigue induced by long hours of work and circadian misalignment, were not simulated in the experiments. Moreover, the participants in this study were graduate students, whose physical abilities and procedural knowledge, skills, and memory may differ from those of construction workers.

Lastly, we used Velcro instead of cement so as to allow the tiles to be readily attached and detached, but Velcro by its nature does not permit continuous adjustment. In future experiments, Velcro could be replaced with magnets.
