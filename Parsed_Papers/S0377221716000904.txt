                  We consider a scheduling problem where a set of jobs has already been assigned to identical parallel machines that are subject to disruptions with the objective of minimizing the total completion time. When machine disruptions occur, the affected jobs need to be rescheduled with a view to not causing excessive schedule disruption with respect to the original schedule. Schedule disruption is measured by the maximum time deviation or the total virtual tardiness, given that the completion time of any job in the original schedule can be regarded as an implied due date for the job concerned. We focus on the trade-off between the total completion time of the adjusted schedule and schedule disruption by finding the set of Pareto-optimal solutions. We show that both variants of the problem are 
                        NP
                     -hard in the strong sense when the number of machines is considered to be part of the input, and 
                        NP
                     -hard when the number of machines is fixed. In addition, we develop pseudo-polynomial-time solution algorithms for the two variants of the problem with a fixed number of machines, establishing that they are 
                        NP
                     -hard in the ordinary sense. For the variant where schedule disruption is modeled as the total virtual tardiness, we also show that the case where machine disruptions occur only on one of the machines admits a two-dimensional fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. We conduct extensive numerical studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Most modern production and service systems operate in a dynamic environment in which unexpected disruptions may occur, necessitating changes in the planned schedule, which may render the originally feasible schedule infeasible. Examples of such disruption events include the arrival of new orders, machine breakdowns, order cancellations, changes in order priority, processing delays, and unavailability of raw materials, personnel, tools, etc. Rescheduling, which involves adjusting the original schedule to account for a disruption, is necessary in order to minimize the effects of the disruption on the performance of the system. This involves a trade-off between finding a cost-effective new schedule and avoiding excessive changes to the original schedule. The degree of disruption to the original schedule is often modeled as a constraint or part of the original scheduling objective (Hall, Liu, & Potts, 2007; Hall & Potts, 2004, 2010; Hoogeveena, Lentéb, & T’kindtb, 2012; Jain & Foley, 2016; Liu & Ro, 2014; Qi, Bard, & Yu, 2006; Unal, Uzsoy, & Kiran, 1997; Wang, Liu, Wang & Wang, 2015; Yan, Che, Cai, & Tang, 2014; Yang, 2007; Yuan & Mu, 2007). Variants of the rescheduling problem can be found in many real-world applications such as automotive manufacturing (Bean, Birge, Mittenthal, & Noon, 1991), space shuttle missions (Zweben, Davis, Daun, & Deale, 1993), shipbuilding (Clausen, Hansen, Larsen, & Larsen, 2001), short-range airline planning (Yu, Argello, Song, McCowan, & White, 2003), deregulated power market (Dahal, Al-Arfaj, & Paudyal, 2015), etc.

The literature on rescheduling abounds. For recent reviews, the reader may refer to Aytug, Lawley, McKay, Mohan, and Uzsoy (2005), Billaut, Sanlaville, and Moukrim (2002), Ouelhadj and Petrovic (2009), and Vieira, Herrmann, and Lin (2003). In this paper we review only studies on machine rescheduling with unexpected disruptions arising from machine breakdowns that are directly related to our work. Leon, Wu, and Storer (1994) developed robustness measures and robust scheduling to deal with machine breakdowns and processing time variability when a right-shift repair strategy is used. Robustness is defined as the minimization of the bicriterion objective function comprising the expected makespan and expected delay, where the expected delay is the deviation between the deterministic makespan in the original and adjusted schedules. Their experimental results showed that robust schedules significantly outperform schedules based on the makespan alone. Ozlen and Azizoğlu (2011) considered a rescheduling problem on unrelated parallel machines, where a disruption occurs on one of the machines. The scheduling measure is the total completion time and the deviation cost, which is the total disruption caused by the differences between the original and adjusted schedules. They developed polynomial-time algorithms to solve the following hierarchical optimization problems: minimizing the total disruption cost among the minimum total completion time schedules and minimizing the total completion time among the minimum total disruption cost schedules. Qi et al. (2006) considered a rescheduling problem in the presence of a machine breakdown in both the single-machine and two parallel-machine settings with the objective of minimizing the total completion time plus different measures of time disruption. They provided polynomial-time algorithms and pseudo-polynomial-time algorithms for the problems under consideration. Zhao and Tang (2010) extended some of their results to the case with linear deteriorating jobs. Liu and Ro (2014) considered a rescheduling problem with machine unavailability on a single machine, where disruption is measured as the maximum time deviation between the original and adjusted schedules. Studying a general model where the maximum time disruption appears both as a constraint and as part of the scheduling objective, they provided a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm, a constant factor approximation algorithm, and a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme when the scheduling objective is to minimize the makespan or maximum lateness.

In this paper we address the issue of how to reschedule jobs in the presence of machine breakdowns. We assume that a set of jobs has been optimally scheduled according to the shortest processing time (SPT) rule to minimize the total completion time on m identical parallel machines (Baker, 1974). However, the processing of most of the jobs has not begun. This situation arises when schedules are planned in advance of their start dates, typically several weeks earlier in practice. Based on the SPT schedule, a lot of preparation work has been made, such as ordering raw materials, tooling the equipment, organizing the workforce, fixing customer delivery dates, etc. Due to unforeseen disruptions, different from the setting in Ozlen and Azizoğlu (2011), we consider the situation where machine breakdowns may occur on more than one machine, and the disruption start time and the duration of a machine disruption may differ on different machines. This necessitates rescheduling the remaining jobs in the original SPT schedule. However, doing so will disrupt the SPT schedule, causing havoc on the preparative work already undertaken. Thus, on rescheduling, it is important to adhere to the original scheduling objective, say, the total completion time, while minimizing the disruption cost with respect to the SPT schedule. In this paper we use the maximum time deviation or the total virtual tardiness, where the completion time of a job in the SPT schedule can be regarded as an implied due date for the job concerned here, to model the disruption cost with respect to the SPT schedule. Instead of modeling the degree of disruption over the original schedule as a constraint or part of the scheduling objective, we focus on the trade-off between the total completion time of the adjusted schedule and schedule disruption by finding the set of Pareto-optimal solutions for this bicriterion scheduling problem. The purpose of this paper is twofold. One is to study this innovative and more realistic scheduling model. The other is to ascertain the computational complexity status and provide solution procedures, if viable, for the problems under consideration.

To motivate our scheduling problem, consider a practical example related to the manufacturing of containers. In this context, the manufacturing process is labor intensive and several machines are deployed to manufacture a host of various container types. The preparation for the manufacturing of each type of containers incurs a high operational cost. The factory takes customer orders during the current scheduling cycle (usually a month) and generates an optimal production schedule for the next period that minimizes the scheduling cost measured as the total flowtime for manufacturing all the ordered containers. In other words, the factory uses the SPT dispatching rule to schedule the manufacturing of the containers. The delivery times and related transport arrangements of the finished containers are then determined accordingly. However, unexpected disruptions such as machine breakdowns may occur that will render the machines unavailable for certain periods of time, which will affect the utilization of the machines and order delivery to customers. This will result in the original SPT schedule no longer optimal, wreak havoc on the preparative work already undertaken, and make an impact on the subsequent transport arrangements. Hence, it is important to react quickly to such disruptions whereby the affected jobs need to be rescheduled with a view to reducing the scheduling cost, while not causing excessive schedule disruption with respect to the original SPT schedule (excessive schedule disruption will increase the operational cost or result in the loss of customer goodwill). From the viewpoint of the production planner, a trade-off between the scheduling cost and deviation from the original SPT schedule is desired. This situation can be modeled as our problem of rescheduling on identical parallel machines with machine disruptions to minimize the total completion time.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we formally formulate our problem into two variants. In Section 3 we analyze the computational complexity and derive structural properties that are useful for tackling the two variants of the problem under study. In Section 4 we develop a pseudo-polynomial-time dynamic programming solution algorithm for the variant with the maximum time deviation as the schedule disruption cost and a fixed number of machines, establishing that it is 
                        NP
                     -hard in the ordinary sense. In Section 5 we also develop a pseudo-polynomial-time dynamic programming solution algorithm for the variant with the total virtual tardiness as the schedule disruption cost and a fixed number of machines, establishing that it is 
                        NP
                     -hard in the ordinary sense, and convert the algorithm into a two-dimensional fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the case where machine disruptions occur only on one of the machines. In the last section we conclude the paper and suggest topics for future research.

The quality of a schedule ρ is measured by two criteria. The first is the original scheduling objective, i.e., the total completion time, and the second is a measure of the schedule disruption cost in terms of the maximum time deviation or the total virtual tardiness with respect to the original SPT schedule.

As for all bicriterion optimization problems, we need to establish a relationship or tradeoff between the two criteria in the objective function. In this paper we focus on the Pareto-optimization problem: Given the two criteria

Thus, in any case, schedule ρ′ is no worse than ρ
                              * for the two problems under consideration. The result follows.□

It is worth noting that scheduling the jobs in the earlier schedule in SPT order, each as early as possible, is not necessarily optimal even for the case without the schedule disruption cost. This is because such rescheduling may waste a long period of machine idle time immediately preceding the start time of each machine disruption, which we illustrate in the following example.

The optimality of algorithm SMDP is guaranteed by Lemmas 3.4, 4.1 and 4.2, and the above analysis. We now work out the time complexity of the algorithm. Step 1 implements a sorting procedure that needs O(nlog n) time. In Step 3, for each Q, before each iteration j, the total number of possible states

                        max  ≤ Q|∑Cj

We performed numerical studies by varying the problem size to assess the performance of algorithm SMDP.

                              As expected beforehand, the number of Pareto-optimal points increases as the number of machines increases;

The number of Pareto-optimal points is insensitive to the duration of the machine disruption and the disruption start time;

The average time required to construct the entire Pareto-set decreases as the disruption start time increases;

In most cases the algorithm fails to solve instances with up to 25 jobs due to space capacity limitation.

                              we can eliminate the latter state.
                           

The proof is analogous to that of Lemma 4.2.□

We give a formal description of algorithm STDP as follows:

                              Step 1. [Preprocessing] Re-index the jobs in SPT order.

Step 2. [Initialization] Set

We performed numerical studies by varying the problem size to evaluate the performance of algorithms STDP and STAA. We carried out an experimental study analogous to the one conducted for assessing the performance of algorithm SMDP in Section 4.2. In this experiment we focused on finding a Pareto-optimal solution by applying algorithm STDP and an approximate Pareto solution by applying algorithm STAA for a given

Instance classes (i) and (ii) are used to analyze the impacts of disruption start time, disruption duration, and ε, and the impact of number of machines on the performance of algorithms STDP and STAA, respectively, while instance class (iii) is used to analyze the impact of number of disrupted machines on the performance of algorithm STDP. For instance class (i), we tested our algorithms on instances with 
                           
                              n

                         and 100 jobs; and for instance classes (ii) and (iii), we went no further than instances with 70 jobs, since larger instances took too much time to solve. For each combination of n and instance class (i), we generated 30 instances; and for each combination of n and instance classes (ii) and (iii), we generated 20 instances.

                              As the disruption start time increases, the number of states increases, so the time required to solve an instance also increases for both algorithms;

Algorithm STAA does not perform better than algorithm STDP as expected. The reasons are twofold. One is that in each iteration j, there are two new states generated from each state in 
                                    
                                       S
                                       j
                                    
                                  in algorithm STDP, while in algorithm STAA there are three new states generated. Another is that δ becomes small as the problem size increases, so it becomes more difficult for the quaternarys (t
                                 1, t

                                 2) to fall within the same 4-dimensional subinterval, implying that the elimination rule 1 in algorithm STAA cannot efficiently eliminate the dominated states;

The benefits of Algorithm STAA are particularly evident when the number of jobs is large.

                                  the number of jobs that algorithms STDP and STAA are capable of solving within 3600 seconds decreases and algorithm STAA generates more Pareto-optimal points as the number of machines increases;

As stated above, algorithm STAA does not perform better than algorithm STDP as expected;

As expected, algorithm STDP performs poorly as the number of disrupted machines increases.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we introduce a rescheduling model in which both the original scheduling objective, i.e., the total completion time, and the deviation cost associated with a disruption of the original schedule in the presence of machine breakdowns are taken into account. The disruption cost is measured as the maximum time deviation or the total virtual tardiness with respect to the original schedule. For each variant, we show that the case where the number of machines is considered to be part of the input is 
                        NP
                     -hard in the strong sense, and develop a pseudo-polynomial-time solution algorithm for finding the set of Pareto-optimal solutions for the case with a fixed number of machines, establishing that it is 
                        NP
                     -hard in the ordinary sense. For the variant where the disruption cost is modelled as the total virtual tardiness and the machine disruption occurs only on one of the machines, we also develop a two-dimensional FPTAS. Several important issues are interesting for future research.

Design efficient two-dimensional FPTAS or constant ratio approximation algorithms for the variant where the disruption cost is modelled as the maximum time deviation and machine disruption occurs only on one of the machines.

Design efficient algorithms for the case of the problem with an arbitrary number of machines by using mixed integer linear programming techniques, such as column generation, Lagrangian relaxation, branch-and-bound, or branch-and-price.

Extending our model to consider different disruption events (e.g., new order arrivals, processing delays, etc.) and/or different machine environments (e.g., flowshop).
