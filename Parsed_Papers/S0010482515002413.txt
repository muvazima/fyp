                  MicroRNA is a type of single stranded RNA molecule and has an important role for gene expression. Although there have been a number of computational methodologies in bioinformatics research for miRNA classification and target prediction tasks, analysis of shared miRNAs among different species has not yet been addressed. In this article, we analyzed miRNAs that have the same name and function but have different sequences and belong to different (but closely related) species which are constructed from the online miRBase database. We used sequence-driven features and performed the standard and the ensemble versions of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). However, due to its sensitivity to noise and outliers, we extended it using an ensemble approach. Using linear combinations of dimer features, the proposed Ensemble CCA (ECCA) method has identified higher test-set-correlations than CCA. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the Redundancy Index of ECCA applied to a pair of species has correlation with their genetic distance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

MicroRNA (miRNA) is a type of single stranded RNA molecule that is approximately 21–23 nucleotides long and responsible from the arrangement of gene expressions [1–6]. miRNAs are non-coding RNAs, i.e. they are coded by genes that are not translated into proteins but is transcribed by DNA [7]. Primer transcripts known as pri-miRNAs are processed and first transformed into pre-miRNA hairpin loop and then functional miRNA. Researchers have reported in humans that miRNAs regulate many fundamental cellular functions, therefore the abnormal levels of miRNA levels in cells is linked to the development of cancer [8,9]. The effect of miRNAs as oncogenes or tumor suppressors during tumor development stages has also been addressed [10,11]. Therefore, a working knowledge of miRNAs is very important for early detection and treatment of cancer and may be associated with several other diseases [12].

In the literature, most of the machine learning studies dealing with miRNAs addresses the identification of miRNA target predictions and mRNA target sequences by using classification techniques such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Malik et al. [13] used Naive Bayes classifier to predict miRNA target predictions. As input to Naive Bayes classifier, they proposed to use features extracted from both the seed and ‘out seed’ sequences and the duplex structures. A big amount of mature miRNA and a collection of several confirmed miRNA targets were used to generate the positive and negative classes. They concluded that the seed segment is the most important factor in target selection. Thus, because out-seed segment has an important role in the target interaction for miRNAs, both seed and out-seed regions of the miRNA sequence are included in their feature set. Chenghai [14] aimed to classify real pre-miRNA by feeding the combination of sequence and structure information of stem loops extracted from hairpin sequences as input to SVMs. In [15], a cancer classification method that aims to detect some abnormal miRNA expression patterns was proposed. They used a mutual information based method to evaluate the subsets of miRNAs. In another study [16], a classification method based on pre-miRNAs was proposed for the predicton of human miRNA gene. The main idea of this approach is to identify pre-miRNAs among hairpin structure of the human genome. The dataset contains ncRNA and pseudo hairpins as one class and human pre-miRNA sequences and non-redundant sequences folded into hairpin secondary structure as the other. Several sequence and folding features have been used to discriminate these classes by an SVM classifier. To improve the accuracy of these studies, ensemble learning, a recently popular technique that combines multiple models to finally obtain a robust model, has also been recently used in miRNA classification tasks [17]. As an application of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to miRNAs, the study in [18] looks for the phylogenetic dependence between the investigations of biological species. Another approach has used CCA for both univariate and multivariate gene-based tests of association [19].

Although a large number of machine learning methods have been effectively used for analyzing miRNA sequence features for classification and target prediction tasks, the analysis of shared miRNAs among species has not yet been addressed in the literature. Moreover, instead of using the classical CCA, to avoid its shortcomings, we used our proposed ensemble CCA method [20]. Traditionally, sequence based features such as Minimum Free Energy (MFE), individual base frequencies, individual dimer frequencies, or percent GC content, %(G+C), can all express some correlation between common miRNAs of different species; however, in this paper we show that CCA and ECCA can better identify maximally correlated weighted/linear combinations of these sequence features.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we firstly describe the miRNAs dataset used for our analyses, and then give a brief review of classical CCA and our proposed Ensemble CCA method. We present the simulation results in Section 3. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of our results in Section 4.

Shared miRNAs have the same name and function but have different sequences and belong to different (but closely related) species. miRNA precursors used in the analysis belong to different species (15 in total) were derived from mirBase which is a searchable database for all published miRNA sequences and occurrence [21–24]. Each entry of sequence database represents hairpin portion of miRNAs with information on the location and sequences of the pre-miRNA and mature miRNA. We first analyze shared miRNA precursors among the species (see 
                        Table 1). We chose some species pairs that have a descent number of shared miRNAs (>90). Along with the species that are siblings in the biological tree, we included closely related non-sibling species pairs as well.

The number of shared miRNAs between the analyzed species pairs demonstrates that species pairs with sibling relationship have more common miRNAs than the others (see 
                        Table 2).

For instance, when let-7a-1 miRNA precursor sequences of Equus caballus and Canis familiaris species are aligned (see 
                        Fig. 1), it is seen that shared miRNAs have similar sequences but not exactly the same. Hence, the nature and extent of relations between them need exploration.

The proposed ensemble CCA approach is based on combining weak subsample correlations to obtain a strong reliable correlation. As CCA [25–27] has some generalization problems due to the use of sensitive sample covariance matrices in its formulation especially when the dataset dimensionality is high with respect to the number of samples, we apply our recently proposed Ensemble Canonical Correlation Analysis (ECCA) method [28] to explore the relations between shared miRNAs among different species. The aim of ECCA is combining multiple CCA applications on several subsamples of the given dataset.

In ECCA algorithm, the original training sets of views are resampled to produce

                         subsample pairs of X and datasets. Subsequently, CCA is used to extract the covariate set of each subsample pairs. The next task that needs to be addressed is combining the covariate sets of subsample pairs in order to obtain the final covariate set. However, these matrices cannot be combined horizontally or vertically into a covariate set matrix due to the sample and covariate correspondence problems. Therefore, the covariates sets extracted from the subsamples of the ensemble must be combined in a more sophisticated matrix which does not suffer from sample and covariate correspondence problems. Thus, in our previous study [28], we proposed to use a sophisticated matrix called covariate correspondence matrix to combine the covariate sets of subsample pairs. In simple terms, each column of the covariate correspondence matrix is constituted by projecting all the subsamples onto the set of canonical vectors which has been extracted between the subsample pair that corresponds to that column.

In this CCA-based analysis, we have used miRNAs that have the same name and function but have different sequences and belong to different (but closely related) species. That is, miRNAs of one species forms one set of variables and the miRNAs of the other forms the second as seen in 
                        Fig. 2.

As an example, Canis familiaris and Equus caballus are two species that have totally 323 and 341 miRNAs respectively, however, only 222 of them are common. Thus, rather than finding what makes miRNAs of two species different, we try to find what makes them similar. With the function of measuring the linear relations between two multidimensional sequence features and its originality of its application to miRNA research, CCA is a statistical tool that fits well with the goals of this study. The individual base frequencies, individual dimer frequencies, percent GC content, and features like Minimum Free Energy (MFE) can all express some correlation between common miRNAs of different species; however, CCA can identify the maximally correlated weighted/linear combinations of these frequencies [29]. Since CCA identifies weighted combinations of base frequency features, it is possible to go beyond measuring GC content (G+C) of one species versus GC content of the other. That is, CCA discovers a formula for maximally correlated features, e.g. (2G+3C) feature of one species versus (A+4T) feature of the other might give better correlations.

We show that the ensemble CCA approach discovers correlated functions that generalize better than those found by CCA. We showed that the possibility of analyzing genetic distance by using CCA and ensemble CCA approaches and are not contented with simply correlations, thus, we used redundancy index in order to ensure the robustness of the CCA and ensemble CCA correlations. For the numerical simulations, all pairs with high number of common (and also dissimilar) miRNAs have been chosen to be used in this study. Thereby, species pairs having under 90 common miRNAs are not used so that some example can be spared for the test set. Only a small portion of common miRNAs (randomly selected 40 of them) were used for training the CCA/ECCA methods and the correlations were validated on the rest of the (hold-out) examples in the miRNA datasets (as shown in Table 2).

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this section, we intend to demonstrate that the similarity functions can be obtained between the species. The discovery of the miRNAs that have the same name and function but have different sequences belong to different species evocates the question “why?”. The question “why?” leads to the correlation. Correlation technique is one of the most common methods used to determine mutual similarity relationships.

In the application of two correlation techniques CCA and ECCA, the miRNAs of one species forms one set of variables (view) and the miRNAs of the other forms the second. The nucleotide composition dataset that we called the base dataset, constitutes alphabet of 4 bases

                        . Each element of β represents one of the 16 features which are the counts of the pairs of base nucleotides. Another important feature we used is the GC content. In molecular biology and genetics, GC content is the ratio of G(guanine) and C(cytosine) to all bases in a DNA/RNA molecule. While AT pairs are bounded by two hydrogen bonds, GC pairs are bounded by three hydrogen bonds. That is why the energy released by GC content is higher than the others which makes high-GC-content RNA structures more tolerant to higher temperatures. Since some species pairs have small number of shared miRNAs (~90), we generated the training set by randomly choosing 40 samples, and used the rest of the shared miRNAs as the test set for all the species pairs. The train-test splits are repeated 10 times for statistical significance and average correlations are reported. Although we can optimize the number of partitions for ECCA method, we set the number of subsamples to 4 in order to avoid the bias. For both base and dimer datasets, we compared the usage of the counts and percentages of the nucleotides as input features. Percentage values are obtained by normalizing the features with respect to the length of the miRNAs sequence and discarding one of the columns (e.g. the last one) to avoid singularity that results from the fact that the sum of percentages adds up to 1.0.

Test correlations of the most correlated feature explored on the training set by each method over counts and percentages of bases are analyzed (see 
                        
                        Tables 3and 4). Firstly, we must note that the length of the miRNAs sequence (total number of nucleotides in the shared miRNA precursors) gave significant correlation only between Bos taurus – Homo sapiens species. Therefore, it can be deduced that the length of miRNAs that have the same name and function but have different sequences and belong to different (but closely related) species does not need to be correlated [30]. Obviously, the base sequences of shared miRNAs between different species are considerably correlated in general. It is also observed that the test correlations of the relations explored by CCA and ECCA are generally higher than those of the individual bases. The correlations of CCA and ECCA methods are not significantly different from each other when both count and percentage features of the bases are considered. This emerges from the fact that the input dimensionality of the base dataset is not high with respect to the number of training samples (4 input features and 40 training samples). However, CCA with its traditional formulation can already explore correlations that can be generalized to unseen test set examples on such datasets. Clearly, the relations explored with percentages of base nucleotides are more generalizable than those of with counts of base nucleotides. Most correlated miRNA sequences are between Bos taurus – Homo sapiens and Bos taurus – Sus scrofa species (see Tables 3 and 4). Ultimately, species that are under the same class in the biological tree have a tendency to share more common miRNAs and be more correlated by means of precursor sequences. Moreover, p-Values varies between the interval 1,68e-211–6,45e-30 which supports the significance of these correlations.

The high similarity of common mature miRNA sequences between species pairs together with the high correlation of base frequencies yield high CCA/ECCA correlation (e.g. when using common mature miRNA sequences for Canis familiaris & Equus caballus, correlation for basecount frequencies are A(0.85), C(0.83), G(0.76), U(0.77), GC(0.92), CCA(0.81), ECCA(0.81) as seen in Table 3). As a result of high correlations among mature miRNA sequences, we prefered to study on pre-miRNA sequences instead of mature miRNA sequences.

Although GC content is one of the commonly used sequence driven features, it is clearly seen in Tables 3 and 4 that its correlations are smaller than those found by CCA and ECCA. The test correlations of the most correlated feature over dimers are also analyzed (see 
                        Table 5). Corresponding table shows the count and percentage values of related correlations. The count of dimer correlations demonstrates the real number of dimer features while the percentage dimer correlations demonstrates the individual dimer values divided by the total number of dimer values. The most remarkable point is the superiority of ECCA over CCA with count features which are due to the sensitivity problems of the classical CCA with low N/n ratio where N is the number of training samples and n is the number of features. For the half of the species pairs, the highest individual dimer correlation is obtained with UA dimer. Here, ECCA gave the highest test correlation between Bos Taurus – Homo sapiens species. The relations between shared miRNA sequences of Bos taurus–Sus scrofa and Equus caballus–Homo sapiens are also highly correlated.

As stated in Table 5, for most of the species pairs, average correlations of individual dimers and ECCA correlations are comparable while the top individual dimer correlations are higher than the correlation of the first ECCA covariate. However, since the next most correlated individual base/dimers will already be correlated with the most correlated one (i.e. they will not be orthogonal to each other), it is meaningless to explore further relations other than the one with the highest correlation by using the individual base/dimer analysis.

Genetic distance represents the genetic divergence between species, thereby, large genetic distance refers to a distant genetic relationship while a short genetic distance stands for a close genetic relationship. We found out that as the species get closer in the phylogenetic tree, the number of shared miRNAs increases. Therefore, it can be inferred that species under the same class have higher number of common miRNAs and close relationship rather than the species under different classes in the phylogenetic tree. CMD and class information in phylogenetic tree of the analyzed species support this inference as shown in 
                        Table 6.

On the other hand, since the correlations obtained using CCA/ECCA methods on sequence-driven features yield some correlations between species, these correlations are also naturally expected to reflect the genetic relationships between the species; i.e. the stronger canonical correlation is, the smaller genetic distance the two species have. However, it has been known in the literature that strong canonical correlations can be obtained between two variates even though these variates do not represent significant portions of variance from their variable sets. In other words, the correlations can be dummy and due to only a single variable or very few variables. To overcome the bias and uncertainty in using canonical correlations, Redundancy Index (RI) has been proposed [31]. We showed the results of CMD, RI for CCA, RI for ECCA among basecount and dimercount features and lastly JI for all species pairs in 
                        Table 7. Low-CMD and JI in Table 7 demonstrate that these species have genetic relationship and similar to each other. Thus, CCA/ECCA are able to detect this relationship. To show that RI of CCA and ECCA correlates with the CMD, common miRNAs of species pairs are represented by extracting sequence driven features such as basecount, dimercount and trimer features (
                        Table 8).


                        Trimers can be considered relatively high-dimensional (64 trimers) given that there are a small number of samples in the training set. Dimension reduction is performed on trimer features to a lower-dimensional space in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional representation is maximized (>0.95). However, PCA space is not appropriate for RI computation because the dimensions are orthogonal that causes RI values to be unfairly poor. Therefore, in order to perform CCA/ECCA methods and RI computation as usual, we used reconstruction to go back to the original 64 dimensions from the reduced dataset.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this paper, we present a computational approach based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) over miRNAs which have an important role on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the relations between the shared miRNAs of species rather than the classification and discriminative methods used in the literature on miRNAs. We improved the generalization of CCA by using the ensemble version of CCA (ECCA). We performed simulations to measure the test correlations on the hold out test examples between the shared miRNAs of various pairs of species and found out that ECCA correlations outperform those of CCA, the classical sequence based features such as base or dimer percent correlations, GC%, and Minimum Free Energy. Experimental results show that ECCA works better than CCA when using a small size training set and high number of dimensions (such as 16 when using dimers). Moreover, the correlations are generally higher when the two species belong to the same biological class and have a high number of shared miRNAs; whereas for species in different classes, the correlations are lower even if they have a large number of shared miRNAs. We also clarified that there is a strong negative correlation between Redundancy Index (RI) of CCA/ECCA and genetic distance of the paired species. Pairs with better redundancy indices (higher RI) have smaller genetic distance. It can also be concluded that the nucleotide composition (bases) and dimers have higher RI than trimers. Therefore, trimers or higher order features should not be considered more informative for this task. Another observation is that, ECCA produces better RI indices than those of CCA. This strengthens our argument that ECCA is more robust than CCA when using small datasets. Future work will mainly cover the development of predicting the secondary structures using RNA fold or other structure prediction tools. Considering structural information and features can result in better predictions as structures are more conserved than sequence information.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

Species that can be expressed phylogenetically have genetic relationships between each other. In this study, we demonstrate an alternative way of analyzing genetic relationships between species by means of utilizing miRNA precursor sequences rather than ordinary sequences used in the literature. The number of common miRNAs among the species that belong to the same class in a phylogenetic tree is higher than the number of common miRNAs under different classes. Genetic relationships between organisms can be examined not only through common genes but also via common miRNA sequences. Two machine learning methods CCA and ECCA are able to identify these relationships. In order to overcome the uncertainty of CCA/ECCA correlations on multivariate data, Redundancy Index(RI) can be used. A high correlation between the RI and genetic distance obtained by the utilization of common miRNAs of species, describes the genetic relationship in a more reliable manner.
