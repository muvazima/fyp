                  Dengue virus can ignite both protective and pathogenic responses in human. The pathogenesis is related with modified functioning of our immune system during infection. Pattern recognition receptors like Toll like receptor 3 is vital for the induction of innate immunity in case of Dengue infection. Toll like receptor 3 induces TRIF mediated activation of Type 1 interferons and Fc receptor mediated induction of cytokines. Interferons have been related with clearance of Dengue virus but it has adopted modified regulatory mechanisms to counter this effect. SOCS protein is also induced due to the interferon and cytokine mediated signalling which can subsequently play its part in the regulation of interferon and cytokine production. Our hypothesis in this study relates the pathogenesis of Dengue virus with the SOCS mediated inhibition of our innate immunity. We used the qualitative formalism of René Thomas to model the biological regulatory network of Toll like receptor 3 mediated signalling pathway in an association with pathogenesis of dengue. Logical parameters for the qualitative modelling were inferred using a model checking approach implemented in SMBioNet. A linear hybrid model, parametric linear hybrid automaton, was constructed to incorporate the activation and inhibition time delays in the qualitative model. The qualitative model captured all the possible expression dynamics of the proteins in the form of paths, some of which were observed as abstract cycles (representing homoeostasis) and diverging paths towards stable states. The analysis of the qualitative model highlighted the importance of SOCS protein in elevating propagation of dengue virus through inhibition of type 1 interferons. Detailed qualitative analysis of regulatory network endorses our hypothesis that elevated levels of cytokine subsequently induce SOCS expression which in turn results into the continuous down-regulation of Toll like receptor 3 and interferon. This may result into the Dengue pathogenesis during the stage of immunosuppression. Further analysis with HyTech (HYbrid TECHnology) tool provided us with the real-time constraints (delay constraints) of the proteins involved in the cyclic paths of the regulatory network backing the evidence provided by the qualitative analysis. The HyTech results also suggest that the role of SOCS is vital in homoeostasis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The incidences of dengue (DENV) fever have increased 30-fold in the last five decades (Deen et al., 2006). Today nearly 2.5 billion people, i.e. about 40 percent of the world population, is living in areas where there is a risk of DENV transmission. It has been reported as endemic in at least 100 countries (Guha-Sapir et al., 2005). According to a recent report of World Health Organization (WHO), around 50–100 million DENV infections occur per annum including 500,000 cases of DENV haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and 22,000 cases of mortality worldwide (C. for Disease Control, in press; Organization et al., 2014).

Dengue virus belongs to the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. It has four serotypes including DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 (Atkinson, 2010; Organization et al., 2009). Transmission of the virus is mainly caused through the bites of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Female Aedes aegypti acquires this virus from the blood of an infected person (Rao and Durvasula, 2013; Kramer and Kauffman, 2008). The virus infects the mid-gut of the mosquito and transfers to the salivary glands over a period of 8–12 days, which then is transmitted to humans on next bite (Sam et al., 2013). The DENV virus after entering the systemic circulation replicates within the cell of mononuclear phagocyte lineage (macrophages, monocytes and B-cells). DENV infections may result in dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) marked with high fever, skin rash, headache and severe muscular and joint pains (Lam et al., 2013; Sam et al., 2013).

Recent studies implicates that the course of DENV infection has been attributed to the innate immunity, particularly generated by the pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (De Kruif et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2009; Tsai et al., 2009). TLRs are the part of the innate immune system and activated by the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Akira et al., 2006; Kawai and Akira, 2011). The study of Iwasaki and Medzhitov on human monocytic cells U937 strongly supports the role of TLR3 for inducing immune response against DENV (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004). Fig. 1
                         illustrates the possible signalling events generated by TLR3 during DENV infection. As key players of innate immunity, the recognition of several viruses via TLR is very important for the induction of various cytokines to avert pathogenesis (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004). Several pro-inflammatory cytokines are induced as a result of the TLR3 activation and provide an interface between the innate and adaptive immune responses (Hoebe et al., 2004). Modulation of DENV infection by type 1 interferon alpha/beta (IFNα/β) has been suggested by observing DENV-infected patients and IFNα/β-receptor deficient mice (Ashour et al., 2009). In vitro analysis with several cell types and viral strains proved that DENV viral RNA decreased by multiple folds upon introduction of IFNα/β, however, IFN gamma (γ) showed variable responses depending on the cell type and signalling pathway (Diamond et al., 2000). At the early stage of viral infection, inflammatory response through PRRs provide dominant role in priming and regulating innate immune system (Kulka et al., 2004). Yi-Ting Sai et al. in their study demonstrated the role of TLR3 in mediating strong IFNα/β induction and subsequent inhibition of DENV viral replication, which limits its cytopathic effect (Tsai et al., 2009; Diamond et al., 2000). Type 1 interferons upon their interaction with IFN receptors elicit antiviral, anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory roles. Shresta et al. demonstrated critical and non-overlapping role of IFNα/β in resolving primary DENV infection in genetically deficient mice (Shresta et al., 2004).

Expression of DENV non-structural (NS) proteins including NS2A, NS4A or NS4B in human cells support the elevated replication of an IFN sensitive virus (Muñoz-Jordán et al., 2003). Cells infested with NS4B protein or DENV do not exhibit IFN-α/β mediated induction of nuclear signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1. By blocking STAT1 activities, NS4B protein of DENV may interfere with the IFNα/β mediated antiviral response (Muñoz-Jordán et al., 2003). These findings indicate that NS4B might be involved in blocking IFNα/β signalling during DENV infections.

IFNα/β activate STAT1–STAT3 heterodimers (Qin et al., 2008), followed by SOCS1 and SOCS3 mediated down-regulation (Song and Shuai, 1998). Qin et al. implicated in their study about the up-regulation of IFN mediated induction of SOCS-1, which in return down-regulate IFN signalling and reduce the expression of CD40 cells (Qin et al., 2006; Song and Shuai, 1998). They also proposed the inhibitory mechanism of JAK/STAT phosphorylation which ultimately inhibit the vital signalling cascade for the induction of cytokines (Qin et al., 2006).

Various studies have established the role of Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus pathogenesis (Kliks et al., 1989). The pre-existing antibodies (Abs) are major contributors for development of DHF and DSS and fail in neutralizing the infecting serotype of DENV (Halstead, 2003). The Fc receptors (FcR) family offers a major example of how to promptly trigger, activation and inhibition of the signalling pathway to maintain harmony between innate and adaptive immune response (Ravetch and Lanier, 2000). In accumulation to their exact roles in prompting the activation of innate effector cells, FcγRs also play a role in the regulation of B-cell activation, antigen presentation and immune-complex mediated maturation of the dendritic cells (DCs) (Bolland and Ravetch, 1999). A new hypothesis termed as intrinsic ADE, suggests that DENV internalization via FcγR results in the induction of interleukin-10 (IL-10) production, biased T-helper-1 (Th)1 to Th2 response and suppression of innate immunity, which leads to both high levels of antibodies (Abs) and viral load in dengue patients (Ubol et al., 2010; Halstead et al., 2010). Fujii et al. in a recent study, suggested the up-regulation of IL-10 levels via FcγR (Fujii et al., 2013). As a consequence of ADE, complementary mechanism to higher viremia may be explained as FcγR mediated DENV entry due to suppressed antiviral immune response. In the case of DENV infection, suppressed levels of IL-12, IFNγ, TNFα and nitric oxide along with the elevated levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines tend to provide immunosuppressive environment for viral replication (Chareonsirisuthigul et al., 2007).

Computational systems biology provides a compelling platform to answer critical scientific questions about signalling mechanisms based on pragmatic modelling and theoretical elucidation (Kitano, 2002). Multitude of biological facts have been uncovered by molecular biology including functional properties of the genes and proteins. However, for the interpretation of the dynamics of the biological system, these information require further investigation (Kitano, 2002). To understand the intrinsic complexity of biological systems experimental and computational approaches in combination are speculated to solve this problem (Kitano et al., 2001; Ideker et al., 2002). Various computational approaches assisted with the experimentally observed phenomenon in previous literature helped us to understand the behaviours of the complex biological regulatory networks involved in DENV replication and immune evasion (Ideker et al., 2002). A model that captures biological observations related to physiological and pathological conditions could also predict the underlying dynamics behind these observations: oscillations or cycles, stable states and bifurcation points. Interestingly, the bifurcation points (specific pattern of protein interactions), may play a role in leading the system towards pathogenic state, can provide us an insight about the useful therapeutic target. Thus, instead of targeting proteins in the pathogenic state (abnormal physiological state) drugs may target entities involved in the interactions causing the physiological abnormalities. We predicted with the help of a qualitative model the underlying causes of the hyper-inflammatory condition in the case of cerebral malaria (CM) pathogenesis (Ahmad et al., 2012). The model predicted that longer activation and interactions of two proteins BTK and MAL, and the pre-existing high levels of cytokines play key role in the pathogenesis of CM. The later hypothesis was validated with a study conducted by Franklin et al. (2011) (Khor et al., 2007; Hamann et al., 2009; Ferwerda et al., 2009; Ramasawmy et al., 2009) which emphasizes the relationship between elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and CM. Our recent study (Paracha et al., 2014) shows a strong affinity of BTK with MAL protein. These studies suggest that the expression dynamics of the pathway should be studied in order to have an understanding of the behaviours of the systems and to predict drug targets which would ultimately increase our confidence about the potential drugs and would accelerate the drug design process.

For the last few decades, formal methods have received the attention of researchers in various disciplines to formally model and verify complex systems. Model checking is an automatic formal verification technique which exhaustively explore dynamics of a system formally expressed as automata (
                           M
                        ) to check whether it meets specifications formally expressed as formulas (Φ) (Clarke et al., 1999). Formally, a model checking process is represented as 
                           M
                           ⊨
                           Φ
                        . Verification could be carried out even if the system is parametric and in this case the values of the parameters are synthesised for the properties to be verified (Streck et al., 2012; Henzinger and Wong-Toi, 1995). Thus, parameter synthesis is another key feature of model checking.

In the current study, TLR3 mediated signalling pathway has been studied using the generalized logical approach introduced by René Thomas (Thomas, 1991; Thomas et al., 1995). This approach represents the qualitative analysis of dynamic behaviour of the system with a focus on the feedback mechanisms.

This approach is successfully applied on some other signalling systems including the MyD88-adapter-like (MAL) associated biological regulatory network (BRN) (Ahmad et al., 2012), control of differentiation process in helper T cells (Mendoza, 2006), control of organ differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana flowers (Mendoza et al., 1999) and segmentation during embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster (Thieffry and Sanchez, 2002; Sanchez and Thieffry, 2003). Kinetic formalism of René Thomas and its implementation in GENOTECH (Ahmad et al., 2012) provided us an in silico approach to test hypotheses related to DENV pathogenesis. René Thomas’ logic relies on the discretization of expression levels which can be determined by the qualitative thresholds. The evolution of these levels are driven by the logical parameters. Values of these parameters can be inferred with the help of SMBioNet (Khalis et al., 2009), which implies a model checking approach by first expressing the observations (properties) in Computation Tree Logic (CTL) formulas and then computes all possible sets of parameters leading to models satisfying these observations. Once the reliable set of parameters are determined, the tool GENOTECH then computes the qualitative model showing all the behaviours of the network and where important behaviours can be seen as paths (trajectories), closed paths (cycles) and stable states (see state graph in Section 3). Delays are incorporated in the qualitative model to model the activation and inhibition orders of proteins; which protein activates or deactivates first now depends on their time delays. The values of such parameters can be synthesised using the hybrid model checking tool HyTech (Henzinger et al., 1997).

In this study, we performed a formal analysis of TLR3 signalling pathway using its discrete and hybrid models. In these models, we analysed the role of SOCS protein in the context of TLR3 mediated IFNα/β production in DENV infection. The design of this study is graphically depicted in Section 2. First, the Biological Regulatory Network (BRN) is obtained (Fig. 2
                        ) by keeping the prominent entities (in which we are interested) of the pathway and abstracting the rest, provided that the behaviour is preserved. For example, if an entity ‘A’ activates(→+) ‘B’ which inhibits(→−) ‘C’, and the proteins ‘A’ and ‘C’ are the ones in which we are interested, we simply abstract it to A
                        →
                        −
                        C while implicitly showing the behaviour that ‘A’ inhibits ‘C’ through the activation of ‘B’. This BRN is then used to obtain the logical parameters from SMBioNet. These parameters are used in GENOTECH which computed the qualitative cycles, a stable state, and transformed it into parametric linear hybrid automata in HyTech format. Cycles were showing the oscillations of all proteins while the stable state was showing the over-expression of SOCS along with DENV. The delay constraints of a significant cycle, representing its invariance kernel (a set of cyclic trajectories which start and end at the same point, see Definition 2.12, (Ahmad and Roux, 2010)), were computed by the analysis of parametric linear hybrid automaton (hybrid model) of TLR3 signalling pathway in HyTech tool. The computation of the invariance kernel enabled us to observe the sustained cyclic nature of this cycle, as well as the possible delay values in the form of linear constraints. Our study implicates that when SOCS was oscillating within the qualitative cycles then all the other proteins of the pathway including SOCS itself were showing sustained oscillations in the hybrid model. Our analysis suggests that altered oscillatory behaviours of SOCS protein play a vital role in the inhibition of TLR3 mediated IFNα/β production, which ultimately results in the down-regulated immune response with subsequent elevation in DENV titre.

@&#METHODS@&#

Usually, biological systems are represented by conventional models having differential equations referring to the time derivative of different quantities such as concentrations, temperatures and rates. As a result of inherent complexity of biological systems, little is known exactly about these entities. In the year 1970, René Thomas (Thomas, 1991) presented a Boolean logic based method to model biological regulatory networks. He presented the efficacy of his modelling methodology by checking the lambda phage genetic switch (Thomas, 1991; Mendoza et al., 1999; Mendoza, 2006). René Thomas noted the limitations in Boolean logic as it has only two levels, 0 or 1, that are not able to formalize related problems. So, Thomas generalized the Boolean logic to “kinetic logic” and proved the efficacy of the methodology by utilizing it in different genetic regulatory systems (Thomas, 1978, 1991; Thomas and d’Ari, 1990; Snoussi and Thomas, 1993; Thomas et al., 1995, 1998; Demongeot et al., 2000; Thomas and Kaufman, 2001), and found it to be efficient in approximating the differential equations based modelling (Thomas and d’Ari, 1990).

Kinetic logic formalism models biological regulatory networks (BRNs) based on the qualitative threshold levels of entities and their types of interactions (Thomas and d’Ari, 1990). Value of at least “1” as minimum threshold for any entity is required to bring a positive or negative change in the target entity (Thomas, 1979). Entities are representing proteins, genes or both of them that can interact with each other to bring positive or negative effects showing stimulatory or inhibitory effects on the system, respectively. Positive effect shows that the expression level of an entity increases the rate of activation or production of other entity, whereas, negative effect reduces the rate of activation. Biological activation and inactivation are sigmoidal (non-linear bounded curve) in nature and are discussed below. The following definitions and concepts define the kinetic logic formalism and are mainly adopted from (Ahmad et al., 2012).

If an entity e
                           1 enhances the rate of synthesis or activation of another entity e
                           2 then e
                           1 is the positive regulator for e
                           2. In this case, every time the concentration of e
                           1 enhances or reduces, it will affect the concentration of e
                           2 in similar manner. This relationship can be shown by sigmoidal nature. The sigmoidal curve can be shown by its step function and is shown in Fig. 4
                            A. We can see that below a threshold level θ, e
                           1 slightly changes the rate of activation of e
                           2. But as soon as the concentration of e
                           1 reaches its threshold level θ, the rate of activation of e
                           2 elevates rapidly to a level where it saturates its target entity e
                           2. So, we can say that when e
                           1
                           <
                           θ it can not bring any positive change and if e
                           1
                           ≥
                           θ then e
                           1 can bring the positive change in e
                           2.

If an entity e
                           3 decreases the rate of activation of another entity e
                           4, then e
                           3 can be called as negative regulator or inhibitor of e
                           4 and the process is called as negative regulation or inhibition. The process of inhibition also depends on the threshold levels of e
                           3 showing that whenever the concentration level of e
                           3 reaches its threshold level then e
                           3 will be efficient in decreasing the activation levels of e
                           4, up to a level where e
                           4 can be completely inactivated or its affect in the system is abolished. The affect of inhibition is also of sigmoidal nature and is shown in Fig. 4 B along with its step function.

                        Table 1 represents the state table of running example which shows all the possible states, set of resources and logical parameters. This table helps to construct the state graph which captures all the behaviours of the running example. Two stable states namely (000) and (111) can be observed clearly in the state graph shown in Fig. 6
                        .

GENOTECH (Ahmad et al., 2012) constructs a qualitative model of BRNs according to Thomas’ formalism and produce the state graph, which shows the dynamical behaviour of a BRN. Modelling is facilitated by GUIs, which allow to construct a BRN as directed labelled graph. The tool can perform the basic analyses of the state graph like the identification of stable states, cycles and path finding between two states. The state graph can be saved in DOT format (Gansner et al., 2006) for further study in the Graphviz tool (Ellson et al., 2004).

Although René Thomas framework captures the qualitative dynamics of biological regulatory networks, its semantics are derived from the values of logical parameters. Once the state graph is generated by assuming a certain value of these parameters, it is still required to manually verify the model against some known observations. This manual process is quite time expensive even for small BRNs containing only two entities. Model Checking is one of the formal techniques in computer science that verifies models against specification formally expressed as temporal logic formulas. Bernot et al.(Bernot et al., 2004) applied model checking to reverse engineer the values of logical parameters from biological observations specified as CTL (Computational Tree Logic) formulas. This technique is based on exhaustive enumeration of parameters values, each time a parameter combination is used to generate the state graph. Finally, by invoking a model checker, the verification of CTL formulas is carried out and all parameters that are coherent with CTL formulas are selected as set of acceptable parameters. Thus model checking solves this problem by not only expressing biological behaviours in a formal temporal language but also reverse engineering the values of logical parameters.

A path is a sequence of states in a state graph. In Computational Tree Logic (CTL), properties are checked in the state graph by applying quantifiers to the paths originating from a given state, as well as the states occurring on each of the originating paths. Description of each of the quantifiers is given below:
                              
                                 •
                                 
                                    A: This is a path quantifier which enforces that a given property should hold in all paths originating from the given state. The quantifier itself is read as “For all paths”.


                                    E: Known as “Existential Quantifier”, this is also a path quantifier which enforces that a given property must hold in at least one path originating from the given state. The quantifier is read as “There exists a path”.


                                    G: This quantifier is known as the “Global Quantifier” and is a state quantifier which enforces that a property holds in all states of a path originating from the given state, inclusive of the given state as well. It is read as “globally”.


                                    F: The “Future Quantifier” is the second state quantifier and enforces that a given property must hold in one of the future states in the path originating from the given state. It is read as “in future” or “eventually”. The future quantifiers also covers the current/given state as well when checking the property.


                                    X: The “Next Quantifier” is the third state quantifier and enforces that a given property must hold in the immediate successor state. It is read as “next”.

The usual format for a CTL formula is ϕ
                           ={A/E}{G/F/X}{ψ/ϕ} where ψ is a predicate representing a property and ϕ another CTL formula. Then, this format allows nesting of quantifiers.

SMBioNet (Bernot et al., 2004; Richard et al., 2006, 2012; Khalis et al., 2009) is a tool for the parameter enumeration of Biological Regulatory Networks (BRNs), based on the Discrete Framework of René Thomas (Thomas, 1991). Given a model of BRN in the form of Thomas network and behavioural properties (observations), expressed as CTL formulas, SMBioNet exhaustively enumerates all compatible parametrizations by generating a state graph for each parameter combination and by verifying the formulas on each state graph. The verification of CTL property is performed by invoking model checker NuSMV (Cimatti et al., 2002). The parameter combinations are reduced by applying Snoussi and observability constraints (Chadoeuf et al., 2000). Finally, all the models that satisfy CTL properties are short-listed. SMBioNet has been applied in studies like tail resorption in tadpole metamorphosis (Khalis et al., 2009) and immunity control in bacteriophage lambda (Richard et al., 2006).

Hybrid modelling merges the discrete modelling with the continuous domain of time via special variables called ‘clocks’. Likewise, the transitions are characterised as discrete and continuous where,
                           
                              •
                              Discrete transitions represent instantaneous switching of locations or states, and

Continuous transitions represent elapsing of time within the same location or state.

The natural environment of the cell is difficult to accurately model through discrete modelling frameworks. Take the concentration of a protein for instance – the discrete model represent their expression levels as positive integers where a protein is at ‘0’ level at one instance, and immediately jumps to ‘1’ level the very next instance. This does not accurately replicate the continuous process of increasing expressions that proteins go through in the natural cellular environment. Ahmad et al. (Ahmad et al., 2008) proposed the use of piecewise linear curves for the modelling of the sigmoidal nature of protein expression (Fig. 7
                        ), as opposed to the step functions used in discrete models.

Clock variables are used to measure the ‘delays’ (the time duration) that needs to pass between two consecutive expression levels. Thus a clock variable h is associated with each protein in the BRN. The initial values of each h are set to zero, which then approach either d
                        + or d
                        −. d
                        + signifies production delay, that is, the delay required to increase the associated proteins concentration level by 1. Similarly, d
                        − signifies the degradation delay, that is, the delay to decrease the said concentration by a single level. The rate of evolution of each h is given by the first order derivative dh/dt
                        =
                        r where r
                        ∈{0, 1, −1} (Ahmad et al., 2008, 2007).

In most cases, the exact values of the delays associated with the proteins are not known which is why unvalued parametric delays are instead used (Ahmad et al., 2012). Thus, the hybrid model was constructed using Parametric Bio Linear Hybrid Automaton (Ahmad, 2009) defined below and given as Supplementary File 3.

The BRN given in Fig. 2 comprises four entities; namely DENV, IFNα/β, TLR3 and SOCS. DENV activates TLR3 and SOCS, which then formulates a positive feedback loop with IFNα/β due to the even number of negative interactions involved in this loop. The presence of SOCS inhibits the synthesis of IFNα/β and TLR3, while its own production is positively regulated by IFNα/β. Thresholds fixed by variables TLR3, IFNα/β, SOCS and DENV lead to a total of 16 possible states in the state graph. The state of the system at any given time is represented by a vector (TLR3, IFNα/β, SOCS, DENV). Before the infestations of DENV, all the proteins that participate in this network are absent. Hence, (TLR3=0 & IFNα/β=0 & SOCS=0 & DENV=0) constitutes a starting state of the system. The presence of two responses within the same network, derived from the literature, implies that there exist two possible paths starting from the initial state i.e. from all zeros state, can proceed towards DENV clearance and a pathogenic state (Vaughn et al., 2000). The DENV clearance or normal state is known to be characterized by low titres of DENV, whereas the pathogenic state is characterized by its high titre and elevated levels of SOCS (Xi et al., 2008). These two observations are encoded in CTL formulas as described in following equations.

The desirable qualitative model of DENV should contain closed or cyclic paths, which originate from an initial state, represented by all zeros state, and then return back to its original position from where it started. Closed or cyclic paths actually represent the homoeostasis of the immune system, however, a diseased state can be achieved if homoeostasis could not be maintained. Along with the presence of closed paths or cycles in the dynamics of DENV infection, pathogenesis can be encountered if dynamics proceed towards the stable steady state (0011). The first formula, denoted as Φ
                           α
                         models the behaviour of the BRN that reflects that pathogenic state is reachable from an initial state and remains as its future state. If the future state persists for a long time then we can call this as stable state.

The second property, given as Φ
                           β
                         expresses that starting from an initial state, the immune system is able to reset its configurations by going back to its original position and maintain the immune homoeostasis. The formula Φ combines (conjuncts) these two properties and is used for the selection of models by SMBioNet. SMBioNet selects 43 sets of parameters (each set represents a specific qualitative model) (Supplementary File 1) that satisfy the above mentioned CTL formula. These qualitative models were then further analysed in GENOTECH by generating state graphs, which allowed us to analyse the expression patterns of the proteins, cyclic paths, stable states and the dynamics of the BRN. The selected set of parameters given in Table 2
                         were used to model the BRN Fig. 2, which gives a state graph shown in Fig. 9
                        . This model was selected since it incorporates the above mentioned observations in the form of a stable state (0011) and homoeostasis, represented by the qualitative cycles visible in Fig. 9. In particular, we are interested in the cycle which follows well ordered regulation pattern evident in the TLR3 pathway (Fig. 1) where the occurrence of DENV activates TLR3 which in turn activates IFN before the activation of SOCS. The activation of IFN suppresses DENV resulting in the down regulation of TLR3 and in the up regulation of SOCS. Finally, IFN is down regulated by the presence of SOCS, which is then degraded in the absence of its activators.

This biologically plausible pattern is found in 9 models out of 43, and is represented as (0000) → (0001) → (1001) → (1101) → (1100) → (0100) → (0110) → (0010) → (0000). The detailed method for the selection of a single parameter set (given in Table 2) from the 9 sets is provided in Supplementary File 5. It is important to note that the change in the parameters (that is, if any parametrisation from the other enumerated sets is selected) will change the qualitative dynamics of the BRN. This in turn will change the hybrid model (see Section 3.3), affecting the delay constraints themselves, as well as their biological implications and significance.

This section presents the results obtained by the modelling and analysis in GENOTECH, which simulate the model according to René Thomas’ formalism. This tool is used to model BRN along with the usage of set of logical parameters obtained from SMBioNet. As output, this gives a state graph (Fig. 9) showing the paths between any two states (transitions), stable states and possible cycles among different states. The state graph represents all possible transitions from one state to another, where each state shows the expression levels of every entity at a particular time. From a stable state, which is like a sink, the system does not evolve to other states so has been termed as stable (pathogenic) state. The state (0000) represents that all entities are at zero level while (0001) shows the presence of DENV. These two states are included in all the cycles of the BRN as shown by solid arrows (Fig. 9). The tendencies of divergence from cycles towards stable state (0011) are also shown by dashed edges. The cycles in the state graph represent the homoeostasis of the BRN to overcome or control the level of the viral load and clear infection. The stable state shows the elevated levels of both DENV and SOCS representing the pathogenic behaviour.

As these cycles are time-abstract cycles therefore, their exact nature (sustained oscillation or damped oscillation) cannot be predicted in qualitative models. Thus, with time-delays, their nature can be predicted in the analysis of the hybrid model, where a convergence of the invariance kernel algorithm shows sustained oscillations, while non-convergence shows damped oscillations.

In this section, we present the HyTech results regarding the invariance kernel of the BRN. Invariance kernels are linear time constraints represented as conjuncted relations between different clocks of the automaton. These delays provide us the timing (of activation and inhibition) for the involved proteins which govern a particular set of trajectories resulting in a cycle. If a conjuncted constraint relation of an invariance kernel becomes false, the trajectories will deviate from cycles and might even result in a stable (pathogenic) state.


                        Table 3
                         shows the complete trajectory of the cycle discussed in Section 3.1, along with its invariance kernel. As the other cycles in the state graph (see Fig. 6) themselves are small perturbations of this one, the invariance kernel was computed only for this cycle, detailing the delay constraints governing the trajectory. The table also allows us to list the relations (≤, <, ≥, >, =) between the individual delays in the form of a matrix (given in Table 4
                        ) computed by using a linear constraint solver over finite ranges for each delay (the computed sets are provided in Supplementary File 2).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Dengue infection is the form of critical disease that shows the symptoms even before the activation of adaptive immune response (Sariol et al., 2011). This infection also presents viral particles to various organs, such as liver, spleen, lymph nodes, brain and spinal cord by inhibiting the IFNα/β mediated signalling pathways (Shresta et al., 2004). Previous studies showed that DENV uses its NS proteins to down regulated the IFN induction, which is very necessary to control the DENV infection in early phases of its progression (Guzmán and Kouri, 2002). More than 300 IFN stimulated genes are induced as a result of the activation of Janus Kinase (JAK), Tyrosine Kinase (Tyk) signal transducers and activation of transcription (STAT)1/2 and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) when IFNs bind to cell surface receptors (Borden et al., 2007). For the clearance of DENV particularly in early stages of infection, TLR3 mediated IFN production is very critical in determining course of pathogenesis. However, uncontrolled TLR signalling results in chronic inflammation, infectious disease propagation and autoimmune disorders (Cook et al., 2004). Therefore to maintain the immune balance TLR signalling and subsequent functions must be tightly controlled. Various TLR signalling suppressors have been identified including SOCS proteins, which play important role in maintaining the homoeostasis both in pathogen titre versus cytokine mediated hyperinflammation. Our BRN results also endorse that timely activation and deactivation of SOCS protein is crucial in progression of pathogenesis and clearance of DENV infection.

The qualitative model (state graph) (Fig. 9) of the TLR3 associated BRN in DENV infection encompasses three types of behaviours which include cycles representing homoeostasis, the stable state (in red) representing pathogenesis and the perturbations (in yellow). In addition to cycles, various bifurcation states also exist in the state graph which can lead the system to the stable state/pathogenic state. The bifurcation states are (0010), (1011), (0111) and (0001) and are shown in green colour in the state graph.
                           
                              •
                              The bifurcation state (0010) leads both to the state (0000) of the cycle and to the stable (pathogenic) state (0011). This demonstrates that either the system remains in the cycle by the degradation of SOCS or the high level of SOCS followed by the high titre of DENV may guide the system to pathogenic state.

The bifurcation state (1011) leads to the cycle state (1111) and to the stable (pathogenic) state (0011). From here we predict that the activation of IFN leads the system to the state (1111) and thus may prevent the system from pathogenesis.

The bifurcation state (0111) has two successor states (0110) and (0011) which implies that if IFN degrades before the degradation of DENV then the system will lead to the stable (pathogenic) state (0011).

The state (0001) also bifurcates the system from the cycle towards the stable (pathogenic) state. This suggests that the faster activation of SOCS than TLR3 leads the system to stable (pathogenic) state (0011).

The states (1010) and (0101) represent the states due to perturbation in the system– all the transition from these states always lead to the cycles (successor states are in the cycles). The state (0101) endorses the fact that early treatment with Interferon can avert the system from pathogenic state, which follows the cell line study of Michael S et al. (Diamond et al., 2000) in which the system recovered to the healthy state when it was pretreated with interferon, blocking the propagation of DENV. The subsequent successor states of (1010) show that if IFN does not get activated and SOCS remains active then the system leads to the pathogenic state (0011).

These insights highlight the significance of SOCS protein in pathogenic and healthy out comes of DENV infection and we hypothesize that homoeostasis of SOCS protein along with IFN is essential for recovery from DENV infection. By in-silico study, we also endorse the fact established by Chaturvedi et al. (Chaturvedi et al., 2000) and Green et al. (Green et al., 1999) that high levels of IL-10 (Interleukin-10) can lead to elevated levels of SOCS protein (Green et al., 1999), which is implicitly modelled in our system as the activation of SOCS through DENV. In the late phase of DENV infection, it was observed that Th2 cytokines levels were found elevated in patients which tends to enhance IL-10 level which in turn activates SOCS (Chaturvedi et al., 2000). In the light of these insights, we suggest to explore the role of potential drugs which could inhibit IL-10 and SOCS. In addition, we also suggest to consider IFN therapy in DENV infection as a potential prophylactic agent for clinical trials.

The invariance kernel of the significant cycle, given in Table 3, consists of conjuncted delay constraints of the proteins that remain true within this cycle. It starts with constraint I: 
                           |
                           
                              d
                              DENV
                              −
                           
                           |
                           ≤
                           |
                           
                              d
                              
                                 TLR
                                 3
                              
                              −
                           
                           |
                        , which implies that DENV is degraded or suppressed faster than TLR3. This is significant because TLR3 detects and reacts to the presence of DENV, and is responsible for the production of IFN which leads to the DENV clearance. If the constraint is violated or becomes falsified, then TLR3 would become inactive during DENV presence, representing a possible failure of the immune system of the individual.

The second significant constraint in the invariance kernel, constraint VI, is 
                           
                              d
                              
                                 TLR
                                 3
                              
                              +
                           
                           +
                           |
                           
                              d
                              
                                 TLR
                                 3
                              
                              −
                           
                           |
                           ≤
                           
                              d
                              SOCS
                              +
                           
                        . This implies that the full oscillation of TLR3 (represented as π(TLR3)) is completed before or at the same time as the activation of SOCS. The significance of this constraint lies in comparison with the previously discussed constraint, as well as the haemorrhagic fever state (0011). Given that the previous constraint argues that DENV is supposed to be degraded or suppressed before TLR3, this constraint shows that the activation of SOCS will take more time than the full oscillation π(TLR3) and, by transitivity, will activate after the clearance of DENV, effectively leading the system away from the disease state and towards the recovery state. This inference is further reinforced by the length calculation of this cycle which gives us the equation 
                           
                              Length
                              (
                              l
                              )
                           
                           =
                           
                              d
                              SOCS
                              +
                           
                           +
                           |
                           
                              d
                              SOCS
                              −
                           
                           |
                         indicating that the complete oscillation π(SOCS) takes the most time of all the four entities involved in the cycle. This can be seen in the matrix where the delay 
                           
                              d
                              SOCS

                         is strictly greater than 
                           
                              d
                              
                                 TLR
                                 3
                              
                              +
                           
                           ,
                           
                              d
                              
                                 TLR
                                 3
                              
                              −
                           
                         and 
                           
                              d
                              DENV
                              −
                           
                        , and greater than or equal to 
                           
                              d
                              IFN
                              +
                           
                         delays.

Lastly, another constraint from this cycle, upon which the recovery of the system and the individual depends, is isolated in the matrix as 
                           
                              d
                              DENV
                              +
                           
                           ≥
                           
                              d
                              SOCS
                              −
                           
                         (shown in Table 4: row 7, column 6). This constraint (most easily visualised in the state (0010)→(0000)) enforces that the viral infection is not occurring before the degradation or deactivation of the SOCS protein. Simply, falsifying this constraint will open up trajectories where the viral infection occurs again before the SOCS protein has been degraded or deactivated, immediately plunging the system into DENV related pathogenesis ((0010)→(0011)).

Collectively, all these constraints suggest that DENV treatment should not only focus on Interferon therapy for virus clearance, but also elongate the activation delay of the SOCS protein by targeting its activation pathways.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In conclusion, our study provides the foremost computational evidence about the divergent pathogenic outcomes produced, as the result of cytokines imbalance profile in DENV signalling. Computational qualitative modelling of TLR3 mediated IFNα/β production signalling pathway indicated that if the entities present in this pathway lose a precise pattern of initiation and/or inactivation then system dynamics can lead to diverse outcomes. Qualitative results provide us to evaluate logical parameters of BRN based on the discrete formalism of René Thomas. Hybrid modelling approach had been applied to depict the homoeostasis and the associated delays of the BRN. Our study highlights the possible behaviour of the system towards propagation and clearance of DENV. Analysis of the qualitative model highlights the implication of SOCS protein in elevation of DENV propagation, the results of which endorse the fact that in late stages of DENV infection imbalance in cytokine level shift the system from homoeostasis to disease. Hybrid modelling supports this implication by providing us the exact relations between the delays that constrain these behaviours. In this context, we hypothesize that the timely induction of the SOCS protein, which is continuously up regulated by the higher expression levels of IL-10, is the turning point in determining the course of infection toward propagation or clearance.
