                  In this paper, we consider a generic inexact subgradient algorithm to solve a nondifferentiable quasi-convex constrained optimization problem. The inexactness stems from computation errors and noise, which come from practical considerations and applications. Assuming that the computational errors and noise are deterministic and bounded, we study the effect of the inexactness on the subgradient method when the constraint set is compact or the objective function has a set of generalized weak sharp minima. In both cases, using the constant and diminishing stepsize rules, we describe convergence results in both objective values and iterates, and finite convergence to approximate optimality. We also investigate efficiency estimates of iterates and apply the inexact subgradient algorithm to solve the Cobb–Douglas production efficiency problem. The numerical results verify our theoretical analysis and show the high efficiency of our proposed algorithm, especially for the large-scale problems.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Subgradient methods are popular and practical techniques used to minimize a nondifferentiable convex function. Subgradient methods originated with the works of Polyak (1967) and Ermoliev (1966) and were further developed by Shor, Kiwiel, and Ruszczyński (1985). In the last 40years, many properties of subgradient methods have been discovered, generalizations and extensions have been proposed, and various applications have been found (see Auslender & Teboulle, 2004; Bertsekas, Nedić, & Ozdaglar, 2003; Hiriart-Urruty & Lemaréchal, 1996; Larsson, Patriksson, & Strömberg, 1996; Nedić & Bertsekas, 2001; Nesterov, 2009; Patriksson, 2008; Shor et al., 1985 and references therein). Nowadays, the subgradient method still remains an important tool for nonsmooth and stochastic optimization problems, special for large-scale problems, due to its simple formulation and low storage requirement.

Motivated by practical reasons, approximate subgradient methods (also called ∊-subgradient methods) are widely studied in Auslender and Teboulle (2004), D’Antonio and Frangioni (2009), Kiwiel (2004), Larsson, Patriksson, and Strömberg (2003), Shor et al. (1985). Kiwiel (2004) proposed a unified convergence framework for approximate subgradient methods. The author presented convergence in objective values and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution set, using both the diminishing and nonvanishing stepsize rules. Larsson et al. (2003) proposed and analyzed conditional ∊-subgradient methods to solve convex optimization problems and convex–concave saddle-point problems. Improving conditional subgradient methods, D’Antonio and Frangioni (2009) combined the deflection and the conditional subgradient technique into one iterative process, and investigated the unified convergence analysis for the deflected conditional approximate subgradient methods, using both the Polyak-type and diminishing stepsize rules. Furthermore, Auslender and Teboulle (2004) proposed and developed an interior ∊-subgradient method for convex constrained optimization problems over polyhedral sets, in particular 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 +
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                        
                     , via replacing the Euclidean distance function by a logarithmic-quadratic distance-like function.

Recently, Nedić and Bertsekas (2010) investigated the effect of noise on subgradient methods for convex optimization problems. Their work was motivated by the distributed optimization in networks where the data is quantized before being transmitted between nodes (see Kashyap, Basar, & Srikant, 2007; Rabbat & Nowak, 2005 and references therein). When the constraint set is compact or the objective function has a set of weak sharp minima, the authors established convergence properties to the optimal value within some tolerance, which is expressed in terms of errors and noise, under the bounded subgradient assumption.

Quasi-convex optimization problems can be found in important applications in various areas, such as economics, engineering, management science and various applied sciences (see Avriel, Diewert, Schaible, & Zang, 1988; Crouzeix, Martinez-Legaz, & Volle, 1998; Hadjisavvas, Komlósi, & Schaible, 2005 and references therein). The study of using subgradient methods to solve quasi-convex optimization problems has been limited. Using the diminishing stepsize rule, Kiwiel (2001) studied convergence properties and efficiency estimates of the exact subgradient method for solving a quasi-convex optimization problem under the assumption that the objective function is upper semi-continuous. On the other hand, modified dual subgradient algorithms were investigated in Gasimov (2002) and Burachik, Gasimov, Ismayilova, and Kaya (2006) for solving a general nonconvex optimization problem with equality constraints by virtue of a sharp augmented Lagrangian.

Motivated by practical and theoretical reasons, in this paper, we focus on an inexact subgradient algorithm for solving the following quasi-convex optimization problem:

                      is a quasi-convex function and the constraint set X is nonempty, closed and convex. We denote the optimal solution set and the optimal value respectively by

                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                     , and we assume that 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                      is nonempty and compact.

Inspired by the idea in Nedić and Bertsekas (2010) and references therein, we investigate the influence of inexact terms, including both computation errors and noise, on the inexact subgradient algorithm. The computation errors, which give rise to the ∊-subgradient, is inevitable in computing process. On the other hand, the noise may come from practical considerations and applications, and is manifested in inexact computation of subgradients. Considering a generic inexact subgradient algorithm for the quasi-convex optimization problem (1.1) and assuming that the computational errors and noise are deterministic and bounded, we establish convergence properties in both objective values and iterates within some tolerance given explicitly in terms of errors and noise. We also describe the finite convergence behavior to approximate optimality and efficiency estimates of iterates.

The quasi-convex function is more difficult to deal with, as the epigraph of a convex function is convex; while only the sublevel set of a quasi-convex function is convex. Lacking the convexity assumed in Nedić and Bertsekas (2010), the main technical challenges are defining a suitable subdifferential of a quasi-convex function, establishing the proper basic inequality, which is a key tool needed in this area of study, and applying the convexity of the sublevel set instead of that of the epigraph of a convex function, when analyzing the inexact subgradient method algorithm for the quasi-convex optimization problem. To meet these challenges, we adopt the closure of Greenberg–Pierskalla subdifferential as the quasi-convex subdifferential, introduce the Hölder condition to relate the quasi-convex subgradient with objective function values and establish the basic inequality, which is only a local property though, and then obtain the convergence property in objective values and finite convergence under the Hölder condition, instead of the upper semi-continuity of the objective function used in Kiwiel (2001). Another contribution is to describe the convergence property in iterates, which are absent in Nedić and Bertsekas (2010), by virtue of convexity of a sublevel set. When X is noncompact, we need to assume an additional generalized weak sharp minima condition. This condition extends the concept of weak sharp minima in Nedić and Bertsekas (2010) and is presented by using 
                        
                           dist
                           (
                           x
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     , the distance of the decision variable x to 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                     .

We also investigate the quantification of the influence of errors and noise by using both the constant and diminishing stepsize rules, while only the diminishing stepsize rule is considered in studying convergence properties and efficiency estimates of an exact subgradient method in Kiwiel (2001).

We further consider the fractional programming as an application of the quasi-convex model, describe the Cobb–Douglas production efficiency problem as an example, and perform some numerical experiments on this problem via applying the inexact subgradient method. The numerical results verify our theoretical analysis and show that the quasi-subgradient type method is highly efficient for the production efficiency problem, even when the problem is large-scale.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the notations used in this paper, the quasi-subdifferential theory and the inexact subgradient algorithm. In Section 3, we establish convergence properties in both objective values and iterates, and finite convergence behavior of our algorithm when the constraint set X is compact. Section 4 presents the convergence behavior when f has a set of generalized weak sharp minima over noncompact X, and Section 5 gives the efficiency estimates. Finally in Section 6, we apply our algorithm to the Cobb–Douglas production efficiency problem, and demonstrate the numerical results.

There are many different types of subdifferential, such as Clarke–Rockafellar subdifferential, Dini subdifferential, Fréchet subdifferential (see Aussel, Corvellec, & Lassonde, 1995 and references therein) and so on. They are the same for convex functions, but different for nonconvex functions. Here we introduce the Greenberg–Pierskalla subdifferential, defined by Greenberg and Pierskalla (1973), as follows.

It is recalled in Greenberg and Pierskalla (1973, Theorem 1) that the z-quasi-conjugate function provides a lower bound for the corresponding convex conjugate function, and indeed, the convex conjugate function is the supremum of the z-quasi-conjugate over z.

The above lemma shows that the existence of nonzero quasi-subgradient only requires the quasi-convexity. Therefore, throughout this paper, we assume that the objective function is quasi-convex. In particular, we do not assume the upper semi-continuity of the objective function as in Kiwiel (2001), unless otherwise specified.

It is well-known that the stepsize rule is critical in subgradient methods. In this paper, we investigate convergence properties of the approximate quasi-subgradient method using the following stepsize rules.

The Hölder condition of order p is used to describe some properties of quasi-subgradients in Konnov (1994). Here, we use this condition to investigate convergence properties of the approximate quasi-subgradient method. It is worth noting that the Hölder condition of order 1 is equivalent to the bounded subgradient assumption, assumed in Nedić and Bertsekas (2010), whenever f is convex.

We now give the basic inequality and the convergence property in objective values using both the constant and diminishing stepsize rules. We start with the basic inequality, which shows a significant property of a subgradient iteration.

The main difficulty in the study of the approximate quasi-subgradient method comes from the difference between the basic inequality (3.2) for our proposed quasi-convex subgradient method and that of convex subgradient method (cf. Nedić & Bertsekas, 2010). This difference originates from definitions and properties of subgradients: the convex subgradient directly connects with objective values and shares a global property of the objective function, while the quasi-convex subgradient is a normal direction to its sublevel set and is not directly associated with the objective function. Here, we utilize the Hölder condition to relate the quasi-convex subgradient with objective function values, which is only a local property.

In Assumption 2, we assume that f satisfies the Hölder condition on the whole space

                        . Actually, this assumption is essential for the convergence result in Theorem 3.1. Relaxing it by the assumption that f satisfies the Hölder condition on the constraint set X cannot ensure the validity of Theorem 3.1 even if f is continuous on

The proof uses properties of the diminishing stepsize rule (cf. (2.6)) and a line of analysis similar to that of Theorem 3.1. We omit the details.□


                        Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 show convergence to the optimal value within some tolerance given in terms of errors and noise by using the constant and diminishing stepsize rules, respectively. In Theorem 3.2, the total error 
                           
                              c

                              μ
                              
                                 
                                    (
                                    Rd
                                    )
                                 
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                              
                              +

                        , which is a similar formula as in Nedić and Bertsekas (2010), has an additive form, including the noise level R and the error level ∊. By contrast, in Theorem 3.1, the total error additionally includes a term related to the constant stepsize v.

When the noise vanishes (
                           
                              R

                        ), the approximate quasi-subgradient method is reduced to the ∊-quasi-subgradient method. In such a situation, the term

                              ,

                              -

                              〉
                           
                         vanishes in the corresponding basic inequality, and Lemma 3.1 holds (where 
                           
                              R
                              =
                              0
                           
                        ) without the compactness hypothesis of X. Therefore, when the noise vanishes, the convergence result holds regardless of the compactness hypothesis of X. Furthermore, when the error level is precise (
                           
                              ∊
                              =
                              0
                           
                        ), we obtain the convergence result of the exact quasi-subgradient method, which is the main result in Kiwiel (2001), where upper semi-continuity of f is assumed. Here, we have obtained the result as in Kiwiel (2001) without the usc assumption, but using the Hölder condition of order p instead. The following two examples show that the Hölder condition and upper semi-continuity are independent of each other.

                              . It is easy to verify that f is quasi-convex and satisfies the Hölder condition of order 2 with modulus 1 on 
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                              . However, f is not usc at

                              . Thus, this example shows that the Hölder condition does not imply upper semi-continuity.

Thus, from Kiwiel (2001), we cannot obtain convergence of the exact quasi-subgradient method (cf. (14)–(15) in Kiwiel (2001)) for this example. However, the sequence generated by the exact quasi-subgradient method converges to

                              which contradicts with (3.1). Thus, this example shows that upper semi-continuity does not imply the Hölder condition.

Although, from Kiwiel (2001), we obtain the convergence property of the exact quasi-subgradient method for this example. However, the convergence result of the approximate quasi-subgradient method (see Theorem 3.2) fails for this example. Indeed, given positive scalars p and μ, we consider the constraint set

From the above two examples, we observe that the Hölder condition of order p describes some property of the objective function, which is essentially different from the upper semi-continuity, and it can be used to investigate convergence properties of the approximate quasi-subgradient method. Hence, using the mild assumptions, we have established convergence properties of the approximate quasi-subgradient method from a new perspective, which is different from that in Kiwiel (2001).

                         has a nonempty interior in many interesting applications, such as surrogate relaxation of discrete programming problems (see Dyer, 1980).

We have shown the convergence property in objective values in Section 3.1, and in this subsection we consider the convergence property in iterates. In Nedić and Bertsekas (2010), where noise in subgradient methods for convex optimization was considered, Nedić and Bertsekas did not give convergence property in iterates. In fact, convergence of 
                           
                              {
                              
                                 
                                    x
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                              
                              }
                           
                         is quite difficult to obtain. Kiwiel (2004) described the convergence of 
                           
                              {
                              
                                 
                                    x
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                              
                              }
                           
                         generated by ∊-subgradient method for convex optimization. Although Kiwiel did not consider the effect of noise, his work is really helpful for our research. Following the framework of Kiwiel (2004), we give the convergence of 
                           
                              {
                              
                                 
                                    x
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                              
                              }
                           
                         generated by the approximate quasi-subgradient method using the diminishing stepsize rule. Besides the extension to the approximate quasi-subgradient method, another improvement of our work is to maintain the convergence property without the lower semi-continuous and coercive condition assumptions used in Kiwiel (2004), instead we use the usc assumption.

First, let us show a useful property of a convergent sequence, which converges in objective values as well. This result requires the additional usc assumption.

In this section, we consider the other case when X is noncompact. Considering the similar case, Nedić and Bertsekas (2010) assumed that the objective function f has a set of weak sharp minima and the ∊-subgradients are uniformly bounded on X (see Nedić & Bertsekas, 2010, Assumptions 3.1–3.2). The function f is said to have a set of weak sharp minima over X (see Burke & Ferris, 1993) if for some scalar

                           g

                     .

Furthermore, in what follows we consider a noise sequence 
                        
                           {

                                 )

                     , which we refer to as a low level noise sequence (see Nedić & Bertsekas, 2010). In particular, we introduce the following assumptions.

Before we discuss the convergence in objective values which is the main result of this subsection, we consider the following two lemmas which show the boundedness of

                        , generated by the approximated quasi-subgradient method using both types of stepsize rules. This interesting property is new in the literature.

So far, we have established the convergence property in objective values for approximate quasi-subgradient method and extended the corresponding results in Nedić and Bertsekas (2010) in Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 in the presence of generalized weak sharp minima. Specifying 
                           
                              g

                              t

                              1
                           
                        , the generalized weak sharp minima is reduced to the weak sharp minima used in Nedić and Bertsekas (2010), and the obtained total errors (cf. Corollary 4.1) have similar formulae to that of Nedić and Bertsekas (2010, Propositions 3.1 & 3.2).

Fractional programming is widely used in the modeling of practical problems arising in various areas, such as economics, information theory, management science and applied physics. In fractional programming problems, the objective is to optimize certain indicator (efficiency), characterized by a ratio of technical and economical terms, subject to the constraint imposed on the availability of goods. Examples of such situations are financial and corporate planning (debt/equity ratio), production planning (inventory/sales, output/employee), health care and hospital planning (cost/patient, nurse/patient ratio), etc. For details, one can refer to Avriel et al. (1988), Crouzeix et al. (1998), Hadjisavvas et al. (2005), Stancu-Minasian (1997) and references therein.

                     The production efficiency problem is to maximize the profit/cost ratio, which is an efficiency indicator, i.e., the ratio between what is obtained and the expenditure, subject to a variety of constraints on funding levels. Hence, the Cobb–Douglas production efficiency model is stated as

We first show the performance (in both optimal value and CPU time) of the approximate quasi-subgradient algorithm using the diminishing stepsize rule for different dimensions. The computation results are displayed in Table 1
                     . In this table, QSM (resp. AQSM-R, AQSM-∊) denotes the exact quasi-subgradient method (resp. the approximate quasi-subgradient method with noise only, the approximate quasi-subgradient method with error only), the columns of Projects and Factors represent the numbers of projects and production factors of the problem (6.1) respectively,

                      and CPU time denote the obtained optimal value and the CPU time (seconds) cost to reach 
                        
                           
                              
                                 f

                      by each algorithm, respectively.

From the results in Table 1, we can see that the quasi-subgradient type methods are highly efficient for the Cobb–Douglas production efficiency problem, even when the problem is large-scale. In the presence of persistent noise (
                        
                           R
                           =
                           1
                        
                     ) or error (
                        
                           ∊
                           =
                           1
                        
                     ), there are some tolerances from the optimal value of the QSM, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis in the preceding section. We can also note that the AQSM-∊ achieves the better optimal value than the AQSM-R.

The second experiment is performed to study the sensitivity analysis on noise and error, by using both the constant and diminishing stepsize rules. In this experiment, we fix the problem size 100×100, generate the noise and error series on [0,10], respectively. We characterize the performance by the relative error of optima value

The numerical results, plotted in Fig. 2
                     , are consistent with the theoretical analysis in Section 3. Although the constraint set of the problem (6.1) may be noncompact, the optimal solution and the iterates are always placed in some bounded area. Recall that Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 provide tolerances away from the optimal value of the forms

                      in the problem (6.1). In absence of the error ∊, the curves (plotted by ∘) of AQSM-R basically fit the exponential form of tolerance. When the noise R vanishes, the curves (plotted by □) of AQSM-∊ verify the linear dependence of tolerance on ∊.

We further analyze the sensitivity behavior on noise and error simultaneously. The results are plotted in Fig. 3
                     , where the left one is for the diminishing stepsize rule and the right one is for the constant stepsize rule. These results are also consistent with the theoretical analysis in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2.

We also test the global convergence property of the QSM by randomly selecting initial starting points. We adopt the same diminishing stepsize rule as the one used in Table 1, that is

                     , and start from several different initial points, either feasible or infeasible. As long as the iteration number is taken large enough, the sequence of the function values always converges to the same value. Also, the QSM starting from feasible points significantly outperforms when starting from infeasible points.
