                  This paper investigates the modal split and trip scheduling decisions with consideration of the commuters’ uncertainty expectation in the morning commute problem. Two physically separated modes for transportation, the auto mode on highway and the transit mode on subway, are available for commuters to choose for traveling from home to workplace. The travel time uncertainty is assumed to only occur on highway. Every commuter is faced with the joint choice of transport mode and trip scheduling for minimizing her/his generalized travel cost. The study reveals that uncertainty expectation can significantly influence the travel decisions and lead to a distinctive flow pattern. We also examine the effects of transit headway and fare on modal split and equilibrium cost by numerical examples.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Most cities are facing growing traffic demand and limited road space, which definitely gives strong reason to rapidly develop mass transit. In a network with multiple transportation modes, the home departure choice of commuters always involves two dimensions of decision making such as which mode to select and when to depart. It is evident that the study of jointly considering modal split and trip scheduling is important for us to obtain deep insights into how to manage congestion dynamically and allocate commuters among multiple modes efficiently. This has received great attention during last decades (Danielis & Marcucci, 2002; Huang, 2000; Kraus, 2003).

The pioneering model with endogenous trip scheduling was developed by Vickrey (1969). In his model, congestion takes the form of queuing behind a single bottleneck and each commuter is confronted with a trade-off between queuing cost and schedule delay cost of early or late arrival at workplace. This work has been extended to a variety of circumstances and widely studied (Arnott, de Palma, & Lindsey, 1990; van den Berg & Verhoef, 2011; Xiao, Qian, & Zhang, 2011). Lindsey (2004) presented an analysis of the existence and uniqueness of the user equilibrium with consideration of user heterogeneity. Zhang, Yang, Huang, and Zhang (2005) examined the linkage between morning and evening commutes by allocating the commuters’ utility-valued work time. de Palma and Fosgerau (2013) generalized the bottleneck congestion analysis through allowing for random queue and considering the users’ scheduling preferences.

The above mentioned studies only focused on the morning commute problems with single mode. A fact in reality is that there often exist multiple modes providing substitutable transportation services, e.g., commuters in most cities can make trips either by private cars or public transit. Hence, a topic of modal split arises and has received longstanding interests (Huang, Tian, Yang, & Gao, 2007; Huang & Yang, 1999; Wu, Yin, & Lawphongpanich, 2011). Tabuchi (1993) was among the first to study the modal split behavior in a transportation system with a physically separated mass transit parallel to a highway with a bottleneck. He compared the optimality and efficiency of several transit fare and road toll regimes. Huang (2000, 2002) extended Tabuchi's work by considering the user heterogeneity and elastic demand. Suggesting that the transit mode is represented by buses traveling on the same road with private cars, Huang et al. (2007) studied the mode choice and commuting behaviors in a newly proposed bi-modal transportation system. Mirabel and Reymond (2010) investigated the redistribution of toll revenue and analyzed the impact of redistribution on total cost and modal split. Habib (2012) formulated a combined model of mode choice, work start time and work duration, and revealed some behavioral insights into activity scheduling and mode choice decisions. Gonzales and Daganzo (2012) examined the two-mode problem with time-dependent demand in an urban area and optimized the transit fare for minimizing the total system cost. Tian, Yang, and Huang (2013) recently investigated the efficiency of a tradable travel credit scheme designed for a highway/transit system with user heterogeneity in value of time.

For a competitive two-mode transportation system, there is an important extension valuable to conduct, i.e., the impact of highway travel time uncertainty on modal split and trip scheduling decisions. The importance has been recognized by many scholars (Brownstone & Small, 2005; Fosgerau & Karlstrom, 2010; Siu & Lo, 2008), and some progresses have been obtained. Noland and Small (1995) determined the optimal departure time under uniform and exponentially distributed random delay with an exogenous time profile of congestion. Noland and Polak (2002) reviewed both the theory and empirical results of several cases for measuring the coefficient of travel time variability using the stated preference techniques. Siu and Lo (2009) examined the role of uncertainty in affecting the equilibrium trip scheduling, using a model incorporating the user heterogeneity in arrival earliness and lateness.

It is commonly observed that driving on highway is easily influenced by external random incidents, while the transit runs are always operated in a regular manner with invariable travel time. Inspired by this observation, this study assumes that only the travel time on highway is uncertain and commuters are homogeneous in their own uncertainty expectation.

                        1
                        Based on the agent-based simulation results, Sunitiyoso and Matsumoto (2009) found that the traveler's expectation plays an important role in travel mode decision-making.
                      Different from what is proposed in Siu and Lo (2009), the exponential distribution for travel delay is employed, and thus the influence of uncertainty expectation on travel decisions can be carefully stated. According to their perceived uncertainty expectation, commuters consciously adjust the choices of transport mode and departure time to minimize the expected generalized travel cost. Without loss of generality, we deal with a two-mode transportation system in which the auto mode on highway and the transit mode on subway compete to serve a population of commuters. Commuters have to first make a trade-off between experiencing the uncertain risk of arriving early or late if selecting auto mode and bearing the body congestion occurring in carriages if selecting transit mode. Then, they make the scheduling plan so as to minimize the generalized travel cost associated with the selected mode. An equilibrium state is reached when no commuters can reduce their expected generalized travel costs by unilaterally changing the mode and departure time choices.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the model formulation. Section 3 examines the properties of equilibrium solutions of the model. Section 4 presents numerical results to illustrate the impact of uncertainty expectation on commuters’ modal split and trip scheduling choices. Section 5 concludes the paper.

Suppose there are two alternative transport modes, a highway and a transit line, connecting a single pair of origin and destination. A population of N commuters wishes to arrive at the workplace at the work start time t* (normalized to be zero in this study for simplicity) each morning, either by the auto mode on highway or the transit mode. For the convenience of studying, let N
                     A and N
                     T denote the number of commuters taking auto and transit modes, respectively, and 
                        
                           
                              N
                              A
                           
                           +
                           
                              N
                              T
                           
                           =
                           N
                        
                     . Throughout the study, we assume that both modes are effectively used (i.e., N
                     A > 0, N
                     T > 0), which means corner solutions will not be considered. Let α represent the unit cost of travel time, β the unit cost of arrival SDE (schedule delay early), and γ the unit cost of arrival SDL (schedule delay late). According to the empirical study by Small (1992), the relation 0 < β < α < γ always holds.

For simplicity and without loss of generality, we assume that the highway is characterized by the standard bottleneck model (Vickrey, 1969) with a fixed capacity s. The auto mode is susceptible due to the traffic incidents frequently occurring on highway, which leads to the uncertainty of travel time. To reflect the influence of this uncertainty on the travelers’ mode and scheduling choices, it is further assumed that all highway users will experience an extra random time R in addition to the deterministic time. The probability density function of this random variable is known to all travelers, and takes the following form:

                     where the parameter μ is the mean (also the standard deviation) of the distribution. The exponential distribution can set low probabilities for long delays, which is obviously reasonable in reality. For reflecting the initiative of avoiding the possible schedule delay cost induced by uncertainty, we let every auto user X, reserve a travel time budget b(X) ahead of the schedule.

                        The term ‘travel time budget’ defined by Lo, Luo, and Siu (2006) is the time commuters set aside for a trip, and is related to the possibility that a commuter could reach the destination at the official work start time.
                     
                  

In terms of the definition of travel time budget, the home departure time of an auto user X, without consideration of the time spent on highway, should be

Before putting forward the equilibrium travel cost functions of two modes, for convenience of understanding, the following assumptions are specially figured out:

                        
                           (A1)
                           All commuters (auto users and transit users) are homogeneous in the values of travel time and arrival schedule delay.

The probability distribution of extra random time R is known and same for all users.

The transit capacity is large enough to accommodate all reached users.

The attraction of two modes is identical to all users, and they will firstly make the decision of travel mode and then the departure time according to their own preference.

Note that these assumptions are used to derive the equilibrium travel cost function in the following context, and some of them can be further relaxed and researched. In this study, we assume that the generalized travel cost of an auto user X consists of such three parts as fixed cost (i.e., the fuel consumption and vehicle depreciation), travel time cost and schedule delay cost. Without loss of generality, a linear travel cost function is used as follows:

Unlike the auto mode, the transit mode is usually favored by users for its steady service quality. The steady service quality is contributed by a fixed schedule of all transit runs with given speed. It is evident that this character distinguishes from what the auto mode has. As a result, the travel time of transit mode is constant and independent upon the outside traffic conditions. Suppose the transit mode is defined by several transit runs centered around the official work start time t*. Let

Without loss of generality, we assume the generalized travel cost of transit mode includes the following four parts: the fixed transit fare, the travel time cost, the schedule delay cost, and the body congestion cost generated by the in-carriage crowding discomfort.

                        The body congestion critically affects the commuters’ choices on transit runs. They have to make a trade-off between the increasing discomfort cost by traveling closer to the peak rush hour and the increasing schedule delay early/late cost by making an early or late home departure.
                      Accordingly, the generalized travel cost of a passenger who rides on the ith run is formulated as follows:

Till now, we have formulated the equilibrium travel costs of the two modes, as given in Eqs. (10) and (19). Considering the uncertainty effect on highway, as is assumed, commuters will firstly divide themselves among two modes and then make trip scheduling decisions. Finally, a joint equilibrium of modal split and trip scheduling will be achieved when

                           At equilibrium, the farther the arrival time of a transit run is from the work start time, the fewer is the number of commuters contained in this run, i.e., for ∀j < k ≤ 0, nj
                            < nk holds, and for ∀j > k ≥ 0, nj
                            < nk holds.
                        

At equilibrium, for arbitrary two runs j and k, with j < k ≤ 0, the generalized travel costs of commuters choosing these two runs are

After the mathematical observations of the equilibrium solutions are explored, now we try to give some practical insights into the above properties. Lemma 1 tells us that the first auto user always arrive at the workplace before the work start time if ignoring the effect of the random travel time. Following the previous clarification, Proposition 1 further implies that the more is the auto commuters, the earlier the morning rush hour comes. Although the results stated in Lemma 1 and Proposition 1 are intuitive to a bottleneck model, to facilitate the proof procedures of other properties and understand the subsequent numerical results, they are re-emphasized in this study. Additionally, Proposition 2 shows that the earlier the auto user departs, the higher expected SDE cost and the smaller expected SDL cost he/she will encounter. For the transit mode, Proposition 3 indicates that the transit run arriving at the work start time is always preferred by the largest number of transit users, and the preferences for other runs are monotonically descending with the increase of the gap between the arrival time and the work start time. Therefore, the arrangement for administrators and resources could be adjusted according to this phenomenon. Furthermore, Corollary 1 reminds that the transport planner only need to arrange transit runs during the rush hour and the extra runs are redundant and unnecessary. It is evident that the above obtained properties are in consistent with our intuition, which not only helps to prove the reasonability of the established model in Section 2, but also helps to verify whether the numerical results in next part are correct.

The numerical study is conducted in this section to show some visual views on the equilibrium solutions. For simplicity, a linear body congestion function

                      is adopted. The input data of all model parameters are listed in Table 1
                     . Some of them will be changed for conducting sensitivity analyses later.

Solving the joint equilibrium model of two modes, we obtain the modal split, 
                        
                           
                              N

                      and 
                        
                           
                              N
                              T
                           
                           =
                           559
                        
                     . Fig. 1
                      shows the equilibrium travel cost EC
                     A and its components associated with auto mode. As is depicted, the equilibrium travel cost of each commuter is separated into five components but the sum of them is identical, all equal to 40.60. The travel time cost, which is the summation of free flow travel time cost and queuing time cost, increases first and then declines subject to X. For those departing early, the main component constituting the equilibrium travel cost is the SDE cost; for those departing late, the main component is the SDL cost; for those departing in the middle of the peak period, the main component is the travel time cost, but due to the random travel delay, their schedule delay costs exist significantly. As claimed in Proposition 2, the SDE cost always decreases and the SDL cost increases with respect to X.

The equilibrium travel cost EC
                     T of transit mode against runs is shown in Fig. 2
                     . As is seen, all transit runs with positive traffic volume have the same equilibrium travel costs while other runs with higher travel costs are empty. The congestion cost increases first and then declines. This implies that the number of commuters monotonically increases in early arrival transit runs and decreases in late arrival runs, which verifies Proposition 3. In addition, unlike auto mode, the schedule delay cost of transit mode is either the SDE cost or the SDL cost, since the moving time is constant. We also find that the chosen transit runs are asymmetric for early and late arrivals runs as the unit schedule delay costs of these runs are not identical.

To study the impact of the uncertainty expectation μ on the equilibrium outcomes, Table 2
                      shows the main results for different uncertainty expectations. In this table, “No delay” means the travel time on highway is deterministic. As the uncertainty expectation μ increases, the equilibrium travel cost increases, the number of auto commuter decreases, the peak period shrinks, the total transit users (obtained by 
                        
                           
                              N
                              T
                           
                           =
                           
                              ∑
                              
                                 i
                                 =
                                 −
                                 
                                    i
                                    e

                     ) and the transit runs chosen by commuters grow. More commuters shift to choose transit mode for avoiding the potential loss induced by higher uncertainty risk. Hence, the uncertainty expectation μ remarkably affects the equilibrium modal split and travel cost.

To further clarify the effect of the uncertainty expectation on equilibrium queue length, Fig. 3
                      displays the queue curves on highway for different uncertainty expectation μ. As is observed, both the peak period length and the maximal queue length declines with the increase of the uncertainty expectation μ. This is a direct reflection of the reduced auto commuters. When no random delay occurs, the queue curve is linear; nonlinear, otherwise. Fig. 4
                      shows the number of commuters choosing each transit run. As the uncertainty expectation μ increase, more commuters turn to choose transit mode, consequently more runs are required and each run has to serve more commuters.

Furthermore, the sensitivity analyses are represented for different transit headways and fares in Tables 3
                      and 4
                     , in order to provide some insights into the design of the operation parameters on transit mode. As is demonstrated in Table 3, the equilibrium travel costs and the number of auto commuters both increase with the headway. Simultaneously, the duration of the peak period on auto mode expands, while the total number of transit users declines and the required transit runs reduce. All these phenomena reveal that setting larger transit headway will introduce the shift of commuters from transit mode to auto mode. Table 4 gives the output results with the increase of the transit fare, and all outcomes show a relatively slender change but with the same trend. The reason comes from such fact that the travel cost of transit mode is sensitive to the headway, which is in accordance with the practical situation, where changing headway is more expensive but a prominent return.

Finally, we examine the joint effect of the uncertainty expectation μ and headway Λ on the number of auto commuters and the equilibrium travel cost. Fig. 5
                     (a) and (b) depicts their isolines, respectively. When fixing the uncertainty expectation μ, we find that the number of auto commuters N
                     A and the equilibrium travel cost EC
                     A(EC
                     T) both ascend but with decreasing amplitude as the transit headway increases. This is because the number of transit users becomes smaller and smaller with the increase of the headway, the required number of transit runs reduce and then the impact of transit headway disappears gradually. With fixed transit headway Λ, the number of auto commuters N
                     A declines but the equilibrium travel cost 
                        
                           E
                           
                              C
                              A
                           
                           
                              (
                              =
                              E
                              
                                 C
                                 T
                              
                              )
                           
                        
                      goes up as the uncertainty expectation μ increases. Therefore, it is necessary to manage the uncertainty efficiently for having an appreciate mode share and travel cost level.

The joint effect of the uncertainty expectation μ and transit fare f
                     T on number of auto commuters and equilibrium travel cost are numerically investigated. Fig. 6
                     (a) and (b) depicts the isolines, respectively. From these two figures, we find that the number of auto commuters N
                     A and the equilibrium travel cost 
                        
                           E
                           
                              C
                              A
                           
                           
                              (
                              =
                              E
                              
                                 C
                                 T
                              
                              )
                           
                        
                      are less sensitive to transit fare. This means the impact of transit fare on modal split is limited. On the other hand, for a fixed transit fare f
                     T, the number of auto commuters N
                     A declines while the equilibrium travel cost EC
                     A(EC
                     T) goes up with the increase of μ. This is similar with that observed in Fig. 5, but the marginal effect is more obvious. The reason may be the transit fare has less influence than headway.

In summary, all the above numerical results support a finding that the equilibrium solutions, like the modal split, the travel cost, the peak period of auto model as well as the required number of transit runs, are substantially influenced by the uncertainty expectation. Generally, increasing μ will result in more commuters shifting to transit mode and the equilibrium travel cost increased. It is therefore necessary to manage the uncertainty expectation for realizing a target modal split and then enhancing the system efficiency through travel cost reduction. Other relevant system parameters should also be carefully designed.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the presence of exponentially distributed random delay on highway, this paper examined the joint decision-making problem of modal split and trip scheduling in a traffic network consisting of a highway and a transit line. On the base of prediction to uncertainty expectation, commuters have to make various choices like transport mode, departure time and transit run. At the equilibrium state finally reached, all commuters should experience the same generalized travel cost whatever the mode or the scheduling plan is. We found that, for a given uncertainty expectation, the SDE cost of auto mode always decreases and the SDL cost always increases with respect to the index X. The number of transit commuters monotonically increases in the early arrival runs and decreases in the late arrival runs. Numerical results supported all theoretical findings presented in this paper and further verified that the uncertainty expectation indeed influences the commuters’ mode and trip scheduling choices significantly. With the increase of uncertainty expectation, more commuters shift to transit mode, the number of auto commuters decreases and the duration of peak period on highway is shrunk. On the other hand, more transit runs are required and each run services more commuters.

The modeling approach proposed in this paper is subject to simple traffic networks and adopts a number of assumptions. Its value lies in the insights derived from the equilibrium solutions and the new viewing angle to evaluate the effect of uncertainty expectation on travel behaviors. Through this study, we have fully recognized the importance of managing uncertainty. The sensitivity analyses also provided valuable suggestions for the planning and operation of the system.
