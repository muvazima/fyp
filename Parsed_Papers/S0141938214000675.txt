                  A series of Sm3+ and Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 phosphors were synthesized by high temperature solid state reaction. Recorded XRD patterns proved that the titled compound in a single phase has been obtained. Sm3+ and Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 could emit orange and white light, respectively. The optimal doping concentration of Sm3+ or Dy3+ was experimentally ascertained to be 6mol%. The critical distance of energy transfer for Sm3+ or Dy3+ doped sample is 1.540nm. In addition, there is no cross energy transfer between the Sm3+ and Dy3+ ions in the co-doped samples. The results indicated that the electric dipole–dipole interaction is predominant energy transfer mechanism for concentration quenching of Sm3+ or Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 phosphor. The charge transfer band was observed in the excitation spectra of Sm3+ or Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 phosphors. Present investigation indicated that Sm3+ and Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 can be applied in solid state lighting and LaBWO6 is a promising host for display applications.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Luminescent materials have obtained extensively applications for a long period due to their ability to convert electromagnetic radiation (i.e., ultraviolet (UV) and infrared light) into visible light [1–2]. Especially, phosphors based on rare earth (RE) ions doped borates or tungstates have attracted continuing attention due to their interesting photoluminescence wavelengths extending from the UV to the infrared [3–7]. The practical potential of these materials is mostly associated with the structural characteristics of the boron- or tungstate-oxygen groups [5]. Molybdates and tungstates with scheelite structure are considered as good host lattices under near-UV or blue light excitation due to their MoO4 tetrahedron and WO4 unit [2]. Zheng et al. reported the emissions and photocatalytic selectivity of SrWO4:Ln3+ (Eu3+, Tb3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+) prepared by a supersonic microwave co-assistance method and discussed the energy migration occurs from WO4
                     2− to the doped rare earth ions [8]. Novel red-emitting Eu3+-activated La2

                      phosphors with well-defined one-dimensional nanostructures were synthesized via a supersonic microwave co-assistance method for the first time at very low temperature by Huo et al. [9]. Eu3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+-doped boro-molybdates phosphors have been investigated by Zhang and Seo [2] and Zhang et al. [10]. Recently, LaBWO6 as a promising host for luminescence applications has been prepared by Pechini method and the luminescence properties of the Eu3+ doped LaBWO6 were reported by Huang et al. [5]. LaBWO6 of tungsten borate compounds was first discovered in 1979 by Palkina et al. [11]. Aleksandrov et al. found the crystallization of LaBWO6 when they studied WO3-B2O3-La2O3 glasses [12]. Based on the pseudo-ternary phase diagram of LaBWO6−(Li2WO4/LiF)−B2O3, the LaBWO6 crystals have been firstly grown by the flux method [13]. Currently, LaBWO6 as the host for rare earth doped luminescent materials was rarely reported in literature. To the best of our knowledge, the luminescence properties of Sm3+ and Dy3+ in LaBWO6 have not been reported till now. In this work Sm3+ and Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 were prepared by high temperature solid state reaction and their luminescence properties were investigated in detail. The present investigation results indicate that LaBWO6 is an excellent host for luminescence applications.

Considering the evaporation of H3BO3 during the solid-state reaction, 10wt.% excess amount of H3BO3 was added to compensate the evaporating loss. All raw materials were mixed homogeneously in an agate mortar. The homogeneous mixture was put into a corundum crucible and sintered at 980°C in air for 10h. Then, the samples were cooled to room temperature in the furnace, and grounded again into powder.

The structures of the phosphors were investigated by an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, Beijing MSAL-XD-2) with Cu Ka radiation (λ
                     =0.15406nm) at 36kV tube voltage and 20mA tube current. The patterns in 2θ were from 10 to 70°. The excitation and emission spectra were measured by a Hitachi F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer at room temperature.

                        7/2 transition is the strongest excitation band. In addition, a broad band peaking at 281nm was observed in Fig. 2 except for the direct excitation of Sm3+ ions. Dotsenko et al. [16] reported that the maximum of the Sm3+ charge transfer (CT) band is at 200nm in YAl3B4O12. Van Pieterson et al. [17] reported that the excitation spectrum of Sm3+ emission in YPO4 lied below 200nm. Huang et al. observed the broad band of O2
                        −–W6+ charge transfer transition peaking at 298nm inside the tungstate group in Eu3+ doped LaBWO6 phosphor [5]. Zhang et al. found an O2−–W6+ charge transfer transition band peaking at 285nm in Ca3WO6:Sm3+ co-doped Eu3+ 
                        [18]. As described above, the charge transfer transition of Sm3+–O2− generally locates below 200nm considering the difficulty in the electron transfer from O2− to Sm3+ with the 4f
                        5 electronic configuration [19]. Therefore, the broad band (ca. 281nm) in the excitation spectra might be from the oxide host lattices, which is mainly attributed to the CT transition of O2
                        −–W6+ inside the tungstate group [5]. A similar CT band was observed in the Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 in our experiments (Fig. 5).

                        >0.06, the luminescence intensity decreased. This concentration quenching process often attributes to energy migration among Sm3+ ions. The critical distance (R

                        15/2 transition at 451nm is the most intense one. There were some research works which reported that the Dy3+–O2− charge transfer band usually located below 200nm, such as 166nm [22], 173nm [23] and 191nm [24]. In similarity, followed the discussions about the excitation spectrum of Sm3+ doped LaBWO6 above, the broad band (centering at 273nm) might be attributed to CT transition of O2−–W6+ inside the tungstate group [5].

                        13/2 (integrated from 460 to 510nm, from 555 to 600nm, respectively) transitions on the Dy3+ content were shown in the inset of Fig. 6. The inset showed that both emission intensities of the two bands increased with increasing Dy3+ content and then they decreased with further increasing Dy3+ content. The optimum Dy3+ concentration was 6mol%. This concentration quenching process often attributes to energy migration among Dy3+ ions, and the critical distance was Rc
                           =
                        1.540nm calculated using the formula of (4).

The CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.294, 0.314) was located in the white region (see Fig. 3, marked as (b)). Vengala Rao et al. reported that Dy3+ doped phosphor could be tailored to emit white light by suitably adjusting the yellow-to-blue intensity ratio, so luminescent materials doped with Dy3+ could be used as potential material for two colors emitting phosphors [15].


                        Fig. 7
                         showed the excitation and emission spectra of Sm3+ and Dy3+ co-doped sample. Fig. 7 (a) and (c) presented the typical excitation specta (λ
                        em
                        =595 and 571nm, respectively). Fig. 7(b) and (d) presented the typical emission specta (λ
                        ex
                        =386 and 402nm, respectively). Compared with Figs. 2 and 5, the characteristic peaks in the excitation and emission spectra (excited at 595 and 402nm, see Fig. 7(c) and (d), respectively) were almost the same to that of only Sm3+ ions doped LaBWO6 phosphor, and the characteristic peaks in the excitation and emission spectra (excited at 571 and 386nm, in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively) were almost the same to that of Dy3+ ions doped LaBWO6. It shows that, compared with the photoluminescence spectra of only doped Sm3+ or only doped Dy3+ samples, there is no any significant change in the photoluminescence spectra of the co-doped sample and there is no energy cross transfer between the co-doped Sm3+ and Dy3+ ions. The efficient energy transfer should take place from the host to the doped RE ions. This property is of prime importance for tuning the phosphor system for obtaining the desired color coordinate by adjusting the amount of individual RE ion content independently [26].

In the case of emission spectra of LaBWO6: xSm3+ or LaBWO6:xDy3+ phosphors, the emission intensity increased with the increase of RE ion concentration and after reaching the critical concentration (x
                        =0.06mol) it decreased, as shown in the insets of Figs. 4 and 6. A decrease in the emission integral intensity illustrates the occurrence of energy migration between the doped RE ions in different sites in the lattice, resulting in concentration quenching. With respect to the mechanism of energy transfer in LaBWO6: xSm3+ or LaBWO6:xDy3+ phosphors, the critical distance between Sm3+ ions or between Dy3+ ions is an important parameter. The critical distance of energy migration between Sm3+ ions was 1.540nm for the Sm3+ doped sample, and the same value Rc
                           =
                        1.540nm was also obtained for Dy3+ doped sample, which presents that the electric multipolar interaction is the main energy transfer mechanism [27–28].

According to Huang’s rule [29–31], the relationship between the integral luminescent intensity I and doping concentration x can be expressed as follows:

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Sm3+ and Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 phosphors were synthesized by solid state reaction method. The XRD patterns proved that prepared phosphors could be indexed to LaBWO6 in a single phase. The doping of RE ions with a small doping concentration did not affect the phase structure significantly. The Sm3+ doped LaBWO6 exhibited orange emission and the strongest emission intensity was located at 595nm. Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 exhibited two emission bands of blue and yellow, which peaked at 480 and 571nm, respectively. The blue emission is slightly higher than yellow emission which indicates the high-symmetry around Dy3+ ions. The optimal doping concentration was found to be at x=
                     0.06 for both of these two kinds of RE ions doped phosphors. The excitation and emission spectra of Sm3+ and Dy3+ co-doped sample show that there is not any significant change in the photoluminescence spectra compared with that of only Sm3+ or Dy3+ doped samples. The electric dipole–dipole interaction is the dominant concentration quenching mechanism for the Sm3+ or Dy3+ ions doped LaBWO6 phosphors.
