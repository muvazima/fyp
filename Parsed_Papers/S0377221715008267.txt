                  This paper addresses the multitrip Cumulative Capacitated Single-Vehicle Routing Problem (mt-CCSVRP). In this problem inspired by disaster logistics, a single vehicle can perform successive trips to serve a set of affected sites and minimize an emergency criterion, the sum of arrival times. Two mixed integer linear programs, a flow-based model and a set partitioning model, are proposed for small instances with 20 sites. An exact algorithm for larger cases transforms the mt-CCSVRP into a resource-constrained shortest path problem where each node corresponds to one trip and the sites to visit become resources. The resulting problem can be solved via an adaptation of Bellman–Ford algorithm to a directed acyclic graph with resource constraints and a cumulative objective function. Seven dominance rules, two upper bounds and five lower bounds speed up the procedure. Computational results on instances derived from classical benchmark problems for the capacitated VRP indicate that the exact algorithm outperforms a commercial MIP solver on small instances and can solve cases with 40 sites to optimality.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A trend in the last decade is to apply operations research to facilitate logistic operations in humanitarian disasters. Several models have been proposed to cope with mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery operations, see for instance the surveys of Altay and Green III (2006) and Galindo and Batta (2013). An important issue after a disaster is to determine the transportation routes for first aids, supplies, rescue personnel or equipment from supply points to a set of destination sites, geographically scattered over the disaster region. In this context, the arrival time of relief supplies at the affected communities clearly impacts the survival rate and the suffering of victims. Hence, the total length or duration of the routes used in vehicle routing for industrial logistics must be replaced by more pertinent service-based objective functions in humanitarian logistics (Campbell, Vandenbussche, & Hermann, 2008).

The aim of this paper is to solve exactly, via a reformulation as a shortest path problem, a version of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) inspired by the response phase of relief operations. A single vehicle with limited capacity and range is allowed to perform multiple trips and the classical objective function (total travel time or distance) becomes the sum of arrival times at affected sites. We call this problem the multitrip Cumulative Capacitated Single-Vehicle Routing Problem (mt-CCSVRP).

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews related problems. In Section 3 the problem is formally defined and two mixed integer linear models are proposed. Section 4 describes the procedure to transform the mt-CCSVRP into a resource-constrained shortest path problem in an directed acyclic graph. An ad-hoc shortest path algorithm is developed in Section 5. Computational results are presented in Section 6 for the two models and the exact method. Concluding remarks close the paper in Section 7.

After a disaster, the deliveries to affected sites must take the urgency of the situation into account. Campbell et al. (2008) suggest that using service-based objective functions may better reflect the different priorities and strategic goals found in delivering humanitarian aid. The minimization of the average arrival time is more pertinent to address the emergency of humanitarian logistic operations than classical objective functions, such as the minimization of the total distance traveled. We use in this paper an equivalent objective, the sum of arrival times.

The sum of arrival times has been already used in some routing problems. For instance, the Minimum Latency Problem is a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which consists in finding a tour starting at a depot and visiting each other node only once, in such a way that the total latency is minimized (Archer & Williamson, 2003; Blum, Chalasani, Coppersmith, Pulleyblank, Raghavan, & Sudan, 1994). The latency of a node is defined as the total distance or travel time to reach it. This problem is also known as the Delivery Man Problem (Fischetti, Laporte, & Martello, 1993) or the Traveling Repairman problem (TRP) (Jothi & Raghavachari, 2007; Tsitsiklis, 1992) because of its possible application to maintenance.

The Multiple Traveling Repairman Problem or k-TRP is a generalization of the minimum latency problem where k tours must be determined (Jothi & Raghavachari, 2007). In the Time-Dependent TSP (TDTSP), the traversal cost of an arc depends on its position in the tour (Gouveia & Voss, 1995; Lucena, 1990; Picard & Queyranne, 1978). When the objective of the TDTSP is to minimize the sum of distances traveled from the depot to each node, the problem is known as the TSP with cumulative cost or Cumulative TSP (CTSP) (Bianco, Mingozzi, & Ricciardelli, 1993).

The Cumulative Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CCVRP), described by Ngueveu, Prins, and Calvo (2010), is a variant of the classical CVRP where the objective function becomes the sum of arrival times at demand nodes. The CCVRP can also be considered as the generalization of the minimum latency problem to several vehicles. These authors provide a mathematical model, several lower bounds and two memetic algorithms. Solutions are compared using classical CVRP instances from Christofides, Mingozzi, and Toth (1979), replacing the total length of the routes by the sum of arrival times, and on TRP instances from Salehipour, Sörensen, Goos, and Bräysy (2008).

The results confirm that the optimal solutions can be quite different in the CCVRP and the classical CVRP, as already observed by Campbell et al. (2008). In Euclidean versions for instance, CVRP solutions with edge crossings are suboptimal, while the elimination of these crossings often brings no improvement for the cumulative objective. More recently, Ribeiro and Laporte (2012) presented an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) for the CCVRP which is compared with the memetic algorithms from Ngueveu et al. (2010), while Ke and Feng (2013) proposed a two-phase metaheuristic which improves some best known solutions from Ngueveu et al. (2010) and Ribeiro and Laporte (2012). Lysgaard and Wøhlk (2014) developed a branch and cut and price algorithm, able to solve CCVRP instances up to 69 required sites.

A comparison between the minimization of cost, maximal arrival time and average arrival time for the TSP and CVRP is given by Campbell et al. (2008). Their paper presents lower bounds, an insertion heuristic and a local search procedure. The minimization of maximal arrival time is also addressed by Applegate, Cook, Dash, and Rohe (2002) via a branch-and-cut algorithm, while Hemel, van Erk, and Jenniskens (1996) solve a practical problem aiming at minimizing the maximal tour length, using the average arrival time to break ties. Dell, Batta, and Karwan (1996) add a multi-period horizon and equity constraints.

A common assumption is that each vehicle makes a single trip, which is not realistic in disaster logistics where helicopters, for instance, can perform multiple sorties. The multitrip extension of the classical CVRP is known as the multitrip Vehicle Routing Problem (mt-VRP) and was first studied by Fleischmann (1990). Rivera, Afsar, and Prins (2015) introduce the cumulative version, called multitrip Cumulative Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (mt-CCVRP). They develop a flow-based model, a Multi-Start Iterated Local Search (MS-ILS) and a dominance rule for the order of routes in a multitrip. The model and the MS-ILS are evaluated on the mt-CCVRP and its particular case, the CCVRP. Rivera, Afsar, and Prins (2014) present a Multi-Start Evolutionary Local Search (MS-ELS) for the mt-CCVRP, which alternates between giant tours covering all the nodes and mt-CCVRP solutions (using a splitting procedure) and calls a variable neighborhood descent for improvement. The metaheuristic is compared with the MS-ILS of Rivera et al. (2015).

Few authors have investigated multitrip single-vehicle routing problems. Azi, Gendreau, and Potvin (2007) study a multi-trip single-vehicle routing problem with time windows (mt-SVRPTW) by enumerating all feasible trips. As it is not always possible to cover all customers, they maximize the number of visited customers and then minimize the total length. The problem is formulated as an Elementary Resource-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (ERCSPP) on an auxiliary graph and solved using a label correcting algorithm inspired by the one proposed by Feillet, Dejax, Gendreau, and Gueguen (2004).


                     Angel-Bello, Martínez-Salazar, and Alvarez (2013) seem to be the only authors who studied the mt-CCSVRP. They propose two mixed integer linear models for a version with a maximum number of trips. Evaluated on randomly generated instances, the best model can consistently solve instances up to 25 customers but the number of trips in the solution is limited to 2 or 3.

Our method is inspired by Azi et al. (2007) but the problems are quite different. Azi et al. consider time windows, their auxiliary graph contains circuits, and they try to visit a maximum number of sites while minimizing the total distance. In our case, there are no time windows, all sites must be visited, and the goal is to minimize the sum of arrival times at the sites. These features induce specific dominance rules and lower and upper bounds. In particular, we prove an important dominance rule which leads to an acyclic auxiliary graph.

The mt-CCSVRP uses the sum of arrival times at sites as objective function, like in the cumulative CVRP, but involves a single vehicle which can perform more than one trip. This flexibility is necessary when the total demand exceeds the capacity of the vehicle and/or the range of the vehicle is limited. In the context of humanitarian logistics, the mt-CCSVRP models the distribution of relief supplies to a set of sites affected by a disaster, using for instance one helicopter which can do multiple sorties. After the disaster, the victims are waiting for rescue and multiple crews can be coordinated to use the vehicle full time. Nevertheless, the limited range of the vehicle imposes an upper bound on the flight time of each trip.

The problem can be defined on an complete undirected graph

                      of n locations affected by a disaster, called sites because customers is here inappropriate. The set E is composed of edges (i, j) with travel times wij
                      satisfying the triangle inequality, also called flight times. A single vehicle of capacity Q and range Lmax
                      (in terms of flight time) is based at the depot. Each site i ∈ V′ has a demand qi
                      and a service time σi
                     . It is assumed without loss of generality that 
                        
                           
                              ∑

                                    V
                                    ′

                      and qi
                      ≤ Q, ∀ i ∈ V′.

The objective is to identify a sequence of trips 
                        
                           (
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           v
                           )
                           ,
                        
                      called multitrip, such that each site is visited exactly once and the sum of arrival times is minimized (in the last trip, the return to the depot is not counted). A trip k is a cycle, starting and ending at the depot, whose total load Wk
                      fits vehicle capacity Q and total flight time Lk
                      does not exceed the range Lmax
                     . Each trip k has also a setup time (loading time) μk
                      before leaving the depot, computed as the sum of service times over all sites served by the trip, weighted by a given coefficient β. The loading times and service times do not affect vehicle range but delay the arrivals at sites.

In our version, the number of trips v is a decision variable. Contrary to the mt-CVRP, the cumulative objective is sensitive to the trip ordering: Theorem 2 in Section 4 defines the optimal ordering for a given set of trips. Fig. 1
                      shows a small instance with

                           Z

                     .

In the following, two mixed integer linear programs are developed. The first one is a flow-based model whose variables have no trip index. The second one is based on a set partitioning model where columns correspond to the possible routes and each site must be covered by exactly one route.

The flow model derives from the one presented by Rivera, Afsar, and Prins (2013) for the mt-CCVRP, based on replenishment arcs (Boland, Clarke, & Nemhauser, 2000; Mak & Boland, 2000) and arc coefficients (Ngueveu et al., 2010). Replenishment arcs are used to replace the trips of a multitrip by a single trip: if a trip with last site i is followed by a trip with first site j, arcs (i, 0) and (0, j) can be replaced by one replenishment arc (i, j), see Fig. 1. The coefficient of an arc expresses the number of times its cost is counted in the objective function. Although we have here one vehicle only, the existing model must be modified to handle vehicle range, loading times and service times.

                         define the flow on each arc (i, j), i.e., the load of the vehicle traversing this arc. The binary variables xij
                         are equal to 1 if and only if arc (i, j) is traversed. Due to the special nature of replenishment arcs, similar but separate variables

                         are used for these arcs. Finally, the variables ti
                         are used to respect vehicle range: they represent the cumulated flight time to arrive at site i since the last departure from the depot (without loading and service times), not the arrival time.

The resulting MILP is defined by Eqs. (2)–(33). The objective function (2) represents the sum of arrival times to affected sites, extending Eq. (1) to multitrips and using the variables defined above.

Constraint (3) means that only one vehicle is used. Eqs. (4) and (5) indicate that exactly one arc is traversed to arrive at each site j and leave it. The last arc of the multitrip is ignored since it has no impact on the objective. Constraints (6)–(8) concern flow variables: Eq. (6) ensure that each demand is satisfied while Eqs. (7) and (8) guarantee that vehicle capacity is respected.

Constraints (9)–(12) concern arc coefficients. Constraints (9) imply that the coefficients of successive arcs decrease along a trip. Eqs. (10)–(12) limit the maximum arc coefficient. Constraints (13)–(18) are simple valid inequalities which are useful to reduce running time when the model is solved by a commercial solver. The coefficients used for loading times, the variables φ

                        , are constrained by Eqs. (19) –(23). The range constraint is implemented via Eqs. (24) –(26), using variables ti
                        .

Finally, constraints (27)–(33) define the seven groups of variables. The model has been tested on small instances and computational results are reported in Section 6.3.

The mt-CCSVRP can also be solved as a set partitioning problem, based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG)

This model takes advantage of Eq. (34) to compute the cost of a multitrip, based on the cost, duration and number of sites of each trip. The sum of arrival times Zp

Constraints (36) imply that each site is visited by exactly one trip. Constraints (37)–(39) control the order of the trips. Eq. (37) (resp. (38)) inhibits the ordering variable

                        ). Eqs. (39) impose an order between trips k and k′ when both belong to the solution.

Note that arc (k, k′) exists in H if and only if the mean duration of trip k is lower than the mean duration of trip k′, thanks to Theorem 3 proved in the sequel. If (k, k′) and (k′, k′′) exist in H, by transitivity (k′′, k) cannot exist and we do not need to define 
                           
                              γ
                              
                                 
                                    k

                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                                 k
                              
                           
                        . Therefore no cycle is possible in a solution.

Finally, Eqs. (40) and (41) define the variables. In Section 6.3 this model is tested and compared with the flow model and the exact method of Section 5 on small instances.

This section describes how to transform the mt-CCSVRP into a resource-constrained shortest path problem. Roughly speaking, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) 
                        
                           
                              G

                           =
                           
                              (
                              K
                              ,
                              H
                              )
                           
                           ,
                        
                      called auxiliary network, where each node in K (called trip-node to distinguish them from the nodes of the real network G) represents one trip, H contains one arc (k, k′) if trip k can be followed by k′ in a multitrip, and the sites become consumable resources. The pre-computation of feasible trips looks very heavy but many trips can be discarded in practice, using two dominance rules stated in Theorems 1 and 2. The process is also sensitive to the vehicle range Lmax
                     , as shown in the tests of Section 6.

One arc links two trip-nodes k and k′ if they have no common site and if a crucial dominance property stated in Theorem 3 holds. It is this dominance rule which leads to an acyclic graph. A feasible solution is a path, called complete path, whose trip-nodes cover all sites.

Each trip k is defined by a cost Ck

                         (for instance), k⊕v will dominate k′⊕v for any sequence v of sites, e.g., (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) will dominate (2, 1, 3, 4, 5). Hence, k′ can be deleted immediately. However, if k and k′ satisfy Theorem 1 but have distinct last sites, e.g. (1, 2, 3) and (3, 1, 2), k dominates k′ but this is not necessarily the case for extensions like (1, 2, 3, 4) and (3, 1, 2, 4). So, Theorem 1 is applied only at the end, once all possible extensions of each trip have been generated.

Note that after the precomputation of K, it is no longer necessary to verify capacity and range constraints. The same trip generation procedure is also used in the set partitioning model described in Section 3.2.


                        H contains one arc (k, k′) if trip-node k can be followed by trip-node k′ in a complete path, e.g., if trip k can be followed by trip k′ in a multitrip. A first condition is that k and k′ visit distinct sites, i.e.,

Like in Feillet et al. (2004) and Azi et al. (2007), we use an extension of Bellman–Ford algorithm with multiple labels per node to solve our resource-constrained shortest path problem. In our version, depicted in Algorithm 1, all paths are implicitly elementary since the graph is directed and acyclic: each partial path undergoes a single extension towards its feasible successors.
                  

The algorithm numbers the trip-nodes from 1 to |K| in topological order. It defines for each trip-node k ∈ K a set Ωk
                      of non-dominated partial paths ending at this trip-node and updates the best solution p
                     * when it is improved. This solution is initialized in line 1 by the best result of two heuristics, called in the procedure Initial_solution described in the sequel.

Each path p is identified by a label

In most shortest path problems on DAGs compare, feasible paths go from the first node (without predecessors) to the last (without successors). Here, other nodes may lack successors or predecessors (see Fig. 2) and a complete path may begin and end at any node. So, for each trip-node k, the algorithm initializes Ωk
                      with the partial path reduced to trip k, with a label

                      (line 6) and tries to extend it by adding one trip k′ at the end. The candidates correspond to the arcs (k, k′) ∈ H. The existence of (k, k′) ensures by construction that trips k and k′ have no common sites but some sites of k′ can be visited by earlier trips on the path: this case is avoided by checking that

We adapted them to concatenate one trip-node k′ at the end of a path p.

This is why the while loop lines 13–16 browses each trip-node u after k, even if the new partial path is complete, to eliminate the existing paths which are dominated. This loop stops when all trip-nodes have been inspected or as soon as an existing path dominates the new one. If the latter is not dominated (line 17), it is added to

Given a partial path p, we describe now five lower bounds for the cost of the best complete path which prolongs p.

                        Section 4 describes two dominance rules to eliminate trip-nodes when building the auxiliary network. We now introduce four other rules to discard partial paths in the shortest path algorithm. The first one (Theorem 4) extends Theorem 1 to compare two partial paths p and p′ instead of two trips k and k′. It simply says that p dominates p′ if it is not more costly, it does not last longer, and all sites visited by p′ are also visited by p.

                        Theorems 5, 6 and 7 give the same result. Since the last dominance rule dominates the others, it is the only one actually used in Algorithm 1.

Two constructive heuristics are executed at the beginning of the algorithm. The best solution obtained is used to initialize p
                        *.


                        First heuristic. Starting with an empty path p, the first heuristic sweeps the trip-nodes in topological order (non-decreasing mean duration) and adds the incumbent trip-node k at the end of p if its sites are not already visited by the path 
                           
                              (
                              
                                 S
                                 p
                              
                              ∩
                              
                                 S
                                 k
                              
                              =
                              ⌀
                              )
                           
                        . The heuristic ends when path p is complete (all sites are covered).


                        Second heuristic. According to the system of equations (43) and the first lower bound, the expression

                         gives a lower bound for the cost of a shortest path beginning with the path p⊕k. Starting again from an empty path, the second heuristic adds at each iteration the feasible trip-node k with the smallest lower bound value.

Computational experiments have been conducted to evaluate and compare the performances of the two mathematical models and the shortest path approach. The instances used are presented in Section 6.1. Section 6.2 appraises the impact of the dominance rules of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 on the auxiliary network generation phase. In Section 6.3, the two mathematical problems are solved using a MIP solver (CPLEX) and compared with the shortest path algorithm on instances with 
                        
                           n
                           =
                           20
                        
                      sites. The exact approach is tested on larger instances with up to 
                        
                           n
                           =

                      in Section 6.4.

The shortest path algorithm is coded in Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2010 Professional while the mathematical models are solved using IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio version 12.5. The computer used is an Intel Core i5 PC at 2.50 GigaHertz with 4 GigaBytes of RAM and Windows 7 Professional.

The 14 classical CVRP instances from Christofides et al. (1979) (CMT instances) were taken as a basis. These benchmark problems with 50–199 customers include 7 instances with service times (instances 6 to 10, plus 13 and 14). We selected instances 6 to 10 with 50, 75, 100, 150 and 199 customers to derive 138 mt-CCSVRP instances, partitioned in four groups containing 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              20
                              ,

                         or 40 sites, respectively. To build the set for one value of n, we take each CMT instance, assume a single vehicle, consider different values for Lmax
                        , keep only the depot and a subset of n sites.

The values for Lmax
                         are multiples of 10, between a minimum feasible value (which depends on the CMT instance) and 120. The nodes selected are the depot and the n first sites i which can be reached by the vehicle, i.e., the ones satisfying 2 · w
                        0i
                         ≤ Lmax
                        . The coordinates of these sites, their demands and service times, and the vehicle capacity are the same as in the original CMT file. The traveling time wij
                         on each edge (i, j) is equal to the Euclidean distance, computed as a double-precision real number.

Finally, the loading time for each trip k in the auxiliary network is computed as

Instances 13 and 14 (100 and 120 customers) have been discarded. Contrary to the other CMT instances, their clustered nodes induce a huge number of trips. For example, instance 13 with

                              =

                         and a selection of

                         sites has already more than 20 millions feasible trips and the auxiliary network requires more than 24 hours to be generated.

As explained in Section 4, Theorem 2 is used to delete dominated trips as soon as they are generated, thus avoiding useless attempts to extend them, while Theorem 1 is used at the end, once all extensions have been done. We tried two strategies to evaluate the impact of these rules. Strategy 1 involves Theorem 1 only, while Strategy 2 applies both theorems. The two strategies end by sorting the set K of non-dominated trips in non-decreasing order of mean trip duration, following Theorem 3, and building the arc-set H. Experiments were conducted on 20 instances with 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              20
                           
                         sites and four Lmax
                         values: the minimum feasible multiple of 10, plus 70, 100 and 120.


                        Table 1 summarizes the results. The two first columns indicate the original CMT instance and the vehicle range Lmax
                        . Column |K| reports the number of non-dominated trips obtained at the end. This number, identical for both strategies, is the number of trip-nodes in the auxiliary graph G′ for the shortest path algorithm. Column Nmax
                         mentions the maximum number of sites per trip, to see the impact of parameter Lmax
                         and have an idea of the size of the solution space. The last four columns provide for each strategy the number of generated trips (columns |Kg
                        |) and the total time in seconds to build the auxiliary graph (columns Time
                           g
                        ).

The table shows that Strategy 1 (Theorem 1 alone) leads to a strong reduction between the |Kg
                        | trips generated and the final |K| non-dominated trips. This reduction ranges from 57% (for CMT06) to 95% (for CMT09), with an average of 77%. Clearly, this reduction gets stronger as Lmax
                         increases but, in parallel, the running time, the number of generated trips and the number of non-dominated trips grow very quickly. The maximum number of sites per trip (Nmax
                        ) is roughly proportional to Lmax
                        .

The application of Theorem 2 in the second strategy brings additional savings. Compared with Strategy 1, the number of generated trips |Kg
                        | is reduced by up to 64% (for CMT09) and by 27% on average. A decrease in running time of up to 81% (CMT09 again) and 74% on average can also be observed: the extra time spent in applying Theorem 2 is compensated by a much smaller number of trip extensions.

Among the instances derived from CMT08, the number of non-dominated trip-nodes |K| is larger for 
                           
                              
                                 L

                         than for 
                           
                              
                                 L

                        . This result is not abnormal since the n sites i extracted, which are the first to satisfy 2 · w
                        0i
                         ≤ Lmax
                        , are not necessarily the same for different Lmax
                         values.


                        Table 2
                        
                         compares
                         the two mathematical models and the shortest path algorithm, reusing the 20 instances with 
                           
                              n
                              =

                         of the previous subsection. The three first columns recall the CMT instance of origin, the range Lmax
                         and the number of non-dominated trip-nodes |K|. For the exact method are reported the optimal solution value 
                           
                              Z
                              
                                 p
                                 *
                              
                           
                         and the total running time in seconds (including network construction via Strategy 2). For each model are given the time in seconds to find an optimal solution (limited to two hours), the percentage gap between the best integer solution found and the best lower bound reported by CPLEX (Gap
                           c
                        ) and the percentage gap between the best integer solution found and the optimal solution. Null gaps are highlighted in boldface while dashes indicate memory overflows in CPLEX.

The results show that the shortest path approach is much more efficient than a direct resolution of the two mixed integer linear programs: it solves all instances to optimality in 69 seconds on average and in 441 seconds (7.4 minutes) in the worst case. Nevertheless, the number of trip-nodes in the auxiliary network and the total running time grow quickly with Lmax
                        . A comparison with the previous table reveals than the fraction of time devoted to the auxiliary network construction increases in parallel, reaching 92.3% for the last instance (309.06 seconds out of 334.80).

Although the instances considered are small (20 sites), the flow-based model retrieves only nine of the optima found by the shortest path algorithm and CPLEX has no proof of optimality since its branch-and-cut is always interrupted after two hours. The CPLEX gaps (column Gapc
                        ) varies between 1% and 10% but is not sensitive to the parameter Lmax
                        .

CPLEX behaves differently on the set partitioning formulation, due to its large number of colums: |K| binary variables are used to select the trips, plus O(|K|2) to enforce the dominance relation for the order of these trips in the multitrip. 5 instances with at most 209 trip-nodes are solved to optimality. The time limit is reached and poor integer solutions are returned for 5 other instances with up to 636 trip-nodes. The 10 remaining instances from 3 321 trip-nodes onwards raise an “out of memory” error.

Contrary to the other instances, on the data files derived from CMT08, the set partitioning formulation obtains an optimal solution when 
                           
                              
                                 L
                                 
                                    m
                                    a

                              =
                              70
                           
                         but not for 
                           
                              
                                 L
                                 
                                    m
                                    a
                                    x
                                 
                              
                              =
                              40
                           
                        . These results can be explained by the number of non-dominated trip-nodes, which is larger in the instance with 
                           
                              
                                 L
                                 
                                    m
                                    a
                                    x
                                 
                              
                              =
                              40
                           
                        .

The previous subsections have shown that the shortest path approach is fast enough for 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              20
                           
                         (one minute on average) to envisage solving larger instances. Tables 3, 4 and 5 respectively gather our results for 25, 30 and 40 sites. Most column headers have been already defined. The number of trips generated |Kg
                        | and the final number of non-dominated trips |K| come again from Strategy 2. We distinguish now between the time to generate the auxiliary network (Time
                           g
                        ) and the time to determine the shortest path (Time
                           s
                        ), and provide the percentage gap between the initial solution and the optimum (Gap
                        0). Concerning vehicle range Lmax
                        , all multiples of 10 between the minimum feasible value and 120 are considered for n ∈ {25, 30}. For 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              40
                              ,
                           
                         
                        Lmax
                         has been limited to 100 otherwise the network is too large.

The results in Tables 3, 4 and 5 confirm the impact of the dominance rule of Theorem 1. If |Kg
                        | and |K| are compared, the number of trip-nodes in the auxiliary network is reduced by 59–82% for instances with 25 sites, 60–85% for 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              30
                              ,
                           
                         and 66–82% for 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              40
                           
                        . These percentage are not significantly affected by the number of sites but tend to increase with Lmax
                        . For most instances, a greater value of |Kg
                        | or |K| implies a greater value of the maximum number of sites per trip Nmax
                        , but the latter can stagnate because of capacity constraints, see for example instance CMT07 in Table 4.

The two heuristics used at the beginning yield very good solutions on average, since Gap
                        0 varies between 0% and 12.7%, with an average value of 4.31%. Nevertheless, a better initial solution does not always imply a faster resolution. Consider in Table 5 instance CMT07 with

                        . They have comparable networks (149, 248 and 152, 764 non-dominated trips). However, the first one which has a better initial gap (2.49% vs. 5.27%) takes longer to be solved (3 258 seconds vs. 2 662 seconds).

The time to generate the auxiliary network and compute the shortest path increases quickly with n and Lmax
                        . For instances with the largest Lmax
                         values, constructing the network can be more time-consuming than determinating the min-cost path, like for CMT10 with

                                    x
                                 
                              
                              =

                         in Table 4. Figs. 3 and 4
                         illustrate respectively the number of non-dominated trip-nodes (|K|) and the total running time (Time
                           g
                         + Time
                           s
                        ) for the different values considered for n and Lmax
                        . Each point is averaged over all instances with the same values of n and Lmax
                        . The left part of each figure uses a linear scale for the Y-axis while the right part is logarithmic. In the logarithmic plots, the curves are almost linear when Lmax
                         is large enough, indicating an exponential growth.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

This paper has presented a new version of the mt-CCVRP, in which only one vehicle is available and the range of the vehicle represents a very restrictive constraint. This combinatorial optimization problem constitutes a good way to model the delivery of relief supplies after a disaster, since the objective function takes into account the urgency of the situation.

Two mathematical models have been compared with an exact approach based on a reformulation of the problem as a resource-constrained shortest path problem. While a commercial MIP software solves only a minority of instances for 20 sites, the exact method can tackle instances with up to 40 sites, thanks to good initial solutions, dominance rules and lower bounds which accelerate the solution procedure. Like many dynamic programming approaches, our method reaches its limits when the state-graph is too big, which happens in our case for large values of the vehicle range (Lmax
                     ).

Among possible future research directions, the exact approach could be used in a column generation scheme for the mt-CCVRP. Cumulative versions of other node-routing problems, such as the Generalized VRP or the Selective VRP, are worth studying to model different distribution policies in humanitarian logistics. Similar objectives like the sum of weighted arrival times are also interesting to reflect site priorities.
