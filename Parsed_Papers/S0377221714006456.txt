                  This paper presents a cyclical square-root model for the term structure of interest rates assuming that the spot rate converges to a certain time-dependent long-term level. This model incorporates the fact that the interest rate volatility depends on the interest rate level and specifies the mean reversion level and the interest rate volatility using harmonic oscillators. In this way, we incorporate a good deal of flexibility and provide a high analytical tractability. Under these assumptions, we compute closed-form expressions for the values of different fixed income and interest rate derivatives. Finally, we analyze the empirical performance of the cyclical model versus that proposed in Cox et al. (1985) and show that it outperforms this benchmark, providing a better fitting to market data.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Through the time, modeling the term structure of interest rates (TSIR) has been the object of many studies and the aim of attention for economists and financial institutions. This paper proposes a cyclical square-root model where the instantaneous interest rate is pulled back to a certain time-dependent long term level characterized by an harmonic oscillator. Therefore, assuming a time-dependent mean reversion level will derive in a time-dependent spot rate volatility. Empirical evidence (see, for instance, Amin & Morton (1994) Chan, Karolyi, Longstaff, & Sanders (1992)) illustrated that interest rate volatility depends on the interest rates level. Then, it seems natural to model interest rate volatility using a similar functional form as that in the mean reversion level.

Models proposed in the academic literature can be classified in endogenous and exogenous. Endogenous models make certain assumptions on the factors that drive the TSIR and their stochastic processes. The TSIR is fully characterized by these factors meaning that the current TSIR is an output rather than an input of the model. Examples of one-factor models are Brennan and Schwartz (1980), Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985), or Vasicek (1977) (CIR from now on). The main drawback of these models is the lack of empirical realism as they do not fit accurately the current TSIR and, consequently, do not price correctly fixed income assets. In order to cope with this problem, we can find two-factor models such as, for instance, Cox et al. (1985), Longstaff and Schwartz (1992), or Schaefer and Schwartz (1984) while Babbs and Nowman (1999), Balduzzi, Das, Foresi, and Sundaram (1996), Beaglehole and Tenny (1991), Chen (1996), Dai and Singleton (2000), and Duffie and Kan (1996) introduced and analyzed different multi-factor models.

On the other hand, exogenous models consider the current TSIR as an input and derive future changes in interest rates avoiding intertemporal arbitrage opportunities. The first contribution was made by Ho and Lee (1986) who showed how to build a model consistent with the initial TSIR. Since this model has some disadvantages, their work has been extended by a number of authors such as Abaffy, Bertocchi, and Gnudi (2005), Black, Derman, and Toy (1990), Black and Karasinski (1991), Brigo, Mercurio, and Morini (2005), Heath, Jarrow, and Morton (1992), Hull and White (1990, 1993), and Mercurio and Moraleda (2000).

Applications and analysis of some of these models can be found in Chen and Huang (2013), Chen and Hu (2010), Chiarella, Clewlow, and Musti (2005), Chiarella, Fanelli, and Musti (2011), Date and Wang (2009), de Frutos (2008), Falini (2010), Hainaut (2009), Hernández, Saunders, and Seco (2012), Mitra, Date, Mamon, and Wang (2013), and Weissensteiner (2010), among others. Excellent literature reviews on term structure TSIR models can be seen in some books as, for instance, Andersen and Piterbarg (2010), Brigo and Mercurio (2006), Cairns (2004), Filipović (2009), Hunt and Kennedy (2004), James and Webber (2001), Munk (2011), Nawalkha, Believa, and Soto (2007), and Rebonato (1998) or papers as Boero and Torricelli (1996), Schmidt (2011), or Vetzal (1994), among others.

Derivative markets trade a huge volume of contracts on a daily basis and derivatives pricing has become an issue of utmost importance. Despite the great progress in this matter, there is still a trade-off between analytical tractability and empirical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a model where the mean reversion level and the spot rate volatility follow a cyclical process characterized by an harmonic oscillator. This cyclical model provides great flexibility to reflect the different shapes that the TSIR can exhibit empirically and provides a high analytical tractability, allowing an accurate fitting of the TSIR and constituting a powerful pricing tool. Under this framework, we analytically price zero-coupon bonds and different derivatives such as forward on bonds, European options on zero-coupon and coupon-bearing bonds, European bond forward options, swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, collars, and provide some risk management measures. Finally, we analyze the empirical performance of this model versus its natural benchmark, the CIR model. We show that, for the data set used in this analysis, the cyclical model outperforms this benchmark, providing a much better fitting to current data for every time horizon.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the cyclical model and its practical implications. Section 3 presents the general pricing partial differential equation and derives closed-form expressions for different derivatives. Section 4 presents the empirical analysis of the model. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the main findings and conclusions. Mathematical proofs are deferred to Appendix A.

In this section, we propose our model and the specific functional form for each time-dependent parameter, and describe all the practical implications arising from this model.

                     These specific expressions guarantee the positiveness of the mean reversion level and the interest rate volatility. It is clear that this model nests the CIR one taking

                      in Eqs. (4) and (5). Note that we incorporate two additional parameters, phase and frequency, with respect to the CIR model.

For square-root processes of this type, Cox et al. (1985) shows that the distribution function of interest rates is a rescaled non-central chi-square with

In Fig. 1
                         we plot the discount function for four arbitrary set of parameters in the cyclical model against the CIR model. We can see the ability of our proposed model to fit different shapes of the term structure of bond prices, adding much more flexibility with the same analytical tractability as in the CIR model.

The following Corollary immediately arises.
                           Corollary 1
                           
                              As a coupon bond can be interpreted as a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds, pricing of coupon bonds is straightforward applying Proposition 
                              1.□

Replacing the bond price expression obtained in Proposition 1 into (7), (8) and using Eqs. (2)–(11), we get the next Corollary.

                        Fig. 2
                         shows the TSIR for four different set of parameters in the cyclical model against the CIR model. We can see that our model is capable of replicating several different shapes of the TSIR such as upward sloping, downward sloping, humped, and inverted humped.

For illustrative purposes, Figs. 3 and 4
                        
                         show how the TSIR responds to changes in the mean reversion speed and volatility in both models. In the CIR model, the higher the speed of mean reversion, the higher the interest rate while, in the cyclical model, the lower the mean reversion speed, the flatter the TSIR. Besides, in this model, there is a twist in the pattern due to the cyclical behavior. In Fig. 4, for both models, the higher the volatility, the lower the TSIR.


                        Figs. 5 and 6
                        
                         reflect the response of the TSIR to different values of the mean reversion level parameter in both models. In the CIR model, the higher the mean reversion level, the higher the yield. In the cyclical model, it is harder to analyze this response as it depends on three parameters. Anyway, we observe that the lower the amplitude, the flatter and the lower the TSIR. When changing the temporal frequency, it seems clear that the higher the temporal frequency, the more humped the TSIR. Finally, for different offset phases, the curves occasionally crossover each other.

On the risk management side, we get the following Corollary.

This section derives the closed-form expression for the price of any interest rate derivative. For this endeavor, we will move from the risk-neutral to the s-forward measure, determining the corresponding probability law. First, consider a derivative whose pay-off at time s is given by

                                  can not be interpreted as the forward price at time t, but as the price at time t of an asset paying the forward price at time s.□


                                 For all the above cases, put option prices arise directly from the put-call parity.

In this subsection we focus our attention on pricing “pure” interest rate derivatives, that is, derivatives whose underlying is directly the interest rate. We start pricing FRAs, and then, we move to more complicated products such as swaps, caps, floors, and collars.

Consider a FRA with $1 notional value and maturity s, where the investor agrees to pay a fixed interest rate K and receive a floating rate with tenor

An interest rate swap can be interpreted as either the difference between two coupon bonds or a portfolio of FRAs. Hence, swap valuation is a straightforward application of Proposition 1 or 8. Moreover, swaptions can be valued applying Proposition 6.

A cap (floor) contract guarantees to its holder a pay-off if a certain floating interest rate is above (below) a specified rate, the cap (floor) level. Similarly to swaps, caps and floors involve a series of regular payments, usually referred as caplets or floorlets. Therefore, a cap (floor) can be interpreted as a portfolio of caplets (floorlets).

Consider a caplet written on a floating rate with $1 face value and maturity s. If the caplet is exercised, the investor pays a fixed interest rate K and receives a floating rate with tenor

In order to price a floorlet, same type of calculations as in this Proposition can be used. Alternatively, we can use the caplet–floorlet parity.

Cap, floor, and collar prices are a straightforward application of these results.

In this section we analyze the empirical performance of the cyclical model versus the CIR model. In other words we estimate the gain provided by the incorporation of the harmonic oscillators into the pricing formula. In the pricing section we have computed analytical expressions for interest rates and for bond and derivative prices. Hence, we could use realized data on either of these variables to evaluate the empirical performance of the cyclical model. On this regard, we consider the yield to maturity time series for four different alternatives, namely, 3-months, and 1-, 5-, and 10-years maturities. In this way we can asses the model ability to fit short-, medium-, and long-term maturities. Note that we can directly relate the yield to maturity with the zero-coupon bond price as stated in Corollary 3. Moreover, applying Proposition 1, we have that the yield to maturity is given by the following expression

                     We opt for using interest rate data because a good fit of the discount function for future cash flows should suggest a potentially good fit of bond prices, and later, of interest rate derivative prices. Alternatively, it is unclear that a relatively good fit of derivative prices might necessarily imply a good fit of the discount factor. Obviously, the empirical analysis of the cyclical model for derivative prices is an interesting issue and is left for further research.

The data set used for this study consists of daily yields obtained from US Treasury (constant maturity) Bills. In more detail, we consider four maturities, 3-months, 1-, 5-, and 10-years, from February 1, 2013 up to February 11, 2014. Each time series consists of 257 daily observations. Fig. 7
                      presents the time series graph for each maturity. We can see that the 3-month yield provides very low values during the whole period, in fact it becomes null on September 26, 2013, while the maximum yield does not exceed 0.14%. The 1-year rate displays a similar behavior with very low rates oscillating between 0.09% and 0.17%. Finally, the 5- and 10-year yields present a quite alike picture (the linear correlation between both series is 0.9852) but with different mean level.

The fitting or calibrating problem can be formulated as a problem of minimizing the sum of squared pricing errors in the form of a regression model, that is

                     , the sum of the absolute value of pricing errors. We can see that the cyclical model provides a more precise adjustment to actual market data, reducing the aggregate sum of square residuals of the 3-month, 1-, 5-, and 10-year maturities by 42%, 25%, 70%, and 81%, respectively.


                     Fig. 8
                      compares graphically the pricing errors (in absolute value) of both models for every maturity and during the whole sample period. We can see that most of the time the cyclical model outperforms the CIR one. Moreover, whenever the CIR model provides lower pricing errors than the cyclical model, the gap between both models is quite narrow. However, there are many days where the cyclical model provides much lower pricing errors and the gap with the CIR model is quite large.

It is worth to mention that, for the regression problem, we have assumed the approximation provided in Remark 1. For each regression problem the values of the parameter q obtained for the four maturities under analysis are

                      shows the comparison between the Mathieu cosine and sines versus their respective approximation functions. We can see that, in both cases, the approximation is excellent, in fact we are not able to spot any visual difference.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper has presented a cyclical square-root model for the TSIR assuming that the mean reversion level of interest rates and the spot rate volatility follow a cyclical behavior modeled by an harmonic oscillator functional form. This specification preserves the analytical tractability and provides high flexibility, allowing the model to capture a variety of different shapes of the discount factor and the TSIR. We have included several examples where, for arbitrary sets of parameters, our model is capable of replicating different yield curve shapes such as upward sloping, downward sloping, humped, and inverted humped. In addition, we have presented a thoroughly analysis on how the TSIR responds to different values of each parameter, illustrating an interesting insight of the model main features. Moreover, fixing the temporal frequency to zero, the cyclical model nests the original one presented in Cox et al. (1985).

Under this framework, we have derived closed-form expressions for the prices of bonds, forward on bonds, European options on zero-coupon and coupon-bearing bonds, European bond forward options, swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, and collars.

Finally, we have analyzed the empirical performance of the cyclical model versus its natural benchmark, the CIR model. Our findings show that the cyclical model provides a much better fitting to market data, reducing significantly the aggregate sum of square residuals for every maturity. Then, this model can reflect more adequately than its competitor possible changes in short-, medium-, and long-term rates.

The results obtained have strong practical applications. As stated before, there is a trade-off between analytical tractability and empirical accuracy. In this sense, our model fulfills a real necessity providing a powerful and simple tool for pricing and risk management purposes and for empirical issues and should be of special interest for traders, financial institutions, and risk managers.
