                  An extension of the restricted Delaunay-refinement algorithm for surface mesh generation is described, where a new point-placement scheme is introduced to improve element quality in the presence of mesh size constraints. Specifically, it is shown that the use of off-centre Steiner points, positioned on the faces of the associated Voronoi diagram, typically leads to significant improvements in the shape- and size-quality of the resulting surface tessellations. The new algorithm can be viewed as a Frontal-Delaunay approach — a hybridisation of conventional Delaunay-refinement and advancing-front techniques in which new vertices are positioned to satisfy both element size and shape constraints. The performance of the new scheme is investigated experimentally via a series of comparative studies that contrast its performance with that of a typical Delaunay-refinement technique. It is shown that the new method inherits many of the best features of classical Delaunay-refinement and advancing-front type methods, leading to the construction of smooth, high quality surface triangulations with bounded radius-edge ratios and convergence guarantees. Experiments are conducted using a range of complex benchmarks, verifying the robustness and practical performance of the proposed scheme.

Surface mesh generation is a key component in a variety of computational modelling and simulation tasks, including many forms of computational engineering and numerical modelling, a range of problems in computer graphics and animation, and various data visualisation applications. Given a geometric domain described by a bounding surface 
                        Σ
                      embedded in 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              3
                           
                        
                     , the surface triangulation problem consists of tessellating 
                        Σ
                      into a mesh of non-overlapping triangular elements, such that all geometrical, topological and user-defined constraints are satisfied. While each use-case contributes its own set of specific considerations, it is typical to require that surface tessellations: (i) consist of elements of high shape–quality, (ii) provide good geometrical and topological approximations to the underlying surface 
                        Σ
                     , and (iii) satisfy a set of user-specified element sizing constraints. While various strategies have been developed to solve the surface meshing problem in the past, a new algorithm is developed in this study with the aim of improving the quality of the resulting triangulations. This new work is an extension of initial studies presented by the authors in [1].

Mesh generation is a broad and evolving area of research. A number of algorithms have been developed to tackle various meshing tasks, including grid-overlay methods  [2,3] in which a mesh is generated by warping and refining a semi-structured background grid, advancing-front techniques  [4–7] which grow a mesh incrementally in a layer-wise fashion, and Delaunay-based strategies  [8–17] which incrementally refine an initially coarse Delaunay triangulation.

The Delaunay triangulation  [18] is imbued with a number of attractive theoretical properties. In the context of mesh generation, for triangulations in 
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                         and surface tessellations embedded in 
                           
                              
                                 R

                        , it is known that such structures are topologically optimal  [19], maximising the worst-case element quality in the resulting mesh. The reader is referred to  [19] for additional details. As the name suggests, Delaunay-refinement schemes are based on the incremental refinement of an initially coarse bounding Delaunay tessellation. At each step of the algorithm, elements that violate a set of geometrical, topological or user-defined constraints are identified and the worst offending element is eliminated. This is achieved through the insertion of an additional Steiner-vertex at the refinement point of the element—either the circumcentre of the element itself, or a point on an adjacent segment of the bounding geometry. The original planar Delaunay-refinement methods of Chew  [8] and Ruppert  [9,10] have since been extended to support volumetric tessellations  [12] and surface triangulations  [15,16,14].

Delaunay-based methods have previously been applied to the surface meshing problem, via the so-called restricted Delaunay paradigm originally introduced by Edelsbrunner and Shah  [20]. Given a surface

                           X
                         is sufficiently dense and well-distributed, the restricted Delaunay triangulation

                         is an accurate piecewise approximation of 
                           Σ
                        , incorporating several theoretical guarantees of fidelity. Given such behaviour, a Delaunay-refinement algorithm for surface mesh generation proceeds as per the planar case, with an initially coarse restricted Delaunay triangulation, induced by a sparse sampling 
                           X
                           ∈
                           Σ
                        , being incrementally refined via the introduction of new Steiner vertices positioned on the surface 
                           Σ
                        . This process is discussed in detail in Section  2.

Advancing-front techniques are an alternative approach to mesh generation, in which elements are created one-by-one, starting from a set of frontal facets initialised on the bounding geometry. The mesh is marched inwards layer-by-layer, with new elements created by carefully positioning vertices adjacent to facets in the frontal set. Following the placement of new elements, the set of frontal facets is updated to incorporate the new mesh topology. Elements are added incrementally in this fashion until a complete tessellation of the domain is obtained. Such methods are applicable to surface meshing problems  [5–7], although several non-trivial issues of robustness are known to exist  [7]. Fundamentally, advancing-front techniques are heuristic in nature, and do not typically offer theoretical guarantees of convergence or bounds on element quality. Nonetheless, when such methods are successful, they are known to produce very high-quality tessellations.

Due to their theoretical robustness, Delaunay-refinement schemes are a popular choice for practical meshing algorithms. On the other hand, it is well known that optimised advancing-front type methods can often produce meshes with superior element quality characteristics, though their heuristics can sometimes break-down in practice. In this study, a new Frontal-Delaunay algorithm is presented which seeks to combine the benefits of classical Delaunay-refinement and advancing-front type approaches. While such strategies have been pursued previously in the case of planar and/or volumetric refinement algorithms, it is believed that the present study is the first application of such ideas to the restricted surface meshing problem directly. The new algorithm is designed to produce smooth, high-quality triangulations consistent with an advancing-front scheme, whilst also inheriting the theoretical robustness of Delaunay-based techniques. It is expected that this new algorithm may be of interest to users who place a high premium on mesh quality, including those operating in the areas of computational engineering and numerical simulation.

A brief review of the traditional surface Delaunay-refinement scheme is presented in Section  2, along with a discussion of the underlying theoretical constructs, including the restricted Delaunay tessellation. The new Frontal-Delaunay algorithm is presented in Section  3, focusing in-detail on the off-centre point-placement scheme proposed in this work. In Section  5, a detailed comparison between the conventional Delaunay-refinement and proposed Frontal-Delaunay schemes is presented, contrasting output quality and computational performance.

Delaunay-refinement algorithms operate by incrementally adding new Steiner vertices to an initially coarse restricted Delaunay triangulation of the underlying surface. Contrary to typical planar algorithms  [8–10], refinement schemes for surface meshing are designed not only to ensure that the resulting mesh satisfies element shape and size constraints, but that the geometry and topology of the mesh itself is an accurate piecewise approximation of the underlying surface.

Before discussing the details of Delaunay-refinement algorithms for surface meshing problems, a number of important theoretical concepts are introduced:

The development of provably-good Delaunay-refinement schemes for surface-based mesh generation is an ongoing area of research. An algorithm for the meshing of closed 2-manifolds embedded in 
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                        , adapted largely from the methods presented by Boissonnat and Oudot in  [15,16] is presented here. This method is largely equivalent to the cgalmesh algorithm, available as part of the cgal package, and summarised by Jamin, Alliez, Yvinec and Boissonnat in  [17]. A similar algorithm is also described by Cheng, Dey and Shewchuk in  [19] and Dey and Levine in  [24], while a variant developed for the reconstruction of medical images is presented by Foteinos, Chernikov and Chrisochoides in  [25]. The algorithm presented in this section is referred to as the ‘conventional’ Delaunay-refinement approach throughout, due to its direct use of circumcentre-based Steiner vertices.

As per Jamin et al.  [17], the development of the conventional Delaunay-refinement algorithm is geometry-agnostic, being independent of the specific description used for the underlying surface 
                           Σ
                        . It is required only that the geometry support a so-called oracle predicate that can be used to compute the intersection of a given line segment with the surface 
                           Σ
                        . The Frontal-Delaunay algorithm presented in Section  3, additionally requires that the oracle compute intersections between a disc of a given radius and the surface 
                           Σ
                        . Such constructions will be discussed in further detail in Section  3. While a very general class of surface description is supported at the theoretical level, in this study, attention is restricted to the development of so-called remeshing operations, in which the underlying surfaces 
                           Σ
                         are specified as existing 2-manifold triangular complexes 
                           P
                        . This restriction is made in the present study for convenience only, and future work is intended to focus on more general surface descriptions, including implicit and analytic functions, in addition to those that contain sharp creases.

Following Jamin et al.  [17], the Delaunay-refinement algorithm takes as input a surface domain, described by a smooth 2-manifold 
                           Σ
                        , an upper bound on the allowable element radius-edge ratio 
                           
                              
                                 ρ

                        , a mesh size function

                         defined at all points on the surface 
                           Σ
                         and an upper bound on the allowable surface discretisation error

The Delaunay-refinement algorithm begins by creating an initial point-wise sampling of the surface

                        . Exploiting the discrete representation available for 
                           Σ
                        , in this study the initial sampling is obtained as a well-distributed subset of the existing vertices 
                           Y
                           ∈
                           P
                        , where 
                           P
                         is the polyhedral representation of the surface 
                           Σ
                        . Care is taken to ensure that each connected component in 
                           P
                         is sampled. Alternative initialisation methods making use of robust persistent-triangle techniques are described in  [16,19].

Frontal-Delaunay algorithms are a hybridisation of advancing-front and Delaunay-refinement techniques, in which a Delaunay triangulation is used to define the topology of a mesh while new Steiner vertices are inserted in a manner consistent with advancing-front methodologies. In practice, such techniques have been observed to produce very high-quality meshes, inheriting the smooth, semi-structured vertex placement of pure advancing-front methods and the optimal mesh topology of Delaunay-based approaches. While Frontal-Delaunay methods have previously been used by a range of authors in the context of planar, volumetric and parametric surface meshing, including, for example studies by Üngör and Erten  [27], Rebay  [28], Mavriplis  [29], Frey, Borouchaki and George  [30], and Remacle, Henrotte, Carrier-Baudouin, Béchet, Marchandise, Geuzaine and Mouton  [31], the authors are not aware of any previous investigations describing the application of such techniques to the surface meshing problem directly. The conventional advancing-front method, on the other hand, has been generalised to support surface meshing, as, for example, outlined in studies by Rypl  [32,6] and Schreiner, Scheidegger, Fleishman and Silva  [7,33].

In these previous studies, the conventional planar advancing-front methodology is extended directly to facilitate surface operations. Meshing proceeds via the incremental introduction of a well-distributed set of vertices 
                        X
                      positioned on the surface 
                        X
                        ∈
                        Σ
                     . It should be noted that, contrary to the restricted Delaunay techniques introduced in previous sections, advancing-front methods typically maintain a partial, and possibly non-Delaunay manifold triangular complex

                              Σ
                           
                        
                      only—they do not construct a full-dimensional tessellation 
                        T
                        
                           
                              |
                           
                           
                              Ω
                           
                        
                     . It should also be noted that, in addition to the usual limitations associated with advancing-front strategies, serious issues of robustness often afflict these techniques in practice due to the difficulties associated with the reliable evaluation of the requisite geometric intersection and overlap predicates for sets of non-planar elements. Additionally, for highly curved and/or poorly separated surface definitions it is known to be difficult to ensure the topological correctness of the output mesh

                     . Schreiner et al.  [7,33] introduce a number of heuristic techniques in an effort to overcome these difficulties.

The new Frontal-Delaunay algorithm is based primarily on a generalisation of ideas introduced by Rebay, who, in  [28], developed a planar Frontal-Delaunay algorithm in which new vertices are positioned along edges of the associated Voronoi diagram. Rebay showed that new vertices can be positioned on

                        , a strategy broadly consistent with conventional advancing-front techniques. While his algorithm maintains a Delaunay triangulation

                           =

                         of the current vertex set 
                           X
                        , it is still fundamentally an advancing-front scheme—bereft of guarantees on the element shape quality

                        . Rebay reported that his scheme produced very high-quality output, typically outperforming conventional Delaunay-refinement in practice.

Üngör and Erten have approached the problem from the flip-side, introducing the notion of generalised Steiner vertices for planar Delaunay-refinement methods. Their ‘off-centre’ vertices are points lying along edges in the associated Voronoi diagram, as per Rebay. In  [34], Üngör showed that when refining a triangle 
                           τ
                        , its off-centre should be positioned, if possible, such that the new triangle

                        . Importantly, Üngör demonstrated that such a strategy typically leads to an improvement in the performance of Delaunay-refinement in practice, reducing the size of the output

                        . Üngör extended the guarantees derived for Ruppert’s Delaunay-refinement algorithm to his off-centre technique and showed that such bounds are typically improved upon in practice. Off-centre refinement is based on Ruppert’s Delaunay-refinement framework directly, involving modifications to the procedure used to refine low-quality triangles only.

The use of generalised Delaunay-refinement strategies has also been explored by Chernikov, Chrisochoides and Foteinos in [35,36], in which Steiner points are positioned within a set of so-called selection-balls adjacent to element circumcentres. In  [35], Chernikov and Chrisochoides show that a family of ‘provably-good’ generalised two- and three-dimensional Delaunay-refinement schemes exist, and can be realised via the specification of appropriate selection-ball radii parameters. It is unclear whether this selection-ball formalism incorporates the full set of Voronoi-type off-centres currently in use, including those introduced by Rebay  [28], and Erten and Üngör  [27], in addition to the strategies defined in the present study. Such a determination may form the basis for future work.

In this study, a generalisation of the ideas introduced by Rebay and Üngör is formulated for the surface meshing problem—using off-centre Steiner vertices to simulate the vertex placement strategy of a conventional advancing-front approach, while also preserving the framework of a restricted Delaunay-refinement technique. The aim of such a strategy is to recover the high element qualities and smooth, semi-structured point-placement generated by frontal methods, while inheriting the theoretical guarantees of Delaunay-refinement methods. Advancing-front algorithms typically incorporate a mesh size function

The proposed Frontal-Delaunay algorithm is an extension of the restricted Delaunay-refinement algorithm presented in Section  2, modified to use off-centre rather than circumcentre-based refinement strategies. The basic framework is consistent with the Delaunay-refinement algorithm described previously, in which an initially coarse restricted Delaunay triangulation of a surface

In addition to the use of ‘off-centre’ point-placement schemes, the Frontal-Delaunay algorithm also introduces changes to the order in which elements are refined. To better mimic the behaviour of an advancing-front type method, elements are refined only if they are adjacent to an existing ‘frontal’ entity. In the case of surface facets

This so-called packing-lemma states that any point-set 
                           X
                         in a bounded domain 
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 d
                              
                           
                         for which there exists a positive minimum separation distance between the points in 
                           X
                         must, consequently, be finite. As such, if it can be shown that a meshing algorithm preserves such a minimum separation length between its vertices, Lemma 1 can be invoked to prove that such a vertex-set is finite, and, as a result, that termination of the algorithm is guaranteed. Lemma 1 is stated here without proof—interested readers are referred to  [19] for full details.

Before examining the behaviour of the Frontal-Delaunay algorithm as a whole, the impact of a single refinement operation is analysed. Firstly, the behaviour of the various off-centre point-placement schemes introduced in Section  3.3 is examined:

Using Propositions 2 and 3, the off-centre point-placement strategies utilised in the Frontal-Delaunay algorithm are shown to constitute a ‘safe’ set of refinement operations, with the insertion of Type I vertices leading to a non-decreasing minimum edge-length and use of the Type II scheme declined once the mesh is sufficiently well refined. Using these results, termination of the full Frontal-Delaunay algorithm can be re-visited:

                                    Using Proposition 3, it is known that the introduction of Type II off-centres is declined once the mesh is sufficiently well refined. Type I points alone can therefore be relied upon to satisfy element shape-constraints.

Using (i)–(iii), the progression of the Frontal-Delaunay algorithm can be examined. Starting with an initial vertex distribution

                              , both Type I and Type II point-placement schemes are used to satisfy mesh-size and surface-error constraints—with refinement continuing until all surface balls are sufficiently small, as per (ii)–(iii). Any remaining low-quality elements in violation of the radius-edge constraints are subsequently refined through the insertion of Type I vertices alone. This final phase is guaranteed to preserve minimum edge-length.

Using Lemma 1, it is clear that the Frontal-Delaunay algorithm is guaranteed to produce a point-wise sampling 
                                 X
                                 ∈

                               of finite size and must terminate in a finite number of steps as a consequence.

Finite termination leads directly to a number of useful auxiliary guarantees on both the nature and quality of the output tessellation. Adopting the conventional terminology, surface meshes generated using the Frontal-Delaunay algorithm can be considered to be ‘provably-good’:

In addition to proofs of termination and convergence, it is also necessary to ensure the point-set 
                           X
                           ∈
                           Σ
                         remains well-distributed throughout the refinement process. Such behaviour requires that no spurious short edges be introduced within the initial refinement phase as the algorithm seeks to satisfy mesh-size and surface-error constraints.

While the preceding results address the behaviour and performance of the underlying Delaunay-refinement algorithm, the approximation quality of the resulting mesh is also a key consideration. Using the framework introduced by Boissonnat and Oudot  [15,16], a variety of geometrical and topological guarantees are sought. Firstly, a number of results from  [15,16] are summarised:
                           Definition 5
                           Given a bounded domain 
                                 Ω
                               enclosed by a surface 
                                 Σ
                              , the medial-axis of 
                                 Ω
                               is the topological closure of the set of centres of empty balls that touch the surface 
                                 Σ
                               at more than one point.

Noting that the medial-axis lies at the ‘centre’ of any geometrical features in the domain induced by 
                           Σ
                        , it is clear that the distance to the medial axis, denoted 
                           
                              
                                 d
                              
                              
                                 M
                              
                           
                           
                              (
                              
                                 x
                              
                              )
                           
                         throughout, is a measure of the local ‘thickness’ of the domain. Using such considerations, Boissonnat and Oudot introduce the notion of loose 
                        
                           ϵ

                         that induce restricted surface triangulations 
                           
                              Del
                           
                           
                              
                                 |

The reader is referred to  [15,16] or  [19] for additional details and proofs. Boissonnat and Oudot go on to show that restricted Delaunay refinement, consistent with the algorithm presented in Section  2, is a ‘provably-good’ technique, being guaranteed to produce a loose

The Frontal-Delaunay algorithm presented in this study derives from the same Delaunay-refinement framework developed in [15,16], and inherits much of its theoretical robustness as a result. Using the properties of loose 
                           ϵ
                        -samples, the surface triangulations generated using the Frontal-Delaunay algorithm are guaranteed to be a good geometrical and topological approximation to the underlying surface—provided the mesh size function is sufficiently small:

The performance of the Delaunay-refinement and Frontal-Delaunay surface meshing algorithms presented in Sections  2 and 3 was investigated experimentally, with both techniques used to mesh a series of benchmark problems. Both the Frontal-Delaunay and Delaunay-refinement algorithms were implemented, allowing the performance and output of the two techniques to be compared side-by-side. Due to similarities in the overall algorithmic structure, a common code-base was used, with the algorithms differing only in the type of Steiner vertices inserted, as per the discussions outlined in Section  3. Care was taken to ensure that both methods were implemented in a consistent fashion, allowing unbiased comparisons to be made between the algorithms without needing to account for systemic differences arising from particular implementation and/or design choices. Both algorithms were implemented in C++  and compiled as 64-bit executables. Both the Frontal-Delaunay and Delaunay-refinement algorithms have been implemented as part of the jigsaw meshing package, currently available by request from the first author. These implementations are referred to as jgsw-fd and jgsw-dr throughout the following discussions, with the suffixes –fd and –dr denoting ‘Frontal-Delaunay’ and ‘Delaunay-refinement’, respectively.

In order to provide additional performance information, the well-known cgalmesh implementation  [17] was also included in a subset of the meshing comparisons. The cgalmesh algorithm was sourced from version 4.6 of the cgal package  [40,41] and was compiled as a 64-bit library. The cgalmesh algorithm is referred to as cgal-dr throughout the following discussions, with the suffix –dr denoting ‘Delaunay-refinement’. All tests were run using a single core of an Intel i7 processor. Visualisation and post-processing was completed using matlab.

The various Delaunay-refinement and Frontal-Delaunay algorithms were used to mesh a series of eight benchmark problems, including (i) a set of three test-cases presented in Fig. 4
                        , in which the performance of the new jgsw-fd algorithm and the existing cgal-dr implementation was compared, (ii) three additional test-cases shown in Fig. 5
                        , designed to contrast the performance of the jgsw-fd and jgsw-dr algorithms, and (iii) two detailed comparative studies presented in Figs. 6 and 7
                        
                         designed to assess the impact of non-uniform mesh-sizing constraints on the performance of the jgsw-fd and jgsw-dr algorithms.

Overall, both Delaunay-refinement algorithms (cgal-dr, jgsw-dr) and the new Frontal-Delaunay technique (jgsw-fd) were found to successfully mesh the full set of benchmark problems, satisfying all constraints. These results demonstrate that the new Frontal-Delaunay technique is capable of generating high-quality surface triangulations, satisfying constraints on element shape–quality

                               is the root-mean-square edge length.

The area–length ratio is a robust, scalar measure of element shape–quality, and is typically normalised to achieve a score of +1 for ideal elements. The area–length ratio decreases with increasing distortion, achieving a score of +0 for degenerate elements and −1 for fully inverted elements.

The performance of the jgsw-fd and cgal-dr algorithms was assessed using a set of three test-cases. The elephant, hip and bunny geometries were meshed using uniform mesh-size constraints, with a small constant value,

                                 x
                              
                              )

                           α
                         was chosen to be approximately 2% of the mean bounding-box dimension associated with each model. Due to differences in the way that mesh-size constraints are interpreted by the two meshing packages, the mesh-size value selected for the cgal-dr algorithm was reduced by a factor of 
                           
                              
                                 4

                        . This reduction accounts for the fact that in cgal-dr, mesh-size constraints are imposed with respect to the element circumradii, whereas the jgsw-fd algorithm treats the mesh-size function in terms of element edge length. Both algorithms were found to produce meshes incorporating consistent mean edge-lengths based on these modified mesh-size values.

Overall, the results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that both the jgsw-fd and cgal-dr algorithms generate high-quality surface meshes for all test cases—satisfying the required element shape–quality, mesh-size and surface discretisation error thresholds. Focusing on the distribution of element shape–quality explicitly, it is clear that the jgsw-fd algorithm achieves significantly better results, producing meshes with higher mean area–length ratios in all cases. In fact, with mean area–length ratios of

                         for cgal-dr), it is clear that the vast majority of elements generated by the jgsw-fd algorithm are of near-ideal shape. This improvement in mean mesh-quality is also evident in the distribution of element plane-angles, with the jgsw-fd approach generating histograms clustered more tightly about 60°. These results are confirmed by an analysis of the mean-absolute-deviation in angle,

                        , showing that the spread of the plane-angle distribution is reduced by a factor of approximately three through use of the jgsw-fd algorithm. Finally, analysis of the relative-length distributions shows that meshes generated using the jgsw-fd algorithm tightly conform to the imposed mesh size constraints, with a tight clustering of

In terms of computational expense, meshes generated by the jgsw-fd and cgal-dr algorithms are shown to be very similar in size. Additionally, despite the additional work required to support the off-centre refinement scheme, the jgsw-fd algorithm appears to be slightly more efficient than cgal-dr, though the difference in run-time performance is not significant.

Consistent with the analysis presented in Section  5.3, the performance of the jgsw-fd and jgsw-dr algorithms was next assessed. While cgal-dr and jgsw-dr are representative of the same class of meshing algorithms, the benchmarks included in this section allow for an unbiased comparison of the Frontal-Delaunay and Delaunay-refinement approaches, with both the jgsw-fd and jgsw-dr algorithms benefiting from the same set of implementation design and optimisation decisions.

Consistent with the previous analysis, the performance of the jgsw-fd and jgsw-dr algorithms was assessed using a set of three test-cases. The ifp2, femur and rocker geometries shown in Fig. 5 were meshed using uniform mesh-size constraints, with a small constant value,

                           α
                        , imposed globally, where 
                           α
                         was chosen to be approximately 2% of the mean bounding-box dimension associated with each model. An analysis of the distributions of element area–length, plane-angle and relative edge-length measures confirms much the behaviour noted in Section  5.3—in terms of overall mesh-quality and size-conformance, the jgsw-fd algorithm is a clear winner.

An analysis of computational expense leads to different conclusions, with the jgsw-dr algorithm seen to produce meshes that are slightly and yet consistently larger than those generated using jgsw-fd. The jgsw-dr scheme also appears to be somewhat faster than the jgsw-fd algorithm, typically requiring only approximately 70% of the run-time imposed by jgsw-fd. Such behaviour is not unexpected, with the additional work associated with the off-centre point-placement scheme employed in jgsw-fd expected to result in lower overall performance. The search for additional efficiency in the jgsw-fd algorithm is an interesting topic for future research.

Analysis of Figs. 6 and 7 ​shows that both the jgsw-fd and jgsw-dr algorithms generate high-quality meshes for all test cases—satisfying the required element quality, size and surface error thresholds. Analysis of the area–length and plane-angle distributions again shows that the jgsw-fd algorithm consistently outperforms the jgsw-dr scheme, generating meshes with higher mean area–length ratios in all cases. Furthermore, it is evident that the quality of meshes generated using the Frontal-Delaunay algorithm improves with increased uniformity, via

In contrast, similar analysis shows that output generated via the jgsw-dr scheme to be essentially independent of sizing uniformity, with distributions of 
                           a

                        . Visually, the enhanced quality of the meshes generated using the Frontal-Delaunay algorithm is again evident, with all test cases showing a marked increase in both smoothness and sub-structure. Given the tight bounds on radius-edge ratios in these tests, the Delaunay-refinement algorithm appears to achieve a maximum mean area–length ratio

                           0.92
                        . The Frontal-Delaunay algorithm is seen to generate consistently better output, with mean area–length metrics reaching

                              )
                           
                           ≃
                           0.97
                         at high resolution settings.

Consistent with previous results, analysis of the distribution of relative-length ratios show that the jgsw-fd algorithm tightly conforms to the imposed non-uniform sizing constraints, with 
                           
                              
                                 h

                         tightly clustered about 1. Furthermore, like the element shape–quality results discussed previously, it can be seen that this distribution improves as 
                           g
                           →
                           0
                        , as indicated by the narrowing of the distribution about 
                           
                              
                                 h
                              
                              
                                 r
                              
                           
                           =
                           1
                        . In contrast, the Delaunay-refinement scheme is again shown to be consistently associated with significant sizing error, as illustrated by broad distributions of relative-length straddling 
                           
                              
                                 h
                              
                              
                                 r

                           1
                        . Such behaviour appears to be largely independent of the characteristics of the imposed mesh size constraints.

A new Frontal-Delaunay algorithm has been developed to triangulate smooth surfaces embedded in 
                        
                           
                              R

                     . The new algorithm is based on the so-called restricted Delaunay paradigm, in which a surface mesh 
                        
                           Del
                        
                        
                           
                              |

                     , conforming to an underlying surface description 
                        Σ
                     , is constructed as a subset of a full-dimensional Delaunay tessellation 
                        
                           Del
                        
                        
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                     . The new restricted Frontal-Delaunay algorithm is based on a generalisation of the work of Rebay  [28] and Üngör  [34] for planar problems, in which generalised ‘off-centre’ Steiner vertices are inserted along edges in the Voronoi diagram. This work has been extended to support surface meshing operations through the development of a new point-placement strategy that positions vertices on facets in the underlying Voronoi complex. This new scheme allows for the insertion of both size- and shape-optimal Steiner vertices, leading to a hybrid approach that combines many of the advantages of conventional advancing-front and Delaunay-refinement techniques. A series of comparative experimental studies confirm the effectiveness of this new approach in practice, demonstrating that an improvement in mesh-quality is typically achieved when compared to conventional Delaunay-refinement schemes. Importantly, it has also been demonstrated that the new Frontal-Delaunay algorithm satisfies the same set of constraints as conventional restricted Delaunay-refinement approaches, adhering to limits on element radius-edge ratios, edge length and surface discretisation error. Results show that the new algorithm is an effective hybridisation of existing mesh generation techniques, combining the high element quality and mesh sub-structure of advancing-front techniques with the theoretical guarantees of Delaunay-refinement schemes. It is expected that applications that place a premium on mesh-quality, including problems in computational fluid dynamics and/or structural analysis, may benefit from the new Frontal-Delaunay technique. Future work should focus on support for an extended class of surface definitions, including domains containing sharp features.
