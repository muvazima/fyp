@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It's well known that (rational) Bézier curves (Farin, 1996) are widely used in Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD). Especially, 
                        
                           
                              G

                      Hermite interpolation, interpolating points as well as their tangent vectors and curvatures, by rational cubic Bézier curves have been extensively studied in the literature (Farin, 1996; de Boor et al., 1987; Goodman, 1988; Degen, 1993; Sakai, 2001; Chen et al., 2002; Walton and Meek, 2011; Li and Deng, 2012).

Recently, methods on interpolating

                      (Farin, 2008; Femiani et al., 2012) or

                      (Walton and Meek, 2011; Li and Deng, 2012) Hermite data by rational cubic Bézier curve with circular arc precision property have been proposed. However, to our best knowledge, there are no methods on

                      Hermite interpolation by rational cubic Bézier curves with conic precision. In consideration of the important applications of conics in CAGD, we propose such a method in this paper.

Applying the reparametrization method, rational Bézier curve can be transformed to standard form: both the first and the last weight are equal to 1. For such rational cubic Bézier curve, it is easy to derive the other two weights according to the given 
                        
                           
                              G

                      Hermite data under the condition that its control polygon is determined (Farin, 1996; Goodman, 1988). However, they do not describe how to select the Bézier polygons to meet the conic precision property. We also use the rational cubic Bézier curve with standard form. The difference between our method and those of Farin (1996), Goodman (1988) lies in how to construct the control polygon. We derive the control points according to two conic Bézier curves, both matching the

                      Hermite data and one end curvature of the given

                      Hermite data. The conic precision property is based on the fact that the two conic Bézier curves are the same conic which the given

                      Hermite data sampled from. We give the explicit form for both the control points and the weights of the interpolating rational cubic Bézier curve.

                     , we simply allow that the weights are not positive after degree elevation of two conics. In this way, our method can reproduce all conic Bézier curves, including those having singularities. Fig. 4
                      illustrates some complementary conic curves reproduced by our method.

If the data comes from an ellipse, we get the whole ellipse in two complementary pieces, while if the data come from a hyperbolic curve or a parabolic curve, we also get the ‘whole’ curve in two complementary pieces with at least one of the complementary pieces having singularities.

We also present some examples in Figs. 5–7

Interpolating curves and control polygons produced by Walton and Meek (2011) (‘WM2011’), Li and Deng (2012) (‘LD2012’) and our method (‘LDM’) are displayed in green, red and black lines, respectively. Curvature plots are provided in Figs. 6 and 7. Figs. 6 and 7 show that the interpolating curves of our method always gives better or similar curvature distribution compared with those of ‘WM2011’ and ‘LD2012’. Some statistics data is summarized in Table 1
                      (M is the number of curvature extreme, and ε is the difference of the maximum and minimum curvature) to make this fact clearer.

We have shown how to construct a rational cubic Bézier curve which interpolates a C-shaped

                      Hermite data with conic precision, a property not reported before. The idea is natural in that its control points are constructed based on two conic Bézier curves, which turn to be the same curve when the 
                        
                           
                              G

                      Hermite data come from a conic and thus the algorithm is simple. Both the weights and control points are expressed in explicit form. The two tangential angles implied by the

                      Hermite data can range from 0 to π, and the sum of them is no more than 2π, which is more general than previous methods.
