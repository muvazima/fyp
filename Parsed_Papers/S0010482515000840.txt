                  This paper presents two new concepts for discrimination of signals of different complexity. The first focused initially on solving the problem of setting entropy descriptors by varying the pattern size instead of the tolerance. This led to the search for the optimal pattern size that maximized the similarity entropy. The second paradigm was based on the n-order similarity entropy that encompasses the 1-order similarity entropy. To improve the statistical stability, n-order fuzzy similarity entropy was proposed. Fractional Brownian motion was simulated to validate the different methods proposed, and fetal heart rate signals were used to discriminate normal from abnormal fetuses. In all cases, it was found that it was possible to discriminate time series of different complexity such as fractional Brownian motion and fetal heart rate signals. The best levels of performance in terms of sensitivity (90%) and specificity (90%) were obtained with the n-order fuzzy similarity entropy. However, it was shown that the optimal pattern size and the maximum similarity measurement were related to intrinsic features of the time series.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Detecting transitions in nonlinear dynamic systems is an important and challenging issue for which there is no definitive answer. This is particularly the case, for instance, in medicine when detecting the precise instant in time when a stroke occurs, i.e. when a patient goes from a normal to an abnormal state [1], or when discriminating between normal and abnormal fetuses on fetal heart rate recordings [2,3].

One of the most promising ways for detecting such states lies in quantifying the complexity of time series. Among the possible complexity descriptors, fractal [4–7], multifractal [8–12], recurrent [1,13] and entropy [14–18] indicators are undoubtedly the most effective.

However, entropy descriptors are highly dependent on the setting parameters (m,r) [19], and the choice of these parameters is critical, especially for moderately sized signal lengths [20]. Chon et al. [21] claimed that entropy descriptors such as approximate entropy and sample entropy are not accurate in assessing signal complexity using the recommended values in the literature [22].

Though it has been suggested by [23] to set the tolerance r empirically between 0.1 and 0.2 times the standard deviation of the time series, recent studies focusing on improving the detection of transitions [24,19] have shown the interest of setting it at another value. This suggested value, adapted for the detection of transitions, has been proposed to maximize entropy

                     where r is the tolerance and m is the pattern size.

On the other hand, for the setting of pattern size m, few studies have focused on finding the optimal value of m, and the only studies published focused on the reconstruction of the original phase space

                        1
                        The principle of reconstruction consists of finding the minimum embedding dimension m that corresponds to a sudden change in the nearest false neighbors.
                      
                     [25,26] rather than the detection of transitions or the discrimination of time series differing in complexity. However, the recent study by Restrepo et al. [19] tested several sizes of pattern m. Basically, the most commonly used values of m were set at 1, 2 or 3 [27,3]. These low values of m were proposed because too high a value of m leads to a poor estimation of the entropy

                     [19] or to a poor reconstruction of the system dynamics.

The study reported here showed that examining the role of the pattern size m could provide important insights into quantifying the complexity of time series, thus leading to improved understanding of nonlinear dynamic systems. Furthermore, it was shown that the combined use of m

                      can provide a more consistent method to distinguish between different dynamics.

In view of the lack of a satisfactory method, the need to find a new transition detector or a discriminator is greatly needed. The second aim of this study was to establish a new paradigm to provide important insights into quantifying the complexity of time series. This new concept, for which, as suggested by [18], a membership function was introduced, encompassed the standard definition of entropy descriptors. Indeed, the general framework of “n-order fuzzy entropy” on which the new paradigm is based depends on the following equation:
                        
                           (1)
                           
                              E
                              (
                              n
                              ,
                              m
                              )
                              =
                              ϕ
                              (
                              m
                              +
                              n
                              )
                              −
                              ϕ
                              (
                              m
                              )
                           
                        
                     where n is the order, and ϕ is the average of the natural logarithm of the probability of finding similar patterns of size m. By setting n=1 in Eq. (1), we recognized the definition of approximate entropy [14].

The concepts of maximum entropy and of n-order entropy were then introduced in the following work to achieve the above aims. The two new paradigms were validated through simulations and recordings of fetal heart rate.

The aim of this section is to show that the concept of maximum entropy

                         is really valuable for discrimination purposes. For this purpose, and within a more general framework, the similarity entropy was used as the foundation since its superiority was recently shown with regard to approximate entropy [18]. Definition of the similarity entropy is written as follows:

                         through simulations. These simulations were focused on fractional Brownian motion (fBm) because (i) they are good archetypes of biomedical signals and (ii) their degrees of irregularity can easily be varied through the Hurst exponent

                           )
                         governed by the self-affinity equation: 
                           x
                           (
                           rt

                           x
                           (
                           t
                           )
                        , where r is a scaling parameter and 
                           H
                         the self-affine invariant called the “Hurst exponent”. The autocorrelation function of self-affine time series is a decreasing function whose decreasing speed depends on the Hurst exponent: the higher the Hurst exponent, the more regular the time series and the longer the correlation length.

                         deviations were dependent on the value of the Hurst exponent and varied from 0.01 to 0.03. It is obvious from Table 1 that

                         is a good discriminating parameter since it permits significant differentiation of two fBms differing by less than 10% of the Hurst exponent value. This outcome augurs well for discriminating two time series of different complexity. Findings regarding the other parameter m
                        ⁎ were not so clear and suggest that it should be used with caution. Finally, it should be noted that the outcomes derived from

                         were very similar between non-fuzzy and fuzzy approaches, and this was not the case for m
                        ⁎.

To sum up this section, it can be confirmed that the maximum amplitude

                         of the 1-order entropy was a good descriptor, directly related to intrinsic features of the time series under study, and was also a good indicator to discriminate different levels of complexity while keeping tolerance fixed at r=0.2. Although the maximum entropy augured well for the complexity analysis, not all features of the

However, it can be seen that the mean values obtained from fuzzy estimations were lower than those obtained from non-fuzzy estimations. This latter point was not in favor of fuzzy estimations when fBms were considered.

                         reported in Fig. 5d for non-fuzzy estimations and in Fig. 5h for fuzzy estimations showed that the best values were between n=4 and 8 when m=1 and between n=25 and 30 when m=6. These results indicate that it is worthwhile using n-order entropy for discriminating fBms of different levels of complexity.

To sum up this section, it was shown that it was more advantageous to use maximum n-order entropy rather than maximum 1-order entropy. This was confirmed for high values of entropy and for the lowest relative accuracy. However, these results were obtained for fBms that were hypothesized as a coarse model of fetal heart rate signals. In order to confirm that n-order entropy still works on biomedical signals, examination of fetal heart rate signals is reported in the following section.

The aim of this section is to demonstrate the validation that the n-order fuzzy entropy provides discrimination between abnormal and normal fetuses. Data collection is introduced first and then the methods are compared.

Fetal heart rate (FHR) signals were measured using a homemade pulse Doppler system co-developed with Altaïs Technologies (Tours, France). This system, which transmits ultrasound waves of 2.25MHz for an acoustic power limited to 1mW/cm2 (for more details see [28,29]), was developed to measure both the FHR and fetal movements (pseudo-breathing and limb movements).

After locating the fetal heart with an echographic scanner, 80 Doppler recordings of 30min each were acquired at CHRU Bretonneau Tours, France. In order to constitute homogeneous groups without spurious data, gestations complicated by other kinds of disorders (hypertension, diabetes) were discarded. Two groups of fetuses were selected: normal and those with severe Intra-Uterine Growth Retardation (IUGR). The normal group included 40 fetuses without disorders, delivered at term by spontaneous labor. The severe IUGR group included 40 fetuses delivered prematurely by cesarean section. For this clinical protocol, the gestational ages of fetuses ranged from 26 to 34 weeks. The consent of each parent was obtained and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Clinical Investigation Centre for Innovative Technology of Tours (CIC-IT 1415 CHRU of Tours). All parents were over eighteen years of age and pregnancies were single.

                         for non-fuzzy and fuzzy estimations, respectively. This outcome confirmed that it was preferable to use n-order rather than 1-order-based estimators of complexity.

The results shown in Table 6 demonstrated that it was preferable to use fuzzy algorithms since (i) the relative precision was lower for fuzzy than for non-fuzzy estimations and (ii) average values were similar for fuzzy and non-fuzzy estimations, and no bias was introduced.

The findings shown in Fig. 6 demonstrated that meaningful classifications (Kruskal–Wallis test was performed with a p-value 
                           <

                        ) were obtained for all methods used. Note a small advantage with fuzzy estimations since outliers (green crosses in Fig. 6) were removed, showing that here the fuzzy approach improved statistical instability. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the level of similarity was lower for abnormal fetuses than for normal fetuses. This outcome corroborated the results previously reported in [3]. Furthermore, it can be seen that the similarity measurements were fairly homogeneous. This was certainly due to the good homogeneity of the fetus groups. Note that the high levels of performance of n-order entropy were confirmed by the very good values for sensitivity and specificity reported in Table 7.

The findings reported in Table 7 showed that the sensitivity and specificity were good since they were above 86%. This outcome was confirmed by the small values of the 5-fold cross validation errors obtained with the linear discriminant analysis [31]. Fuzzy estimations were preferable since slightly improved sensitivity, specificity and cross validation error were found. The best performance was obtained for

                        , suggesting that n-order fuzzy entropies were better than 1-order fuzzy entropies.

To sum up this section, it was again shown that it was advantageous to use maximum n-order entropy rather than 1-order entropy. A slight advantage was found for the fuzzy approach. Moreover, all methods tested showed significant discrimination, which is valuable for improving medical diagnosis.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

The aim of this paper was to propose new descriptors to improve the differentiation between time series of differing complexity. The primary objective was to extend the complexity studies of time series recently undertaken in this field based on a search for the best parameter settings. This search for solutions revealed several original outcomes. The first original result was obtained by investigating the role played by the size pattern m. This led to the concept of maximum entropy 
                        
                           
                              E
                           
                           
                              ⁎
                           
                        
                      that we found to be related to the intrinsic feature 
                        H
                      of the time series examined, i.e. fBm. As the concept of maximum entropy also explained the presence of slope changes in the function 
                        Φ
                        (
                        m
                        )
                      and as the 1-order entropy was the discrete derivative of the function 
                        Φ
                        (
                        m
                        )
                     , then the presence of inflection points in the 1-order entropy led naturally to the concept of the n-order derivative that we have presented here as n-order entropy. This constitutes the second original finding. By adapting the concept of maximum entropy to n-order entropy and by combining the latter concept to the fuzzy concept, a very high performance level descriptor was then proposed.

Thus, four main important results were obtained in this study.

The first main result was derived from the research for the best setting in relation to pattern size m
                     ⁎ when the tolerance r was constant and fixed at r=0.2. As a follow-up of previous studies by [24,19], and based on the research for the best setting r

                        )
                     . In particular, it was shown that both m

                      were related to intrinsic features such as the Hurst exponent of fractional Brownian motion and we were very surprised to find very high values for pattern size m
                     ⁎ since values lower than 20 are often reported [19]. In any event, it was shown that it was quite easy to discriminate fBms differing by at least 10% from the Hurst exponent considered. This outcome augurs well for detecting complexity changes of other nonlinear dynamic systems or for discriminating other kinds of signals of different complexity. Finding the best setting of m was interesting since it provided a complementary insight into the role of m that was now no longer limited to the role of embedding dimension. It can therefore be confirmed that it is necessary to seek both the value of m

                     , it was shown that the n-order similarity entropy quite easily discriminated fBms with low Hurst exponents. This outcome augurs well for discrimination of biomedical signals since it was reported in [12] that such low Hurst exponents are measured for fetal heart rate signals.

The third important outcome concerned the validation of the different descriptors of complexity in the discrimination between normal and abnormal fetuses. Using the best discrimination function based on the n-order similarity entropy, it was shown that it was fairly easy to discriminate between fetuses without disorders and fetuses with IUGR. It seemed clear that it was really the difference in complexity between the two groups of fetuses that was the key point for good discrimination. However, although the n-order similarity entropy was very appealing, it was still difficult to identify exactly what led the n-order similarity entropy to outperform the other methods. It was probably a mixture of several elements based on (i) the monotonic decrease in the probability of finding similar patterns of size m, (ii) the maximum gap between similarity measurements of patterns of non-consecutive size and (iii) other features that remain to be revealed. The high level of performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity obtained for all complexity descriptors used in this study was certainly due to the level of homogeneity of each group. Note also that the levels of performance of the new proposed descriptors were very close. This finding is not so surprising since it was shown that FHR time series could be coarsely considered as fBm of Hurst exponents differing in 
                        δ
                        H
                        =

                      (
                        H
                        =
                        0.07
                      and 
                        H
                        +
                        δ
                        H
                        =
                        0.30
                     ) and since it was shown in this study that the proposed descriptors could significantly differentiate fBm of Hurst exponents differing at least by 
                        δ
                        H
                        =
                        0.01
                     . Nevertheless, although the results were very good, it is important that this study be extended to greater numbers of recordings. In any event, these findings augur well for the discrimination of other kinds of biomedical signals.

The final important finding was that it was almost always advantageous to develop descriptors with fuzzy foundations. Indeed, the use of a membership function led to reduction of the standard deviation of estimations, improvement in the relative precision and improvement in both the sensitivity and the specificity of the discriminator of fetal behaviors.

Above all, in antenatal medicine, our contributions complement contribution to the characterization of pathological IUGR and we hope that this contribution will reduce the risk of hypoxia often associated with increased morbidity and mortality in premature neonates [30].
