               Abstract
               
                  In this paper, a soft computing method, based on a recurrent self-organizing neural network (RSONN) is proposed for predicting the sludge volume index (SVI) in the wastewater treatment process (WWTP). For this soft computing method, a growing and pruning method is developed to tune the structure of RSONN by the sensitivity analysis (SA) of hidden nodes. The redundant hidden nodes will be removed and the new hidden nodes will be inserted when the SA values of hidden nodes meet the criteria. Then, the structure of RSONN is able to be self-organized to maintain the prediction accuracy. Moreover, the convergence of RSONN is discussed in both the self-organizing phase and the phase following the modification of the structure for the soft computing method. Finally, the proposed soft computing method has been tested and compared to other algorithms by applying it to the problem of predicting SVI in WWTP. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness of achieving considerably better predicting performance for SVI values.
