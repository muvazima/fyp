                  The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in a two-way analysis of variance is a ratio involving three variance components. Two recently developed methods for constructing confidence intervals (CI’s) for the ICC are the Generalized Confidence Interval (GCI) and Modified Large Sample (MLS) methods. The resulting intervals have been shown to maintain nominal coverage. But methods for determining sample size for GCI and MLS intervals are lacking. Sample size methods that guarantee control of the mean width for GCI and MLS intervals are developed. In the process, two variance reduction methods are employed, called dependent conditioning and inverse Rao-Blackwellization. Asymptotic results provide lower bounds for mean CI widths, and show that MLS and GCI widths are asymptotically equivalent. Simulation studies are used to investigate the new methods. A real data example is used and application issues discussed. The new methods are shown to result in adequate sample size estimates, the asymptotic estimates are accurate, and the variance reduction techniques are effective. A sample size program is developed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The two-way crossed analysis of variance layout is commonly encountered in psychometry (McGraw and Wong, 1996), radiology (Belge et al., 2006; Hing et al., 2007), inter-rater reliability studies (Potempa et al., 1995; Eliasziw et al., 1994), assay reproducibility studies (McShane et al., 2000; Dobbin et al., 2005), and gauge repeatability and reproducibility studies (Burdick et al., 2005). The intra-class correlation coefficient (denoted 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ICC

                      below) represents agreement between laboratories, raters, or instruments in this layout, depending on the context. The 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ICC
                              
                           
                           
                              b
                           
                        
                      is a function of three variance components. A common goal of inter-rater reliability studies is to construct a confidence interval for the 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ICC
                              
                           
                           
                              b
                           
                        
                     . But traditional interval methods based on maximum likelihood asymptotics perform poorly (for examples of this poor performance, see supplement (Appendix B) and (Cappelleri and Ting, 2003)). As a result, both Modified Large Sample (MLS) interval (Cappelleri and Ting, 2003) and Generalized Confidence Interval (GCI) (Weerahandi, 1993; Burdick et al., 2005) methods were developed. MLS and GCI provide nominal coverage for the 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ICC
                              
                           
                           
                              b
                           
                        
                      (Cappelleri and Ting, 2003), (Ionan et al., 2014). But, no methods currently exist for determining the sample size required to construct GCI or MLS intervals in this layout.

The GCI and MLS intervals are constructed using exact statistical methods (Weerahandi, 1995). Sample sizes for confidence intervals based on exact methods have been developed for some important contexts (Bonett, 2002; Zou, 2012), but not the one addressed in this paper. Bonett (2002) developed a sample size method for the intraclass correlation coefficient for settings in which the 
                        
                           ICC
                        
                      is a function of two variance components. None of the models in Bonett (2002) match the setting addressed in this paper. Also, Bonett’s approach cannot be adopted to this setting because it is based on an asymptotic approximation to the variance of the ICC estimate. But no adequate approximation to this variance is available for the setting studied in this paper. Moreover, the MLS and GCI methods, since they do not use such a variance estimate in their construction (that is, they are based on exact calculations), may have widths unrelated to this variance. Nor can the MLS or GCI widths be expressed algebraically as simple functions of the sample size. Turning to the work of Zou (2012), he addressed the important setting of a one-way layout; the approach used an estimate of the width of the Wald interval for the sample size calculations. Zou also interestingly controlled the probability that the width is below a bound, rather than the expected width. Zou’s Wald interval approximation approach is not well suited to the context addressed in this paper because the 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ICC
                              
                           
                           
                              b
                           
                        
                      estimator in the two-way layout is often highly skewed, the asymptotic convergence in this context is slow, and Wald intervals do not perform well in this setting.

                      in a two-way analysis of variance layout without interaction was discussed in McGraw and Wong (1996) and studied in Saito et al. (2006). McGraw and Wong (1996) did not give sample size formulas; they provided formulas for the lower and upper bounds of a confidence interval (their Table 7, Case 2A); in that context, the

                      is called the “degree of absolute agreement among measurements”, the “criterion-referenced reliability”, or the “Type I ICC”. Importantly, the formulas from Table 7 in McGraw and Wong for the specific setting ICC(A, 1) and case 2A, which were taken from Shrout and Fleiss (1979) and developed by Haggard (1958) in 1958, only work well when the degrees of freedom for each mean square is large (Montgomery, 2013, p. 600; Cappelleri and Ting, 2003; Ionan et al., 2014). The MLS and GCI methods studied in this paper, on the other hand, work well even if the degrees of freedom for one or more mean squares are small; thus the MLS and GCI are more robust and appropriate to use for sample size estimation. Saito et al. (2006) studied different experimental designs for this model when 
                        
                           
                              r

                     . To compare the efficiency of different designs, they used an approximation to

                      based on the delta method (that is, a Taylor series expansion). But since the GCI and MLS methods are based on exact calculations, their widths may not be related to the efficiencies (or standard errors) of the point estimates. At one point in their discussion, Saito et al. (2006) did use exact methods to construct the intervals and compare widths (their Table III), but strictly in a limited context of comparing optimal allocation patterns, not sample size estimation. Since the primary objective of the 2006 paper was to compare designs, they did not present an explicit sample size method as we do here, or a set of tools for determining sample size for specific settings. In our study, we also allow 
                        
                           
                              r
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                        ≥
                        1
                      because this is a reasonable design in some cases and is not uncommon in biomarker studies (MAQC Consortium, 2006; Dobbin et al., 2005; Polley et al., 2013; McShane et al., 2000).

The sample size estimates produced by our method ensure that the mean confidence interval width is below a user-specified target width. Ideally, one may wish to control the actual width of an interval to be below a target, rather than the mean width. But the actual width of both the GCI and MLS intervals are functions of the observed mean squares; since the observed mean squares are unknown at the study design phase, it is not feasible to control the actual interval width itself. One approach might be to “plug in” estimates of the values of these variance components that will be observed when the experiment is run. But such an approximation approach seems suboptimal since it leaves open the question of the sensitivity of the approximation to mis-specification of the variance component values that will be observed. Controlling the expected widths as we do in this paper averages over the observed values of mean squares. This averaging requires integrating the unobserved mean squares out of the width formulas. For both the MLS and GCI, this results in complex multiple integrations without clean analytic solutions. A variety of statistical computation methods are employed to make the integrations computationally tractable.

Statistical computation methods are reviewed in Robert and Casella (2013). As shown below, classic Monte Carlo integration is inadequate for sample size determination because of the computational demands. For the GCI sample size method, importance sampling (Ripley, 2006) was investigated but produced relatively minor computational gains. The method of Rao-Blackwellization (Robert and Casella, 2013), which involves conditioning on variables so as to reduce the variance, produced substantial variance reduction for estimates of the cumulative distribution function. We modified this method and call the resulting procedure inverse Rao-Blackwellization. Control variates (Rothery, 1982) are another widely used variance reduction technique. They depend on identification of an effective control variate. By investigation we identified a control variate for the

                     . For the MLS procedure, we find that the

                      width–which is initially a function of three variance components–can be rewritten as a function of two dependent 
                        F
                      distributions. Subsequently, using mathematical manipulations we develop a method which we call “dependent conditioning”. This method is closely related to two-stage Gibbs sampling (e.g., Robert and Casella, 2013). Gibbs sampling requires assessment of the convergence of a Markov chain Monte Carlo, which can be problematic; our approach avoids this issue by using a single Monte Carlo instead of an MCMC.

In the context of manufacturing, gauge repeatability and reproducibility studies are carried out in order to monitor and improve a manufacturing process (Burdick et al., 2005). The sources of variability in these experiments are typically the operators, parts and replicates. The model studied in this paper assumes no interaction between operators and parts, and that these are random effects.

                      is the proportion of total variance attributable to the objects of measurement (a.k.a., targets) (McGraw and Wong, 1996). The two-way model assumes two sources of variance; for example, one source may represent items on a mathematics test, and the other source the different children taking the test; or one source might represent different judges with varying anchor points, and the other source different individuals who are the objects of judgments. In the context of biomarkers or clinical assays, the sources of variability are typically patient-to-patient, laboratory-to-laboratory, and within-laboratory.

                      in that context is the ratio of the variance between patients relative to the overall variance due to all sources, and it is assumed that there is no interaction between patients and laboratories.

This paper is organized as follows: Section  2 presents the basic model, interval methods, and objective functions for sample size determination; Section  3 presents the asymptotic results; Section  4 discusses the interaction setting; Section  5 presents the methods for estimating the confidence interval widths and the sample sizes; Section  6 presents an application; Section  7 presents results of simulation studies; Section  8 presents discussion and conclusions. Proofs and other details appear in the Supplement (see Appendix B).

                        . One could fix this total number of observations, as done in Saito et al. (2006). But this approach, while leading to interesting insights on design allocation in the 2006 paper, does not seem well suited to sample size determination because fixing this product is artificial, and the designs for a fixed value of the product may be limited. For example, if the product value is 55, then the possible designs are

Another option would be to specify a cost function, and determine the sample size for a fixed cost; but this method is limiting in that cost functions may vary from one application to another, and users may have difficulty specifying an explicit set of costs.

Instead, to maximize the potential usefulness of our approach, we focus on settings where two of the design parameters are fixed, and the third design parameter is free. More motivation for this approach is presented in the Discussion section. We develop for a GCI-based design sample sizes that will satisfy

In this section we derive the asymptotic distributions of the confidence interval widths as one design parameter goes to infinity and the other two remain fixed. These results are important because in some cases it is not possible to achieve the targeted mean width of Eqs. (4) and (5) by increasing only one design parameter (e.g., 
                        
                           
                              b

                        →
                        ∞
                     ). Therefore, searching for a sample size would be futile. These theorems can be used to identify these settings. Theorems are given here and proofs appear in the Supplement (see Appendix B).

From Theorem 1, we can note that the limiting distribution of the GCI width is a monotone increasing function of

                        . Therefore, if we have a very large Monte Carlo sample, we will have the approximate equality

                         which is the corresponding term from Theorem 4 for the MLS. Similarly, the results of Corollaries 1 and 4 lead to similar estimates, as do the results of Corollaries 2 and 5. In fact, the MLS and GCI methods are asymptotically equivalent in respect to these interval widths. To our knowledge, we are the first to make this observation.

A formula for the sample size could be derived if Eqs. (4) and (5) could be written explicitly as functions of

                      and 
                        
                           
                              r

                     . But this is not the case. On the other hand, if the intervals could be calculated quickly, then an iterative search could be used to determine the sample size. This is our approach. Table 2
                      shows why this approach is needed. Brute force computation methods can take over 6 h. Our computation methods produce the same answer in less than one minute.

Our approach to estimating the mean 
                           
                              
                                 μ
                              
                              
                                 
                                    MLS
                                 
                              
                           
                         is based on recasting the MLS formula as a function of two dependent 
                           F
                         distributions. By explicitly deriving the conditional distribution of one 
                           F
                         given the other, this permits us to integrate out one of the 
                           F
                         variables, avoiding one Monte Carlo integration. Moreover, the correlation between the 
                           F
                        ’s results in further variance reduction and the MLS mean can be calculated from a relatively small simulation from a single 
                           F
                         distribution. We call this method “dependent conditioning”.

We term this method “inverse Rao-Blackwellization”.

                        Lemma 1 provides a way to estimate the quantile function, and subsequently

A potential issue that may arise is that during data analysis an interaction may be detected by testing, and this may lead to constructing a GCI or MLS interval for

                     , for comparison. As can be seen from the table, the asymptotic widths for the MLS and GCI are very similar to each other. This makes sense since the two approaches are asymptotically equivalent, as noted in Section  3.3. Since the width is a monotone decreasing function of

                              b

                     . This is the case for all lines except the first, where the tiny discrepancy can be attributed to simulation error. Therefore, both Corollaries 1 and 4 are supported by the simulation and produce nearly identical asymptotic estimates.

Next, we evaluated the MLS method, both in terms of accuracy of the CI width estimate and variance reduction (computational savings). The total variance reductions shown in Table 4
                      due to both the integration step and the reduced variance from the conditioning are shown in the rightmost column. The reductions depend on the study size, and are two orders of magnitude for larger studies, and an order of magnitude or less for smaller studies (

                        1
                     ). Since larger studies require more computational overhead, this means that most width calculations can be performed in a relatively short timeframe. The accuracy of the mean interval width estimates are evaluated by comparison of the MLS width estimation method with a pure Monte Carlo estimation of the mean width; this comparison shows that the MLS estimates are very close to the Monte Carlo means; the new method produces very accurate mean widths over these simulations. The two are equal to two decimal places for larger sample size. The MLS method is slightly conservative for some of the smaller sample sizes, probably due to the discrete nature of sample sizes and associated widths in that context.

Our GCI method is based on inverse Rao-Blackwellization and a control variate. We sought to assess both the accuracy of our approach and the computational savings. As can be seen in Table 5
                     , the total variance reduction from the two methods combined ranges from three orders of magnitude to less than one order of magnitude. Unlike the MLS method, the amount of variance reduction is strongly dependent on the true value of the

                      is to 1, the greater the variance reduction. This is not too surprising since our control variate has a linear relation with

                      is close to one as well. In terms of design settings, the variance reduction is smallest for the design with

                     . Comparing the means from our method to the pure Monte Carlo means also presented in the table, our method is accurate in most cases to two decimal points. Our method appears to provide potentially large variance reduction and very accurate estimates of the interval widths over all simulations examined.

The objective of our program is to estimate the sample size requirements. We therefore used simulation to assess the adequacy of the sample size estimates. Table 6
                      shows the MLS sample sizes generated by our method along with a Monte Carlo evaluation of the adequacy of the sample sizes. First, it is clear that the sample size estimates achieve the targeted mean widths because the Monte Carlo evaluations produced mean MLS CI widths almost identical to the targeted widths (or slightly conservative for smaller sample sizes). To make our method reproducible, the R program uses a fixed random seed (that the user can vary manually) so that if it is run twice in a row with the same input, the same sample size estimate will result. The table shows the variation in sample size estimates (see SD) as these seeds are varied. The variation is 0 or close to 0 in all cases across all the twenty replications. It is apparent from the table that our method produces sample size estimates with very small standard deviations, often with no observed variation over Monte Carlo replications. In sum, the program provided high quality sample size estimates across all simulations considered.


                     Table 7
                      shows the GCI sample sizes generated by our method with a Monte Carlo evaluation of the adequacy of the sample sizes. The results indicate that the method produces sample size estimates that achieve the targeted mean width. Comparing the results of Tables 6 and 7, we see that there are some differences in the sample size requirements between the MLS and GCI methods. The GCI sample size estimates are equal to or smaller than the MLS sample size estimates. The Monte Carlo indicates that both sample size estimates produce adequate mean widths however. This might seem to suggest that the GCI method is preferable to the MLS method overall, but we have found that the two methods in practice are very similar and such a broad conclusion seems unwarranted from this limited study. Comparing these methods is outside the scope of this paper. Also note that others have suggested that the MLS is superior to the GCI (Cappelleri and Ting, 2003).

Next, we addressed the setting of an interaction effect in the two-way layout. If the interaction exists, and the methods of Burdick et al. (2005) for interactions are used to construct a GCI interval instead of the no-interaction model, how will the resulting widths of the two intervals compare? Results are presented in Fig. 1
                     . One can see that for small values of 
                        
                           
                              b

                     , the mean interval widths for the interaction-based intervals can be quite a bit larger than the mean widths for the no-interaction intervals (negative values on the 
                        y
                     -axis). As 
                        
                           
                              b

                      increases, the bias decreases to below 0.01. In sum, if one is concerned about an interaction then a rule of thumb may be to decrease the targeted width by, say, 0.01, and insist on

To explore how our programs may be used in practice, we revisit the dataset of Barzman et al. (2012). As background, this study looked at the reproducibility of different emergency room staffers who rated a common set of children (actually, videos of the children), on the Brief Rating of Aggression by Children and Adolescents (BRACHA) instrument. The two sources of variation are the children and the raters. For this example, we assume that we are designing a new reproducibility study of the BRACHA instrument which will use a new set of children and emergency room staffers, with each set drawn from the same population used in the 2012 paper. The analysis of variance table for this study is shown in the supplement (see Appendix B), and the mean squares for videos, raters, and residuals were

                      emergency room staffers. Then our goal, at the design stage, is to determine how many children each emergency room staffer should evaluate to achieve a sufficient level of precision in terms of the interval width on the ICC. To achieve a mean interval widths of 0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05, plugging the estimates into the MLS and GCI sample size functions produced sample size estimates of 
                        B
                        =
                        6
                     , 7, 11, 18, 47, 142 and 
                        B
                        =
                        5
                     , 7, 9, 13, 31, 236, respectively. Thus, if we find an interval width of 0.10 sufficient, we could use 31 children, 10 emergency room staffers, and GCI method for the interval calculation. However, if we want a higher level of precision with an expected interval width of 0.05, we will need 142 children, 10 emergency room staffers, and MLS method for the interval calculation.

The estimated asymptotic width for the MLS using Corollary 4 is 0.0359, and for the GCI using Corollary 1 is 0.0358. The methods display instability in the sample size estimates as the targeted width gets close to the optimal width, in these cases within 0.02. For comparison, the Barzman study used

                      and had a Bayesian credible interval width of 0.11. If such a study is to be repeated again, we would advise to take a larger sample to ensure that the nominal coverage and the expected interval width are achieved.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this paper were presented the first methods and accompanying computer programs to calculate sample size to obtain a desired mean confidence interval width for the intraclass correlation coefficient in a two-way crossed analysis of variance without interaction. The methods were shown in simulations to work well and to produce appropriate sample sizes. Code in R to implement the methods is being made available with this publication. In addition, asymptotic results were presented that can be used to estimate the minimum achievable width as one design parameter goes to infinity, and simulations also showed that these methods perform well. These asymptotic results also showed the asymptotic equivalence of GCI and MLS method widths.

In a two way balanced layout there are three free design quantities, which we have denoted 
                        
                           (

                     , the first two representing the levels of each main effect and the third representing the number of replicates per cell. In this paper, we developed methods for determining the number of replicates for one parameter when the other two are held fixed. We think this approach produces the most useful methods and software for experimental designers for a number of reasons. First, often in practice only one design parameter can be feasibly increased; in that setting, our method can be used to determine how large to make that parameter. Second, often the basic design will be driven by the experimental objective, logistics, or cost. For example, in laboratory assay comparison studies, it may simply be impractical to have more than

In this paper, two new methods were developed for variance reduction called inverse Rao-Blackwellization and dependent conditioning. Inverse Rao-Blackwellization is motivated by contexts in which estimation of a function 
                        f
                        
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                      of a random variable 
                        X
                      is of interest. In our motivating example, 
                        f
                      was a quantile function. The method may be useful when estimation of 
                        f
                        
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                      results in high variance estimators, but 
                        
                           
                              f

                      can be estimated precisely using Rao-Blackwellization; in other words, using a random variable

On the other hand, dependent conditioning is appropriate for multidimensional contexts in which the goal is to estimate a function

Average interval width is a common criterion used for sample size determination, but it is possible to use an alternative criterion, such as the 90th percentile of the interval widths; a similar suggestion was made by Zou (2012). Such an approach should be more conservative, and would guarantee with 90% probability that the width will be no larger than the target. Our approach could be extended to this context with some additional work. In particular, the integrals in Eqs. (4) and (5) would be replaced with quantile functions; subsequently, some of the variance reduction methods used in this paper specifically designed for integration may need to be modified to quantile estimation.

These results can potentially be expanded from confidence intervals to hypothesis testing by inverting the intervals. Calculating the power to detect a user-specified alternative, or the sample size required to achieve that power, would be a very direct extension of the results of this paper. But an issue that would need to be addressed in such an extension is how to form the alternative hypothesis. For example, the null hypothesis may be that

This paper has focused on the balanced, two-way layout without interaction and the intraclass correlation coefficient. But the methods developed here could be extended to ratios of other variance components based on MLS or GCI procedures, such as the many presented in Burdick et al. (2005). They could also be extended to unbalanced designs using the unweighted sum of squares approach (Burdick et al., 2005). In some cases, simple sample size formulas may result; but in many other cases, there may be need to address statistical computational challenges like those described above.

The GCI and MLS methods used in this paper are only moderately robust to departures from normality (Ionan et al., 2014). If data have heavy tails and/or are highly skewed, then the MLS and GCI methods should not be used. This is a limitation of the sample size methods presented here.
