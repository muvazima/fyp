                  This paper proposes an improved multi-objective differential evolutionary algorithm named multi-objective hybrid differential evolution with simulated annealing technique (MOHDE-SAT) to solve dynamic economic emission dispatch (DEED) problem. The proposed MOHDE-SAT integrates the orthogonal initialization method into the differential evolution, which enlarges the population diversity at the beginning of population evolution. In addition, modified mutation operator and archive retention mechanisms are used to control convergence rate, and simulated annealing technique and entropy diversity method are utilized to adaptively monitor the population diversity as the evolution proceeds, which can properly avoid the premature convergence problem. Furthermore, the MOHDE-SAT is applied on the thermal system with a heuristic constraint handling method, and obtains more desirable results in comparison to those alternatives established recently. The obtained results also reveal that the proposed MOHDE-SAT can provide a viable way for solving DEED problems.
