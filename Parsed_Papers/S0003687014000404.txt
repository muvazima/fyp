                  Purpose
                  Designers and ergonomists may occasionally be limited to using tables of percentiles of anthropometric data to model users. Design models that add or subtract percentiles produce unreliable estimates of the proportion of users accommodated, in part because they assume a perfect correlation between variables. Percentile data do not allow the use of more reliable modeling methods such as Principle Component Analysis. A better method is needed.
               
               
                  Results
                  A new method for modeling with limited data is described. It uses measures of central tendency (median or mean) of the range of possible correlation values to estimate the combined variance is shown to reduce error compared to combining percentiles. Second, use of the Chebyshev inequality allows the designer to more reliably estimate the percent accommodation when the distributions of the underlying anthropometric data are unknown than does combining percentiles.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  This paper describes a modeling method that is more accurate than combining percentiles when only limited data are available.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Designers and ergonomist practitioners often are asked to produce designs that will concurrently accommodate users on multiple anthropometric dimensions, but have only percentile tables with which to develop those dimensions. For example, it might be necessary to estimate 95th percentile seated elbow height above the floor as a combination of 95th percentile seat height and 95th percentile elbow height above the seat. In this paper, we demonstrate that using either the median or mean of the range of possible correlation values, as appropriate, to combine two or more anthropometric variables is both more accurate and more reliable than adding or subtracting percentile values.

It might accurately be said that combining (adding or subtracting) percentiles is the least preferred option that you should choose when developing anthropometric models. Combining percentiles, for example adding two 95th percentile values in the expectation that the result will produce 95 percent accommodation is likely to introduce substantial error into anthropometric models (Nah and Kreifeldt, 1996; Gordon, 2002; Robinette and McConville, 1981). Nah and Kreifeldt (1995) note that the error between the expected percent accommodation and the actual percent accommodation can be substantial, for example achieving only 50 percent accommodation instead of the expected 95 percent when two 95th percentile values are subtracted.

While multivariate models, such as Principle Component Analysis, can accurately model combinations of anthropometric variables, a designer or ergonomist is often presented with only a summary table of percentile data, consequently lacking the data necessary to use other strategies that will produce accurate models. Similarly, they may lack the tools or knowledge to utilize multivariate techniques.


                     Roebuck (1995) notes that not knowing the correlation between anthropometric variables is an underlying cause of this inaccuracy. When a designer adds equal percentile values of two anthropometric variables, he or she implicitly assumes that the correlation between them is 1.0, regardless of the actual value of the correlation coefficient.

To see why this is so, consider that a form of the regression equation is Z
                     
                        Y
                      = r
                     
                        xY
                     
                     Z
                     
                        x
                     , where Z
                     
                        Y
                      and Z
                     
                        x
                      are the z-scores corresponding to values of Y and X and r
                     
                        xY
                      is the correlation between X and Y (Nolan and Heinzen, 2012). If two equal percentile values are added, such as two 95th percentile values, then Z
                     
                        Y
                      must equal Z
                     
                        x
                     , and r
                     
                        xY
                      must be equal to 1.

This paper describes a method to minimize the error of estimates of the combined variance of two variables in comparison to adding or subtracting percentiles. It describes a method of dealing with the unknown, pair wise correlations between any group of anthropometric variables and the average, or expected error in the estimate of a combination of a group of combined variables.

Although the individual variances or the standard deviations of anthropometric variables are commonly given (Roebuck, 1995; Gordon et al., 1989; Harrison and Robinette, 2002; Pheasant, 1988; Norris and Wilson, 1995), this is not always the case. For those cases, a method of estimating the variance is suggested in Section 7.0; although that method must be used with caution as non-normally distributed variables may lead to substantial error.

Any two variables can be combined if the means, variances, standard deviations, and correlation between the two variables (r
                     
                        AB
                     ) are known (Roebuck, 1995; Pheasant, 1988). Knowledge of either the standard deviation or the variance implicitly determines the other, as the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

When two variables are added together, the combined mean, M
                     
                        AB
                     , is equal to M

                        B

When any two variables are added, the combined variance, VAR
                        AB, is equal to the sum of the variance of A and B, plus 2 times the correlation r
                     
                        AB
                      times the product of the standard deviations of A and B.

The Pearson product–moment correlation describes a linear relationship between two variables. If the variables are distributed as bivariate normal, then the Pearson correlation completely describes the dependency relationship between them. Expressed alternatively, if for two bivariate normal variables the Pearson correlation is zero, then the two variables are independent.

However, if the variables are not normally distributed, the correlation coefficient still describes any linear dependency that exists between them. Interpretation of the significance of the correlation is however, problematic.

It is possible for two variables to be non-linearly dependent. A simple example is Y = X
                        
                           2
                         for values of X between −100 and 100. Although Y is clearly dependent on X, the Pearson correlation between the values of X and Y is zero. We do not consider here whether or not anthropometric elements have non-linear dependencies.

While a combined mean can be calculated when r
                     
                        AB
                      is unknown using Eqs. (1) and (2), calculating the combined variance using Eqs. (3) and (4) is not possible when the correlation is unknown.

It is possible to estimate r
                     
                        AB
                      in order to calculate the combined variance when adding or subtracting variables; however, this will introduce error into the calculated value of the combined variance. The error can be expressed as the difference between the variance as calculated with the true value of r
                     
                        AB
                      and the variance as calculated with the estimated correlation value, r′

Adding more variables adds to the error in the same fashion as is shown in Eq (11). However, unlike the case shown in Eq. (10), there is a possibility for the differences between the true and estimated correlation values in Eq (11) to cancel, depending on the signs of the differences.

Use of the median and mean as estimators of a range of unknown correlation values has useful properties in regard to minimizing such errors. In the following sections, the median is shown to be the most appropriate estimator when combining any pair of anthropometric variables and the mean is shown to be preferred as the estimator when more than two variables are combined. Both provide more accurate combinations of anthropometric variables than does the combination of percentiles.

A property of the median of a set of data points is that the sum of the distances between the median and all the other data points is minimized (Hanley et al., 2001).

Consequently, assuming that the correlation r′
                           AB
                         is equal to the median of the possible range of correlation values will minimize the sum of all possible absolute errors, and, consequently, the average absolute error in the estimate of the correlation value.

A property of the mean of a set of data points is that the sum of the deviations, or differences between the mean and all the other data points is 0. Unlike the absolute deviations about the median, the sum of deviations about the mean takes account of the direction (sign) of the difference between the true correlation and the mean.

When only two anthropometric variables are combined, there is only one value for the difference between the true value and the estimator. The median is the appropriate estimator to use, as, on average, it minimizes the absolute difference between the estimator and the median. For a single difference between the true and estimated correlation values, in terms of average absolute difference, the median is as close or closer to the true value than the mean.

When more than two anthropometric variables are combined, there are two or more difference values between the mean and the estimator. The mean is the appropriate estimator to use, as it incorporates the algebraic sum of the multiple difference values. That is, a high and low value will tend to cancel one another, as the sum of the deviations about the mean is always 0.

An example presented in Section 4.1 is based on a uniform distribution of possible correlation values ranging between −1 and 1. Since it is a symmetric distribution, the mean and median are equal to one another, and the average error in the estimate of the true correlation value is 0 for both the mean and the median. However, the actual distribution of the correlation values is not known.

If the possible correlation values are uniformly distributed between −1 and 1, then both the mean and the median are equal to zero. If the median or mean are used as estimators of the correlation values, r, then the total sum of possible differences between the true and assumed correlation values is given by

When this integral is evaluated, we find that the sums of all possible differences between the median and the mean correlation value and all other possible values of the correlation coefficient are zero.

Evaluating the integral in Eq. (14) yields an average expected error in the estimate of the combined variance of zero for both the mean and median.

In contrast to using either the median or the mean correlation values, adding percentiles implicitly assumes that the correlation r

It was noted in Section 3.0 that simultaneous accommodation on multiple variables can be achieved by pair wise addition of the means and variances of the several variables.

In Sections 3.2 and 3.3, the median was described as the optimum estimator when two variables are combined and mean as the optimum estimator when three or more variables are combined.

When three or more variables are combined, the expected error in the estimate of the variance of the combined variables is additive. That is, the average error in the estimate of the variance of the combination of A and B adds to the average error in the estimate of AB + C. However, the deviations about the mean always sum to 0, no matter what the range of correlation values or how the correlation values may be distributed.

Two previous studies (Albin, 2013a,b) have compared the relative accuracy of combining pairs of anthropometric variables, contrasting adding or subtracting percentiles with pairs combined using Eq. (3)–(6). In each study, the possible values of rAB were assumed uniformly distributed between −1 and 1 with the median equal to 0.

In the first study, the true 95th percentile values for 20 pairs of combinations of 5 anthropometric elements (10 addition and 10 subtraction) were compared to estimates obtained by either combining percentiles or combining the variables assuming that the median possible correlation value was 0.

Relative error was determined as the difference between the true value and the estimated value divided by the true value. For addition, the average relative error was −2.4 percent of the actual dimension for combining percentiles and 0.7 percent for the median method. For subtraction, the average relative error was 26.7 percent for combining percentiles and −11.1 percent for the median method.

In the second study, for addition of two anthropometric elements, the average relative error when estimating the 95th percentile and 5th percentile was 4.3 percent and 5.9 percent respectively for combining percentiles and 1 and 1.3 percent respectively when the median was assumed equal to 0. For subtraction of the two elements, the relative errors for the 95th and 5th percentile values when combining percentiles were 12.6 percent and 13.3 percent respectively; for the median method, the relative error values were 3.5 percent and 4.4 percent respectively.

As described in Section 1 and elsewhere (Albin, 2013a,b), adding or subtracting percentiles implicitly assumes that the correlation between the combined variables is 1.0. Unless all the variables are perfectly correlated, then almost any other possible value of r would be a better estimator of r than 1.0. The median and mean of the possible correlation values are attractive estimators of the actual value of r, as they minimize the error for combinations of any two variables or for combinations of more than two variables, respectively.

In the absence of any knowledge of the range and distribution of correlation values, assuming the range to be between −1 and 1 and the values to be uniformly distributed is a conservative estimate. It is entirely possible that future research might determine that the range of values is more limited or that the distribution of values is not uniform. However, this would affect only the values of the median and mean, not their ability to minimize error as previously described. Similarly, the errors described in Table 1
                     
                      would have different values, but estimates based on the median or the mean would still have less error than adding percentiles.

On occasion some information regarding the correlation values of the variables may be known. For a single combination of two variables, prior knowledge of the possible correlation values is very useful, as the exact correlation value can be used to combine two variables, resulting in an accurate estimate of the combined variance.

However, when more than two variables are combined, the act of combining the first pair creates a different set of correlation values between the newly combined pair and the remaining variables. As an example, consider three variables: A = (1,2,3,4,5), B = (2,3,1,5,4), C = (2,6,4,10,8). Their correlation values are AB = 0.60, AC = 0.80, BC = 0.90.

If A and B are added, then the correlation with C is 0.95; however, if B is subtracted from A, then the correlation with C is −0.11, if A is subtracted from B, the correlation with C is 0.11. All the new correlation values are outside the range of the original set of correlation values.

If the mean or median of the first set of correlation values is used to predict the correlations of the second set, the average deviation about their mean (0.77) is −0.45. In contrast, if the mean is assumed to be 0, then the average deviation about the mean is 0.32. Similarly, if the average absolue deviation is first calculated using the median of the original correlation values (0.8), the average absolute deviation for the second set of correlation values is 0.58. If the median is assumed to be 0, then the average absolute deviation for the second set of correlation values is 0.39.

Although this is not conclusive proof that the distribution of r should be treated as uniformly distributed between −1 and 1, it does suggest that such an assumption is at least tenable as a starting point pending more research on the actual distribution of r.

If anthropometric data are normally distributed, then the percent accommodated may be calculated by using the equation

                     where Z corresponds to the appropriate Z-value, for example ± 1.645 for the 95th and 5th percentiles. M
                     combined is the mean of the combined anthropometric elements and S
                     combined is the standard deviation of the combined elements.

However, it does not appear that anthropometric data may be reliably treated as normally distributed. Normally distributed data have a skew of zero and, for large samples, a standard error of skewness (SES), approximately equal to √(6/N). If the skew value divided by the SES is equal to or greater than 2, the distribution is considered as not normally distributed (Wright and Herrington, 2011).

The US Army anthropometric database (Gordon et al., 1989) has 132 anthropometric variables for females and for males. The skew of each variable was determined through use of the Excel skew function. For males, 118 variables have skew greater than zero and 14 have skew less than zero. For females, 122 have skew greater than zero and 10 have skew less than zero.

For the total of 264 anthropometric variables for males and females, 84 of the males' variables and 103 of the females' variables meet the criterion necessary to be described as not normally distributed, that is, where the absolute value of the skew value divided by the SES is greater than 2.

Another measure of whether or not the data are normally distributed is the D'Agostino-Pearson Omnibus Test (D'Agostino and Pearson, 1973). This test uses both skew and kurtosis to determine whether or not a data set is normally distributed. Skew and kurtosis were determined for each variable using the Excel skew and kurtosis functions. The SES was calculated as previously described; the computation of the standard error of kurtosis and the D'Agostino Pearson Omnibus Test were calculated as suggested by (Goldstein, 2013) using Excel.

Using the omnibus test, 92 of the males' variables and 94 of the females' variables were found not normally distributed.

Consequently, as it appears that the great majority of the anthropometric data for males and females are not nomally distributed, then using the Z score method of describing percentiles is problematic and not recommended, as the data cannot be treated as normally distributed.

However, an alternative method of reliably determining accommodation exists. Chebyshev's inequality (Walpole and Myers, 1978) states that, for any data, regardless of distribution, the probability p that some data point will be more than K standard deviations from the mean can be expressed as
                           
                              (18)
                              
                                 
                                    p
                                    ≤
                                    
                                       1

                                             K
                                             2
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        where 1 − p is the proportion of the population that it is desired to accommodate and K is the number of standard deviations above and below the mean.

As an example, if it is desired to accommodate 90% of a combined population, then the proportion to be accommodated is 0.9. Solving Eq. (18) with p set equal to 0.1 gives a value for K of 3.16. Chebyshev's inequality reliably assures that 90% of the population will be within ±3.16 standard deviations of the mean.

Further, suppose that the designer wishes to accommodate all individuals up to and including the 90th percentile. Then the Chebyshev-Cantelli (Wikipedia, 2012) inequality for one-sided distributions states that the probability that some data point will be more than K standard deviations from the mean is

                        where p is again the proportion to be accommodated. By relying on the Chebyshev-Cantelli inequality [18], a designer may be assured that he or she will accommodate 90 percent of all individuals, except for the group whose measurement exceeds the 90th percentile, if the criterion is set at three standard deviations from the mean.

Consequently, using either the Chebyshev or Chebyshev-Cantelli inequalities means that no assumption of normality need be made in order to reliably compute the percent accommodation. However, the accommodation intervals may be very wide relative to the more familiar Gaussian distribution based accommodation intervals.

A pair wise concatenation of N elements results in an aggregate mean and variance for the combination of those N elements. Use of the Chebyshev inequality allows a statement of the percent of the aggregate scores accommodated within a range defined by the aggregate mean plus and minus some multiple, K, times the square root of the combined variance.

By extension of Eqs. (1) and (3) for combined means and variances, the combined mean for the elements is the sum of the means of the individual elements. In the case where the correlation between the elements is assumed to be zero, then the aggregate variance is the sum of the variances of the individual elements.

By selection of an appropriate value for K, we can determine a value of the aggregated elements that will accommodate a desired percent of the population.

For example, we might want to calculate the value, V
                        90 that will accommodate 90 percent of the population. In that case

In the special case where the median of the range of possible correlation values is zero, using the median correlation is equivalent to assuming that the anthropometric elements are linearly independent.

If the elements are linearly independent, then the joint accommodation on any two variables is the product of the probabilities of their occurrence (percentiles/100), e.g. combining two 95th percentile elements will result in the accommodation of 0.952, or approximately 90 percent of the combined variables. If the percentiles used are the same for each anthropometric variable, then the joint accommodation on N elements is the percentile value used raised to the Nth power. This can be expressed as

                                    P
                                    =
                                    
                                       P
                                       V
                                       N
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        where P is the proportion it is desired to accommodate, P
                        
                           V
                         is the percentile value that it is necessary to use in order to achieve accommodation for the desired proportion of the population, and N is the number of variables that are to be combined. As N increases, P
                        
                           V
                         must also increase. Table 2 shows the necessary percentile values that must be used to achieve 90 percent accommodation as N increases from 1 to 10. (Table 2).

For example, suppose that an ergonomist or designer wishes to accommodate 90 percent of a population on each of 10 elements. He or she must then use the 99th percentile on each element in order to achieve 90 percent accommodation. If the 95th percentile value was used, then the expected proportion accommodated is 0.9510, or about 0.60.

The variance of an anthropometric element is often specified in the summary table of percentile values. However, if it is not specified it might be estimated empirically from the table values. For example, the difference between the 5th and 95th percentile values divided by 2 times the Z
                     95 value, 1.645, gives an estimate of the standard deviation for normally distributed data. More generally, this can be expressed as

This may be less of an issue when the anthropometric dataset used has been truncated. For example, the US military excludes very small or very large individuals. As a result, the military dataset contains fewer outliers and may be less skewed than the civilian population from which it is drawn.

Observation of the difference between the fifth and 95th percentile values of anthropometric elements in ANSUR suggests that the difference between the 5th and 95th percentile values, divided by 3.29, provides a reasonable estimate of the standard deviation, accurate within about one percent.

For a total of 264 ANSUR [6] anthropometric elements (132 male and 132 female), the average difference between the actual and the estimated value of the standard deviation using Eq. (27), as a percent of the actual standard deviation, is 1.2 percent and 1 percent, for females and males, respectively.

However, the CAESAR database (Harrison and Robinette, 2002) is a civilian database and does not specifically exclude small or large individuals. As a result, the difference between the actual and estimated standard deviation for the CAESAR anthropometric data is much greater. The difference, when expressed as a percent of the actual standard deviation, is 11.5 percent for males and 11 percent for females. The CAESAR values used are those gathered using traditional measurement techniques and presented in chapter 2 of the referenced document. There are 39 for males and 40 for females.

Consequently, estimating the variance in this way should be done with great caution if at all, as it will produce only marginally approximate values when the data distribution is skewed.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Although multivariate techniques such as Principle Component Analysis are more efficient in the guidance that they offer for ergonomists or designers seeking to model a dimension by combining two or more anthropometric elements, often sufficient data or the tools necessary to use those techniques are not available to the ergonomist or designer.

Combining percentiles is an alternate technique to produce combinations of anthropometric elements. However, as discussed earlier, combining percentiles is not an efficient way to combine anthropometric elements as it commonly leads to substantial error and should be avoided.

If the means, variances and inter-correlations of the anthropometric elements to be combined are known, then it is straightforward to determine the combined mean and variance for any one pair of elements. Once the combined mean and variance are known, it is possible to determine the percent of the user population that is accommodated as a function of the mean and the standard deviation, using either a known underlying distribution model or the Chebyshev inequality if the underlying distribution of the anthropometric data is not known.

As Roebuck (Roebuck, 1995) noted, a source of error in adding percentiles arises from a lack of knowledge of the correlation between the anthropometric elements that are to be combined. This paper demonstrates that, when the correlation between two variables is unknown, assuming that the correlation value is equal to the median or the mean of the range of possible correlation values substantially reduces the error in the estimate of the combined variance. Assuming the median or the mean correlation when combining variances produces more accurate models than does adding or subtracting percentiles.

The underlying distribution of the anthropometric data is a second source of error in estimating the percent accommodation for a given user population. It is sometimes assumed that anthropometric data are normally distributed; however, as the analyses of the ANSUR data in Section 5 suggest, that may be a risky assumption. The great majority of all of the anthropometric elements in the ANSUR database appear not to be normally distributed. It is suspected, but not known, that other anthropometric data may also have non-normal distributions.

Using the normal distribution z-values to determine the number of standard deviations above and below the mean necessary to accommodate a desired percent of the population likely adds error to the anthropometric model. However, in contrast, the Chebyshev theorem is distribution-free and allows a reliable statement of the number of standard deviations above and below the mean necessary to accommodate a desired percent of the user population regardless of the data distribution.

Using the median correlation value and the Chebyshev theorem provides greater accuracy than does combining percentiles. When limited data prevent the use of more sophisticated modeling methods, this method should be used rather than adding or subtracting percentiles, as it produces more reliable accommodation interval estimates. However, the reliability comes at the cost of much wider accommodation intervals. It would be useful to study a larger sample of global anthropometric data to determine if a common empirical distribution might be developed that would afford both reliability and narrower accommodation intervals.
