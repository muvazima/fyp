                  Gene networks (GNs) have become one of the most important approaches for modeling biological processes. They are very useful to understand the different complex biological processes that may occur in living organisms. Currently, one of the biggest challenge in any study related with GN is to assure the quality of these GNs. In this sense, recent works use artificial data sets or a direct comparison with prior biological knowledge. However, these approaches are not entirely accurate as they only take into account direct gene–gene interactions for validation, leaving aside the weak (indirect) relationships.
                  We propose a new measure, named gene network coherence (GNC), to rate the coherence of an input network according to different biological databases. In this sense, the measure considers not only the direct gene–gene relationships but also the indirect ones to perform a complete and fairer evaluation of the input network. Hence, our approach is able to use the whole information stored in the networks. A GNC JAVA-based implementation is available at: http://fgomezvela.github.io/GNC/.
                  The results achieved in this work show that GNC outperforms the classical approaches for assessing GNs by means of three different experiments using different biological databases and input networks. According to the results, we can conclude that the proposed measure, which considers the inherent information stored in the direct and indirect gene–gene relationships, offers a new robust solution to the problem of GNs biological validation.
               
            

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

In the last few years a huge amount of biological information has been analyzed by researchers in order to obtain useful knowledge. Currently, the analysis of this information and its representation are challenges that are faced by modeling techniques. Gene networks (GNs) are one of the most accepted tools for the representation of the genetic models in current bioinformatics studies, since they are able to show easily and visually the gene regulatory processes. GNs present the biological information as a graph, where genes are represented as nodes of the graph, and their relationships are presented as edges (Pavlopoulos et al., 2011). There are many works which use the GNs as a method to represent the regulatory gene processes. For example, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) is one of the most widely used repositories for analyzing relationships between genes. The metabolic pathways stored in KEGG contain knowledge about different biological processes in GNs structures.

The GN generation process is a crucial step in any study related to reconstruction of gene regulatory processes. Depending on the chosen method to generate the network, the model obtained may widely change. Hecker et al. (2009) mainly categorized the GNs into four approaches based on the algorithm used to obtain the models: Information theory-based networks, which usually use a correlation algorithm to establish gene–gene interactions depending on similar expression patterns among the genes (Butte and Kohane, 2000); logical networks (Boolean networks) (Bornholdt, 2008) involving only two states for the network genes: expressed and unexpressed; differential equation-based networks that describe gene expression changes as a function of the expression of other genes and environmental factors (Climescu-Haulica and Quirk, 2007); and finally, Bayesian networks (Needham et al., 2007), which reflect the stochastic nature of gene regulation and make use of the Bayes-rule.

Further, GNs can be represented in different levels of abstraction. These levels range from the detailed gene regulatory processes (like the metabolic pathways stored in KEGG where genes, proteins, compounds and metabolites interact on chemical reactions) to the gene association networks, where the relationships represent some kind of influence between the genes. In this sense, it is possible to transform a complex network into an association network rising its level of abstraction (Hecker et al., 2009). For example, in the work of Sales et al. (2012) a method to obtain gene association networks from the metabolic pathways of KEGG is presented.

Once the network is obtained, the next step is to ensure the reliability of the inferred model. In order to evaluate the GNs quality, synthetic data (Van den Bulcke et al., 2006) and/or prior biological knowledge (Li and Li, 2008) are used to assess the quality of the relationships presented in the network.

On the one hand, synthetic or artificial data represent the simulation of a real biological data set. This method is based on producing an artificial data set according to a previously known network. The simulated gene expression values are stored in a data set in order to be used as input for the GN inference method. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is tested by a comparison of the two networks, the real previous network and the generated one. Different tools, presented in the literature, may be used for producing these artificial data sets (Schaffter et al., 2011). For example, Gill et al. (2010) used synthetic data sets generated by the Syntren tool (Van den Bulcke et al., 2006) in order to provide a recipe for conducting a differential analysis of networks constructed from microarray data and proposed formal statistical test for gene networks.

Despite the fact that synthetic data are useful to rate the performance of algorithms, they cannot reproduce completely the complex internal features of real biological processes since they are only based on simulations of real processes.

On the other hand, the use of real biological knowledge provides great reliability in the correctness of the models validated, since this approach allows a direct comparison of them with highly accepted data. This validation, widely used in literatures (Aguilar-Ruiz et al., 2011; Kamburov et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2012), is usually carried out by using biological databases such as Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000), SGD (Cherry et al., 2012) or YeastNet Lee et al. (2007) as gold standard.

In spite of the fact that the methods presented above are useful for the validation process, they present a fundamental lack. These methods do not use all the information stored in a GN, as they only consider the strong relationships leaving aside the indirect ones (Wei and Li, 2007). The relationships stored in a GN can be classified into two groups (Poyatos, 2011): direct (or strong) which connect one pair of genes directly; indirect (or weak) where two genes are connected by a path with multiple edges. Due to this, a direct comparison is not completely accurate because it ignores weak relationships.

Furthermore, the use of the indirect relationships is useful to mitigate another important problem in the validation of GNs. Inference algorithms are not always able to generate a network that reproduce the internal features of biological processes to identify the relationships between genes (Muddana et al., 2006). This issue may occur due to problems in the input data set, and are oblivious to the inference algorithm (Zeisel et al., 2010; Draghici et al., 2006).

In this paper, the authors present a new method to assess the biological coherence of gene association networks by using the knowledge stored in biological databases. The method obtains a measure, named GNC (gene network coherence), which is able to consider not only the direct relationships, but also the indirect ones to perform a complete and fairer evaluation of the input network.

To show the performance of GNC, we used some representatives networks from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Homo sapiens in three different experiments. The results achieved show that GNC outperforms the classical approaches for assessing GNs and offers a new robust solution to the problem of GNs biological validation.

Our approach is based on the use of direct and indirect relationships presented in a GN for the evaluation of its biological quality. GNC rates the biological coherence of an input network regarding a specific biological database (DB). Depending on the type of the information to be validated, i.e. protein–protein interaction (PPI), co-expression relationships, gene regulatory relationships or even all of them, a different database should be selected.

The methodology entails three consecutive steps (see Fig. 1
                     ), which are described below.

In the first step, the information of the gene–gene relationships presented in the input network, and the information of the relationships from the selected biological database, are represented as adjacency matrices (AM). The adjacency matrix of a GN of N genes is the N
                        ×
                        N upper-diagonal matrix where the entry a
                        
                           ij
                         is 1 if a direct edge exists from gene g
                        
                           i
                         to gene g
                        
                           j
                        , and 0 if there is no direct edge between them. An example is depicted in Fig. 1, where two AMs are obtained from the input network and the biological database, respectively.

After the AMs have been obtained, the Floyd–Warshall algorithm (Asghar Ainia, 2012) is used to calculate the minimum path for every pair of genes. Hence, the minimum distance of all gene pair combinations is computed and stored into two distance matrices; one for the input network (DM
                        
                           IN
                        ) and another for the database (DM
                        
                           DB
                        ). Note that indirect relationships are considered to generate both distance matrices. This process is depicted in the step 1 of Fig. 1.

Once the distance matrices have been obtained, they are combined to generate a new one that stores the coherence of the gene–gene relationships from the input network regarding the biological database. The new matrix, hereafter called Coherence Matrix (CM), is a V
                        ×
                        V upper-diagonal matrix where V is the number of genes considered. This matrix stores the existing gap among the common genes in both matrices (DM
                        
                           IN
                         and DM
                        
                           DB
                        ). The method uses only the common genes between the input network and the database because there is no information to rate the quality of the interactions from genes in IN that are not present in DB. With this pruning, the problems associated with the different networks size are overcome. Each value of the coherence matrix is calculated by a distance function (1) that is described at following:

                              where α and β denote entries from the input network and database DMs, respectively. That is, α
                              =
                              DM
                              
                                 IN

                              =

                                 DB
                              (i, j).

Eq. (1) presents a distance function to obtain the coherence of the relationships from the input network. This equation uses the same concept presented in the topology-based distance function presented by Dougherty (2007), where the function is showed as the summation of the difference between the distances of the relationships (see Section 5 for more details). In contrast to this, our approach is able to score not only the existing gap between the networks, but also weight this gap based on its relevance (distance of the relationship). Thereby the biological coherence of each relationship is weighted as inverse relation of its distances difference between IN and BD (|α
                        −
                        β|). Also the minimum distance of this relationship in both networks (min{α, β}) is considered in order to weight the coherence of the relationship with its relevance into the graph. Thus, the greater the topology difference and the distance of the relationship, the lower the coherence of this relationship. The generation process of the coherence matrix is showed in second step of Fig. 1, where the DMs are used to obtain the CM.

Finally, the coherence of the input network is calculated. GNC measure is calculated by averaging the values of the upper diagonal from CM. The total rating measure will be computed accordingly to the following definition:

GNC shows the average of the coherence values for all relationships presented in the evaluated network. Note all the relationships coherence have the same relevance for the final evaluation although it was previously weighted according to its relevance.

Thus, GNC offers a biological quality measure for the input network regarding the selected DB. This proposed measure ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the best coherence score, and 0 is the worst one.

A thorough analysis has been conducted to assess the reliability of the results obtained by our proposal. Firstly, a ROC analysis is presented to prove that our method performs better than classical one which only use direct relationships. Secondly, the behavior of the GNC measure against the noise is shown in an exhaustive randomness study. Finally, the performance of GNC has been compared with results stemmed from Gene Ontology analysis of a set of yeast cell cycle networks.

In this section, a complete ROC analysis was performed to show the improvement achieved by using indirect relationships (GNC) over other measures, which only considers direct gene–gene interactions, along with its robustness against information without biological meaning. Concretely, we have performed a comparative ROC analysis of GNC with two well-known measures: Predicted Positive Value (PPV) (Penfold and Wild, 2011), that estimates the ratio of relationships that were correctly inferred; and the F-measure (Cerulo et al., 2010), which considers not only the number of correct relationships, but also the number of relationships that should have been inferred according to the gold standard (see Section 5 for more details). These measures have been broadly used in the literature for assessing the results obtained by gene networks inference algorithms (Cerulo et al., 2010; Dougherty, 2012; Bansal et al., 2006).

The ROC analysis has been widely used in literatures (Alakwaa et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2008; Kamburov et al., 2012) to score the performance of classifiers or ranking methods using a comparison between true positive rate and false positive rate. Furthermore, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is presented because it provides useful information about how the presented approach performs.

This analysis is divided into two different experiments according to the organism considered; S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens.

As input data sets, two contrasting yeast networks were used in this experiment. These networks were presented by Costanzo et al. (2010), a co-expression network obtained from genetic expression profiles composed by 4270 genes and 74, 840 edges; and the network generated by Balaji et al. (2006), a PPI gene network composed by 4441 genes and 12, 873 relationships, where co-regulated interactions between transcription factors are presented.

Previous networks are analyzed according to three different biological databases. Concretely, the yeast information stored in the YeastNet (v2.0) (Lee et al., 2007) which combines PPI, PDI, co-expression, phylogenetic conservation and literature information. The interactions obtained from GeneMANIA (Mostafavi et al., 2008; Warde-Farley et al., 2010) which contains functional association data including protein and genetic interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization and protein domain similarity. Note, we have taken only the co-expression interactions that are presented in 10 or more references in the literature to assure the quality of those interactions. And finally, the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) (Cherry et al., 2012) that provides the complete S. cerevisiae genomic sequence. For this study, only the PPI interactions have been taken for the experiment since Balaji's network is composed by PPI.

To perform this experiment, a sample of random networks were generated for each input network studied, i.e. one set for Constanzo's and one different for Balaji's as well. Theses samples were produced using the method described in the work by Alexeyenko et al. (2012) (see Section 5 for more details).

The type of the information contained in the input networks and databases has divided the experiment into two groups: Costanzo's network was compared with interactions obtained from YeastNet and GeneMANIA (co-expression), and Balaji's network was compared with the interactions obtained from YeastNet and SGD (both contain PPI).

The results of the analysis are depicted in Fig. 2
                           , where each subfigure represents the study performed for a different input network and database. It is worth mentioning that all of the subfigures present the same behavior: our approach performs better than the other measures considered. For example Bajali's network AUC values (Fig. 2(d)) increases from 0.66 for PPV and 0.89 for the F-measure, using only the direct relationships, to a value of 0.93 using the indirect ones. In the same way, result presented in Fig. 2(c), using YeastNet, the AUC values increase from 0.82 for F-measure and 0.89 for the PPV to a value of 0.985 obtained by our method.

Furthermore, Constanzo's network also shows a significant improvement in the results obtained by our proposal, increasing an AUC value from 0.67 for PPV and 0.69 for F-measure to 0.88 according to GeneMANIA, and a similar improvement using YeastNet.

In this section, two networks from H. sapiens organism are used as input data sets. In particular, we have used the network presented by Lage et al. (2010), which is a PPI human network composed of 12, 552 genes and 350, 029 interactions. This network is generated by determining the second-order interactions of the cardiac developmental protein.

We have used a human KEGG pathway as input gene network. In this case, we have selected the Purine metabolism pathway (hsa00230), being the human pathway which contains the largest number of interactions (168 genes and 4828 interactions). Since a pathway cannot be directly managed as a gene network, we transformed hsa00230 into a gene association network, applying the process described by Sales et al. (2012).

To perform the evaluation of these input networks, we have selected two different biological databases: (a) the PPI interactions for the human stored in GeneMANIA (presented in the previous section), and (b) the interactions stored in the Biological General Repository for Interaction Data sets (BioGRID) Breitkreutz et al. (2008). The BioGRID is an open access repository of genetic and protein interactions that are curated from the primary biomedical literature for all major model organism species. BioGRID stores more than 500, 000 manually annotated interactions from more than 30 model organisms including the H. sapiens (Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2013).

The ROC study results, which have been performed similarly to previous section, are illustrated in Fig. 3
                           . These results present the same behavior for all subfigures, where GNC outperforms the F-measures and PPV. For example, regarding Lage's network results, AUC values range from 0.58, obtained by PPV, to 0.67, by GNC, using BioGRID, and from 0.53 to 0.61 for PPV and GNC, respectively, using GeneMANIA (see panels (a) and (b)). The maximum difference is presented in the evaluation of the metabolic pathway against BioGRID, where the AUC value reaches from 0.58, obtained by F-measure, to 0.80 obtained by our approach (see panel (c)).

It is also worth mentioning the difference observed between the results obtained by the KEGG pathway using the BioGRID as gold standard, instead of GeneMANIA. These differences are explained due to the different types of interactions stored into the databases. As it was described above, for the GeneMANIA database we have only selected the protein–protein interactions, while the BioGRID contains protein and genetic interactions. The KEGG's pathways are composed of different types of relationships (PPI, genetic interactions or chemical reactions among others), so it makes sense that the results obtained by the BioGRID show higher significance. Furthermore, when the input network contains only PPI, we can observe that there is not a significant difference between the results obtained from the two databases (see the results obtained by the network presented by Lage et al. panels (a) and (b)). This behavior proves the relevance of the selection of a suitable gold standard to perform the evaluation.

Despite the fact that in Section 3.1 it has been shown that GNC performs better than classical approaches to distinguishing real networks from random networks, in this section, the behavior of the measure to the progressive inclusion of noise in the input network will be shown. This study was developed using the networks presented by Balaji et al. and Constanzo et al. described in the previous section.

In order to evaluate their biological validity, two different databases have been considered: SGD and GeneMANIA (presented in the previous section as well). GeneMANIA is used to analyzed Constanzo's network, which only contains co-expression relationships; while Balaji's, a PPI network, is studied using SGD. Moreover, we have included in the study two alternative measures presented above (PPV and F-measure).


                        Fig. 4
                         presents the evolution of the results obtained by the measures for the input networks in relation to both databases, in two different panels. These results show that our approach is able to detect the loss of biological information as the randomness increases in the networks. Furthermore, both experiments follow a similar behavior which verifies that all measures are able to detect how the loss of relevant information is progressive, and how the biological meaning of the network decreases as the randomness does increase in the networks. Additionally, it is important to note that GNC presents a more sensitive behavior against noise than the other two measures. For example, considering Constanzo's network, GNC decreased by 0.63 units (from 0.87 to 0.24), while F-measure decreased from 0.66 to 0.19 with a noise of 100% (decreased by 0.47 units). Balaji's network presents similar behavior, GNC reached 0.16 a decrease of 0.45 units if compared to its initial value (0.61). Similar results were reported for the F-measure: it was decreased by 0.4 units (from 0.57 to 0.17).

In conclusion, GNC is able not only to detect the progressive loss of relevant information in the input network, but also presents more sensitive behavior against noise than the other presented measures.

The usefulness of our approach to rate the biological GNs quality is tested in this section by a functional study of a set of gene networks. In addition, we will conduct a comparison between the results obtained by GNC and a Gene Ontology-based approach, which does not consider the relationships between the genes to assess gene networks.

To do so, we present a similar study than the presented in the work of Gallo et al. (2011), where the performance of four yeast cell cycle networks was the object of study. In this study, the input networks were produced by four inference network techniques on the same set of genes from the well-known microarray presented by Spellman et al. (1998), a yeast cell cycle time series expression data. In particular, the subset of genes, which was firstly used by Soinov et al. (2003), is composed by 20 genes that encode important proteins for cell-cycle regulation.

Specifically, the input networks were generated by applying four techniques: the approach presented by Soinov et al., that is based on the application of C4.5 algorithm to infer decision trees from gene expression data. The relationships of the network are finally extracted from these trees; Bulashevska and Eils (2005), which is a method based on the Bayesian approach and utilizing Gibbs sampling; Ponzoni et al. (2007) whose algorithm called GRNCORP is based on a combinatorial optimization to infer the model; and finally, the algorithm presented by Gallo et al. (GRNCORP2) that is a performance improvement of the previous one. For the study the three databases applied in the ROC analysis were used (YeastNet, SGD and GeneMANIA) since they store a wide variety types of information.

Moreover, a complementary study based on Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) of the same set of networks have been presented in order to compare their results with the generated by our proposal. Note the GO-based studies have been used in the literature to rate the biological significance of gene networks (Nepomuceno-Chamorro et al., 2010; Mahanta et al., 2012; Roy et al., 2014) by examining their annotations and finding those annotations that they share to a significant extent. The inference methods should be able to select only the genes in the input data set that are related with the studied process (the cell cycle) to generate the networks. In order to verify this assumption, the GO analysis was used to determine if the cell cycle GO-term (GO:0007049) is enriched for all input networks and yields the ratio of genes within GN that are annotated in this GO-term. It is worth mentioning that 14 of the 20 input genes are annotated in GO:0007049.

All networks introduced in this study are composed of a single connected graph, except for Soinov's network, which is composed of two clusters. We have selected the whole network to perform the study similarly than the work run by Roy et al. (2014), but for Soinov's approach, the biggest cluster obtained was selected as the most representative result. This is a similar process than the one presented by Nepomuceno-Chamorro et al. (2010), where the biggest subgraph obtained was studied as the most representative result from the method.

The results obtained for both approaches (GNC and GO-based analysis) are also depicted in Fig. 5
                        . The first three bars show the results obtained by GNC using the different databases, the fourth one shows the results obtained by the GO-based study.

If we focus only on GNC results, we can observe that the method obtains similar results for all selected databases. Soinov's network scored the worst results while Ponzoni's network obtained the best. These results are consistent with the experiment carried out by Gallo et al. (2011) using the same data set. GRNCORP was successfully compared with Soinov's and Bulashevska's approaches, while Gallo presented a detailed analysis of the performance of GRNCORP and GRNCORP2, where the last one presents the most stable result but not a significant biological improvement.

Furthermore, the GO-based analysis presents a similar behavior than GNC for three of the four input networks, except for Soinov's network. This difference is plausible since GO-based analysis fits better studying gene sets because GO does not provide information about gene–gene relationships. Note that the network generated by Soinov technique is based on the algorithm C4.5, which is typically used to classify genes in sets of genes (clusters) (Dinakarpandian et al., 2005; Steuer et al., 2006). Therefore, it is not surprising that the best results were achieved for the analysis which is typically used to evaluate sets of genes.

With these results, specifically the evaluation performed on Soinov's network, we can see how GNC not only obtains the expected results but also how it fits better than GO-based approach.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A novel measure to rate the biological coherence of gene networks has been presented. The measure is based on the use of the direct and indirect relationships presented in a GN to make an exhaustive evaluation of it.

In order to prove its usefulness three different experiments have been carried out. Firstly, a ROC analysis was presented for different input networks and databases. The results presented by this ROC analysis, using yeast and human networks, show that the use of indirect relationships is a significant improvement in gene network assessment task. GNC presented a better performance exceeding the results obtained by classical approaches which consider only direct relationships. Additionally, in this section we have showed that GNC is able to evaluate different kinds of networks like co-expression, PPI or metabolic pathways among others. Secondly, a randomness study proves that our method is sensitive to the noise when assessing an input GN, verifying that GNC is able to show how the networks lose relevant information as the randomness increases, and our method is able to detect this loss of information. Finally, an analysis made by our approach on different yeast networks is compared with a GO-based analysis. Unlike the GO-based analysis, GNC considers the internal architecture of the network, which is the essential feature of a gene network. The results show that GNC fits better than GO-based approach to perform studies of gene networks.

According to these results, we can conclude that the proposed measure offers a new robust solution to the problem of GNs biological validation.

GNC rates the biological coherence of a gene network calculating the topology distance between two networks based on their adjacency matrices. This concept is used in the topology-based distance presented in the work by Dougherty (2012). We have incorporated the concept of indirect relationships to this distance, using the minimum path algorithm and the new coherence matrix. The original topology-based distance is defined as follows:

This is a commonly used distance function used to assess inference algorithms validity (Zhao et al., 2008).

The main goal of this study is, first, to compare the results obtained by the methodology making an assessment of real biological networks against random networks (without biological meaning) and, second, show the improvement of considering the indirect relationships for the assessment. We have assumed that the real networks contain biological meaning for all relationships stored in them. Hence, the evaluation of a sample of their relationships should produce relevant results for GNC. In contrast, the evaluation of random networks should obtain poor results since the random relationships should not contain biological information.

Each real network has been split into 100 parts to generate a set of biological input networks to perform the study. The generation of the random networks was performed by applying the algorithm presented by Alexeyenko et al. (2012), where an algorithm to generate gene random networks from real one is described.

A threshold (
                           T
                        ) has been used to decide if the evaluated network contains coherent information with the selected database. 
                           T
                         denotes the maximum GNC value for an input network to be considered as valid. To generate the ROC curve for each topology, 101 different 
                           T
                         values (from 0 to 1) were used. According to the experiment presented by Alexeyenko et al., a set of 100 random networks was generated for each input network to evaluate the performance. With this idea, the confusion matrix is obtained for each iteration:
                           
                              •
                              True positives (TP): the number of sets from real networks where the GNC value exceeds the threshold.

False negatives (FN): the number of sets from real networks where the GNC value does not exceed the threshold.

False positives (FP): the number of random sets of relationships where the GNC value exceeds the threshold.

True negatives (TN): the number of random sets of relationships where the GNC value does not exceed the threshold.

The randomness study is commonly used in the literature to test the sensitivity of the proposed approach against noise in the input data (Gaire et al., 2013). In this work, it was performed changing the input networks by increasing their randomness in their gene–gene relationships. Thus, in a loop process composed of 10 iterations, the random relationships added to the networks were increased by 10% at each iteration, and a 10% of the original relationships were removed. To avoid bias, this process was performed 100 times for each point. In this sense, 2000 (100 networks ×10 iterations ×2 input networks) different random networks were generated to perform the whole study.

In the yeast cell cycle study section, a Gene Ontology analysis was presented. The GO analyzes have been used in the literature to rate the biological significance of the results obtained by gene network inference techniques (Nepomuceno-Chamorro et al., 2010; Mahanta et al., 2012; Roy et al., 2014). In particular, these analyses were used, not only to assess the clusters obtained by the methods, but also the complete network generated. In particular, if the network studied was composed by a single graph, the complete network is used in the study to rate the biological significance of the network in a similar way than in the work by Roy et al. (2014). In the case that the network contains different subgraphs, we used the biggest cluster (genes that comprise the biggest subgraph) of the input networks to perform the GO analysis as in the work presented by Nepomuceno-Chamorro et al. (2010). In this work, the authors selected the biggest subgraph generated by their method to rate the biological quality of the network inferred using GO.

The knowledge stored in GO provides useful information about the biological functionality of a gene or gene product. Each GO-term refers to a particular functionality and one or more genes could be annotated to it. In this sense, we have evaluated the biological validity of the input network, regarding the process studied. To do so, we have firstly analyzed if the cell-cycle GO-term (GO:0007049) is enriched by the genes within the input network. With this aim, FuncAssociate 2.0 tool (Berriz et al., 2009) that is a web application that discovers properties enriched in lists of genes or proteins has been used. We have then calculated the proportion of those genes which are annotated in this GO-term obtaining in this way the final measure.

Although this analysis provides useful information about the biological information contained in network according with GO, it does not consider the relationships among the genes of the networks, which is the main feature in gene networks.

The complexity of our approach is due to two features: the computational process to obtain the distance matrices among all the nodes in the networks, and the calculation of the GNC measure. Floyd and Warshall algorithm, the minimum path algorithm used to compute the distance matrices, has a complexity of O(n
                        3) where n represents the number of genes in the networks, while the process needed to obtain the GNC measure has a complexity of O(k
                        2), where k is the number of the common genes between the input network and the database. Due to this, the complexity of the approach could be defined as follows:

                                 (
                                 
                                    n
                                    3
                                 
                                 +
                                 
                                    k
                                    2
                                 
                                 )
                                 =
                                 O
                                 (
                                 
                                    n
                                    3
                                 
                                 )
                              
                           
                        
                     

Although GNC presents a complexity higher than PPV or F-measure (which have a O(n
                        2) complexity), the results presented in this paper prove that our approach performs better than these measures to rate the biological meaning of gene association networks. In addition, the applications provided were developed using a multi-thread design in order to speed up the running time of the software.
