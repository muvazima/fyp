                  Topological properties are with invariance and take priority over other features, which play an important role in cognition. This paper introduces a new attention selection model called TPA (topological properties-based attention), which adopts topological properties and quaternion. In TPA, using Unit-linking PCNN (Pulse Coupled Neural Network) hole-filter expresses an important topological property (the connectivity) in visual attention selection. Meanwhile, using the quaternion Fourier transform based phase spectrum of an image or a frame in a video obtains the spatio-temporal saliency map, which shows the result of attention selection. Adjusting the weight of a topological channel can change its influence. The experimental results show that TPA reflects the real attention selection more accurately than PQFT (Phase spectrum of Quaternion Fourier Transform).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper, we introduce a model called TPA (topological properties-based attention) for attention selection, which adds topological properties to PQFT (Properties based Phase spectrum of Quaternion Fourier Transform) model [1,2]. PQFT model uses the phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform to obtain the spatio-temporal saliency map of attention selection. Unlike previous models of attention selection, our model TPA is based on the fact shown by Chen [13] that topological properties play a key role in perceptual organization. The topological property used in this paper is expressed by Unit-linking PCNN (Pulse Coupled Neural Network) hole-filter [3,4] using pulse transmission of PCNN. The two main contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly, inspiring by topological perception theory in psychology, we introduce topological properties to attention selection. Secondly, we propose a new model based on topological perception theory that achieves better attention saliency maps than PQFT.

There are bottom-up attention and top-down one in cognition. Some objects automatically effortlessly “pop-out” from their surroundings, that is, they draw our visual attention in a “bottom-up” manner. This is called bottom-up attention. Focal visual attention feeds back and locally modulates visual processing and representation of selected objects in a “top-down” manner, which is called top-down attention [5]. In computer vision, there were many bottom-up models simulating visual attention, such as NVT, PQFT, SR, and STB [6,1,7,8]. Among these bottom-up models, it is NVT, the earliest model presented by Itti [5,6,9–11] that has been used widely. TPA method in this paper is also a bottom-up attention model.

Topological perception theory is the psychological foundation of our model. According to research finds of visual process, topological perception theory is an important branch of psychology [12,13,15,16,19]. It addresses the importance of topological properties with invariance in visual perception. Topological properties are invariant and stable in topological transformation. Visual perception is an essential part of visual attention and topological properties with invariance play an important role in visual perception. This inspires us to apply topological properties in visual attention.

The paper consists of seven sections. Section 2 introduces topological perception theory, emphasizing its two characteristics: invariance and priority. Section 3 describes the fundamental knowledge of quaternion and hypercomplex Fourier transform. In our model TPA, utilizing the phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform obtains spatio-temporal saliency map. Section 4 describes PCNN (Pulse Coupled Neural Network) model and Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter. PCNN developed from Eckhorn’s linking model [14]. Unit-linking PCNN is a simplified version of PCNN, and hole-filter based on Unit-linking PCNN is used here to express connectivity, a topological property used to enhance the perception of the whole object. Section 5 presents and analyzes our TPA model in detail. In Section 6, experimental results show that using TPA model, the quality of spatio-temporal saliency improves apparently, which reflects real attention distribution better. The last section gives conclusions.

                      shows how to introduce a topological channel in TPA.

Chen proposed topological perception theory in 1982 [12]. Early vision is sensitive to topological structure [12,13]. A topological transformation is a one-to-one and continuous transformation. In detail, it means that topological transformation is a continuous geometric transform meeting the following criteria, (1) not breaking, (2) not merging, (3) any two points not overlapping to become one point. Topological properties are invariant in topological transformation, and they are most stable among image-based features, such as color, edge density, and shape [15,16]. Usually when the local geometrical properties of an object change, the topological properties remain unchanged. For example, a dog could appear in different shapes, but its connectivity keeps invariable. The number “8” has two holes, and if we circumrotate it or do other changes without breaking or fusing, the number of the holes remains unchangeable. Topological properties involve connectivity, the number of holes, inside/outside relation and so on. TPA uses connectivity.

Topological perception plays an important part in visual perception [17,18]. It is proposed to address the question of “what are the primitives of visual perception?”. What is the meaning of this question? This question can also be expressed as “where is the beginning of the visual perception process?”. Topology theory gives the following answer. The primitives of visual perception are geometrically invariant, which means human beings perceive topological properties firstly in visual process. The topological approach is based on one core idea and includes two main aspects. The core idea is that perceptual organization should be understood as transformation and invariance among transformation. The first aspect emphasizes the topological structure during perception forming. Namely, the global nature of perceptual organization can be described in terms of topological invariants. The second aspect further highlights early topological perception. Namely, topological perception is prior to perception of local feature properties. The “prior” has two strict meanings. Firstly, it implies that global organization determined by topology is the basis on which perception of local geometrical properties depends. Secondly, topological perception (based on physical connectivity) occurs earlier than perception of local geometrical properties [13].

That theory considers that topological perception determines separation between objects and backgrounds in visual process [12,13]. Topological perception is prior to other feature perceptions in visual process, and early vision is very sensitive to topological structure. Honeybee’s brain is very small, but it could distinguish the difference among different topological structures [19]. So it is reasonable to presume that topological perception is fundamental to all vision systems. Perceptual object is invariant to geometric transformation. Psychologists consider that perceptual object leads to attention selection. When a laying cat turns into a moving cat, and its topological properties remain unchanged although the shape of the cat is changed. No new perceptual object appears. A solid triangle turns into a solid circle, and its topological properties remain unchanged. Here we consider that there is no new perceptual object appeared. If it becomes an empty square, which means topological properties has changed, a new perceptual object generates. Attention would concentrate on this perceptual object [13].

In this paper, we introduce connectivity (an important topological property) to our TPA model for attention selection. Here connectivity is used to make the model produce attention for a whole object.

Quaternion Fourier transform can be applied in color images processing [20–27]. In this paper, we take four features of an image as four channels to produce a quaternion image. These four channels of a quaternion image are composed of one gray intensity channel, two color channels and one topological channel. TPA in this paper utilizes quaternion Fourier transform obtains the phase spectrum, and then utilizes this phase spectrum produces a saliency map. Quaternion Fourier transform performs rapidly and in parallel.

A quaternion can be represented in hypercomplex form, see the following equation:

Literatures [1,2] introduced that the phase spectrum played a main role in the saliency map and amplitude spectrum contributed little to that. In this paper, firstly using quaternion obtains the phase spectrum of quaternion images. Then using this phase spectrum produces saliency map. The computation steps are as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           Using quaternion Fourier transform of a quaternion image obtains its frequency domain expression in polar form

                              , which only involves phase spectrum information. Then doing inverse Fourier transform of q gets the spatial domain representation q(t).

Saliency maps are obtained finally.

PCNN consisting of spiking neurons is a kind of spiking neural networks. It is developed from Eckhorn’s linking model [14]. PCNN has been applied in image processing widely [28–31]. A PCN (Pulse Coupled Neuron) has biological support, and it is the simplified version of a real neuron.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the model of a PCN [3], and it illustrates that a PCN consists of three parts: receptive field, modulation field and pulse generator. The receptive field receives input signals. The modulation field has two channels (L channel and F channel). They do multiplication modulation, and the output signals transmit to the pulse generator, which determines whether the neuron model emit pulses or not.

                         is the amplitude gain of the threshold adjuster. The activity of a PCN can be described as follows. If the internal activity is greater than the threshold, the neuron equals to 1. Then its threshold rises over the internal activity and its output turns to 0. The neuron emits a pulse. The threshold descends with time increasing. When the internal activity is greater than the threshold again, the neuron emits a pulse once again. These PCNs connects to form a PCNN.

Computation of PCNN is complex. In order to reduce computation complexity, Unit-linking PCNN, a simplified version of PCNN, was presented. Unit-linking PCNN has used in image segmentation and other image processing [32–34].


                        Fig. 5
                         shows the structure of a Unit-linking PCN [45], which is similar with the structure of a PCN. But it simplifies F channel and L channel. Although Unit-linking PCNN is the simplified model of PCNN, it retains main characteristics (such as pulse spread) of PCNN.

                        Eq. (9) describes the model of a Unit-linking PCN, where the symbols have the same meanings as those in Eq. (8). A Unit-linking PCNN consists of identical Unit-linking PCNs. In image processing based on Unit-linking PCNN, one-to-one correspondence exists between the image pixels and the neurons. Pixel’s intensity inputs to F channel and each neuron connects with other neurons in its neighboring field through L channel. This paper also adopts this connection way. In TPA model, we utilize Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter to get the expression of connectivity. The Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter result of the image (or the frame in a video) inputs to the topological channel in TPA model.

According to Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter method, pulses emitted by seed neuron in the background spread in the background out of holes and are blocked by hole boundaries. The hole including the boundary and the region in the boundary correspond to non-fired neurons.

Assuming objects corresponding to relatively dark regions and backgrounds corresponding to relatively bright regions, we expand edges of the whole image one pixel as bright regions and choose one of the neurons at this bright region as the seed neuron emitting the initial pulse. With two channels multiplication modulation, we can make neurons fire in the seed neuron’s 4-neighboring field. Pulse waves inspiring by the seed neuron would spread freely and fast in four orientations, which shows pulse-spreading character of PCNN. Pulse waves spread in the background out of holes and are blocked by hole boundaries. The neurons inside holes cannot be excited to fire. Finally, neurons not fired correspond to holes including holes boundaries and other neurons correspond to backgrounds. How do we know the ending of hole-filter? Obviously, if there is no new neuron fired, hole-filter finishes [3,4].

When a contour of a whole object composed of different segments is close, sometimes using this hole filter method can merges different segments of this object as a whole one because the contour of the whole object blocks pulses emitted by the seed neuron in the background. In this situation, this whole object will be not segmented into several parts. Unit-linking PCNN could perform hole-filter, not only for binary images, but also for gray intensity images.

TPA (topological properties-based attention) is a new model proposed in this paper, which introduces topological properties in attention selection. There are two psychological supports of introducing topological properties in our model. (1) In visual process, topological perception is prior to local geometrical properties perception. (2) Topological properties are invariant to topological transformation, and they are most stable among image-based features [15,16], such as color, edge density, and shape. The algorithm of TPA includes following steps.
                        
                           1.
                           An image or a frame in a video is represented as a quaternion image. Inputting four features of a color image to a quaternion constructs a quaternion image. For images, we input two color pairs, gray intensity and connectivity to a quaternion to produce a quaternion image. For videos, motion replaces gray intensity.

Using quaternion Fourier transform computes the phase spectrum of the quaternion image.

Finally, using the phase spectrum obtains the spatio-temporal saliency map.

In step 1, there is the difference between “for images” and “for videos”. Step 2 and step 3 have been introduced in Section 3. However, how to represent an image as a quaternion image more efficiently still requires further research.

There are four channels (one topological channel T, two color channels, and one gray intensity channel) in TPA model for images.

TPA model for images includes one topological channel T. Firstly, the input image is turned into a gray image, with resizing linearly to a small one with the size 64pixel*64pixel. Then we do Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter on that compressed image. The output is a binary image, which expresses connectivity of the original image, and it inputs to the topological channel. Fig. 7
                            shows some examples of natural images and their topological channels.

In human brains, neurons excited by one color are inhibited by another color. This is called a “color opponent-component” theory. The color pairs include red/green, green/red, blue/yellow and yellow/blue. Based on this fact, two color channels [5] (RG and BY) are adopted in TPA model for images.

In Eq. (10), r, g, b are red, green and blue channel of an image respectively. Negative numbers in RG, BY are set to zero.

In Eq. (11), a

                           =BY. Every channel’s input is a 64*64 matrix, where every element is normalized to [0,1]. Literatures [1,2,7] shown that the 64*64 size of image is good at some frequency domain saliency detection.

TPA model for video is similar to that for images, and the only difference is that the motion channel replaces gray intensity channel.

A motion channel is defined as follows:

In Eq. (12), I(t) is the gray intensity of the frame captured at time t and τ is a delay variable. In this paper, τ
                        =2. Four channels of TPA model for videos consist of one topological channel, two color channels, and one motion channel.

TPA considers an important topological property (connectivity), so it performs better than PQFT. This will be shown in next section.

Saliency maps for images or videos reflect the visual attention results. Our experiments include six parts. (1) Image saliency maps of TPA are compared with those of PQFT. (2) A method is presented for evaluating saliency maps. (3) Using eye fixation prediction for images and ROC curves evaluate TPA and PQFT. (4) Video saliency maps of TPA are compared with those of PQFT. (5) Using Psychological patterns evaluates TPA and PQFT. (6) The discussion on weight of topological channel in TPA is given.

In this experiment, we use 100 natural images in a dataset, which is also used in literatures [1,2,7]. Using TPA and PQFT respectively obtains their saliency maps. The result shows that TPA effects are better than PQFT apparently. Fig. 8
                         displays some of these images and their TPA or PQFT saliency maps.


                        Fig. 8 shows that TPA saliency maps could pay more attention to main objects. The dark regions in saliency maps correspond to areas with less attention, while the bright regions correspond to areas with more attention. The regions of main objects in TPA saliency maps are brighter than those in PQFT saliency maps, which shows that more attention concentrates on main objects when using TPA. For example, in the first image of Fig. 8, the hydrant is compelling. TPA model can pop it out. In the third and fourth images, TPA saliency maps pay more attention to the eagle and the bear than PQFT. TPA model pops out the moon in the last image while PQFT does not.

In addition, the regions corresponding to backgrounds are brighter in PQFT saliency maps, while they are relatively dark in TPA ones. This indicates that PQFT pays more attention to backgrounds than TPA. For instance, in the second and fifth images, obviously the PQFT saliency maps for backgrounds are too strong, while TPA ones are much better.

Therefore, TPA performs better than PQFT for both paying attention to main objects and ignoring backgrounds.

Because saliency maps can express the locations of objects, we use the number of objects detected correctly in first five attention focus regions in images to evaluate the saliency maps. PQFT model also uses this criterion [1,2], see the following equations:

                         indicates the ith largest gray intensity in a saliency map, which corresponds to the ith attention focus, where i

                        yi) is the location of the ith focus. Rgni
                         is the ith focus region. α is a threshold to determine the size of regions, where 0<
                        α
                        <1. In all experiments of this paper, α
                        =0.9. The findArea function is used to find the region of Maski

In our experiments, it is allowed to select first five focuses in an image. If focuses correspond to correct objects, they are looked as correct ones. If the focuses are backgrounds, they are not looked as correct ones. Here we use three persons as volunteers. A voting strategy determines the correct objects, which are those objects only the majority (two or three people) agrees on. For 100 natural images, the numbers of correct objects detected by two methods respectively are shown in Table 1
                        .


                        Table 1 shows that TPA finds more correct objects in focus regions of 100 natural images than PQFT, and the total number of correct objects detected by TPA is larger than PQFT apparently. It means that the ability of searching objects or paying attention to objects of TPA is better than PQFT.

It may not be the most appropriate criterion of evaluating the performance of attention selection that selecting discrete target regions based on the saliency maps. A better approach is to use human eye fixation prediction and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves to evaluate the performance of attention selection. It is proposed by B.W. Tatler et al. [35], which is widely used to evaluate the saliency map’s effects [36–40]. This approach needs participant eye fixation, which is the base of ground truth. We use the dataset including 120 color images and corresponding eye fixations from 20 participants provided by Bruce [36]. All participant eye fixations are represented in a binary fixation map. Every image by convolving the binary fixation map with a Gaussian filter [36,41] generates the fixation density map. The fixation density map serves as the ground truth. Those nonzero points in the ground truth are regarded as target points and others are regarded as background points. With a threshold, a saliency map can be divided into the fixation region and non-fixation region. The percentage of target points that fall into the fixation region is called hit rate, and the percentage of background points that fall into the fixation region is called false alarm rate. The threshold is systematically moved between the minimum and the maximum values of the saliency map and this changes both the hit rate and the false alarm rate. ROC curve plots the false alarm rate as a function of the hit rate by varying the threshold. The area beneath the curve is called ROC area. In random choice, the value of ROC area is 0.5. For perfect prediction, the value of ROC area is 1.0. If the model predicts worse than random choice, it would be less than 0.5. The larger the ROC area, the better the prediction performance of a saliency map is.


                        Fig. 9
                         illustrates the ROC curves of PQFT and TPA on Bruce dataset [36] respectively and we calculate the ROC area for each method. The value of ROC area of TPA is 0.7847 and that of PQFT is 0.7743 in Fig. 9. Our TPA model exhibits a bit larger ROC area than PQFT in Fig. 9. Fig. 10
                         shows some saliency maps of PQFT and TPA respectively on Bruce dataset. Fig. 10 illustrates TPA saliency maps are more consistent with fixation density maps than PQFT ones. TPA also produces more obvious contours than PQFT. In addition, TPA is able to pop out some targets that should be paid attention to, while PQFT fails to detect. For example, in the second images in Fig. 10, TPA saliency map could pop out the objects on the carpet. In the third image, the pen on the desk is very notable in the TPA saliency map.

We use a video including 374 frames to test the performance of each method. We obtain their saliency maps of every frame with TPA and PQFT respectively. Some results are shown in Fig. 11
                        .

Using the criterion described in Section 6.2 for each frame in the video, Tables 2 and 3
                        
                         show that although the numbers of correct objects detected by TPA and PQFT are very close, TPA is always interested in the main target (the bear) and sometimes in birds, while PQFT almost does not keep eyes on the bear and it only pays attention to the birds, which are not the target we are always interested in. This experimental results show that TPA performs better than PQFT in video attention selection.

Psychological patterns are widely used in experiments to evaluate the performance of saliency maps [43,44]. Here we use some psychological patterns for feature pop-out, asymmetry search, conjunction search to compare TPA with PQFT.


                        Fig. 12
                         shows some psychological patterns and their PQFT and TPA saliency maps. The first and second images are salient in both color and orientation. TPA could find the targets, while PQFT only find the red bar but fail to detect the green bar. In the third image, both of the two models could detect the target. In the fourth and fifth images, the red dots are salient and arrestive, on which TPA pays more attention than PQFT.

In Fig. 13
                        , for clarity and keeping more details, we use input images with larger size (256*256). The first and second images give an example of asymmetry search. The target in the second image is a plus sign at the center of the image, which is surrounded by vertical bars. Both PQFT and TPA could find it. The last two images are examples of conjunction search. The target in the third image is a horizontal bar, and each model could notice it. In the last image, the orientations of bars are promiscuous. TPA salience maps are consistent with perception. For PQFT, even with no pop-out objects, some bars are more salient than others.

The psychological pattern experiments show that TPA could pop out the different features more obviously than PQFT, and PQFT sometimes notice salient locations in patterns where there is no pop-out feature. TPA saliency maps are more consistent with human’s perception and attention than PQFT.

TPA performs better than PQFT because we use a topological channel in TPA. The main difference between TPA and PQFT is that TPA has T (topological) channel. The other three channels of these two models are identical. Experimental results show that compared with PQFT, TPA topological channel makes salient regions move from edges to internal areas of objects.

Why does T channel play a more important role than other channels in TPA? The main reason is that T channel is a binary image, which only includes 0 or 1. While other channels are gray intensity images, in which every element is normalized to [0,1]. TPA gets saliency maps from the spectrum. That only 0 or 1 exists in T channel produces a larger division than other channels, which makes stronger spectrum than others. It makes T channel stronger in saliency maps. This corresponds to the topological perception theory. According to topological perception theory, topological perception is prior to perception of local feature properties. In visual process, global perception determined by topology is the basis of local geometrical properties perception. Topological perception based on physical connectivity occurs earlier than the perception of local geometrical properties [12,13]. This means topological perception is important in visual attention and connectivity is very important in topological perception. It accords with the topology theory that T channel implements connectivity in TPA model.

Because the influence of topological channel is very strong in TPA, sometimes the saliency map concentrates too heavily on edges. We could reduce this phenomenon by decreasing the weight of topological channel. On Bruce dataset, reducing the weight of topological channel from 1.0 to 0.0 with the step 0.1, we can obtain the optimal weight (0.4) of topological channel by using the criterion of human eye fixation predication.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A bottom-up attention selection model called TPA we proposed in this paper uses the connectivity of topological property and quaternion to produce attention saliency maps. Connectivity expressed by Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter improved the quality of spatio-temporal saliency maps, which accords with the real attention selection better than PQFT. Using TPA in video processing and psychological patterns also produces excellent results too. We will improve TPA with more topological properties besides connectivity and expand its application. In addition, we could use more biologically-plausible motion model in motion channel in the future work.
