@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  Thermoregulatory models have been used in the military to quantify probabilities of individuals' thermal-related illness/injury. The uses of the models have diversified over the past decade. This paper revisits an overall view of selected thermoregulatory models used in the U.S. military and provides examples of actual practical military applications: 1) the latest military vehicle designed with armor and blast/bulletproof windows was assessed to predict crews' thermal strains levels inside vehicles under hot environment (air temperature [T
                     a]: 29–43 °C, dew point: 13 °C); 2) a military working dog (MWD) model was developed by modifying existing human thermoregulatory models with canine physical appearance and physiological mechanisms; 3) thermal tolerance range of individuals from a large military group (n = 100) exposed to 35 °C/40% relative humidity were examined using thermoregulatory modeling and multivariate statistical analyses. Model simulation results assist in the decisions for the strategic planning and preventions of heat stress.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Military operations are widely dispersed across the globe to areas such as Africa, the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Pacific regions, and throughout domestic and extended territories (Department of Defense, 2004; Nevola et al., 2010). One of the major challenges the military faces is sustainment of missions in diverse environment and operational situations. For instance, soldiers working in a battlefield often wear body armor and use vehicles (e.g., High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle [HMMWV], etc) in hot-dry weather (e.g., Iraq air temperature: ∼50 °C/dew point 13 °C). Under these extreme conditions, soldiers experience heat stress and are at inherently higher risk of thermal-related illnesses/injuries. Various strategies/guidelines have been developed to reduce the risk of heat illness for military personnel including early morning/late night patrols, the usage of personnel cooling systems, appropriate hydration, and heat acclimation prior to deployment (Department of the Army and Air Force, 2003; Epstein et al., 2012). However, methods are needed to quantify the effectiveness of these strategies in improving military personnel's ability to sustain their operations. An actual experimental method to replicate military working conditions can be ideal to verify if the strategies/guidelines are up-to-date (Nevola et al., 2004, 2010; Amos et al., 2000). However, this verification method can be costly and time-consuming and it is difficult to replicate or consider all possible military operational and environmental situations.

Considering the above problem, human thermoregulatory models are being developed in the military. They variously predict physiological responses of military personnel and the probabilities of thermal-related illnesses/injuries, estimate safe thermal work times, and predict the time available for successful rescue (Berglund et al., 2006; Kraning and Gonzalez, 1997; Pandolf et al., 1986; Xu and Werner, 1997; Yokota et al., 2008). Thermoregulatory models, consisting of series of biophysical processes and physiological control equations rationally integrated to represent the human thermal physiological mechanisms, can provide simulations of human thermo-physiological responses to various combinations of environmental and operational conditions. These simulations can be conducted repeatedly and efficiently at low cost and without risk to human test volunteers. The various models enable and facilitate equipment, clothing and their design and mission planning to reduce heat illness related risks.

Thermoregulatory models developed over the years include pioneering work (Gagge et al., 1986; Stolwijk and Hardy, 1966; Stolwijk, 1970; Werner and Buse, 1988; Wissler, 1964) and more modern successors including sophisticated models to represent detailed human body parts and models adaptable for different individuals exposed to various environments (Berglund et al., 2009; Fiala et al., 1999; Haslam and Parsons, 1987; Havenith, 2001; Li et al., 2008; Shitzer et al., 1997; Tanabe et al., 2002; Tikuisis et al., 1988; Xu et al., 2011; Yokoyama et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2001). However, utilization of these models to solve practical problems in working environments is infrequently reported. The purpose of this paper is to describe basic overviews of thermoregulatory models used by the US military together with examples of their usage and applications. The ultimate goal of the US military for utilizing thermoregulatory models is to prevent thermal-related illness/injury, promote occupational safety, sustain operations, and maximize the physical performance of military personnel.

@&#METHODS@&#

Thermoregulatory models are mathematical representations of the human, rationally constructed from physiology, heat transfer and thermodynamic principles. Generally, the models' inputs such as environmental conditions (e.g., air temperature [T
                        a], thermal radiation, relative humidity [RH], wind speed [WS]), clothing characteristics (e.g., insulations [clo], water vapor impermeability), anthropometrics (e.g., height, weight, age, %body fat), and activities (e.g., metabolic costs) of subjects are combined to derive physiological outputs (e.g., core temperature [T
                        c], skin temperature [T
                        sk], sweat rates, heart rates [HR]) from appropriate heat, energy and moisture balances on lumped parameter parts of the modeled anatomy.

                         is the rate of the mechanical work; R is the rate of radiative heat loss; C is the rate of convective heat loss; K is the rate of conductive heat loss; E is the rate of evaporative heat loss; and Res is respiratory heat loss. The driving forces for dry or sensible heat transfer values (R, C, K) are the temperature differences between skin and the environment. The driving force for evaporative respiratory, sweating and vapor diffusion through skin processes are the vapor pressure differences between the environment and the surfaces. These heat transfer values depend on the physical properties and heat transfer process relationships for the situation and surface. When the environmental temperature approaches or is higher than T
                        sk, dry heat transfer becomes zero or negative and evaporative heat transfer becomes the only avenue for the human body to dissipate heat. Heat production reflects the activity/exercise level and can be quantified or estimated by various methods. For instance, ASHRAE (2009) provides the list of typical metabolic rates for various activities. Givoni and Goldman (1971), Pandolf et al. (1977) and Santee et al. (2003) established equations to estimate the metabolic cost of soldiers involved in load carriage, different topography, and mechanical work in the field. These quantitative relationships/equations are commonly utilized in the US military for metabolic estimates to this day. Berglund (1977) developed a metabolic rate equation for metabolic cost estimates using ambient/operative temperature, working and resting HR and body surface area of subjects. The equation can be useful to more easily capture transient changes in energy expenditure influenced by activities, clothing, environment, and load carriage.

The human body is often simplified for modeling to a cylindrical shape to more easily obtain numerical solutions to Eq. (1). Some simpler models represent the human body as a cylinder consisting of only skin and core compartments (Gagge et al., 1986; Yokota et al., 2008). Other more complicated models represent the human body with one cylinder or multi-cylinders (e.g., head, torso, arms, legs, etc) consisting of core, muscle, fat, and skin layers (Kraning and Gonzalez, 1997; Stolwijk, 1970; Wissler, 1964; Xu and Werner, 1997). Thermoregulatory control actions such as vasoconstriction, vasodilation, sweat, and shivering metabolic heat production are generally proportional control types responding to differences between tissue temperatures and their thermally neutral thresholds, or set-points.

One of the US Army thermoregulatory models developed by Kraning and Gonzalez (1997) was constructed mainly for simulating heat stress conditions and responses. The human body is represented by a system of concentric cylinders consisting of six compartments or layers (i.e., core, muscle, fat, vascular skin, avascular skin, and blood).

                        D) = 1.8 m). Heat flow between compartments is passively conducted through tissue and actively transported by blood flows. Active regulatory systems (e.g., sweating, skin blood flow) are modeled as proportionally controlled by combinations of mean skin temperature (

                        c (Moran et al., 1998), was also implemented in this model. This index, representing the categorical scales between 0 (no/little PSI) and 10 (very high PSI), has been widely utilized in military physiological research (Hadid et al., 2008; Kenefick et al., 2011).

Another rational model used by the US Army is the six cylinder thermoregulatory model (SCTM) (Xu and Werner, 1997; Xu et al., 2005, 2011). The cylinders represent different parts of the human body (i.e., head, trunk, arms, hands, legs, and feet) with each cylinder consisting of concentric layers for core, muscle, fat, and skin. The integrated thermal signals to control physiological mechanism (e.g., blood flow, sweat) are composed of the weighted thermal inputs from thermal receptors at various sites distributed throughout the body. In order to maintain thermal homeostasis, thermoregulatory actions (i.e., vasomotor changes,

                        , and sweat production) are activated in response to differences between its set point and the integrated thermal signal received by the thermoregulatory controller. The SCTM is particularly useful for cold stress simulations and can predict the thermal status of humans in asymmetric environments such as partial water immersion, clothing, and regional cooling. The shivering metabolic heat production was calculated by a group of equations, including maximal shivering intensity (Mshiv; max), shivering fatigue, and shivering inhibition when T
                        c was below 32 °C. The primary shivering intensity (Mshiv; 1°) was estimated with T

Mshiv; max was determined by a linear equation of VO2max, body mass index, and age. The shivering fatigue is related to the relative shivering intensity, which is defined as Mshiv; 1°/Mshiv; max.

Unlike empirical models that can only be used within the ranges of the data on which the model was based, rational thermoregulatory mathematical models will generally work for a wider range of environmental and operational conditions. However, model validation is important to identify defects, improve the accuracies of predictions, and develop refined models for the future. In general, thermoregulatory models utilized for military purposes have been carefully validated with both laboratory and field studies (Cadarette et al., 1999; Gonzalez et al., 1997; Kraning and Gonzalez, 1997; Santee et al., 1999; Xu et al., 2005; Yokota et al., 2008).

Each thermoregulatory model has strengths and weaknesses for given applications. Haslam and Parsons (1987) and Parsons (2003) compared four thermoregulatory models with physiological data collected from various environmental (e.g., cool–hot, wind vs. no wind) and operational conditions (e.g., rest/work, clothed vs. semi-nude). Their conclusion was that models may predict differently even when the same environmental and operational conditions were given, and that none of the models was the best for all conditions. In part, algorithms or systems utilized in these models were suitable for certain environmental and operational mechanisms (Parsons, 2003). In addition, simple cylindrical models can produce useful predictions, but do not have a means of assessing physiology in some asymmetric environments. The more complex models provide more information on physiological predictions in different body parts including hands and feet although they require many inputs to run simulations (Fiala et al., 1999; Xu and Werner, 1997; Wissler, 1964) than simpler models (Gagge et al., 1986; Yokota et al., 2008). These complex models tend to predict physiological responses under consistent and controlled settings, rather than transient changes. However, the complex models may risk poor performance if vital inputs and/or measurements are missing or obtrusive (e.g., baseline core body temperature measurements), particularly when individuals are involved in prolonged field work, which introduces more uncontrollable confounding factors. Simpler models that require fewer and readily obtainable inputs can provide advantages for a field environment.

Innovative equipment and clothing are needed to ensure US military personnel can safely perform and sustain their work. However, the thermal effects on humans of new vehicles, clothing, and protective gear, including body armor, are common concerns for material development. Human thermoregulatory models have been used to assess the thermal burdens of footwear, vehicles, clothing, equipment, and protective clothing/equipment (O'Brien et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2008). The following example shows how a thermoregulatory model was used to assess human thermal responses within a HMMWV.

The current design of HMMWV, which includes armor and blast/bulletproof windows, increases the likelihood that crews will experience thermal strain inside vehicles under hot environmental conditions. Simulations using the Kraning and Gonzalez (1997) model were conducted to predict the thermal strain experienced by soldiers occupying a HMMWV under realistic meteorological and operational conditions. The detailed mechanisms of the Kraning and Gonzalez model were described in the Section 2.1. The model inputs for anthropometrics, clothing, and environmental conditions were set as follows: The soldiers were assumed to be heat acclimated and to have height, weight, and %BF values of 177 cm, 82 kg, 17%, respectively, representing a typical soldier in the 2004 US Army male database (Bathalon et al., 2004). For simulations, a soldier was clothed in an Army Combat Uniform ensemble (clo: 1.29) including T-shirt, green cotton socks, leather boots, Interceptor Body Armor, and a kevlar helmet, and was expected to operate the HMMWV (∼165 W work rate) for 300 min. Vehicle cabin T
                           a ranging from 85 °F (≈29 °C) to 110 °F (≈43 °C) was utilized for model simulations. The humidity level was set at a constant dew point of T
                           dp = 13 °C, similar to summer weather in Iraq (Weather Underground, 2011). A constant WS of 0.2 m s−1 inside the HMMWV was assumed. Mean radiant temperature was calculated based on a constant radiant load of 175 W m−2, radiant heat transfer coefficient, and clothing surface temperature approximately equivalent to T
                           a. Predicted T
                           c responses as a function of different vehicle cabin temperatures were compared.

Over the years, demands for customized thermoregulatory modeling to meet clients' needs have increased (e.g., the usage of personal cooling devices, or rescue strategies) (Berglund et al., 2006). Additionally, recent thermoregulatory custom modeling demands have expanded outside the exclusive realm of humans. For instance, military working dogs (MWDs) and their handlers often operate in harsh environments, where protection from toxic environments is needed during transportation, temporary housing and field work. For that purpose, prototypes of portable chemical biological protective (CBP) kennel covers and tents are being designed and developed to safely house MWDs. However, the added insulation/encapsulation associated with the CBP kennel covers and tents increases the likelihood of overheating.

The thermal physiological responses of the MWD inside a CBP kennel cover was estimated and assessed through systematic measurements of the heat transfer properties of the CBP enclosure, together with simulations by a custom thermo-physiological dog model (Berglund et al., 2009). The typical MWD, the Belgian Malinois (aka Belgian shepherd, 35 kg, 1.2-m long without tail), was modeled. The MWD in the model was treated like a small human with fur. The MWD model was derived from multiple existing human thermoregulatory models (Gagge et al., 1986; Kraning and Gonzalez, 1997; Yokota et al., 2008) that were modified with canine physiological mechanisms scaled to the Belgian Malinois using previous literature (Kanno, 1982; Meyer et al., 1989; Refinetti and Piccione, 2003; Schmidt-Nielsen et al., 1970). However, the MWD thermoregulatory system does not include eccrine sweating from the skin, but instead relies on panting for evaporative cooling from tongue, mouth, and upper respiratory area. As in humans, control of skin blood flow and shivering are proportional to deviations in T
                           c and T
                           sk from their respective set point temperatures. However, the normal T
                           c and T
                           sk of dogs in neutral thermal conditions are about 1.5 °C higher than those of the human (T
                           c = 36.8 °C; T
                           sk = 33.0 °C) (Kanno, 1982; Refinetti and Piccione, 2003). Thus, these set points were adjusted 1.5 °C higher for the MWD. Panting, which the dog uses in place of sweating, is different from any heat loss mechanism used by the human. It is a high frequency, small tidal volume respiratory motion and minimizes the metabolic energy needed to move the air in and out across the evaporating surfaces. Panting is implemented and controlled in the model at two constant air flow levels based on the elevation (Δ) of the dog's mean body temperature above its set point temperature (Meyer et al., 1989; Schmidt-Nielsen et al., 1970):

The thermal insulation of the MWD's fur depends on its thickness (Folk, 1974). Given a typical fur thickness of 10 mm on the back of the Belgian Malinois, the thermal resistance of fur = 3.19·(thickness/25.4) = 1.26 clo (0.195 °C m2 W−1) (Schmidt-Nielsen et al., 1970). The core compartment beneath the skin compartment of the MWD model generates all the metabolic energy and has a uniform temperature in T

For model simulations, a Malinois (Belgian shepherd) was resting inside a Chemical Biological Protective (CBP) kennel exposed to various outside air temperatures (T
                           a, 20–40 °C) with a constant low humidity (T
                           dp = 9 °C) and high 50% relative humidity. Predicted T
                           c of MWDs in different environmental conditions was compared.

Thermoregulatory models have traditionally been designed using a “one size fits all” approach to predict the physiology of the “average” sized person (Gagge et al., 1986; Stolwijk and Hardy, 1966; Stolwijk, 1970). However, more recent thermoregulatory models capture physiological responses to thermal stress on an individual basis (Havenith, 2001; van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2001). Most occupational populations consist of individuals with diverse body sizes and composition (Bathalon et al., 2004) and, consequently, the physiological responses of some individuals (e.g., body size and shape) within the population may differ from average responses (Bhambhani and Maikala, 2000; Duncan et al., 1995). Assessing the thermal responses of individuals with various body sizes and shapes is important for rescue purposes and to create safety guidelines for both civilian and military populations. The effects of individual physical characteristics on predicted heat casualty rates were examined using the combination of a principal component analysis (PCA) and a thermoregulatory model. PCA selects linear combinations of multiple variables to maximize variation (or information) of populations using new orthogonal principal component (PC) axes and summarizes the overall patterns of the multivariate distributions into simpler dimensions. Each PC axis contains an eigenvalue representing a magnitude of variance and corresponds to eigenvectors or distributions of variables. The detailed information of PCA is described elsewhere (Tatsuoka, 1988). For example, 100 male soldiers (height: 177 ± 7 [SD] cm; weight: 82 ± 12 kg; body fat: 17 ± 6%) with various anthropometrics (i.e., body size/shape), wearing fire resistance army combat uniform (clo: 1.28), walked at 1.34 m s−1 for 480 min while carrying different loads (0, 40 kg) in hot conditions (i.e., T
                           a = 35 °C; RH = 40%). What would the heat casualty rate and range of heat tolerance times look like for groups of soldiers? To answer this question, PCA was used to classify anthropometrics of these 100 individuals into primary somatic forms. Each individual classified with a somatic form was modeled for working situations described above using the SCTM (Xu and Werner, 1997). Heat tolerance times (i.e., the time to reach T
                           c of 39.5 °C) between different somatic groups were compared by load carriage, using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

                        Fig. 1
                         summarizes T
                        c responses using the Kraning and Gonzalez (1997) six-node model as a function of different vehicle cabin temperatures ranging between 29 and 43 °C. Overall, lower cabin temperatures allow soldiers to maintain lower T
                        c, thus they can remain longer in the HMMWV. Based on the T
                        c limit of 38.5 °C, representing 25% heat casualty from uncompensable heat stress (Sawka et al., 2001), soldiers are susceptible to heat illness at vehicle cabin temperatures above 35 °C (95 °F); thus, occupancy should be less than 300 min. Fig. 2
                         summarizes PSI levels predicted over time as a function of vehicle T
                        a. The PSI, calculated based on HR and T
                        c predicted from the model, rates on the five categorical strain levels (No/Little, Low, Moderate, High, Very high). A soldier's thermal work strain increases as vehicle T
                        a and occupancy time increase. When T
                        a < 35 °C, a standard soldier was able to maintain lower or moderate PSI levels for 300 min. However, at cabin temperature of 38, 41, and 43 °C, PSI values reach high levels within 174, 150 and 135 min, respectively. Thus, for longer duration assignments in vehicle conditions above 35 °C, microclimate cooling appears to be necessary to avoid heat illnesses and injuries.

                         displays T
                        c responses of a resting Belgian shepherd inside a CBP kennel exposed to various outside T
                        a (20–40 °C) at two humidity levels: a low humidity with a constant 9 °C T
                        dp and a constant higher 50% RH. Overall, the modeled resting MWD can regulate T
                        c well through panting when outside T
                        a ≤ 35 °C either inside or outside a kennel for more than half day. However, when outside T
                        a > 35 °C, dogs inside the kennel showed higher predicted T
                        c because of the protective kennel insulating effect to the outside environment. The measured thermal resistances to dry heat flow and to vapor heat flow from the kennel to outside were 0.13 °C W−1 and 0.26 Torr W−1, respectively. Overall, the kennel cover adds approximately 0.7 clo of insulations compared to dogs outside the kennel. The model simulation results also indicated that a low humidity and reducing fur thickness from 10 mm to 5 mm can significantly lower T
                        c. They were found to be particularly effective when T
                        a was greater than 35 °C. Further physical activities above resting can substantially increase metabolic heat production and T
                        c and can shorten safe stay times with T
                        a and T
                        dp increase.


                        Fig. 4
                         displays a two dimensional plot constructed from the results of PCA using anthropometry of 100 male soldiers. The PC patterns were developed based on the tabular values shown in Fig. 4. The PC1 (=X-axis) represents 60% of the total variation (=1.79/[1.79 + 1.01 + 0.2]*100, PCA Table) and corresponds to all positive loadings of variables in eigenvectors indicating overall size. The PC2 (=Y-axis), representing 34% (=1.01/[1.79 + 1.01 + 0.2]*100) of total variability, corresponds to dichotomous body shape in eigenvectors such as “tall–fat” versus “short–lean.” Thus, the two dimensional plot, explaining 94% of total variability was identified with five different somatic forms including tall–fat (TF), tall–lean (TL), short–fat (SF), short–lean (SL) and medium (MED) individuals. When individuals were located within a 25% ellipse from a centroid, they were classified as MED. When individuals were located outside the ellipse, they were classified into TF, TL, SF, or SL, depending on the equal quadrant boundaries constructed from grade 45° to the PC1 and PC2 axes (pc2 axis/sin45°; pc1 axis/cos45°). Table 1
                         shows a descriptive summary of height, weight, and %BF for five different somatic forms derived from PCA.

Using the SCTM model (Xu et al., 2011) described in Section 2.1, predicted heat tolerance times (T
                        c < 39.5 °C) were compared as functions of operational conditions and somatic forms. Table 2
                         summarizes differences in heat tolerance time among somatic forms for different loads carried (0, 40 kg) in 35 °C/40% RH condition. Without load carriage, overall, lean groups (i.e., SL, TL) and medium individuals could be active longer than fat individuals (SF, TF). Particularly, the heat tolerance time of TF individuals was significantly shorter than the rest of the groups (p < 0.05). Having low %BF (i.e., lean groups) and higher body surface area per mass (i.e., lean and medium groups) allows these individuals to dissipate heat more easily than fat individuals in this case. Conversely, when they were carrying heavy loads and working in the heat, light weight individuals (i.e., SL) could work significantly shorter than individuals with heavier body weight (i.e., TF, TL, SF, MED, p < 0.05). Carrying a given heavy load increased the physiological strain on individuals with light body weight, and produced more heat production per body surface area (W m−2) than those with heavy body weight. The model simulation results showed that the risk of becoming a heat casualty varied by operational heat stress and individual body size and composition for given environmental conditions. Thus this type of analysis can provide the tolerance range of individuals working as a military unit exposed to similar heat stressful conditions.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This paper provided examples of applications of thermoregulatory models in a variety of US military situations. Using thermoregulation model simulations saves time and money in comparison to more cumbersome human testing. Prototypes can be evaluated during early phases of product development, providing designers the opportunities to understand various thermal impacts of their design on human physiological responses. Thermoregulatory model simulations can provide physiological predictions of individuals in combinations with various environmental and operational stressful situations allowing for better understanding of tolerance ranges and performance levels. This is especially applicable for extreme conditions in which human studies are nearly impossible to conduct due to health, safety, and ethical concerns.

Overall, the trend over the past decade is for thermoregulatory modeling to become diversified in the US military. Models evolved from simple predictions of human physiological responses to prototype clothing and equipment, to custom modeling for unique situations, and estimation of survival time for individuals in thermally stressful work and accident situations. In addition, recent thermoregulatory models have been applied to real-time or near-term future predictions of physiological status using wearable physiological monitoring devices (Buller et al., 2013; Gribok et al., 2010; Yokota et al., 2008) to sustain operation and safety of military personnel. These real-time models tend to utilize fewer inputs for predicting physiological outcomes, and the recent real-time prediction algorithms (Buller et al., 2013; Gribok et al., 2010) were designed primarily to focus on predicting T
                     c using filtering methods of data over time. For instance, T
                     c prediction algorithms were developed based on a combination of a Gaussian distribution of changes in T
                     c over time and a Kalman filter technique capturing the relationship between HR and T
                     c (Buller et al., 2013). Another T
                     c algorithms feature “ahead of time predictions” using data filtering/smoothing method integrated with autoregressive model to “train” individual's T
                     c “habits” or patterns (Gribok et al., 2010). These algorithms allow for more dynamic and situational relevant use of information. Real-time physiological monitoring allows not only individual access to health state information but, with network connections leadership and medical staff, can also have remote access to the physiological status of deployed military personnel. Thus, real-time and predicted physiological responses assist medics and leaders by providing situational awareness, better understanding of thermal safety, guidelines and decision-making guidance, and powerful tools for rescue planning and tailored logistic support.

Thermoregulatory models also can be extended to animals, particularly to working dogs. The increased demand for working dogs has spread to occupational fields across military, law enforcement, border patrol, and search-and-rescue (SAR) (Slensky et al., 2004; Taylor, 2009). Working dogs are used widely within the US as well as deployed overseas. While working in inhospitable environments, dogs may experience dehydration, weight loss, heat exhaustion, and even heat stroke (Slensky et al., 2004; Taylor, 2009). Thermoregulatory modeling can be used to estimate thermal strain levels of working dogs, and thus provide dog handlers with a better understanding of how to prevent or manage thermal strain and health illnesses/injuries in canines, and to sustain their operations.

Thermoregulatory models are commonly evaluated by comparing with measured physiology. As mentioned earlier, models have pros and cons for the usage and applications, which affects accuracies in predictions. The accuracies in models are often referred as a root mean square deviation, a standard deviation, observational comparisons with measured physiology, or selected values which are reasonable for authors (Cadarette et al., 1999; Gribok et al., 2010; Gunga et al., 2008; Xu and Werner, 1997; Yokota et al., 2008). Thermoregulatory models utilized in the US military have been validated primarily in various military laboratory and field studies to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the models for further/constant improvement. This model-test-model approach is important because military operations constantly change (e.g., load carriage, weather, terrain, activity), and model assumptions or parameter sets established in the earlier versions of models may need to be adjusted. For instance, body mass and %BF in the US Army populations, on average, have increased over the years (Knapik and Reynolds, 2010). The default of anthropometric inputs in a model may need to be updated. Older versions of military thermoregulatory models were primarily designed for white male military populations. In contrast, current thermoregulatory models must consider utilizing women and minorities of the racially/ethnically diverse US Army population (Department of Army, 2008), particularly since gender-neutral standards will be considered in the near future operations of US Army (Robinson, 2013). Also, the existing thermoregulatory cold models were primarily designed for sedentary cold immersion, and thus they need to be improved for exercise in cold water as a part of military training and operations (Castellani et al., 2007). Another example is that the loads carried by military personnel increased on average from 30 kg during WWI to 40 kg during Operational Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2004 (Knapik and Reynolds, 2010). How does this increase in load carriage affect human physiology and military performance? Efforts to answer these types of questions are on-going, with constant development of advance technology, changes in anthropometric distributions and physiology in military populations, and more diversified operational conditions. Thus, it is important to balance the approaches of thermoregulatory modeling between development/improvement, and validation/verification, thus the usage/applications of the models are well-assured.

Finally, thermoregulatory modeling can be applied to assess thermal strain levels of civilian workers to prevent thermal injuries and illnesses, and to promote safety and more effective rescue planning and executions.
