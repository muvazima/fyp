               Abstract
               
                  The soft computing methods, especially data mining, usually enable to describe large datasets in a human-consistent way with the use of some generic and conceptually meaningful information entities like information granules. However, such information granules may be applied not only for the descriptive purposes, but also for prediction. We review the main developments and challenges of the application of the soft computing methods in the time series analysis and forecasting, and we provide a conceptual framework for the Bayesian time series forecasting using the granular computing approach. Within the proposed approach, the information granules are successfully incorporated into the Bayesian posterior simulation process. The approach is evaluated with a set of experiments on the artificial and benchmark real-life time series datasets.
