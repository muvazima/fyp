                  A novel global PID control scheme for nonlinear MIMO systems is proposed and implemented for a robot as study case, this scheme is called AWFPID from its adaptive wavelet fuzzy PID control structure. Basically, it identifies inverse error dynamics using a radial basis neural network with daughter RASP1 wavelets activation function; its output is in cascaded with an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter to prune irrelevant signals and nodes as well as to recover a canonical form. Then, online adaptive fuzzy tuning of a discrete PID regulator is proposed, whose closed-loop guarantees global regulation for nonlinear dynamical plants. The wavelet network includes a fuzzy inference system for online tuning of learning rates. A real-time experimental study on a three degrees of freedom haptic interface, the PHANToM Premium 1.0A, highlights the regulation with smooth control effort without using the mathematical model of the robot.
