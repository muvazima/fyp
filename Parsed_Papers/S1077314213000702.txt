                  In this work we present an improvement to the popular Active Appearance Model (AAM) algorithm, that we call the Multiple-Levelset AAM (MLA). The MLA can simultaneously segment multiple objects, and makes use of multiple levelsets, rather than anatomical landmarks, to define the shapes. AAMs traditionally define the shape of each object using a set of anatomical landmarks. However, landmarks can be difficult to identify, and AAMs traditionally only allow for segmentation of a single object of interest. The MLA, which is a landmark independent AAM, allows for levelsets of multiple objects to be determined and allows for them to be coupled with image intensities. This gives the MLA the flexibility to simulataneously segmentation multiple objects of interest in a new image.
                  In this work we apply the MLA to segment the prostate capsule, the prostate peripheral zone (PZ), and the prostate central gland (CG), from a set of 40 endorectal, T2-weighted MRI images. The MLA system we employ in this work leverages a hierarchical segmentation framework, so constructed as to exploit domain specific attributes, by utilizing a given prostate segmentation to help drive the segmentations of the CG and PZ, which are embedded within the prostate. Our coupled MLA scheme yielded mean Dice accuracy values of .81, .79 and .68 for the prostate, CG, and PZ, respectively using a leave-one-out cross validation scheme over 40 patient studies. When only considering the midgland of the prostate, the mean DSC values were .89, .84, and .76 for the prostate, CG, and PZ respectively.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Statistical Shape Models (SSMs) use shape information to yield an accurate, shape constrained, segmentation of an object of interest, and are extremely popular in medical image segmentation [1–6]. A common SSM methodology is the Active Appearance Model (AAM) segmentation algorithm [7]. AAMs attempt to learn both the appearance, and the shape, of an object of interest. In addition, AAMs aim to learn the relationship between the shape and appearance. When using an AAM to segment a new image, the appearance of the new image is matched to the AAM, and the associated shape yields a segmentation of the object of interest.

AAMs achieve this by performing principal component analysis (PCA) on a set of intensities defining the object of interest to yield a low dimensional intensity projection. The intensity projections are then concatenated with the shape information, and PCA is performed a second time. The eigenvectors resulting from the second “coupled” PCA define the linear relationship between shape and appearance. Thus a given coupled projection defines both shape and appearance, and can be used to reconstruct the high dimensional intensity and shape information. However, traditional AAMs define the shape by a set of Cartesian coordinates defined from the landmarks of a single object. Yet there are several issues with using landmarks to construct statistical shape models,
                           
                              1.
                              A large number of anatomical landmarks are required to accurately capture shape variations.

Anatomical landmarks must be accurately aligned and landmark correspondences must be established on all training images [8].

Automated method for landmark detection and alignment can be prone to errors [9].

Landmarks require triangulation, and the triangulation algorithm may be prone to errors [10].

Leventon et al. [11] first proposed performing PCA on a series of signed distance maps (levelsets) to capture shape variations, to overcome the issues with landmark based SSMs. A levelset is defined as a set of positive values at every pixel outside the object of interest, and a set of negative values at every pixel inside the object of interest. Therefore, a value of 0 would represent the surface of the object. The simplest way to compute a levelset is at each pixel in the image, calculate the Euclidean distance to the closest border pixel, and negate that value if the pixel values within the object of interest. To define multiple levelsets, the signed distance to the border of each object is computed.

Tsai et al. [12] concatenated the levelsets of multiple objects prior to performing PCA, essentially “coupling” the levelsets. Hence a single set of low dimensional values (a “projection”) is used to represent the shape of multiple objects. This allows for simultaneous segmentation of multiple objects. In addition, coupling the individual SSMs allows one to take advantage of the inherent dependency between the spatial location of multiple adjoining organs. The technique used by Tsai et al. [12] was in 2D, and the SSMs included not just shape, but also pose information. Akhondi-Asl and Soltanian-Zadeh [13] developed a coupled SSM in 3D, which only accounted for shape variations (but not pose) by first aligning the training shapes. Akhondi-Asl and Soltanian-Zadeh [13] then explored whether coupling the SSMs actually improved segmentation accuracy over simply constructing individual SSMs. It was found that in most cases, shape coupling improves results only when the levelsets were first aligned prior to training.

In this work, we present a new 3D AAM framework which is landmark-free, and which can segment multiple objects simultaneously in a new image via coupling multiple levelsets. Our model, the multiple levelset AAM (hereafter denoted as MLA) uses multiple coupled level sets to model the 3D shapes, thereby helping to alleviate many of the issues facing traditional landmark-based AAMs. The MLA offers the advantage of (1) not having to deal with the landmark identification problem and (2) not having to triangulate a series of landmarks to generate a 3D model. In addition, we take a similar approach to that proposed by Leventon et al. [11] and Akhondi-Asl and Soltanian-Zadeh [13], in that multiple levelsets are coupled to allow for simultaneous segmentation of multiple objects.

Previous work in coupling multiple levelsets involved concatenating the high dimensional levelsets of multiple objects [12,13]. Yet this can be computationally infeasible when dealing with (a) multiple levelsets, (b) a large number of training images, or (c) very large images. To overcome these issues, the MLA performs PCA on each shape, prior to coupling the levelsets, similar to how AAMs perform PCA on the intensities prior to coupling.

In addition, the MLA can also use existing segmentations of one or more organs to generate more accurate segmentations of the adjacent organs (for example using the prostate segmentation to simultaneously segment the bladder and rectum [14]). This is accomplished by generating the coupled projections using both intensities and levesets, whereas prior AAM models are only able to consider intensity information [7].

This approach also allows the MLA to be used hierarchically, in which one object can first be segmented, and then used to drive the segmentations of other embedded objects. For example, in the case of prostate MRI, the central gland (CG) and peripheral zone (PZ) are substructures of the prostate itself (see Fig. 1
                        ). Using an existing prostate segmentation to segment the CG and PZ reduces the search space, which can help hone in on the embedded substructures within the gland. In addition, the coupled model allows for structural linking of the adjoining sub-structures, thereby permitting incorporation of anatomic constraints.

Our MLA is applied to the task of prostate segmentation from endorectal, 3 Tesla, T2-weighted (T2-w) MR images. The prostate gland consists of internal structures including the peripheral zone (PZ), central zone (CZ), and transition zone (TZ), where the latter two structures are jointly referred to as the central gland (CG) [15] (see Fig. 1). While most tumors are found in the PZ, tumors can also be found in the CG, and CG tumors can have drastically different appearance than PZ tumors [16–18]. In the PZ (where most cancers are found), tumors are typically chacterized by hypointense regions on MRI images, in stark contrast to the usually hyperintense PZ regions. However, in the CG, tumors are typically noticeable due to their homogeneous texture, as compared to the traditionally hetergeneous texture in the CG. In recent years, several computer aided detection (CAD) systems have been developed for detecting tumors from prostate MRI imagery [19–25]. Since the tumors in the PZ can appear dramatically different from tumors in the CG, CAD systems would invariably benefit from knowing where each internal prostate structure was located. In addition, treatment options can even be tailored to an individual patient, as CG tumors have been found to be significantly less aggressive compared to PZ tumors [26].

However, most extant prostate segmentation systems only consider the prostate capsule boundary [6,27–32]. Makni et al. [33] developed a system for distinguishing the internal prostate structures on multiparametric MRI, but assumed the prostate is already segmented. Additionally Makni et al. [33] required the use of both T2-w and DCE-MRI to drive the segmentation, as opposed to just a single protocol; imaging with additional parameters (over and above standard T2-w) leads to an increased imaging time and hence cost of exam. Liu and Yetik [25] circumvented the issue of zonal segmentation within the prostate by proposing a spatially aware CAD system for cancer detection, to automatically identify in which part of the prostate the tumor was located.

In this work, we aim to use our MLA to automatically and simultaneously segment the prostate, PZ, and CG from T2-weighted MRI alone. As with Liu and Yetik [25], our ultimate goal is to develop a spatially aware CAD system for prostate cancer detection, but by leveraging the explicit, automated segmentations of the different prostate zones. A second application is to create patient-specific treatment models based on the zonal location of the tumor.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology for training the MLA and using the MLA to segment a new image. Section 3 describes the experimental design and dataset. Section 4 presents the results. A brief discussion is presented in Section 5, while Section 6 presents concluding remarks and future directions.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

The MLA is comprised of distinct training and segmentation steps, which are summarized as follows. To train the MLA, a series of levelsets is first calculated, where negative values represent pixels inside the object, and positive values represent pixels outside the object. PCA is first performed on a set of image intensities and levelsets from multiple training images, resulting in a set of low dimensional intensity and levelset projections [34]. Coupling of the levelsets is achieved by performing PCA a second time on a concatenation of these projections [34].

In the segmentation phase, the intensities of a new image are used to drive the segmentations of the objects of interest. In addition, the MLA framework allows for one or more pre-segmented objects to help drive the segmentation of other objects in the new image. The first step of the MLA is to affinely transform the input intensities and levelsets. These transformations will be used to align the new image with the MLA. After transforming the inputs, a set of low dimensional projections of the inputs (intensities and, optionally, levelsets) are calculated using the trained MLA. The matrix of coupled eigenvectors is then used to reconstruct the high dimensional set of transformed image intensities, and levelsets for all objects in the image. The transformation for which the reconstructions are best correlated with the inputs is then calculated. Given the optimal transformation, the high dimensional levelsets of all objects are reconstructed and thresholded, yielding a set of segmentations for all objects in the image.


                        Fig. 2
                         shows the entire segmentation process on a new image. A comparison between the MLA with a traditional AAM and the coupled levelsets proposed by Tsai et al. [12] is shown in Fig. 3
                        . Traditional AAMs couple intensities with landmarks, and traditional coupled levelsets involve concatenating a set of levelsets, which can be computationally infeasible. The MLA, by comparison, allows for coupling of the projections of multiple levelsets with the intensity projections, essentially allowing simultaneous segmentations in an AAM framework. This helps to avoid the computational cost of concatenating a series of high dimensional levelsets.

Eq. (6) must be optimized to determine the set of affine parameters for which the NCC is maximized. This is a crucial step, since the working hypothesis is that the NCC will be maximized if and only if the MLA is properly aligned with the new image, and hence the reconstruction will properly capture the desired segmentations. A global optimization is first performed, followed by a local optimization to properly hone in on the maximum NCC. To perform the global optimization, an initialization-biased particle swarm optimizer [36] is used, in which 100 random affine parameters (100 particles) are each allowed to converge independently on the maximum NCC, and the particle with the maximum NCC overall is chosen. Then, a local Powell optimization [37] is performed, in which each of the 12 affine parameters is optimized independently. This process of optimizing each parameter independently is repeated until convergence, thus driving the transformations to the maximum NCC value.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

Our data consists of 40 prostate endorectal MR images, acquired using T2-weighting protocol and a 3.0 Tesla coil. Each image was 512×512pixels in the x, y directions with a variable number of slices. The prostate capsule, PZ, and CG boundaries were manually segmented in 3D by an expert radiologist using the 3D Slicer software [38–40]. The raw data for each study was preprocessed to normalize the intensities and remove the bias field [41]. In addition, the variance of each levelset and each intensity image was normalized to a value of 1. Due to the fact that MR imagery of the prostate is used for staging of prostate cancer in the US, and not for screening, all 40 studies have biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer present. A full description of our dataset and associated parameters is shown in Table 2

The MLA was implemented in C++ using the ITK framework [42]. The MLA was run on a machine with 8cores (each 2.67GHz) and 32GB of memory running Debian Linux, compiled using GCC (version 4.7.1). The segmentation process was performed in a multi-resolution fashion, with P

                        ≈107 in the finest resolution. Segmenting the prostate, CG, and PZ on a 140mm×140mm×140mm image took approximately 200s. For all experiments, α
                        =0.95 was used, similar to [7].

Two specific categories of experiments were performed: non-hierarchical experiments (E
                        1,
                        E
                        3,
                        E
                        5) and hierarchical experiments (E
                        2,
                        E
                        4,
                        E
                        6). The non-hierarchical experiments used only the imaging information to simultaneously segment the prostate, CG, and PZ. Therefore, for K
                        =∅, as only the intensities were used to segment the objects. The hierarchical experiments used the imaging information, as well as the known segmentation of the prostate, to segment the CG and PZ, and thus K
                        ={Prostate}. Due to the fact that CG and PZ are embedded within the prostate itself, using a segmentation of the prostate boundary forces the MLA to only consider the desired region of interest. This is also similar to the approach taken in [33], which assumed the prostate was already segmented prior to segmenting the PZ and CG.

For both the hierarchical experiments and the non-hierarchical experiments, both a leave-one-out cross validation, and a 30-run, 5-fold cross validation were performed. For the leave one out experiments (E

                                    C
                                 
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                              
                           
                        , the MLA was trained using the other 39 studies. For each run of 5-fold cross validation experiments (E
                        3
                        −
                        E
                        6), the dataset was randomly split into five groups of eight studies per group. Each study in a given group was segmented using an MLA trained from the 32 studies in the other four groups, resulting in a segmentation for each study. This was repeated 30 times, resulting in 30 segmentations for each study. The goal of the cross validation experiment is to determine the generalizability of the MLA to different training sets, by determining how well each study was segmented given different training sets, and the variance of the results over the various training sets.

This was done due to poor boundary contrast in the base and apex of the prostate, preventing accurate segmentations in these regions.

The cross validation experiments resulted in 30 values for each of the 40 studies (1200 total values). Experiments E

To determine the generalizability over different training sets, the median value was computed over the 40 values for each run. The results over the 30 different median values (1 for each run) are presented as E

@&#RESULTS@&#

The quantitative results for the prostate, CG, and PZ for experiments E
                     1 through E
                     6 are shown in Fig. 6
                     . The segmentation of the capsule boundary resulted in a mean DSC accuracy of 0.81, and a mean MAD value of 1.8mm. When only considering the midgland of the prostate, the mean DSC value for the prostate increased to 0.89, reflecting the tapering off of the gland towards the base and apex.

The hierarchical segmentation results E
                     2, in which it is assumed that the prostate segmentation already exists, as in [33], resulted in a mean DSC value of 0.79 for the CG, and 0.68 for the PZ, with mean MAD values of 1.4mm and 1.0mm for the CG, and PZ, respectively. When only considering the midgland, the mean DSC values were 0.84, and 0.76 for the CG and PZ, respectively. However, when only using the imaging information (non-hierarchical experiment E
                     1), the mean DSC values for the CG and PZ were 0.72 and 0.60 respectively.

Qualitative results from two studies are shown in Figs. 7 and 8
                     
                     . The region in green represents the ground truth segmentations and red represents the segmentation results. The DSC values for the prostate, CG, and PZ, were .88, .86, and .76 respectively in Fig. 7. The DSC values for the prostate, CG, and PZ, were .90, .71, and .73 respectively in Fig. 8.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The closest related work is [33], which reported mean DSC values of 0.89 and 0.80 for the CG and PZ segmentations respectively on multi-spectral (T2-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced), 1.5 Tesla prostate MRI. When using the ground truth prostate segmentations to drive the CG and PZ segmentations, similar to [33], resulted in DSC accuracies of 0.79 and 0.68 for the CG and PZ for the MLA. However, it should be noted that those reported DSC values in [33] were from a combined STAPLE segmentation of three expert ground truths. When considering only one of the ground truths in [33], the mean DSC values decreased to 0.82 and 0.71 respectively. This is a more appropriate and fairer comparison to the results presented in this work, and also reflects the difficulty of getting accurate expert segmentations for the CG and PZ from prostate MRI. In addition, the data used in [33] contained 31 studies (as compared to the 40 we employed in this study).

Moreover, the algorithm in [33] was specifically designed to intelligently take into account data from multiple modalities such as T1 contrast enhanced and diffusion weighted images, to complement the T2-weighted MR imagery. This allowed the algorithm to extract more accurate CG and PZ boundaries by leveraging additional information that may not be present in T2-weighted MRI. It is not clear how well the algorithm in [33] would perform if only T2-weighted MRI images were available (as in the current dataset). In addition, it is also unclear how well the MLA would perform if other MRI protocols were used in addition to, or instead of, T2-weighted intensities, so a direct comparison is difficult. However, it is important to note that while T2-weighted MRI is routinely performed at all sites where prostate MRI is performed, multi-parametric MRI is only done in a subset of those imaging facilities. Hence our algorithm could be employed on data from a larger number of centers.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exploring a fully automated CG and PZ segmentation algorithm, as [33] only reported results using the ground truth prostate segmentations as the inputs to the algorithm.

In all the cases, the 5-fold cross validation experiments performed worse than the leave-one-out experiments, mainly due to the 20% fewer studies used to train the MLA (32 versus 39 training studies), suggesting the need for a large training cohort. However, the median DSC and MAD values between cross validation runs were remarkably consistent, suggesting very little variance between different training sets.

In this work we present a Multi-Levelset AAM (MLA), which offers several unique improvements over the traditional AAM algorithm. The use of anatomical landmarks, which can be prone to errors, is completely eliminated by casting the MLA shape model in a levelset framework. The MLA is able to couple multiple levelsets with image intensities efficiently and intelligently, to offer a coupled model resulting in simultaneous segmentations of multiple objects. The MLA presented uses the image intensities, as well as existing segmentations, to drive the simultaneous segmentations of multiple objects. This is accomplished using knowledge of the shapes of various objects, and how those shapes correlate with intensities.

The algorithm was tested on 40 T2-weighted, 3D, endorectal, 3.0Tesla, prostate MRI images containing ground truth segmentations of the prostate, central gland (CG), and peripheral zone (PZ). Most existing prostate segmentation algorithms only segment the prostate boundary, and yet CG and PZ segmentations are critical for cancer detection and treatment planning. Future work will entail determining quantitatively how the presence and extent of disease affects the MLA.

When using the intensities and known prostate segmentations, mean DSC values of 0.79 and 0.68 were reported for the CG and PZ, respectively. We believe that with more training instances, and with inclusion of multi-parametric data, the segmentation results could be further refined. Overall, the MLA framework is a generalized extension to the AAM segmentation algorithm, and can be used to accurately and automatically segment multiple objects.
