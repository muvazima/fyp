                  In recent years, the popularity of smart phones has boomed the emergence of wearable devices like wristband, smart watch, and sport watch since these devices are portable to record human body information, synchronize information with smart phones, and conduct real-time monitoring of physical condition. However, a recent survey indicates that near 70% respondents are not interested in buying Apple's new iWatch although the marketplace is full of competing alternatives like Samsung's Gear fit, LG's G watch, and Sony's SW3. In this study, a novel framework combining multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), association rule mining (ARM), with K nearest neighbor (KNN) is proposed to help brand companies address the following issues: (1) using MCA to explore the latent relationships between users' demographic profiles, user perceptions of design attributes, and user preferences for wearable devices, (2) using ARM to identify key design attributes that can best configure a specific alternative to achieve effective product differentiation (positioning), (3) using KNN to accomplish efficient product selection (recommendation). More importantly, hundreds of consumers are surveyed to justify the validity of the presented framework.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years, market growth in smartphones is slow and becoming more and more flattening [25,26]. Suppose you live in the developed country (i.e. West Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific regions), the future of smart phones is all about “upgrades” because people have already owned at least one by now. In contrast, wearable devices like smart watches, smart glasses, and wristbands are capturing much more eyes than before [24]. One of the most critical reasons is nothing but portability, especially in a hand-free user interface [6]. However, Google decided to terminate selling its smart glasses because of considering security, safety, and invasion of privacy. Although BI intelligence predicts an amount of over 30 billion in wearable devices can be reached before 2018 (see Fig. 1
                      
                     [29]), a recent marketing survey indicates that almost 70% respondents may not be interested in buying Apple's new iWatch (http://www.reuters.com). In fact, consumers are not willing to purchase a high-priced iWatch because smartphones have already replaced the conventional watches and the low-end digital cameras for many years [30].

Today, a smart watch is well accepted to be an important area to move forwards [19]. In practice, one of the most critical concerns is learning how to lock smart-watch users into the smart-phone platform. It is equivalent to lock people into using an operating system so that when it comes to an upgrade they will not desert your brand. That means, to enlarge a market share, a manufacturer may produce a watch that is compatible with Apple's iOS, Google's Android, and Microsoft's Windows. For instance, Sony, Samsung, and Apple attempt to provide smart watches to lock their existing smartphone users. In contrast, Nike and other sport brands attempt to deliver watches that work with handsets and major in fitness or health features. Meanwhile, Epson (Seiko) and Casio has already developed a variety of sport watches for many years and they can easily switch to this field. Similar to the war in smartphones, the key point to a brand company is creating something magical and delivering its fans something to brag about [21].

In order to hold the crown as a key innovator in the consumer-electronics, only upgrading existing products is absolutely insufficient to inspire dynamically changing consumers. Needless to say, it is tough for brand companies to survive in a globally customized economy although they are always planning and launching new products for acquiring diverse customers [7,17,18]. One of the best examples is like Apple's iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad series, which have been heralded as an “aesthetic” paradigm in industrial design. Obviously, the front-end aspects like user preferences or user perceptions are not only critical to stimulating product sales, but also influential to constructing a firm's product image [11,12,16].

Inspired by Fig. 2
                     , a novel framework is presented to bridge the research gaps between product customization, product differentiation, and product selection [14,15,22,24]. In particular, the latent relationships among user profiles, design attributes, and product alternatives are systematically explored. Without loss of generality, this study focuses on three wearable devices, such as wristband, smart watch, and sport watch. In brief, several critical issues are addressed as follows:
                        
                           •
                           What are the impacts of user profiles on user preferences for wearable devices?

What are the best portfolios of design features to configure various alternatives?

How to incorporate user perceptions of design features into product selection?

Furthermore, managerial insights are offered to assist product planners in planning next-generation wearable devices. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 overviews the concepts of product positioning (differentiation) and product recommendation (selection). The proposed framework integrating multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), association rule mining (ARM), with K nearest neighbor (KNN) is presented in Section 3. Section 4 illustrates a real example to develop user-driven wearable devices. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

New product development (NPD) defined as a process of transforming an identified market opportunity into profitable product(s) for sale, in which a firm could employ it to accomplish the goal of customization, differentiation, and commercialization [5]. In general, the market is full of diverse customers who differ in usage preferences, buying behaviors, demographic profiles, and psychographic backgrounds [11,17,27]. Typical variables commonly used for carrying out market segmentation include demographic variables (i.e. age, gender, race, and salary), psychographic variables (i.e. social class, lifestyle and user perception), and behavioral variables (i.e. user preference and usage pattern).

For simplicity, this study only takes user profiles and user perceptions (see Fig. 2 again) into account. Specifically, product customization can be defined as selecting or arranging portfolios of design attributes (DAs) so as to satisfy given customer needs. In order to tackle the trade-offs between controlling product varieties and satisfying heterogeneous customers, a “STP” approach (segmentation–targeting–positioning) is commonly adopted to help companies focus their limited resources on the ad-hoc niche segments.

In terms of strategic marketing, “positioning” refers to implementing a set of tactics to ensure that these characteristics can occupy a unique position in the minds of customers while “differentiation” means the creation of tangible or intangible characteristics in one or more dimensions between a firm's product and its main competitors' alternatives [13]. Optimal differentiation corresponds to determining which design attributes and associated levels should be configured in products to satisfy given customer requirements and to distinguish a product from existing alternatives, concurrently [12]. In simple words, product positioning is not what you do to a product but it is what you do to the prospect of customers. In practice, it is implemented through a series of steps: (1) visualizing competing alternatives and product features in a low-dimensional space, (2) constructing a predictive model to forecast how potential buyers will react to a marketing stimulus, and (3) determining the optimal position of new product (s) and identifying the niche segments [23,24].

To the best of our knowledge, typical schemes including multi-dimensional scaling and (MDS) and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) are commonly to visualize the complex relationships between design attributes and product alternatives. The objective of the MDS is to visualize the underlying relationships among objects (i.e. products, brands, or attributes) in a lower-dimensional (perceptual) space [4]. In order to display “design attributes” in a perceptual map, a multiple-regression technique is required to maximize the correspondence between an object's performance rating and an attribute's projected coordinates. Based on statistical Chi-square association, MCA is able to elicit the interdependences among respondents' profiles, design attributes, and product alternatives, simultaneously. Thus, MCA is adopted in this study and its details are described in Section 3.

Product recommenders' typical benefits include increasing the probability of cross-selling, consolidating customer loyalties, and attracting potential customers. Rapid advances in data mining technologies assist companies in gathering or analyzing customer profiles from various channels and providing decision supports on product selection and recommendation [14,15,26–28]. In general, content-based filtering (CB) and collaborative filtering (CF) are commonly applied to construct a recommender system. In simple words, CF is a method of making automatic prediction about the interests of a person by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the CF is that if a person A has the same opinion (likes or dislikes) as a person B on an issue (i.e. movie or TV program), A is more likely to have B's preference for another drama than a randomly-chosen person (Wikipedia). In contrast, CB is based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preference. A key problem with the CB is whether the recommender is able to learn user preferences from user's actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types.

Recently, a hybrid system is presented to build a model from a user's past behavior (items previously purchased, selected, and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. As indicated in Table 1
                        , numerous data-mining techniques are briefly compared and each method has its own strengths and weaknesses [2]. Apparently, most of the conventional schemes conduct product recommendation in a supervised way. That means, they are incapable to handle a scenario in which buying profiles or transaction records are insufficient or unavailable. However, as we know, it's very difficult to gather sufficient training samples when a new product is initially launched into the market [26]. Therefore, in order to elicit a quick view on user preferences, this study utilizes MCA to incorporate user profiles and user perceptions into the process of product selection.

A novel framework shown in Fig. 3
                      is presented to achieve product differentiation and product selection of three wearable devices, such as wristband, smart watch, and sport watch. In particular, user profiles and user perceptions are incorporated into the entire decision-making process. For convenience, the proposed framework is operated as follows:
                        
                           •
                           Initially, multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) is used to capture user profiles and user perceptions to form a basis of product differentiation,

Then, association rule mining (ARM) is employed to seek frequent itemsets for identifying core design attributes,

Lastly, K nearest neighbor (KNN) is conducted to justify the validity of product recommendation among three wearable devices.

In this study, MCA is conducted by using SPSS (statistical software) while ARM and KNN are implemented by using WEKA (free data-mining software).

MCA has been studied since the early 1970s to visualize the spatial relationships between rows (samples) and columns (categories of attributes). One of the most popular methods is QT3 (quantification theory ш) to analyze multivariate categorical data. The basic idea of QT3 is to give Y values to samples having similar responses on categories and to give X values to categories having similar responses on samples. If we project the rows and the columns of the original dataset in a two-dimensional plot, the sorting procedure becomes an estimation of x (weights of categories) and y (weights of samples) under the condition of maximizing the correlation between x and y. Furthermore, based on Pearson's Chi-square test, MCA tries to present the underlying structure of a contingency table [8]. If the total Chi-square is larger than a threshold, we conclude that the rows are significantly associated with the columns.

                         means column proportion. Based on assuming a normal distribution, Eq. (4) reveals that positive (negative) association significantly holds if the value is greater (less) than the threshold of 1.96 (minus 1.96).

ARM originated from affinity analysis is also called market basket analysis to examine the issue of “what goes with what”. A typical example comes from using bar-code scanners in supermarkets to automatically look for associations between purchased items, particularly in an implicit form of A
                        ⇒
                        B. In brief, the idea behind association rule is to examine all possible rules among items in terms of an “if-then” format, like the following question: If item A (antecedent) has been purchased, what is the possibility for item B (consequent) to be purchased later?

Although several algorithms have been proposed for generating frequent item sets, the most famous and classic algorithm is the Apriori algorithm presented by [1,10]. Basically, the key idea of this algorithm is using (k
                        −1) frequent item sets to generate k candidate item sets (the step of joining) and then dropping inappropriate sets (the step of pruning) after checking their critical measures. Note that the subsets of large itemset(s) are also frequent in reality and three common metrics (i.e., support, confidence and lift) are respectively defined for measuring association between the antecedent and the consequent:

In simple words, the “support” means that how frequent this portfolio occurs in the dataset for an alternative. In contrast, the confidence is equivalent to the conditional probability that measures the probability to predict the consequent given the antecedent has been captured in advance. Furthermore, the lift defined by the ratio of the observed support (intersect) to that expected tells us whether the antecedent and the consequent are independent (zero), positively correlated (above unity), or negatively correlated (below unity).


                        K nearest neighbor (KNN) belongs to one of the instance-based learning algorithms [20] and its concept is quite simple and straightforward. KNN assumes that all instances correspond to points located in the n-dimensional space like x

In recent years, the popularity of smart phones has substantially changed our society because of powerful capability in processing multimedia information and acting as a social-media carrier [3,25]. Although some experts argue that the social-media technology may detract from our face-to-face interactions with friends or colleagues, the wearable technology actually enhances our day-to-day lives [19]. Sony Inc. designed a wearable device which is compatible with most of the Android phones for displaying Twitter feeds, sending e-mails, and downloading MP3 music. Samsung also launched its galaxy watch and gear fit since 2013 to keep track of the trend in wearable devices. Nike or EPSON sport watches can track how many calories you are burning and also monitor your heart rate (similar to Casio's G-shock). If you are a cyclist or a runner, gathering real-time body information like heart-rate monitoring may be really fantastic. More interestingly, it could be updated and supported by numerous powerful apps without having to bog down the watch's storage drive [21].

As we know, the real power (wearable computing) of a portable device is in its ability to enhance consumers' user experiences [6]. We should understand that it does not matter what name the company decides to give a wearable device, the thing which matters is its product concepts. After reviewing the specifications of popular wearable devices and consulting the experienced industrial experts, Table 2–Table 4
                     
                     
                      demonstrate the details of the existing alternatives in the marketplace. In particular, specific DAs have been configured in these alternatives, such as A3, A7, and A8 for wristband, A7, A13, A15, and A16 for smart watch, and A2, A3, A7, and A8 for sport watch. In summary, the high-end features are concluded as follows:
                        
                           •
                           It should be connected with smart phones to update its information,

It should work like a media player for supporting entertainment,

It can be used to monitor human physical conditions (i.e. heart rate),

It can automatically track users' spatial positions for safety monitoring.

In order to enhance the reliability and validity of this survey, the questionnaires (see Table 5
                         and the Appendix A) were sent to not only end-consumers but also domain experts, such as industry engineers, outdoor sportsmen, and hospital doctors. Different from the past studies [24,26], user profiles, user perceptions and user preferences are concurrently collected and incorporated in this study. Initially, question 1 (How do you perceive of an attribute for configuring a specific alternative?) is used to elicit user assessments. After gathering user profiles and aggregating user perceptions and user preferences, MCA is employed to derive the signed Chi-square associations (see Table 6
                        ). Based on the assumption of a normal distribution, an attribute which association is greater than 1.96 is recognized as a “core” feature of a specific alternative. In Table 6, 498 respondents are surveyed to visualize the latent relationships between user profiles and product alternatives (also see Fig. 4–Fig. 7
                        
                        
                        
                        ).

It is observed that the female favors wristband while the male prefers smart watch and sport watch. If we look at the age-based segments, the “below 20” group is close to smart watch, the group between 20 and 29 is close to the sport watch, and the “above 40” group is close to wristband. This information provides a good basis for product planners to implement strategic STP marketing, namely, segmentation, targeting, and positioning. Similar explanations can be applied to the remaining variables, such as weekly exercise hours and weekly exercise frequencies. Furthermore, as described in Table 7
                        , user perceptions (the input of MCA) are processed to derive the signed Chi-square associations (the output of MCA) between 16 design attributes and wearable devices. For example, user perceptions of A1 are aggregated and explained as follows: 89.27% respondents think that A1 is important to wristband while only 59.39% for smart watch and 42.86% for sport watch.

The results of Table 7 can be transformed to a perceptual map to help market planners visualize core design attributes which can best configure the ad-hoc alternatives. As indicated by Fig. 8
                        , it is found that five features like A1 (sleeping pattern monitoring), A2 (pulse rate measuring), A3 (calorie consumption tracker), A4 (body temperature sensor), and A7 (pedometer) are perceived as highly important in developing the wristband. In contrast, A5 (audio recording), A6 (video recording), A11 (GPS tracking), A12 (phone answering), A13 (message reminding), A14 (music media), A15 (touch panel), and A16 (voice control) are favored by the smart watch. Finally, A2, A3, A7, A8 (odometer), A9 (speedometer), and A10 (barometer) are recommended for the sport watch. Very interestingly, three product features including A2, A3, and A7 are simultaneously recognized as “core” features in both wristband and sport watch.

Referring to Table 5 again, Question 2 (Which alternative will you consider to purchase?) is applied to capture users' product selection (decision labels) in a supervised manner. According to Eqs. (5)–(7), ARM (association rule mining) is adopted to seek the frequent and large itemsets which have significant support, confidence, and lift. In order to extract significant association rules (via the “Apriori” algorithm), the thresholds of the support, the confidence, and the lift are set by 0.2, 0.5, and 1.5, respectively. For instance, in Table 8
                        , rule 1's support is 0.21 for predicting “wristband”. That means that almost 133 samples can be extracted from the entire dataset to support this prediction rule. Compared to the unsupervised MCA, supervised ARM can be used to identify the optimal portfolios of DAs to best configure a wearable device. According to the concept of the ARM, the subsets of the frequent “large” itemset are still frequent. Thus, for the purpose of simplification, Table 8 merely lists the largest itemset to determine the optimal portfolio of DAs.

As it was mentioned in Table 1, integrating ARM with KNN is computationally efficient but powerful to conduct product recommendation. After key user profiles and core design attributes are selected, KNN (K
                        =7) is used to because of its maximal accuracy. Simply speaking, a user's selection among three wearable devices is determined by searching his/her 7 nearest samples. In addition, user profiles and user perceptions of DAs are treated as the antecedents (predictors) and user preferences for wearable devices (i.e. wristband, smart watch, and sport watch) are treated as the consequents. In order to justify the validity of the recommender, a confusion matrix is depicted in Table 9
                        . As you see, respondents' original choices among three alternatives are 231 for wristband, 261 for smart watch, and 140 for sport watch. Most of the predictive errors arise from misclassifying wristband into smart watch and low recognition rate of the sport watch.

On average, an overall accuracy (around 70%) seems to be satisfactory in practice. Specifically, it is found that the best is smart watch (81%). The worst is sport watch (59%) since it is wrongly classified into either smart watch or wristband. Here, only user perceptions of DAs are required as predictors to achieve a satisfactory performance. In summary, the following tasks are successfully accomplished: (1) mapping various types of users with associated preferences for wearable devices (2) indicating which DAs should be configured with regard to wearable devices, (3) incorporating user perceptions of DAs into the process of product recommendation.

Today, to survive in a wide-spectrum of “buyer-dominated” market, industrial managers spend most of their time to make decisions on segmenting the marketplace, targeting prospective customers, and positioning attractive alternatives. In practice, a systematic approach to incorporate user profiles and user perceptions into the entire process of product recommendation is of importance to help product managers capture fast-changing market trends and diverse user requirements. Different from the past studies, this paper demonstrates the following merits:
                        
                           •
                           User profiles and user perceptions of design attributes are captured to achieve effective product positioning (via MCA),

The optimal portfolios of design attributes are systematically identified to best distinguish and configure wristband, smart watch, and sport watch (via ARM),

User preferences for product alternatives are justified to accomplish efficient product recommendation among three wearable devices (via KNN).

In this paper, MCA, ARM, and KNN are fused to relate three entities, namely, user profiles, user perceptions of design attributes, and user preferences for product alternatives. More importantly, an industrial example is used to guide brand companies how to develop a user-driven wearable device for acquiring diverse market segments. In future work, customer requirement analysis like co-creation and social-media mining may be considered to extend the applicability of this study.
