                  To study the interface effects on the device performance, we fabricated indium–gallium–zinc oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) with a two-stack gate-insulator structure. The two-stack gate insulator was composed of a thick main insulator and a thin interfacial insulator; the main insulator determines the effective permittivity of the gate insulator, and the interfacial insulator regulates the gate/active interface properties. The a-IGZO TFTs had about 10cm2
                     V−1
                     s−1 field effect mobility (μ
                     FE) values and 107–108 switching ratios. The dependences of μ
                     FE and threshold voltage, V
                     TH, on the channel width to length ratio were different according to the electron affinity, χ, of the interfacial insulator. The contact resistance between the source/drain electrode and the active layer, and the electron-injection barrier height from the active layer to the interfacial gate insulator layer could explain this finding. In this work, we successfully demonstrated the method to distinguish the interface-related phenomena from the insulator permittivity-related phenomena.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Indium–gallium–zinc oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) are increasingly used instead of silicon (Si) TFTs in flat panel displays (FPDs). The production cost of IGZO TFTs is similar to that of amorphous Si (a-Si) TFTs that are mainly used for liquid crystal displays (LCDs). In addition, IGZO TFTs have sufficient field-effect mobility (μ
                     FE) values to substitute for poly Si (p-Si) TFTs in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display applications [1–3]. Due to their low production cost and superior performance, IGZO TFTs are expected to surpass Si-based TFTs in the near future.

Despite the recent commercialization of IGZO TFT-driven display products, the device performance of IGZO TFTs requires further improvements. Display products are evolving to have larger size and complex functions, and demands placed on TFT performance are greater than ever. Current IGZO TFTs do not meet the performance requirements to completely replace Si TFTs, as the μ
                     FE value [2,4,5] for IGZO TFTs reaches only a few tens of cm2
                     V−1
                     s−1 in comparison with p-Si TFTs, in which μ
                     FE typically exceeds 100cm2
                     V−1
                     s−1.

Active layer optimization is one way to improve TFT performance. IGZO active layer material composition and fabrication processes have been studied extensively [6–8]. Further improvement of IGZO TFT performance by optimizing IGZO active layers is unlikely. TFTs using other high-mobility oxide semiconductors such as indium zinc oxide (IZO) have also been studied [9–11]. Although the switching performance of high-mobility oxide semiconductor TFTs may be higher than that of IGZO TFTs, the overall performance is unlikely to exceed that of IGZO TFTs when considering device stability and fabrication process margins.

Choice of gate insulator is another key factor influencing device performance. High-performance TFTs could be fabricated using a high permittivity gate insulator [12–14]. The large gate-insulator capacitance arising from the high-permittivity gate insulator increases the accumulated channel-carrier density and enhances the switching capability. Besides permittivity, other properties of the interface between the active layer and gate insulator can also have a critical influence on device performance, and a precise understanding of the effect of the interface on device properties is essential for improving device performance. However, accurate analysis of interface effects is difficult as they are not easily distinguished from permittivity effects (Fig. 1
                     (a)).

Here, we adopt a two-stack gate-insulator structure to separate interface effects from permittivity effects. The gate insulator consists of a main layer and an interfacial layer. The main layer, consisting of a fixed material, occupies most of the gate insulator thickness, and the interfacial layer, composed of a range of materials, occupies a small part of the gate insulator thickness (Fig. 1(b)). Using this approach, we can vary interface properties while maintaining a nearly constant effective permittivity in the gate insulator. The device performance dependence on the interfacial layer is presented and analyzed in subsequent sections.

Bottom-gate top-contact TFTs were fabricated using IGZO active layers and two-stack gate insulators on oxidation Si wafer substrates (Fig. 2
                     (a)). The gate electrode consisted of a 100-nm-thick Mo layer sputtered on an oxidation Si wafer and patterned using a photolithography method. The main gate insulator consisted of a 100-nm-thick SiO2 layer deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 300°C on the gate electrode. A 20-nm-thick interfacial insulator was deposited on the gate insulator. In this work, five dielectric materials (SiO2, Al2O3, Si3N4, HfO2, and ZrO2) were used as the interfacial insulator. Al2O3, HfO2, and ZrO2 were deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 150°C, while SiO2 and Si3N4 were deposited using PECVD at 300°C. The active layer consisted of 50nm of IGZO deposited using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering at room temperature with a mixed sputtering gas of Ar:O2 (100:1 sccm). The source/drain electrode consisted of a 100-nm-thick Mo sputtered layer, patterned using dry etching. The channel surface was treated with N2O plasma [15–17]. Then, without a vacuum break, a 200-nm-thick SiO2 passivation layer was deposited at 150°C using PECVD. Electronic characteristics for the fabricated IGZO TFTs (Fig. 2(b)) were measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (HP 4145b) in a dark shielding box at room temperature.

For SiO2 and Al2O3 interfacial gate insulators, μ
                     FE decreased monotonically with the W/L value (Fig. 4
                     ). For ZrO2 and HfO2 interfacial gate insulators, μ
                     FE increased with the W/L value for W/L
                     <50 and then decreased again for W/L
                     >50. For the Si3N4 interfacial gate insulator, the dependence of μ
                     FE on W/L was intermediate between the two previous cases.

The dependence of V
                     TH on W/L was similar to that of μ
                     FE. For all interfacial gate insulator materials, V
                     TH moved toward the negative direction depending on the value of W/L (Fig. 5
                     ). ΔV
                     TH was calculated as a function of W/L using the relationship

                     The ΔV
                     TH curves may be broadly classified as either steep or shallow. ZrO2 and HfO2 showed steep slopes, while those for SiO2 and Al2O3, V
                     TH were shallower.

IGZO TFTs with HfO2 or ZrO2 interfacial gate insulators demonstrated larger subthreshold swing (S) values compared to IGZO TFTs with other interfacial gate insulator materials (Fig. 6
                     ). S values for IGZO TFTs with HfO2 or ZrO2 gate insulators were larger than 1.0V/dec, while those for the other IGZO TFTs were less than 1.0V/dec.

The overall behaviors of μ
                     FE and V
                     TH can be explained by considering two mechanisms. First, the contact resistance between the source/drain and active layer, R
                     C, may explain the decrease in μ
                     FE with W/L. As the L value decreases (i.e., as W/L increases), the influence of R
                     C on the total resistance (R
                     C
                     +channel resistance, R
                     CH) increases. Hence, an increased R
                     C to R
                     CH ratio can degrade the effective μ
                     FE values [19].

Electron affinity, χ, effects can also be considered to have an impact on these results. The dependencies of μ
                     FE and V
                     TH on W/L for SiO2 and Al2O3 were different from those found for HfO2 and ZrO2. SiO2 and Al2O3 have significantly lower values of χ (0.9 and 1 [20]) compared to HfO2 and ZrO2 for which χ is equal to 2.5 [20] (Table 1). The χ value for Si3N4 
                     [21] lies between these values. The relationship between χ values is similar to that of μ
                     FE and V
                     TH; SiO2 and Al2O3 have significantly different properties compared to HfO2 and ZrO2, and the properties of Si3N4 lie between these two groups, which implies that the dependence of μ
                     FE and V
                     TH on the W/L value can be related to the interfacial gate-insulator electron affinity, χ
                     GI. A reduction in χ
                     GI leads to an increase in the height of the electron-injection barrier from the IGZO active layer to the gate insulator layer,

                     , in Fig. 7
                     . Schematics illustrating the relationships among the electron-injection barrier, energy-band bending, interface trap states and electron affinity for the small χ
                     GI materials (SiO2, Al2O3) and for the large χ
                     GI materials (HfO2, ZrO2) are shown as Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. A larger χ
                     GI induces more gate-insulator negative charging and upward bending of the active-layer energy band near the gate insulator/active layer interface, which widens the separation between the conduction-band edge, E
                     C, and the Fermi level, E
                     F, in the near-interface active layer. Hence, the density of unoccupied trap states near the interface increases. Unoccupied trap states may act as trap centers when a positive V
                     GS is applied to accumulate electron carriers. In the contact region, the current path detours from the near-interface region (Fig. 7(c)). Therefore, as the proportion of the device occupied by the contact region increases (i.e., as the proportion of the effective channel length, L
                     eff, decreases), a reduction occurs in the effective density of trap centers for the entire current path. Thus, μ
                     FE may increase as L
                     eff/L decreases. As the length of the contact region is almost unchanged irrespective of L, L
                     eff/L decreases as L decreases (i.e., as W/L increases), which explains the increase in μ
                     FE with increasing W/L (for W/L
                     <50) for IGZO TFTs with HfO2 and ZrO2. For W/L
                     ⩾50 (i.e., L
                     ⩽4μm), R
                     C will dominate the total resistance and hence conduction behavior, since R
                     CH is small. Consequently, the value of μ
                     FE decreases with W/L in this regime. SiO2 and Al2O3 have much smaller values of χ
                     GI than HfO2 and ZrO2, and thus a significantly higher electron injection barrier, as shown in Fig. 7(a); insulator negative charging and band bending near the interface is therefore smaller than that for HfO2 and ZrO2. Hence, trap states may have a more limited effect in the cases of SiO2 and Al2O3, and the dependence on W/L is solely determined by R
                     C across all W/L values. Therefore, μ
                     FE values were found to decrease monotonically with W/L, as shown in Fig. 4.

The behavior of V
                     TH can be explained similarly. A positive gate bias should be applied to accumulate electrons in the effective channel region with bands initially bending upward, to turn on the current flow through the effective channel. A reduction in the ratio of the effective channel length to the total channel length, L
                     eff/L, reduces the influences of the initial upward band bending of the effective channel region on the current flow between the source and drain. Hence, the reduction in L
                     eff/L can move V
                     TH and ΔV
                     T in the negative direction. This tendency should be more prominent in cases for which the bands are bent upward more strongly; thus, greater energy band bending due to higher χ
                     GI values for HfO2 and ZrO2 leads to steeper ΔV
                     TH variations than for other materials (Fig. 5).

The difference in S values according to the interfacial insulator materials (Fig. 6) can be understood in consideration of the interface trap states. For ZrO2 and HfO2 cases, the density of unoccupied trap states is expected to be higher than the other interfacial insulator cases. The high-density unoccupied trap states may cause the larger S values of the TFTs with the ZrO2 and HfO2 interfacial insulators than the other TFTs.

                     FE and V
                     TH on W/L differed with interfacial gate-insulator material. The mechanisms were established to explain this behavior: contact resistance between the source/drain electrode and the active layer, and electron-injection barrier height from the active layer to the interfacial gate insulator layer, which depends on the electron affinity of the insulator. Through this work, we have demonstrated a method for distinguishing interface-related phenomena from insulator permittivity-related phenomena. This method will assist in the development of high-performance devices with high-permittivity and excellent interface gate insulators.
