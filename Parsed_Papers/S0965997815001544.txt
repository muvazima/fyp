                  This article presents numerical modelling of rural road pavement sections recycled in situ with two materials stabilized with bitumen emulsion. The two materials stabilized with bitumen emulsion are base course materials comprising 25% reclaimed asphalt pavement and 75% natural aggregates with and without 1% cement. A 3D-finite difference model was used to determine the response of these pavement sections when subjected to two types of loads with four types of soil subgrades of varying resistances. A nonlinear elasto–plastic Mohr-Coulomb model was used in the two materials stabilized with bitumen emulsion, and a nonlinear model was adopted in the four soil subgrades. Both the resilient and permanent behaviours of these materials were modelled. An analysis was conducted on rutting and fatigue resistances of the base course materials. The base course material containing 1% cement is more resistant and is apt for use in lightly trafficked rural roads. Both base course materials stabilized with bitumen emulsion will first fail from rutting before fatigue.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the primary goals of highway administrations is to maintain the road network in an optimal state of repair and operation. A large part of these networks is composed of lightly trafficked rural roads that use flexible pavements constructed with thin wearing courses comprising asphalt materials and base courses fabricated with unbound granular materials resting upon soil subgrades of relatively low resistance. One of the most effective actions for the maintenance of these pavements was found to be in situ treatment of recycled pavement with bitumen emulsion. In keeping with this convention, the process known as Full Depth Reclamation (FDR) is a rehabilitation technique in which the full thickness of an asphalt wearing course and a predetermined portion of an underlying unbound granular base course are uniformly milled, pulverized and blended to provide a new base course material stabilized with bitumen emulsion (BSM) [1].

In recent years, research on BSM has focussed mainly on characterisation, formulation and implementation. Significant progress has been made in these fields. However, relatively little ground has been gained in the study of the mechanical behaviour of BSM for improving the structural design of the rehabilitation solutions. Most of the methods used to analyse structural designs do not consider the specific mechanical characteristics of BSM. A number of different researchers have reported that these materials play a structural role that varies between the application range of unbound granular materials and the asphalt mixes [2–4]. In this sense, BSM exhibits a nonlinear behaviour similar to that of unbound granular materials, which depends on the pavement stress states, with the most critical mechanical property being shear stress resistance [3–5]. In other words, the failure of these materials is mainly due to significant permanent deformation (rutting) that has an irreversible and negative effect on the structural and functional state of the pavement [2].

The objective of this article is to determine the pavement responses at critical positions in two rural roads pavement sections with BSM base courses. For this purpose, a 3D-finite difference model will be used considering the BSM-specific mechanical characteristics. The permanent deformation (rutting) produced in the BSM will be attained. In addition, fatigue resistance will be analysed.

Two three-layer system sections are modelled (Fig. 1
                        ). The first section was studied earlier in South Africa [3]. It consists of a Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) wearing course 40 mm thick overlying a BSM base course 200 mm thick placed directly over the subgrade. South Africa typically rehabilitates roads with 40 mm HMA wearing courses and 200 mm BSM base courses. This type of rehabilitation specifically belongs to category C: rural roads that are lightly trafficked or strategic roads. These roads have an 80% design reliability and 0.3 to 1 million equivalent standard axle loads (0.3 to 1 MESA) [6]. The second section is similar but with an HMA wearing course 80 mm thick. This second section is not used in the South Africa roads and is analysed for comparison with the first section.

On the other hand, the permissible axle load in South Africa of a single axle with dual wheels is 88 kN, whereas the permissible axle load of a single axle with single wheels used as steering axle is 77 kN, and that of a single axle with single wheels that is not a steering axle is 80 kN [7]. Therefore, two load configurations are used: an 80 kN single axle with two single tyres (ST) (Fig. 1a) and an 88 kN single axle with two dual tyres (DT) (Fig. 1b). A homogeneous circular load p = 0.70 MPa with a radius a = 134.87 mm is applied to the single tyre. For dual tyres, p is also 0.70 MPa but with a = 100.02 mm, and the distance between radial centres is equal to 343.00 mm.

The numerical modelling of the stress state produced in the pavement, created by the application of a static load on its surface, was carried out with the commercial code FLAC3D- 3.10 (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua in 3-Dimensions) [8]. This is a three-dimensional code that uses a specific scheme of finite differences that allows the elastic–plastic behaviour of the materials used in pavement layers to be simulated. The materials are represented by polyhedric elements forming a three-dimensional grid that fits the shape of the modelled object. Each element behaves according to an established law of stress–strain (linear or nonlinear) in response to the loads applied and the boundary conditions. Fig. 2
                         shows the finite difference grid and the coordinate system used for dual tyres. The model comprises 2,500 elements and 2,900 nodes.

Given the conditions of symmetry entailed in the problem (in terms of geometry and loads), only one-fourth of the real problem is studied. The following boundary conditions were applied (Fig. 2):

                           
                              •
                              Movements prevented in direction ‘x’ on plane x = 0 (symmetry plane).

Movements prevented in direction ‘y’ on plane y = 0 (symmetry plane).

Movements prevented in directions ‘x’ and ‘y’ on the lateral (circular) edge of the grid. The lateral (circular) edge of the grid was located far from the load (1.4 m away from the tyre centre) so that it would have a minimal effect on the results.

All movements prevented on the lower plane z = –1.24 m.

Continuity conditions are satisfied at the layer interfaces. The process reproduced with the numerical model consists of two phases: the first provides the in situ state of stresses existing in the pavement before applying the load. Once the state of mechanical equilibrium has been reached for the specific weights and boundary conditions applied, all movements of the model start out at zero. The load is applied in the second phase.

In this research, emphasis should be given to nonlinear elastic-plastic Mohr–Coulomb modelling of the BSM base course. In the HMA wearing course, a linear elastic behaviour is considered. This layer is characterised by the values of the following parameters: specific weight γ = 24 kN/m3, coefficient of earth pressure at rest K
                           0 = 0.6, elastic modulus E = 5,000 MPa and Poisson's coefficient ν = 0.44 [3].

It is assumed that FDR-type treatments are carried out on a pavement that originally consisted of a thin bituminous wearing course and a thick unbound granular base course. Hence, the resulting BSM comprises only 25% Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP). Moreover, two different cases are considered: (a) 25% RAP+75% natural aggregates (R0) and (b) 25% RAP+75% natural aggregates+1% cement (R1). These two BSM base courses are characterised by the values of the following parameters: γ = 22 kN/m3; K
                           0 = 0.6 and ν = 0.35 [3].

A nonlinear elastic behaviour is assumed [9]. In keeping with this, the well-known Mr-Θ model, initially developed for unbound granular materials, is used to obtain the resilient modulus (Mr
                           ) of these materials [3]:

                           3 are the major and minor principal stresses, respectively. The main drawback of this model is that negative values of Θ yield incongruent values of Mr
                           . Ebels [3] obtained the experimental coefficients k
                           1 and k
                           2 of R0 and R1 materials by means of dynamic triaxial tests (Table 1
                           ). In Table 1, it may be observed that in material R0, the value of parameter k
                           1 is equal to 130 MPa, whereas in material R1 (stiffer) this parameter is equal to 150 MPa. Parameter k
                           2 is very similar in the two materials.

Moreover, Table 1 provides the cohesion (c) and angle of friction (ϕ), which allow for the modelling of the elastic–plastic behaviour. According to Jenkins et al. [2], c and ϕ determine the shear stress resistance and therefore the permanent deformation resistance. Compared to material R0, in material R1 with 1% cement, c increases and ϕ decreases.

A fine-grained soil is studied with γ = 20 kN/m3; K
                           0 = 0.6 y ν€= 0.45. In this case, a nonlinear elastic model is used in which Mr
                            decreases as σd increases [10–12]:

                            and k4
                            of four types of subgrade soils by means of dynamic triaxial tests. In Table 2
                           , the values of these coefficients are listed in the four types of subgrade soils with various degrees of resistance: S (Strong); M (Medium); W (Weak); VW (Very Weak). According to Thompson and Elliot [12] the value of Mr
                            at the point where k
                           1 is equal to σd
                            (at the curve breakpoint) is a good indicator of the resilient behaviour of the subgrade material. In this sense, the strong subgrade (S) exhibits a characteristic Mr
                            of 85.1 MPa, whereas the weakest subgrade (VW) has an Mr
                            of only 6.9 MPa.

The rutting resistance of the BSM base course is studied by using a double exponential model that predicts the three phases of the cumulative permanent strain (εp
                        ) versus the number of load cycles (N) [3]:

Jenkins et al [2] reported that SR is a critical parameter that defines the mechanical response of BSM materials to the permanent deformation (PD). As the value of SR increases, the εp value goes up as well. According to Jenkins et al [2], when the SR value is greater than 0.40, high PD (rutting) is produced. It is very important to locate the critical position of SR in the layer. To accomplish this, σ1 and σ3 are determined using the finite difference code at different locations in the BSM base course, which allows the calculation of SR by means of Eq. 4. The critical position was considered to be the point yielding the maximum SR (SR
                        max). This value is used in Eq. 3 to estimate εp
                        .

Moreover, to check the BSM fatigue resistance, the following expression is used [15]:

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Two scenarios corresponding to the two pavement sections discussed in
Section 2.1
 are analysed. The first scenario (pavement P1) has an HMA wearing course 40 mm thick (Fig. 1a), and the second scenario (pavement P2) has an HMA wearing course 80 mm thick (Fig. 1b). The critical responses of the materials in the pavement structure are studied in terms of the different qualities of the two BSM base courses constructed over subgrades of four fine soils with a resistance range that goes from rigid to very weak. Three variables of the pavement response were monitored at the following critical points (Table 5)

The maximum stress ratio (SR
                        max) of the BSM base course was also obtained. The following is an explanation of the effect exerted on the above points by the following characteristics:

Mechanical properties of both BSM base course and subgrade.

As expected, the increase of the HMA wearing course thickness generally produces fewer pavement responses. For example, in Fig. 3
                           (a and b), it can be observed that with both single and dual tyres, the surface deflections on the HMA wearing course and in the subgrade upper fibre are consistently fewer in pavement P2. This also occurs with the vertical strains in the subgrade upper fibre (Table 5, Fig. 3e). Moreover, Fig. 3c shows that in the BSM base course, the tensile strains in the lower fibre that occur in pavement P2 are always smaller than those produced in P1. In addition, Table 5 shows that the SR
                           max values in the BSM base course are always lower in pavement P2.

However, as seen in Fig. 3d, this does not happen in the HMA wearing course, given that in pavement P2 with a single tyre, the tensile strains in the bottom of the HMA wearing course are greater for both R0 and R1 materials. The latter occurrence is also observed with dual tyres and R1 material. To investigate this behaviour, tensile strains of HMA thicknesses between 20 and 140 mm were calculated. Fig. 4
                           a represents the tensile strain in the HMA wearing course bottom versus thickness, with R0 and R1 materials, single and dual tyres and strong subgrade. Fig. 4b represents the tensile strain in the HMA wearing course bottom versus thickness, with R0 and R1 materials, dual tyres and the four subgrade soils. Both figures show an HMA critical thickness at which a maximum tensile strain is produced. Below this critical thickness, the tensile strain decreases with decreasing thickness, whereas above the critical thickness, the tensile strain decreases with increasing thickness. This performance was observed before in flexible pavements constructed with HMA wearing courses resting upon unbound granular materials [12,16,17]. The explanation of this performance is that above the critical thickness, the wearing course provides an “elastic structural layer” action, whereas a thinner layer exhibits “membrane type” behaviour [12].

The impact on the pavement is generally lower with dual tyres (Table 5). In keeping with this, the deflections produced with dual tyres (DT) on the HMA surface (Fig. 3a) and in the subgrade upper fibre (Fig. 3b) are consistently lower than those that occur with single tyres (ST). The same is true with the vertical strains in the subgrade upper fibre (Table 5, Fig. 3e). The tensile strains in the BSM (Fig. 3c) and HMA layers (Fig. 3d) follow this same pattern of behaviour. Moreover, the SR
                           max values in the BSM base courses are lower with dual tyres (Table 5).

As an exception to this behaviour, with R1 material, the tensile strains in the P1-HMA wearing course are higher with DT than with ST (Fig. 3d). In Fig. 4a, it can be observed that in R1 material below 50 mm, the replacement of ST by DT increases the tensile strain. The same is observed in R0 material below 40 mm. This behaviour results because with thin wearing courses, the ST load generates greater stresses in the BSM. Therefore, in accordance with Eq. 1, the resilient modulus increases, making the BSM base course stiffer and producing a decrease of the HMA wearing course tensile strains.

As was expected, the elastic deflections on the HMA wearing course, in the BSM base course and in the subgrade upper fibres increase as the stiffness of the subgrade decreases (Table 5). In Fig. 3a, for example, the most rigid subgrade, S, produces smaller deflections than the other three, M, W and VW. Fig. 5
                              (a and b) is 3D representations of the contour of deflections (z displacement) produced in sections P1-R0, S (Strong) and VW (Very weak) subgrades, respectively, and with DT load. Fig. 6
                              (a and b) is 3D representations of the displacements produced in section P1-R1, S (Strong) and VW (Very weak) subgrades, respectively, and with DT load. As can be clearly seen, in both figures, much higher elastic deflections are produced in the section with the least rigid subgrade (VW). Moreover, this behaviour is evident on the subgrade vertical strain results (Table 5), and the SR
                              max values are lower with the most rigid subgrade (Table 5).

Again, an exception to this clear-cut behaviour pattern can be found in the tensile strains produced in the HMA wearing course. Accordingly, with pavement P1, ST load and R1 material, the tensile strain increases as the subgrade stiffness increases (Fig. 3d). This occurs as well with DT load and R0 and R1 materials. In Fig. 4b, this behaviour can be observed in the four subgrade soils, with DT load and R0 and R1 materials. Accordingly, below the critical thickness, the tensile strain increases with increasing subgrade stiffness, whereas above the critical thickness, the tensile strain decreases with increasing subgrade stiffness.

If the other three factors remain invariable, (HMA thickness, load configuration and subgrade), pavement responses are always lower with material R1—e.g., in the BSM with 1% cement (Fig. 3(a, b, c, d and e). In Fig. 4(a and b), we can observe that the tensile strains in the HMA wearing courses are always fewer with R1 material. If Fig. 5(a and b) are compared to Fig. 6(a and b), it is evident that a greater deflection occurs in the sections containing R0 materials. For example, in section P1-R0 with subgrade S, the maximum surface deflection in the dual tyre zone is roughly equal to 307 µm, whereas in section P1-R1, it is only 260 µm. Moreover, the SR
                              max values are lower in BSM with 1% cement (R1) (Table 5). Therefore, as is logical, the structural capacity of the pavement is greater when the stiffest material R1 is used.


                           Fig. 7 shows the variation of Mr
                            in sections P1-RO, P1-R1, P2-RO and P2-R1 with S (Strong) and VW (Very Weak) subgrades. First, it can be observed that Mr
                            increases with depth. Second, the Mr
                            of the very weak (VW) subgrade ranges between 5 MPa (upper fibre) and 30 MPa, whereas those corresponding to the resistant subgrade (S) range between 80 MPa (upper fibre) and 110 MPa. In the third place, it is observed that, given equal conditions, the Mr
                            of the subgrade is greater with HMA thickness equal to 80 mm (P2).


                           Fig. 8
                           
                            shows the Mr variation in the BSM base course for the two types of soils in sections P1-RO, P1-R1, P2-RO and P2-R1. Contrary to the previous case, as the depth of the BSM base course increases, Mr
                            diminishes. The section P1-R1-S-DT is the one that exhibits the highest Mr
                            values, ranging from approximately 700 MPa (lower fibre) to 1300 MPa (upper fibre). The section with the lowest values is P2-R0-VW-DT. These values fluctuate between approximately 450 MPa (lower fibre) and 650 MPa (upper fibre). Logically, the Mr
                            values are higher in the section with a BSM base course material type R1 (with 1% cement) and subgrade S (Strong). Finally, under equal conditions, the Mr
                            of the BSM base course is greater with HMA thickness equal to 40 mm (P1).

It is very important to explain that to avoid a negative bulk stress (Θ) and consequently meaningless Mr
                            values, in some cases, σ
                           3 was set to 0 while maintaining the same σ
                           1. This means that Mr
                            depends only on σ
                           1. This stress modification is necessary because no real solution exists for 
                              
                                 θ
                                 
                                    k
                                    2
                                 
                              
                            when θ is negative and k
                           2 is smaller than 1. For example, in P1-R1-S-DT section lower fibre, Θ = σ
                           1 + 2σ
                           3 = 100 + 2(0) = 100 kPa. Accordingly, applying Eq. 1, Mr
                            = 150(100)0.33 = 685 MPa.

To calculate the BSM stress ratios, in
Eq. 4

                        Table 6
                         lists the high, low and average values of principal stresses σ
                        1 induced in the BSM base course upper and lower fibres for P1 and P2 pavements, resistant subgrade (S) and dual tyres (DT). Moreover, the minor stresses σ
                        3 caused in the same points are presented. In both R0 and R1 materials, σ
                        1 values are in compression (+ notation). Nevertheless, in sections P1-R0 and P1-R1, σ
                        3 values are in compression in the upper fibres (+ notation) and are in traction in the lower fibres (- notation). In addition, in Table 6 the σd, σdf
                         and SR values are exposed.

In Table 6, it can be observed that, in general, there is not much difference between the σd
                         values obtained with R0 and R1 materials. For example, in the P1-R1 section, the σd
                         average values are 0.444 MPa (upper fibre) and 0.276 MPa (lower fibre), whereas in the P1-R0 section, the σd
                         average values are 0.397 MPa (upper fibre) and 0.229 MPa (lower fibre). Nevertheless, there is an important difference between the σdf
                         values obtained with R0 and R1 materials. For instance, in the P2-R1 section, the σdf
                         average values are 1.129 MPa (lower fibre) and 1.310 MPa (upper fibre), whereas in the P2-R0 section, the σd
                         average values are 0.395 MPa (lower fibre) and 0.581 MPa (upper fibre). Therefore, σd
                         values are reasonably similar in R0 and R1 materials; but σdf
                         values are higher in R1 materials. For this reason, R1 materials have lower stress ratios. Moreover, in Table 6, it can be observed that in P2 pavement with an 80 mm HMA wearing course, the σd
                         and σdf
                         stresses are lower than those in P1 pavement with only a 40 mm HMA wearing course. That indicates lower stress ratios in the P2 pavement.

On the other hand, Figs. 9
                         and 10
                         are 3D representations of the BSM Stress Ratio variation. In any case, the critical points are located at the midpoint between the wheels. In Fig. 9a (P1-R0 section), the maximum SR
                        R0 value is found in the BSM base course lower fibre, slightly to the left of the tyre (0.700–0.777 range). Therefore, in this section, very high PD values will occur. In contrast, in Fig. 9b (P1-R1 section), the maximum SR
                        R1 value occurs in the base course upper fibre slightly to the right of the tyre (0.300–0.314 range). In all probability, in this section, lower PD values will be induced. In Fig. 10b (P2-R0 material), the maximum SR
                        R0 values are generated in the upper fibre of the layer (0.400–0.441 range). In this section, high PD values will probably be created. In Fig. 10b (P2-R1 section), the maximum SR
                        R1 value appears only in the upper part (0.225–0.234 range). Consequently, in this section, PD values will be very low.


                        Eq. 3 was used to estimate the cumulative permanent deformation εp
                         (%) in the BSM base course. Fig. 11
                        
                        a shows the εp
                         (%) curves for the four different cases described above versus the number of single axles of 88 kN (N).

Clearly, the cumulative permanent deformation increases as the maximum stress ratio increases. The lowest εp
                         (%) value occurs on curve P2-R1 corresponding to an HMA thickness of 80 mm and BSM with 1% cement. The highest εp
                         (%) value is found on curve P1-R0 of HMA equal to 40 mm and BSM material without cement. The curves show a part in which the relationship between the logarithm of εp
                         (%) and the logarithm of N is linear. In all of them, there is a starting point at which εp
                         (%) increases exponentially, which would indicate that the material is entering a tertiary zone of deformation. On curve P2-R1, this point is reached with 1 × 107 
                        N and 0.15%εp
                        . On curve P1-R1, it is reached with 1 × 106 
                        N and 0.4%εp
                        . On curve P2-R0, it is achieved with 1 × 105 
                        N and 0.7%εp
                        , and on curve P1-R0, it is reached with 1 × 104 
                        N and 2.0%εp
                        .


                        Fig. 11b represents the εp
                         (%) curves for material R1 and dual tyres. In these curves, the two pavement types P1 and P2 are shown separately with the four types of subgrade. It can be observed that with pavement P2 and material R1, considering different types of subgrade does not significantly affect the service life of the pavement section. In other words, there is little difference between the εp
                         (%) values generated on the four curves corresponding to the different types of subgrade. Thus, for 1 × 107 
                        N
                        , they all show a permanent deformation under 0.20%εp
                        . The same behaviour is observed with pavement P1 and material R1, because for 1 × 106 
                        N, the permanent deformation is less than 0.5%εp
                        .

In South Africa, according to Liebenberg and Visser [13,14], the permanent deformation failure criterion adopted for rural roads is usually a 20 mm rut depth on the pavement surface. Further, research [18] has shown that approximately 80% of the PD observed on the surface originated from within the BSM layer whereas the remaining 20% would be from the other layers of the pavement structure. This relative permanent deformation distribution probably differs in the current pavement of an HMA wearing course 40–80 mm thick and a BSM base course 200 mm thick over a subgrade. For this reason, the following sensitivity analysis will be conducted considering that 80, 60, 40 and 20% of the PD on the surface originated from within the BSM base course.

On the other hand, the failure criterion is applied to category C roads that carry 0.3 to 1 million equivalent standard single-axle loads of 80 kN (0.3 to 1 MESA), even though the maximum axle load is 88 kN [6,7]. A load equivalent factor (LEF) represents the relative damage caused by axle load P compared to an 80 kN single axle load and can be obtained by means of the following expression [7]:

                                    L

                                    F
                                    =
                                    
                                       
                                          (
                                          
                                             P
                                             80
                                          
                                          )
                                       
                                       4
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        where P is any axle load for which equivalence is required (kN), 80 is the equivalent standard load, and 4 is the damage exponent. In this particular case, an 88 kN axle load is equivalent to 1.46 single-axle loads of 80 kN.


                        Table 7 shows the millions of single-axle loads of 80 kN (NPD
                         expressed in MESA) to fail due to rutting for the cases of 80, 60, 40 and 20% PD produced within the BSM base course.

In Table 7, it is shown that for sections P1-R0, P1-R1 and P2-R1, the 4% of PD have the same MESA; therefore, the PD percentages do not affect the service life. For section P2-R0, the NPD
                         are equal only for 80, 60 and 40% PD. Only section P1-R0 has a NPD
                         below 0.3 MESA for category C roads. Sections P1-R1, P2-R0 and P2-R1 are always above 1 MESA for category C roads.

Hence, section P2-R1 is the one that resists the highest NPD
                        , whereas section P1-R0 is the one that resists the lowest NPD
                        . The sections with material R1 have a greater resistance to PD than the sections containing material R0. Increasing the thickness of the wearing course from 40 to 80 mm improves resistance to PD.


                        Eq. 5 was used to estimate the fatigue life (Nf
                         expressed in MESA) of BSM base course for the four previously analysed cases. In Table 7, it can be seen that section P1-R0 has the poorest behaviour to fatigue and section P2-R1 has the best behaviour. The sections containing material R1 behave better than those with material R0. Increasing the thickness of the HMA wearing course from 40 to 80 mm improves the BSM base course fatigue resistance. In all cases, BSM base courses fail because of PD before they succumb to fatigue.

Nevertheless, it is necessary to check whether the failure occurs first owing to the HMA fatigue rather than BSM base course in any of the sections. This can be accomplished using the fatigue law Nfa
                         = 1.1867×10−8 
                        ε
                        −3.67 employed in Spain to test HMA 
                        [19]. This law was obtained by means of displacement controlled tests, which are more applicable to HMA layers with a relatively low thickness, commonly used in lightly trafficked rural roads. Table 7 shows the HMA number of cycles until fatigue failure (Nfa
                         expressed in MESA). In the four cases, the HMA wearing courses will experience fatigue failure before the BSM base courses. Finally, with the exception of section P2-R1 (the section with the thickest HMA wearing course and the stiffest BSM base course), failure occurs from rutting of the BSM base courses before fatigue of the HMA wearing courses.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Based on the results of this research, the following conclusions can be drawn

                        
                           •
                           The responses of the pavement are more satisfactory in cases with an 80 mm thick HMA wearing course, with the exception of HMA tensile strain in sections P2-R0 and P2-R1 with a single tyre and P2-R1 with dual tyres. Better structural behaviour was also obtained with dual tyres, except for the HMA wearing course tensile strain in section P1-R1.

The responses of the pavement also decrease as the subgrade stiffness increases, except in the case of HMA wearing course tensile strain in sections P1-R0 and P1-R1 with dual tyres and in P1-R1 with a single tyre.

In an HMA wearing course situated over a BSM base course, there is a “critical thickness” with a maximum tensile strain.

The responses are more satisfactory with BSM base courses with material R1 containing 1% cement.

The Mr
                               of the subgrade increases with depth, whereas that of the BSM base course materials decreases. The Mr
                               of the subgrade is higher with an 80 mm HMA wearing course, whereas the corresponding value of the BSM base course is greater with 40 mm HMA. The Mr
                               of the BSM base course is higher in layers containing R1 materials and with a resistant subgrade (S).

In an 88 kN single axle with dual tyres, the maximum SR values are found at the following critical points of the BSM base course

                                 
                                    •
                                    Section P1-R0 in the lower fibre to the left of the tyre centre.

Section P1-R1 in the upper fibre to the right of the tyre centre.

Section P2-R0 in the upper fibre underneath the tyre.

Section P2-R1 in the upper fibre underneath the tyre.

The smallest SR and the lowest permanent deformation occur jointly with an 80 mm thick HMA wearing course, BSM base course material R1 and resistant subgrade (S).

In the section with BSM base course material R1, the subgrade stiffness does not significantly affect the resistance to the permanent deformation of the BSM material.

With resistant subgrade (S), the BSM base course of section P1-R0 is the one with the poorest fatigue behaviour, and section P2-R1 exhibits the best behaviour.

The BSM base course materials begin to fail from rutting before they fail from fatigue. The failure of pavement sections may be first attributed to rutting in the BSM and subsequently to HMA fatigue, except in section P2-R1. Therefore, it can be stated that in these types of BSM recycled in situ with asphalt emulsion, as a design parameter, resistance to PD is more critical than fatigue resistance.

Pavement section P1-R1 containing BSM is apt for use in South African Category C roads.

It is crucial to validate the numerical simulation obtained in this research by comparing the measurement results of in-field pavement responses to the results of the corresponding numerical simulation.
