                  Multiple-testing problems have received much attention. Different strategies have been considered in order to deal with this problem. The false discovery rate (FDR) is, probably, the most studied criterion. On the other hand, the sequential goodness of fit (SGoF), is a recently proposed approach. Most of the developed procedures are based on the independence among the involved tests; however, in spite of being a reasonable proviso in some frameworks, independence is not realistic for a number of practical cases. Therefore, one of the main problems in order to develop appropriate methods is, precisely, the effect of the dependence among the different tests on decisions making. The consequences of the correlation on the z-values distribution in the general multitesting problem are explored. Some different algorithms are provided in order to approximate the distribution of the expected rejection proportions. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated in a simulation study in which, for comparison purposes, the Benjamini and Hochberg method to control the FDR, the Lehmann and Romano procedure to control the tail probability of the proportion of false positives (TPPFP), and the Beta–Binomial SGoF procedure are considered. Three different dependence structures are considered. As usual, for a better understanding of the problem, several practical cases are also studied.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The increase of the available information is a direct consequence of the technological advances. Modern science frequently produces data on thousands of different characteristics (variables). Probably, the—omic technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.) stand for the most relevant examples although other fields like astrophysics, brain imaging or spatial epidemiology have also increased substantially the size of the collected data. A usual practice in these fields is to measure all this information in two or more groups of individuals and, by using one particular statistical test, determining whether, in those groups, the behavior of the collected variables is different or not. However, the probability of spurious effects, or false positives, greatly increases when a massive number of tests is performed simultaneously. The aim of the classical multiple comparison procedures (the Bonferroni correction is the most popular one) is to control the probability of committing any Type I error i.e., to control the family wise error rate (FWER). This aim can be too restrictive and in large-scale problems provokes a huge decrease in the statistical power (increase the Type II error). In order to deal with this effect, more liberal criteria have been proposed (see Farcomeni (2008) for a recent and extensive review of modern multiple hypothesis testing methods).

Conventionally, in the multiple testing framework, 
                        
                           N
                        
                      (null) hypotheses are tested (each one denoted by

                              ,
                              i
                           
                        
                        ,
                        
                        1
                        ≤
                        i
                        ≤
                        
                           N
                        
                     ). Table 1
                      depicts schematically the possible situations. Of course, in practice, only the total number of rejections, 
                        r
                     , is really observed and known. Note that controlling the FWER is equivalent to control the 
                        P
                        
                           {
                           
                              r
                           
                           −
                           
                              R
                           
                           >
                           0
                           }
                        
                     . Seeger (1968) introduced and Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) studied and popularized the false discovery rate (FDR), defined as the expected proportion of spurious effects i.e., 
                        
                           FDR
                        
                        =
                        1
                        −
                        E
                        
                           [
                           
                              R
                           
                           /
                           r
                           ]
                        
                     . The FDR is a frequentist well established definition for the multiple hypothesis testing errors and it has some interesting properties: on one hand, it is equivalent to the FWER when all null hypotheses are true (
                        
                           R
                        
                        =
                        0
                     ) and, on the other hand, it is more liberal than the FWER criterion otherwise. The second point is that it allows to increase considerably the number of rejections. Note that, in a number of large-scale experiments (for instance in microarray genome-wide scans), it is usually presupposed that most of the nulls are true; the goal is often to identify a subset of interesting factors for future confirmatory studies and the relative role of type I and type II errors can change respect to the usual one in the (single) hypothesis testing framework.

Several generalizations for the FWER and the FDR criteria and different procedures to implement them have been proposed (see, for instance, Sarkar (2007) and references therein). Most recent works deal with the problem of controlling the tail probability of false positives. Genovese and Wasserman (2006) proposed to control the tail probability of the false discovery proportion (FDP) by the so labeled FDX (false discovery exceedance) i.e., for a fixed 
                        α
                     , to control 
                        P
                        
                           {
                           1
                           −
                           
                              R
                           
                           /
                           r
                           >
                           α
                           }
                        
                     . Similarly, the generalized family-wise error rate (gFWER), proposed by Dudoit et al. (2004), is defined by the probability of committing more than 
                        k
                      Type I errors i.e., by 
                        P
                        
                           {
                           r
                           −
                           
                              R
                           
                           >
                           k
                           }
                        
                     . In addition, we highlight the sequential goodness of fit (SGoF) strategy, proposed by Carvajal-Rodríguez et al. (2009) and deeply explored by de Uña-Álvarez (2011). The SGoF method rejects an amount of null hypotheses equal to the difference between the observed and the expected amounts of 
                        p
                     -values below a given threshold under the assumption that all nulls are true (we denote by

                     -values distribution and its impact on the final decision to be made.

Although it is reasonable to assume that, under the null, each single

                     , and even this proviso is true when the null is simple and the distribution of the test statistic is continuous and known, the true 
                        p
                     -value distribution is only stochastically dominated by the uniform if its distribution is discrete or the 
                        p
                     -value is estimated by a resampling method (see, for instance, Farcomeni (2008)). Under independence and assuming the 
                        p
                     -values to be uniformly distributed, the

The Hedenfalk data Hedenfalk et al. (2001) stands for an illustrative and well-known example which, in the present framework, has been previously considered by several authors. One of the goals of this microarray study was to find genes differentially expressed in breast cancer patients with mutations in the BRCA1 gene relative to those with BRCA2 mutation. A total of 3226 (
                        =

                     ) genes were studied on 7 patients with BRCA1- and on 8 with BRCA2-mutation. The mean and standard deviation for the

                     , the number of significant genes was 498 (15.4%). By using the traditional Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) FDR correction, the number of detected effects (significant genes) was only two. By considering the SGoF criterion for independent data, the total number of effects was 312. Of course, all these numbers could change and, in fact, they do it, when other statistical test (for instance, a non-parametric one) is used.

The key for knowing how many genes to select (or, at least, to measure the committed error) is to know the distribution of the random variable

                      This problem has been previously considered in the literature and there exist a number of papers which deal with it (see Efron (2010) and references therein). However, many of them assume hypotheses which are only reasonable for particular settings. In Section  2 we are concerned with the

                      vector correlation matrix, where

                     -distribution are proposed. The most commonly used tests (the Student–Welch test and the Mann–Whitney one) are explicitly considered. In addition, a general procedure based on resampling is also explored. In Section  4 the obtained results are applied in order to control the tail probability of false positives. Two algorithms, one to control the median and another one for applying the SGoF strategy, are proposed. In Section  5, the behavior of these methods is checked in a simulation study. The results suggest that both procedures get a good compromise between the false and true discoveries. Finally, in Section  6, the practical application is illustrated through three different real problems. Both the tables and the technical results are provided as supplementary material (see Appendix A).

                      can be directly replaced (plug-in method) by their respective sampling correlations (the correlation estimation is a well-known problem, see, for instance, Johnson and Kotz (1970), for normal theory approximation). However, this procedure tends to overestimate

                      stands for the bivariate distribution function from which the data were drawn;

                      denote, respectively, the

                     th and 
                        j
                     th marginal distribution functions. In practice, these distributions are replaced by their sampling counterparts. The proof is also provided as supplementary material (see Appendix A).

Both approximations underestimate the correlation for large

                     . In fact, they never reach the value 1, even when

                        1
                     . Obviously, when the tests are independent, the correlation is usually overestimated. Fig. 2
                      depicts the relationship between the real correlation of the 
                        z
                     -values and the approximated correlation. Two samples (with the same sample size, 25) were drawn, independently, from the same standard bidimensional normal distribution (with correlation 
                        c
                     ). The Student–Welch and the Mann–Whitney tests were then computed. The observed correlations of the 
                        z
                     -values and the ones estimated through Eqs. (8), left, and (9), right, against the value of 
                        c
                      (5000 iterations for each 
                        c
                     -value) were considered.

In a more general context, given an arbitrary comparison criterion,

We propose some alternative procedures which illustrate the practical applications of the approximation to the

The standard Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for controlling the FDR (BH) is broadly used in practice in order to detect effects from massive data analysis. This method controls the expected value of false discovery proportions (

                        -values. As an alternative, we propose to use a more robust measure and controlling the median of the FDP. There exist clear connections between this criterion, the FDX proposed by Genovese and Wasserman (2006), and the gFWER proposed by Dudoit et al. (2004). In fact, like FDX, our method controls the tail probability for the proportion of false positives (TPPFP) at the particular case of 1/2. Similarly, the gFWER controls the tail probability of the exact number of false positives. However, controlling the proportions (instead of the exact number) is more appropriate for large-scale problems Dudoit et al. (2004).

However, under dependency, it can be very anticonservative. de Uña-Álvarez (2012) introduced a correction of the SGoF method based on the Beta–Binomial distribution. In short, it is assumed the existence of 
                           k
                         blocks of tests which share the same within-block correlation. These blocks are based on the order of the sequence; hence, at this time, the order of 
                           p
                        -values plays a fundamental role. Since the number of blocks, 
                           k
                        , is fixed, this correlation can be estimated from the sequence of 
                           p
                        -values. Under this assumption, this method was proved to have good properties.

The method presents some issues. On one hand, the correlation matrix could not have this (assumed) structure. On the other hand, sometimes the order of the

                        -values is at random (or they are randomly recorded), and no consequence should be derived from this order. Using the original data structure in order to estimate the

                     ), the observed rejection proportions for the BH were quite low. However, the most remarkable points are: (1) both median control methods only rejected around 10%, instead of the expected 50%, even lower for unequal sample sizes; and (2) BB rejected above 30% (instead of the expected 5%). In average, this method rejected more than 50 (true) nulls, the observed standard deviations were also very large. The

                      method performed well, although is anticonservative for equal (lower) and conservative for unequal (larger) sample sizes. The correlations between the observed number of rejections and the estimated cut-off points were also very large; 0.863 and 0.850, for equal and unequal sample sizes, respectively. With this covariance structure, it was observed that, for 5% of the iterations, the observed rejection proportion was larger than 15.4%. This implies that, for this model, observing a rejection percentage of 15% does not seem to be too strange. Finally, in the third considered case, the Golub data (

In this case, the 5% of the iterations rejected more than the 12.8% of the nulls. The low observed number of rejections in the methods for controlling the median is due to the strong asymmetry of the rejection distributions.

                        15
                     ), the BH, LR and the BB methods performed similarly. The FWER and the Power increased with the real percentage of false nulls, while the FDP was still under control. The BB method reached a better power, although it reported a greater FWER and FDP too. This effect was also observed for the

                      method was different; for this method, both the FWER and the Power were controlled. The FWER was around the 50% and the statistical power was around 20%. For unequal sample sizes, the behavior was similar but, for the BH and LR procedures, both the FWER and the statistical power were larger. The correlation between the observed rejection proportions and the computed cut-off points ranged between 0.527 and 0.796.

Table 6 is similar to Table 5, but the variance–covariance matrices are extracted from the Hedenfalk data (
                        
                           N

                        3226
                     ). For equal sample size, the BH and LR methods performed similarly; the observed powers were very large. However, while the observed FWER grew with the percentages of false nulls, the power was still constant. The SGoF strategy has serious problems with this structure. Note that, for instance, when the percentage of false nulls was 5%, only for 11.7% of the iterations it rejected above the 15.4% (cut-off point observed when all nulls were true), this percentage achieved the 61.7% when the false nulls percentage was 15%. The BB method obtained worse powers despite of committing more mistakes. However, with the same goal, the

                      method detected the correlation structure and controlled the FWER, while its (poor) statistical power grew with the percentages of false nulls. The

                      method performed well and, as in the independent case, it controlled the FWER (around 25%) and obtained relatively good powers (around 80%). This method got almost the same power than the BH and LR ones with half of the FWER. For unequal (and larger) sample sizes, the pattern of results was very similar.

                      procedure was more conservative than with an equal sample size. Correlations between the observed percentages and estimated cut-off points oscillated between 0.802 and 0.905.

Table 7 is similar to the previous one when the covariance matrices are extracted from the Golub data (

                      controlled the FWER at 50%. BH, LR, BB and

                      methods achieved similar powers (around 20%). The

                      method did not work, being extremely conservative, particularly for unequal sample sizes. The FWER was well controlled but the proportion of detected false nulls was very poor. Probably, the considered sample sizes were too small to successfully handling the variability and the number of tests. In addition, only the 7.5% and 20.1% of iterations with 5% and 15% of false nulls, respectively, rejected more than 12.8% of the nulls. Finally, the correlation among the observed rejection proportions and the cut-off points ranged between 0.754 and 0.897.

In this section, we study in detail three real datasets. In particular, we consider the well-known Hedenfalk and Golub data and the less known Shen data, an epigenetic dataset. Since the DNA methylation values are expected to be highly correlated (see, for instance, Issa (2004)); and since the influence of the microarray normalization methods on true biological effects is still under study (Wang et al., 2012), the last problem is particularly appropriated in our context.

This dataset has been already considered in this context and even it has been used in order to illustrate the problem in the current work. Hence, in short, the Hedenfalk data Hedenfalk et al. (2001) provides 3226 genes, and the focus is to detect possible differences between the gene expression in BRCA1- (7 patients) and BRCA2-mutation (8 patients). Fig. 4
                          depicts the histogram for the 3226 
                           p

                        , the BH procedure declares only two significative effects. The LR method to control the median finds five tests statistically significative. The BB procedure detects around three hundred effects (depending on the parameter 
                           k
                         this number oscillates between 299 and 304). The new proposed procedure to control the median,

                         method rejects 143 or 40 nulls, respectively. By letting the value of

In this dataset, probably because of the sparse available sample sizes, the statistical tests are not powerful and then, the obtained 
                           p
                        -values are large. Note that only the smallest five and two 
                           p
                        -values satisfied the LR and BH conditions, respectively, at level 5%. These criteria do not depend on the observed data but on the 
                           p
                        -values. However, the number of 
                           p

                         is quite large and the SGoF criterion detects this rejection excess in order to declare a larger number of effects. In both the considered procedures, the final number of rejections depends on one parameter;

This well-known dataset contains the expression of 7129 genes (Affymetrix proves) assayed using Affymetrix Hgu6800 chip on 20 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 14 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The data were obtained from the package cited above. Fig. 5

It seems that the small sample sizes (taking into account the large variability) and the large number of simultaneous tests (see, de Uña-Álvarez (2011)) provoke again that the SGoF strategy performs better (in the sense that it detects a larger number of effects) than the method directly based on the 
                           p
                        -values.

The Shen data contains information on 62 Taiwanese cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on which tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues were analyzed using Illumina methylation arrays (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) that screen 26,538 autosomal CpG sites. The reader is referred to Shen et al. (2012) for complete information about the original study. The data are publicly available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) page, with accession number GSE37988 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37988). Probes corresponding to the 
                           X
                         and 
                           Y
                         chromosomes were removed from the dataset in order to eliminate 
                           X
                        -inactivation effects. We considered the crude data (without previous quality control). Due to each CpG is measured on the same subjects, the Student 
                           T
                        -test for paired samples was used in order to compute the 
                           p
                        -values. Fig. 6
                        , similarly to Fig. 5, depicts the histogram for the 26,538 
                           p
                        -values (left) and the kernel density estimation for the respective

                        -values (right).

The total number of CpG sites with a 
                           p
                        -value less than 0.05 (usual nominal level) was 12,394 (46.7%). The BH method declares significant the 10,451 smallest ones. The LR method for controlling the FDP median detects 9864 effects while the proposed method,

                        , is more conservative and only detects 4370 significative genes. The number of effects detected by the BB procedure for the SGoF strategy changed with the selected number of bins: while a small number of bins (below 400) provided around 10,900 significative effects, when the number of bins increases, the number of effects drastically decreases. With 500 bins (

In this dataset, the new methods show themselves more conservative than, for instance, the BH procedure. The number of detected effects was really high. In the original paper and after a previous quality selection of 26,486 autosomal CpG sites, the number of detected effects by using the Bonferroni correction was 2324. However, we want to point out that the nominal level in this case would be

                           /

                           486
                        , extremely low and with potential problems of computational precision.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Multitesting problems are often encountered in practice. The development of statistical tools in order to handling and controlling the involved errors is a really hot topic in the specialized literature. When dealing with a multitesting problem, there exist two main questions: (1) How many hypotheses are false? and (2) Which hypotheses are false? Multitesting procedures are devoted to answer to the first question while the second one is immediately answered: “If we have detected 
                        n
                      effects, they will be those with the 
                        n
                      smallest 
                        p
                     -values”. However, even when the response to the first question were the right one, the probability that the 
                        p
                     -values associated with the false hypotheses occupy the 
                        n
                      smallest positions depends on the relationship between each null and each alternative hypothesis (single statistical power) and on the involved numbers of false and true hypotheses. This is an intrinsic problem in all multitesting procedures. The researchers must look for a compromise between (a) detecting all (or, at least, a high percentage of) the false hypotheses and committing some type I error, and (b) restricting type I errors and losing some statistical power (for instance, Storey (2003) proposed a criterion based on a weighted measure of the false discovery and non-discovery rates). In this paper we studied the distribution of the rejection proportions when all nulls are true under general dependency structures. We provided an approximation which is valid in a variety of situations. However, we point out that the approximation may fail for strongly correlated data matrices; i.e., when the 
                        
                           
                              α
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      value of the (theoretical) matrix from where the 
                        z
                     -values were drawn is very large. This distribution was employed in order to introduce an algorithm for controlling the median of the FDP and for approximating the cut-off point associated with the SGoF strategy. Simulations suggest that both methods are somehow more conservative than the existing procedures: they commit less Type I error but detect less true false hypotheses. In addition, the proposed methodology allows to control the FWER under quite general dependency structures even when there is a fraction of non-true null hypotheses.

The results observed in the simulation study (Section  5) suggest that the power of the 
                        
                           
                              N
                           
                           
                              M
                           
                        
                      method is similar to other existing procedures like the Lehmann and Romano (2005), reporting results similar to the BH method too. The main advantage of 
                        
                           
                              N
                           
                           
                              M
                           
                        
                      is that its FWER remains constant regardless the proportion of false hypotheses. Large variability was observed for the SGoF strategy in the presence of asymmetry in the rejection proportion distributions. The Beta–Binomial SGoF method, with a fixed 
                        k
                     -value (
                        k
                        =
                        50
                     ), does not respect the expected FWER while the proposed algorithm showed itself conservative. The estimation of 
                        
                           
                              α
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      plays a crucial role and, in order to get good approximations, the available sample sizes cannot be too small (see Table 3). In practice, correlations among 
                        p
                     -values are related to correlations in the original data (Section  3). This was investigated in particular for the parametric Student–Welch and the non-parametric Mann–Whitney tests. Because of the quadratic nature of these relationships, the estimation of the ordinary correlation coefficient is important. This question has been previously considered by Efron (2007, 2009). As one may expect, estimating thousands of correlations with small sample sizes often provokes biased results. Of course, the results improve when the real 
                        
                           
                              α

                      is used. In order to avoid the 
                        
                           
                              α

                      estimation, a grid of different possibilities can be fixed and, by arguing as in de Uña-Álvarez (2012), to choose an adequate one among the different results. This option was exploited in the analysis of the three considered real datasets.

One important weakness of the approximation (7) is that even for large sample sizes and

                      still appears. This random function, strongly related to the observed number of rejections, makes the cut-off point estimated for the SGoF to be also strongly related to the observed number of rejections. However, when some null hypotheses are false, and despite of its conservativeness, the method detects effects when the rejection proportion is larger than the expected one under

In short, the provided approximation (7) reports good results for a variety of correlation matrices. Although this approximation may fail when

Large-scale testing is a really exciting problem. The number of papers which deal with this topic is sharply increasing and, during the review process of this document, several new outcomes have been published. In particular, we point out a simulation study focused on the behavior of the Beta–Binomial SGoF method Castro-Conde and de Uña-Álvarez (2013), and a R package, called sgof: Multiple hypotheses testing and freely downloadable at http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/web/packages/sgof/index.html, which computes the BB-SGoF and related procedures.
