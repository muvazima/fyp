                  We test the lower bound for a static remanufacturing system with returns proposed by Feng and Viswanathan (2014) against two heuristics proposed by Choi et al. (2007) and Schulz and Voigt (2014). A numerical study with 81,000 instances concludes that the lower bound always holds for the Choi et al. (2007) heuristic, but does not hold for 45 percent of all tested instances compared to the Schulz and Voigt (2014) heuristic. In these 45 percent, the average deviation from the lower bound is 4 percent with a maximum deviation of 14.9 percent. The main difference between the two analyzed heuristics is that the Choi et al. heuristic applies equally sized manufacturing and remanufacturing batches (which is also assumed to hold in the proposed lower bound), while Schulz and Voigt present a heuristic in which the respective remanufacturing batch sizes may vary. In contrast to Feng and Viswanathan (2014), we conclude that management should be cautious to use too simple policy structures when obtaining a solution for a static remanufacturing system with product returns.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     Feng and Viswanathan (2014) (in the following referred to as FV) derive in their contribution performance bounds for a static manufacturing system with product returns and claim that “the optimal integer ratio policy for the problem obtains a solution whose cost is at most 1.5 percent more than the lower bound.” In this note, we test the proposed performance bounds against the heuristics proposed by Schulz and Voigt (2014) and Choi et al. (2007) and find that the lower bounds do not hold in 36,450 of 81,000 tested instances. For these instances, the average deviation from the lower bound is 4 percent with a maximum deviation of 14.9 percent.

Our numerical experiments show that the proposed bounds hold as long as the heuristic policy belongs to the class of heuristics in which all manufacturing batches and remanufacturing batches are equally sized as in Choi et al. (2007). However, once this assumption is lifted as in the heuristic proposed by Schulz and Voigt (2014) which allows remanufacturing batch sizes to vary within a cycle, we observe a lower total cost compared to the proposed lower bound. Thus, our numerical experiments indicate that the proposed lower bound is only valid among the policy classes with equally sized batches for manufacturing and remanufacturing and is, therefore, not a lower bound for the overall problem.

The remaining note is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly summarize the notation and model setup used. Section 3 presents a numerical example for which the heuristic proposed by Schulz and Voigt (2014) gives a smaller total cost compared to the lower bound proposed by FV. We summarize the results of a large numerical study with 81,000 instances in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 discusses the implications of our findings.


We use the same notation as in Feng and Viswanathan (2014) (see Table 1
                     ). We only consider the specific case of an infinite production rate (i.e. p = ∞) and an infinite recovery rate (i.e. r = ∞) since it turns out that the main massage of this note can already be made for this simplistic case. The demand rate for the item is D and the return rate for remanufacturable items is fD with 0 < f < 1. The setup cost for remanufacturing is Kr
                      and for manufacturing (production) Kp
                     . The holding cost rates for returned items and new items (serviceables) are hr
                      and hs
                     , respectively. Moreover, we denote the number of manufacturing setups in a cycle by P and the number of remanufacturing setups per cycle by R. A common assumption in this field of research (which is also used in the following) is to split the infinite planning horizon into identical cycles with length T that are repeated continuously. Thus, each cycle contains P manufacturing batches and R remanufacturing batches. A policy that results from the heuristic of Schulz and Voigt (2014) is referred to as a (P, R)
                        S
                     -policy. On the other hand, a policy that results from the Choi et al. (2007)-heuristic is referred to as a (P, R)
                        C
                     -policy. We refer to the original articles for a detailed description of the respective heuristics and the corresponding solution finding processes. We only point out that the main difference between the approaches is the assumption regarding the stationarity of remanufacturing batches within a cycle. While a (P, R)
                        C
                     -policy assumes that all (re)manufacturing batches in a cycle are equally sized, the remanufacturing batch sizes may vary in a (P, R)
                        S
                     -policy.

We use the following parameters to prove by example that the lower bound by FV does not hold: hr
                      = 28, hs
                      = 40, D = 100, f = 0.5, Kp
                      = 400 and Kr
                      = 100. In order to compute the lower bound, formulae (1)–(12) from the online appendix are applied. We get

                     P* = 1 and R* = 2. The lower bound would therefore have a total cost of 1749.29. The same total cost is determined when applying the (P, R)
                        C
                      policy approach which results in an optimal (1, 2)
                        C
                     -policy. Yet, the best (P, R)
                        S
                     -policy computes a total cost of 1673.32 with a (1, 2)
                        S
                     -policy. The total unit costs and cycle lengths for both policies are presented in Table 2
                     .

In the following, both solutions are compared in detail to increase transparency on how the respective total costs are derived (see Fig. 1
                     ). To achieve this goal, we compute the inventory positions by determining their geometrical size. The resulting holding cost and fixed cost per cycle must be divided by the optimal cycle length, in order to get the average cost per period. In the end, we compare the average cost per period from the lower bound with the average cost per period of the two heuristic policy structures. Note that we are reporting up to ten digits, since the optimal costs in the respective benchmarks turn out to be sensitive.

                      The optimal policy determined by the heuristic of Choi et al. (2007) is depicted in Fig. 1a. It has an optimal cycle length of T* = 0.686 time units (see the respective articles for the derivation of the optimal cycle length). Both remanufacturing batch sizes are, thus,

                     . In total, five areas A to E have to be computed to determine the total holding cost.


                     Area A: The peak of the triangle is reached after 0.5145 time units. During this time, fD × 0.5145 = 25.725 units return. The area of the triangle can therefore be computed by multiplying half its peak (i.e., 25.725 units/2) with its length of 0.5145 time units. Thus, the cumulated inventory depicted by area A is 6.61775625. At the end of this triangle, a remanufacturing batch is initiated with 17.15 units to be remanufactured.


                     Area B: Area B consists of a rectangle and a triangle. The rectangle can be computed by the length of the remanufacturing phase (0.1715 time units) multiplied with the starting inventory (i.e. 25.725 − 17.15 = 8.575). Thus, the area of the rectangle is 0.1715 × 8.575 = 1.4706125. The triangle results from the remanufacturing phase length (0.1715 time units) multiplied with the inventory that accumulates during this time at rate fD divided by 2, i.e.,

                     . Thus, the cumulated inventory depicted by area B is 2.20591875.


                     Areas C and E: Areas C and E are identical. DfT = 34.3 units have to be remanufactured in each cycle. Thus,

                      units need to be remanufactured in each batch. The area of the triangle can, hence, be computed by multiplying this batch size with the time in which the remanufacturing batch is depleted,

                              R
                           
                           =
                           0.1715
                           ,
                        
                      and dividing by 2. Thus, the cumulated inventory depicted by area C is 1.4706125. Of course, the same cumulated area is computed for area E.


                     Area D: To fulfill the demand for final products, D(1 − f)T = 100 × 0.5 × 0.686 = 34.3 units have to be manufactured in each cycle. The area of the resulting triangle can be computed by multiplying this batch size with the time of depletion (i.e., (1 − f)T = 0.343) and dividing by 2. We get for area D a cumulated inventory of 5.88245 units.

The total inventory holding cost result from multiplying the respective areas with the respective holding cost, hs
                      and hr
                     , and summing them up. It follows HC = 28 × (areas A + B) + 40 × (areas C + D + E) = 28 × 8.823675 + 40 × 8.823675 = 600.0099. The fixed cost for this policy structure is FC = RKr
                      + PKp
                      = 2 × 100 + 400 = 600. In an optimal cycle, both holding and fixed cost have to be equal. The small deviation can be explained because the optimal cycle length of 0.686 has been rounded to three digits in advance. Computing the overall average cost gives

                     -policy is depicted in Fig. 1b. The optimal cycle length is T* = 0.717 and, hence, fdT = 0.5 × 100 × 0.717 = 35.85 must be (re)manufactured. The algorithm introduced in Schulz and Voigt (2014) delivers a size of the first remanufacturing batch of 11.95 and a size of the second remanufacturing batch of 23.90. To determine the total holding cost, areas F to J have to be calculated.

                      time units. Area F results from multiplying this peak (i.e., 0.478 × 100 × 0.5 = 23.9) with the time for depletion of the first remanufacturing and the first manufacturing batch (i.e., 0.478) and dividing the result by 2. We get for area F a cumulated inventory of 5.7121 units.


                     Area G: Since the used product inventory is fully depleted after 0.478 time units, it increases in the next T* − 0.478 = 0.239 time units at a rate of fD resulting in a cumulated inventory depicted by area G of

                        Note, in Fig. 1b the first remanufacturing batch is the peak of area H. This is, because each cycle starts by definition with a remanufacturing batch that has exactly the size of the used product inventory at the end of a cycle.

                     Area I: The manufacturing batch size is 35.85. Multiplying with the time of depletion (i.e., 0.3585) and dividing by 2 gives a cumulated inventory for area I of 6.4261125 units.


                     Area J: The second remanufacturing batch has a size of 23.9. Multiplied by the time of depletion (i.e., 0.239) and dividing by 2 gives cumulated inventory for area J of 2.85605.

The total inventory holding cost are HC = 28 × (areas F + G) + 40 × (areas H + I + J) = 28 × 7.140125 + 40 × 9.996175 = 599.7705. Adding the fixed cost of FC = RKr

It can be seen that the (P, R)
                        S
                     -policy structure leads to lower inventory levels in the used product inventory because the used product inventory is depleted in every subcycle. Due to the relatively large holding cost rate for the used product inventory compared to the final product inventory, the (P, R)
                        S
                     -policy outperforms the (P, R)
                        C
                     -policy. Although one example suffices to prove by contradiction that the lower bound proposed by FV is not accurate for the overall problem of minimizing the average total cost in a remanufacturing system with returns, we have tested this lower bound in an extensive test environment. This extensive test provides some additional insights under what circumstances the lower bound provides good predictions for the system performance.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

In order to test the lower bound, the experimental design of Schulz and Voigt (2014)’s full factorial study is employed. The following Table 3
                     lists all relevant parameters including their lower and upper bounds as well as the difference between two consecutive parameter values. From this experimental design, 81,000 instance can be created in total and have been tested.

Our results show that the lower bound does not hold in 45 percent of the tested instances. In all of these instances the best heuristic policy found was a (P, R)
                        S
                     -policy. This result indicates that the lower bound holds for the class of policies in which all manufacturing batches and all remanufacturing batches are equally sized (i.e., if we only considered the (P, R)
                        C
                      heuristic).

As highlighted in Schulz and Voigt (2014), the ratio of the holding cost for used products and finished products has a significant impact on the instances in which the (P, R)
                        S
                     -policy outperforms other policies. Table 4
                     presents two results for the respective 
                        
                           
                              h
                              r
                           
                           
                              h
                              s
                           
                        
                     -ratios, the fraction of instances in which the lower bound by FV does not hold as well as the average deviation from the lower bound. The data clearly indicates that both the number of instances with lower total cost than in the lower bound as well as the average deviation are increasing as closer hr
                      gets to hs
                     . This result is an indicator that the lower bound proposed by FV overstates the average inventory in the used product inventory since with increasing ratios the holding cost for used products are (ceteris paribus) increasing.

Another important issue of the analysis narrows down to whether mistakes only occur in one of the two discussed lower bounds in FV (i.e.,

Equally interesting is analyzing the question on whether P > R or P ≤ R is the best heuristic policy. Not surprisingly, we observe R ≥ P in all cases with a superior (P, R)
                        S
                      performance. This shows that the (P, R)
                        S
                      policy outperforms the (P, R)
                        C
                      policy (and the corresponding lower bound by FV), the more important the remanufacturing decisions become in a cycle, i.e., the more remanufacturing batches a scheduled in a cycle.

This contribution presents an extensive numerical study and shows that the lower bound proposed by Feng and Viswanathan (2014) seemingly holds for the class of policies in which all manufacturing batches and remanufacturing are equally sized. The implications are from a managerial perspective very important, as our analysis highlights that performance losses can be substantial when managers only restrict to simple policy structures. While Feng and Viswanathan (2014) argue that performance losses will never be higher than 1.5 percent when management restricts to the best (P, 1) or (1, R)-policy, our work shows that performance losses may be substantially higher for certain parameter classes.

Our results show that there seems to be a systematic mistake in the analysis, since we find deviations in both potential candidates for the lower bound (i.e., 
                        
                           Z
                           L

                      and 
                        
                           Z
                           L
                           2
                        
                     ). Our analysis of 81,000 instances indicates that the assumptions imposed by Feng and Viswanathan (2014) are not critical if there are more manufacturing batches than remanufacturing batches in a cycle (i.e., as long as P > R). However, in all other cases we find many instances (i.e., approx. 45 percent) in which the heuristic proposed by Schulz and Voigt (2014) outperforms the proposed lower bound.

Our analysis indicates that the approach by Feng and Viswanathan (2014) overstates the average inventory of used products. We tested several ad-hoc modifications of the proposed lower bound (e.g., adjusting the average used product inventory), but failed to find (intuitive) modifications that provide accurate lower bounds for the problem in our 81,000 tested instances. We conjecture that the main problem stems from the assumption that all batches are equally sized in the lower bound, since the lower bound seemingly (i.e., in our 81,000 tested instances) holds for the Choi et al. (2007) policy with equally sized batches. While the assumption of equally sized (re)manufacturing batches in the lower bound seems intuitive, it is not clear how the optimal policy will react to non-integer batches, i.e., how non-integer batches will be distributed over the optimal cycle. As an example, in the heuristic proposed by Schulz and Voigt (2014), the used product inventory is depleted in every remanufacturing setup. Thus, average inventory positions do heavily depend on the policy structure. The policy structures, in turn, do heavily depend on the system parameters like fixed cost and holding cost. Concluding, we believe that it is an interesting and challenging task for future research to derive accurate lower bounds for the discussed manufacturing system with returns when batch sizes are not equally sized.
