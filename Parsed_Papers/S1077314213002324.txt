                  Based on local spline embedding (LSE) and maximum margin criterion (MMC), two orthogonal locally discriminant spline embedding techniques (OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II) are proposed for plant leaf recognition in this paper. By OLDSE-I or OLDSE-II, the plant leaf images are mapped into a leaf subspace for analysis, which can detect the essential leaf manifold structure. Different from principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) which can only deal with flat Euclidean structures of plant leaf space, OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II not only inherit the advantages of local spline embedding (LSE), but makes full use of class information to improve discriminant power by introducing translation and rescaling models. The proposed OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II methods are applied to recognize the plant leaf and are examined using the ICL-PlantLeaf and Swedish plant leaf image databases. The numerical results show compared with MMC, LDA, SLPP, and LDSE, the proposed OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II methods can achieve higher recognition rate.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Plant recognition based on leaf images is very important and necessary to ecological protection and automatic plant recognition system. It is well known that how to validly extract classification features is central to the plant recognition based on leaf images. Currently, the widely used features for plant recognition based on leaf image can be divided into color, shape, and texture features [1–13]. Plant recognition based on leaf color feature is one of the most widely used techniques. The earliest plant recognition studies used color as comparing feature between images [1–3]. A simple color similarity between two images can be measured by comparing their color histograms. More complex color features may involve looking into spatial relationship of multiple colors or looking at the color histograms in automatically segmented regions of the leaf image. Shape is one of the most important characteristic of the plant leaf. Two basic approaches to shape analysis exist: region-based and boundary-based (contour-based) [4]. Region-based systems typically use moment descriptors [5] that include geometrical moments, Zernike moments and Legendre moments [4]. Boundary-based systems use the contour of the objects and usually give better results for leaf images that are distinguishable by their contours. Curvature scale space methods and deformable templates [6] are some of the common techniques used in contour-based shape recognition. Texture can be described as the spatial patterns formed by the surface characteristics of a leaf that manifests itself as color or grayscale variations in the image. Texture analysis and matching can be done in spatial or frequency domain. Commonly used texture features are gray-level co-occurrence matrices, local binary patterns, Markov random fields, and Gabor wavelets [7–11]. Although they have proven to be effective in some real-world applications, these techniques have not fully considered the following characteristics of plant leaf image data: (1) Diversity. Plant leaf images differ from each other in a thousand ways. They vary with period, location, and illumination conditions, and contain a lot of noise and outliers. (2) Holism. The existing methods only concentrate on feature extraction of every single leaf images while not considering the leaf images as a whole to conduct dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. (3) Geometry. They neglect the intrinsic geometrical structures of leaf image subspace. It inevitably increases the difference of the intra-class leaf images and decreases the difference of the inter-class leaf images simultaneously, which will lead to a heavy weakening of their performances on plant recognition. Moreover, most of these methods are computationally expensive, thus limiting their utility in plant leaf image data sets.

Over the last decade, a large number of nonlinear manifold learning algorithms have been proposed under the assumption that the input data set lies on or near some low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional unorganized Euclidean space. Among the most well known are isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP) [14], locally linear embedding (LLE) [15–16], Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) [17], Hessian-based locally linear embedding (HLLE) [18], maximum variance unfolding (MVU) [19], local tangent space alignment (LTSA) [20], and local spline embedding (LSE) [21]. Each manifold learning algorithm attempts to preserve a different geometrical property of the underlying manifold. Local approaches such as LLE, HLLE, LE, LTSA, and LSE aim to preserve the proximity relationship among the data, while global approaches like ISOMAP aim to preserve the metrics at all scales. These nonlinear methods yield impressive results on some benchmark artificial and real world data sets due to their nonlinear nature, geometric intuition, and computational feasibility.

An important advantage of manifold learning [14–21] compared with conventional approaches concerns how the data are treated mathematically. Conventional approaches typically produce a smaller data space from linear combinations of the original data. One common example is PCA which seeks a low-dimensional linear subspace spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of all samples. However, for plant leaf images, the assumption of global linearity is a severe constraint since they are sensitive to period, location, and illumination conditions and there is no reason to believe that the leaf image data are linearly separable from each other. Manifold learning approaches recognize this fact and allow the data to be nonlinearly related, which results in the fact that manifold learning approaches can much more accurately capture the proper information relationships among the data thus allowing for accurate recognition. Fig. 1
                         shows a simple example that 150 leaf images of two kinds of plants are mapped into two-dimensional subspace by local spline embedding (LSE). The size of each image is 32×32 pixels, with 256 gray-levels per pixel. Thus, each leaf image is represented by a point in the 1024-dimensional ambient space. The left and right leaf images respectively correspond to the points with green and cyan circles in the two-dimensional embedding subspace. As can be seen, the leaf images are divided into two parts. The circles and the asterisks represent leaf images of different classes. It can be clearly seen that the sample points of each class exhibit a sub-manifold distribution. The results demonstrate that LSE can successfully find the discriminative directions, but the directions are not optimal for leaf recognition task. This is because in trying to preserve local structure in the embedding, the LSE implicitly emphasizes the natural clusters in the data. More importantly, LSE is capable of capturing the intrinsic leaf manifold structure to some extent.

In this study, we take an alternative view of manifold learning to develop two orthogonal locally discriminant spline embedding methods (OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II) for plant leaf recognition. The goal of OLDSE-I or OLDSE-II is to map the plant leaf images into a plant leaf subspace for analysis. Different from principal component analysis (PCA) [22] and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [23] which can only deal with flat Euclidean structures of plant leaf space, The OLDSE-I/OLDSE-II finds an embedding that not only inherits the advantages of local spline embedding (LSE) [21] which uses local neighborhoods as a representation of the local geometry so as to preserve the local structure, but makes full use of class information to improve discriminant power by introducing translation and rescaling models. In this way, a plant leaf subspace that best detects the essential plant leaf manifold structure can be obtained. It is worthwhile to highlight several aspects of the proposed approaches here:
                           
                              (1)
                              An efficient subspace learning algorithm for plant recognition should be able to discover the nonlinear manifold structure of the leaf image space. Our proposed OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II algorithms explicitly considers the intrinsic leaf manifold structure which is modeled by an adjacency graph.

OLDSE-I/OLDSE-II takes local structure and discriminant information into consideration simultaneously and attempts to manage the trade-off between LSE, which is based mainly on preserving local geometry and maximum margin criterion (MMC), which emphasizes discriminant power.

OLDSE-I/OLDSE-II shares some similar properties to LSE, such as a local neighborhood preserving character. However, their objective functions are ultimately different. OLDSE-I/OLDSE-II computes an explicit linear mapping from the input space to the reduced space, while in LSE, the mapping is implicit and it is not clear how new data samples can be embedded.

Although OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II seek to find a set of orthogonal basis functions and further improve their recognition accuracy, they use different orthogonalization processes in which their fundamental difference lies.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the LSE algorithms. In Section 3, the OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II algorithms are developed. A variety of the experimental results are presented in Section 4. Finally, we provide some concluding remarks and future work in Section 5.

LSE [21] is a recently proposed manifold learning method for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. This method is developed from the framework of part optimization and whole alignment. Each data point is represented in different local coordinate systems by part optimization. But its global coordinate should be maintained unique. Whole spline alignment is used to achieve this goal. The outline of LSE can be summarized as follows:

Because Yi
                      is unknown, the desirable splines not only can satisfy the conditions in Eq. (3) but also make the reconstruction error to be formulated explicitly in terms of Yi
                     . The spline developed in Sobolev space meets our tasks. Without loss of generality, we consider how to deal with one coordinate component by fixing the upper script r in (3). For clarity, we use simple notations to replace

                     =
                     I. Then, the minimum of E(Y) for the d -dimensional global embedding is given by the d eigenvectors of the matrix M, corresponding to the 2nd to (d

For visualization, the goal of dimensionality reduction methods is to project the original data set into a low-dimensional space that faithfully preserves the intrinsic structure as well as possible, while for classification, it aims to map the data into a feature space in which the samples from different classes could be clearly separated. LSE [21] is an effective dimensionality reduction method to visualize the high dimensional data in 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional space. However, some limitations are exposed when it is applied to recognition tasks. One is the out-of-sample problem. LSE can yield an embedding directly based on the training data set but, because of the implicitness of the nonlinear map, when applied to a new sample, they cannot find the sample’s image in the embedding space. Another is that the classical LSE neglects the class information, which will inevitably impair their performances on pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose two orthogonal locally discriminant spline embedding techniques (OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II). OLDSE-I/OLDSE-II aims to take full advantage of class information and orthogonal subspace to improve discriminant power of the original LSE. On the one hand, we encode discriminant information in preserving local geometrical structure of the data samples by linear operators such as translation, rescaling, and rotation. Here, maximum margin criterion (MMC) [26] is incorporated to explore the optimal linear operators. Specifically, we find a linear transformation V which projects the high-dimensional data samples on a low-dimensional space. The dimensionality reduction matrix V is obtained by optimizing an objective function, which holds the strong discriminant power of MMC and at the same time preserve the intrinsic geometry of the neighbors as LSE in the reduced space. On the other hand, in order to further improve the discriminability of the proposed method, we also use the Gram–Schmidt or Duchene–Leclercq orthogonalization step for obtaining orthogonal basis functions which can provide a more faithful representation for the input data.

In order to overcome the out-of-sample problem, an explicit linear mapping from X to Y, i.e. Y
                        =
                        VTX, is imposed. Thus the objective function for the original LSE can be converted to the following form:

Once linear transformation matrix V is determined, mapping new data points to the lower dimensional space becomes trivial. Considering a new test data sample xt
                         that needs to be mapped, the test sample is projected onto the subspace using the dimensionality reduction matrix V. So we have:
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       y
                                    
                                    
                                       t
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 
                                    
                                       V
                                    
                                    
                                       T
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       x
                                    
                                    
                                       t
                                    
                                 
                                 .
                              
                           
                        Therefore, mapping the new data point reduces to a simple matrix vector product.

Based on the analysis mentioned above, it can be found that the linear approximation to the original LSE seeks to preserve local structure defined by the nearest neighbors as much as possible. It often fails to preserve within-class local geometry, which is very important for pattern classification, because the nearest neighbors may belong to different classes due to influence of complex variations, such as period, location, and illumination conditions. Thus, in order to improve its classification ability, we attempt to construct different translation and rescaling models for each class. Let’s use the same example as in Fig. 1 to illustrate this point. Fig. 2
                         shows two-dimensional embedding of plant leaf images after translation, where it can be seen that the discriminability is significantly improved. Moreover, a rescaling coefficient is introduced to the proposed algorithm and the discriminability is also improved, which can be found in Fig. 3
                        . It should be noted that building appropriate translation and rescaling models for each class can improve the recognition accuracy of the classical LSE significantly. However, when applying the proposed algorithm to real world data, how to explore the optimal translation vectors and rescaling coefficient is still an open problem. In this study, MMC is adopted to find the optimal translation vectors and rescaling coefficient, which will be explored by transformation.

It is reasonable to use MMC in our study. On the one hand, MMC makes it possible to implicitly model approximately optimal translation and rescaling operators. On the other hand, comparing MMC with the classical LDA, the former avoids calculating the inverse within-class scatter, i.e. (Sw
                        )−1
                        Sb
                         is substituted by Sb
                        
                        −
                        Sw
                        . This can not only make the computation more efficient but avoid the small sample size (SSS) problem of the within-class scatter.

In order to obtain optimal linear discriminant embedding, we produce an explicitly linear mapping from X to Y, i.e. Y
                        =
                        VTX. This linear transformation matrix V is obtained by optimizing an objective function, which captures the discrepancy of the local geometries in the reduced space and introduces the maximum margin criterion (MMC) simultaneously. That is to say, this objective optimization satisfies Eqs. (16) and (19). Then, the problem can be written as the following multi-object optimized problem:

In contrast to the original LSE, our proposed method should neglect this constraint, that is to say, we should make use of the translational factor to maximize the average margin between different classes in the embedded space. So the above optimization can be solved as the following constrained objective function:

We call the new linear subspace method as locally discriminant spline embedding (LDSE). In practical problems, one often suffers from the difficulty that XXT
                         is singular. This stems from the fact that sometimes the number of samples in the training set is much smaller than the dimension of each data point. To address the complication of a singular XXT
                        , a PCA step is adopted to project the data set to a PCA subspace so that the resulting matrix XXT
                         is nonsingular.

It is well known that the generalized eigenvectors obtained by solving Eq. (27) are nonorthogonal. The two methods to produce orthogonal basis vectors are discussed in the following.

We use the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization to produce orthogonal basis vectors, which is called OLDSE-I. Set g

                            can be computed as follows:

It is easy to check that v
                           1 is the eigenvector of the generalized eigenproblem

                           associated with the smallest eigenvalue. Since XXT
                            is always nonsingular in the PCA subspace, v
                           1 is the eigenvector of the matrix (XXT

In this section, we provide an analysis of the computational complexity of OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II as a function of the number of samples n,the input dimension D,the intrinsic dimension d,and other related factors if necessary. In the tables, k is the number of nearest neighbors, p denotes the number of iterations, and l indicates the number of polynomials in a spline function. The complexity of OLDSE-I or OLDSE-II is dominated by three parts: nearest neighbor graph construction, alignment matrix manipulation, and solving orthogonal eigenvectors. First, OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II performs nearest neighbor searches, which has computational complexity O(Dn

This section evaluates the performance of the proposed OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II compared with four representative algorithms, i.e., MMC [26], LDA [23], SLPP (LPP2 in [28]), and locally discriminant spline embedding (LDSE), on two plant leaf image databases, i.e., ICL-PlantLeaf

                      and Swedish leaf [29]. Among these algorithms, SLPP, LDSE, OLDSE-I, and OLDSE-II are manifold learning-based algorithms. The original images were normalized such that the region of interest (ROI) was captured and properly aligned, then the leaf areas were cropped into the final images for extracting the features. In addition, we converted the original color images into gray level images. The size of each cropped image is 32×32 pixels with 256 gray levels per pixel. Thus, each image is represented by a 1024-dimension vector in the corresponding image space. The values for the 1024-dimensional vector range from 0 to 255. No further preprocessing is done.

It is well known that the success of manifold learning methods depends greatly on selecting an appropriate neighborhood size. However, it is an open problem how to choose a suitable value of this parameter in constructing a neighborhood graph. Choosing a large neighborhood might result in “short-circuit” edges (see Fig. 4
                     a) which drastically destroy the topological connectivity of the original manifold data. In contrast, choosing a small neighborhood might separate the manifold into a large number of disconnected regions (see Fig. 4b).

With regard to estimation of neighborhood size, many methods have been proposed. Samko et al. [30] made use of residual variance to find the global optimal neighborhood. Wen et al. [31] used graph algebra to optimize neighborhood selection. Balasubramanian et al. [32] selected an appropriate neighborhood based on a trade-off between maximizing the number of points captured in the Euclidean embedding and minimizing the distortion of the geodesic distance estimates. Clearly, these methods are costly and cumbersome as they have to run repeatedly by trial-and-error. Moreover, there may be no global optimal neighborhood for data sets with large curvature. In this work, we constructed the neighborhood for samples of known classes in the same way as UDP algorithm [33]. The k nearest neighborhood parameter for constructing the nearest neighbor graph in SLPP, LDSE, OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II can be chosen as k
                     =
                     l
                     –1, where l denotes the number of training samples per class. The justification for this choice is that the l samples of the same class should be located in the same local geometrical structure provided that within-class samples are well clustered in the observation space.

The scaling parameter β is set to be 1. Note that all algorithms involve a PCA phase. In this phase, we kept 100 percent image energy and selected all principal components corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalues for each method. Different pattern classifiers have been applied for face recognition, including KNN, Bayesian, Support Vector Machine, etc. In this study, we adopt the 1-NN classifier for its simplicity.

In short, the recognition process of plant leaf images has three steps. First, we calculate the feature subspace from the training set of plant leaf images by the OLDSE-I/OLDSE-II algorithm; then the new plant leaf image to be identified is projected into this subspace; finally, the new plant leaf image is identified by the 1-NN classifier.

The ICL-PlantLeaf database was constructed at the Intelligent Computing Laboratory (ICL) of Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It contains more than 20,000 leaf images of 221 plant species. The images were captured at different periods, and have different locations and natural illuminations. In this experiment, we employed a subset containing 480 leaf images of 16 classes (hence, 30 leaf images for each species). These plant leaf images were taken at 3 different periods, and have 5 different locations which determine 5 different natural illuminations. The representative leaf images of 16 plant species are shown in Fig. 5
                        . Fig. 6
                         shows sample images of one species.

Firstly, we randomly select the sixteen images as training sets and the rest images as testing sets for each class. The training sets were used to learn the low-dimensional subspace with the projection matrix. The testing sets were used to report the final recognition accuracy. During the testing phases, the 1NN classifier was used. Note that, for LDA, there are at most c
                        −1 nonzero generalized eigenvalues, and so an upper bound on the dimension of the reduced space is c
                        −1. Fig. 7
                         shows the best mean recognition rates for 10 times. It can be found that our proposed method outperforms the other techniques. We investigate the maximal average recognition accuracy at 9, 9, 28, 26, 29, and 250 dimensions for MMC, LDA, SLPP, LDSE, OLDSE-I, and OLDSE-II, respectively. The best mean recognition rates of MMC, LDA, SLPP, LDSE, OLDSE-I, and OLDSE-II are 91.16(±0.98)%, 92.28(±1.71)%, 92.10 (±1.63)%, 93.71(±1.32)%, 94.11 (±1.07)%, and 94.29 (±2.25)%, respectively. The corresponding leaf image subspaces obtained by carrying out the methods mentioned above are called optimal leaf subspace for each method. Fig. 8
                         shows the recognition rate curves versus the variation of dimensions. In general, the performance of all these methods varies with the number of dimensions. At the beginning, the recognition rates improve with the increase of the dimensions. However, more dimensions will not lead to higher recognition rate after these methods attain the best results.

Secondly, the experiments are conducted to examine the effect of the training number on the performance. For each method, four random subsets with four, eight, twelve, sixteen images per species were selected for training. The rest of the database was used for testing. Such a trail was independently performed 10 times, and then the average recognition results were calculated. Table 4
                         shows the maximal average recognition accuracy, the corresponding standard deviations (std), the reduced dimensions, and the training time for MMC, LDA, SLPP, LDSE, OLDSE-I, and OLDSE-II. As can be seen, OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II consistently outperform the other four algorithms among all the cases. MMC achieves comparable performance to LDA. OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II perform better than LDSE, which demonstrates that the orthogonalization step of the basis function can improve the recognition rate. We can find that classical linear techniques such as MMC and LDA are performed much faster than the ones based on manifold learning. The gap between them on computational complexity is mainly determined by the nature of these two categories. In addition, although OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II almost achieve the same accuracy rate, the former is performed much faster than the latter. Furthermore, the computational cost of the OLDSE-II algorithm grows quickly as the size of the training set is increased.

The Swedish leaf data set comes from a leaf classification project at Linköping University and the Swedish Museum of Natural History [29]. The data set contains the isolated leaves from 15 different Swedish tree species, with 75 leaves per species. Fig. 9
                         shows the representative leaf images of 15 different Swedish trees. The 75 sample images of one species are illustrated in Fig. 10
                        .

According to the above analysis, we know that OLDSE-II improves its discriminant ability at the cost of affording intolerable computational complexity. Therefore, in this experiment, we did not use the OLDSE-II method for comparison. Four random subsets with ten, twenty, thirty, forty images per species were selected for training. The rest of the database was used for testing. We repeated these trails 10 times and computed the average results. The best result obtained in the optimal subspace and their corresponding standard deviations and dimensions for each method are shown in Table 5
                        . The recognition rates versus the variation of dimensions are illustrated in Fig. 11
                        .

From Table 3, we can see three main points. First, OLDSE-I outperforms the other algorithms among all the cases. For example, when the ten leaf images per species are used for training, OLDSE-I leads MMC, LDA, SLPP, and LDSE up to 1.12%, 4.05%, 3.11%, and 0.69%, respectively. Second, as more training samples are used in LDA, the performance approaches that of MMC. Third, the orthogonalization step contributes to improve the performance of LDSE. Fig. 11 shows that the discrimination power of OLDSE-I will be enhanced with the increase of final projected dimensionality, but it will not increase all the time. When the final dimensionality is higher than some threshold, the classification accuracy begins to decline.

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

Several experiments have been conducted on two different plant leaf databases. These experiments have revealed some interesting points:

Compared to MMC and LDA which attempt to preserve the global flat Euclidean structure, OLDSE-I/OLDSE-II attempts to preserve local neighboring geometry and discriminant structure of the data manifold. Therefore, when applied to complex nonlinear data, the proposed OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II can efficiently extract intrinsic features and achieve better performance.

OLDSE-I/OLDSE-II significantly outperforms SLPP, irrespective of the variations in training sample size. There are two reasons contributing to this phenomenon. On the one hand, although both SLPP and OLDSE-I/OLDSE-II are manifold learning-based algorithms and can deal with complex leaf manifold structures, they are intrinsically different in utilizing class information. SLPP only preserves the within-class neighboring geometry by artificially increasing the shift distances between samples belonging to different classes, but leaving them unchanged if samples are from the same class. In contrast to SLPP, OLDSE-I/OLDSE-II incorporates MMC to the original local spline embedding (LSE), which not only preserves the within-class local geometry but also makes the projected data points of different class far from each other. On the other hand, the orthogonalization step contributes to the noise removal and more locality preserving power. So OLDSE-I/OLDSE-II has stronger recognition power.

OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II almost achieve the same accuracy rates under all the experimental cases on the ICL-PlantLeaf database. The goal of the two proposed methods is to find an effective way which can hold the strong discriminant power of MMC and at the same time preserve the intrinsic geometry of the neighbors as LSE. Therefore, they share many similar properties. The main difference between OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II is the way the basis functions are orthogonalised.

Plant recognition based on leaf images has so far been an important and difficult task, especially for leaves with complicated background where some overlapping phenomena may exist. Although there are many algorithms for plant leaf recognition, the recognition rates are usually not high because of the complexity of plant leaf. Manifold learning algorithms are promising alternatives to conventional plant leaf recognition methods. In this paper, we develop two orthogonal locally discriminant spline embedding techniques (OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II) for plant leaf recognition. The projection of OLDSE-I or OLDSE-II can be viewed as a linear approximation of the nonlinear map that faithfully preserves both discriminant power and local geometrical structure hidden in the data. The experimental results show that OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II can achieve higher recognition rates than the other four algorithms. But they improves their discriminant ability at the cost of affording higher computational complexity compared with the classical linear techniques such as MMC and LDA.

However, we have to point out that finding the intrinsic dimensionality or degrees of freedom of plant leaf manifold contributes to capture the inherent attributes hidden in the high-dimensional unorganized observation space. It is well known that the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold is equal to the dimensionality of the local tangent space. Therefore, we will try to address this problem by estimating the dimensionality of the tangent space in the near future. In addition, OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II are linear, but they can be also performed in reproducing kernel Hilbert space which gives rise to nonlinear maps. The performance of OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II in reproducing kernel Hilbert space need to be further examined. Finally, the computational efficiency of OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II is another problem deserving further investigation.
