                  Evidence shows that a small number of line contingencies in power systems may cause a large-scale blackout due to the effects of cascading failures. With the development of new technologies and the growing number of heterogeneous participants, a modern/smart grid should be able to self-heal its internal disturbances by continually performing self-assessment to deter, detect, respond to and restore from unpredictable contingencies. Along this line, this research focuses on the problem of how to prevent the occurrence of cascading failures through load shedding by considering heterogeneous shedding costs of grid participants. A fair load-shedding algorithm is proposed to solve the problem in a decentralized manner, where a load-shedding participant need only monitor its own operational status and interact with its neighboring participants. Using an embedded feedback mechanism, the fair load-shedding algorithm can determine a marginal compensation price for each load-shedding participant in real time based on the proportional fairness criterion, without knowing the shedding costs of the participants. Such fairly determined compensations can help motivate loaders/generators to actively participate in the load shedding in the face of internal disturbances. Finally, the properties of the load-shedding algorithm are evaluated by carrying out an experimental study on the standard IEEE 30 bus system. The study will offer new insights into emergency planning and design improvement of self-healing smart grids.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Historical data shows that power systems have suffered from series of internal and external disturbances leading to various degrees of blackouts due to the effect of cascading failures [13,25,11]. An unpredictable blackout may severely affect activities reliant on electricity, such as railway and air transportation, water supply and hospital services. For example, during the U.S.-Canada blackout of August 14, 2003, over 400 transmission lines and 531 generating units tripped and approximately 50 million people were affected [31]. According to the modern grid initiative conducted by the National Energy Technology Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, many types of electrical generation (e.g., distributed energy resources), storage options [17], advanced metering infrastructure [12,21], as well as the active participation of consumers (e.g., demand-response programs), will in future be integrated to form a huge network of heterogeneous intelligent participants. This will introduce more rigorous reliability and security requirements due to the increasing interdependency and complexity of electric elements. In this context, this work is dedicated to tackling the problem of how to prevent the occurrence of cascading failures by taking into consideration autonomous behaviors and real-time interactions of heterogeneous participants in a smart grid.

Current reliability policies in power systems focus mainly on secure their normal operation under the most severe single or at most two contingencies, known as the

The results have shown that, to extend the policy to more tighter criteria (i.e.,

                     . Along this line, Street et al. [30] have proposed a computationally efficient framework using robust optimization, which does not depend on the size of the set of credible contingencies. However, in their work, the number of contingencies is required as prior knowledge. Recently, to avoid the computational burden, an inverse problem have been proposed, that is, to identify a small group of line contingencies that can trigger a blackout with a certain level of severity [26,10]. For example, Pinar et al. [26] have shown that such a problem can be approximately transferred to be a combinatorial network inhibition problem. Although the centralized optimization approaches adopted by above-mentioned studies are beneficial to analyze and improve system reliability, they are practically infeasible to control power flow in real time and handle multiple and simultaneous contingencies affecting several parts of a power system [27]. Therefore, it would be desirable to control power systems in a decentralized manner [33].

As Amin and Schewe [4] argued, a smart grid that automatically responds to emergencies could reduce the rising number of debilitating blackouts. The last few years have witnessed the development of new technologies, services and concepts to improve grid reliability and security in the face of system disturbances. Specifically, to facilitate the real-time monitoring and control of a grid, a series of advanced communication infrastructure, modern sensors, real-time simulation tools, as well as intelligent protection applications have been introduced. For example, advanced metering infrastructure, which is a means to facilitate two-way communications, will let utilities send real-time pricing signals to consumers and thus encourage consumers to implement direct control of demand-side management [12]. By doing so, a look-ahead simulation tool may send corrective instructions to control devices in less than half a second [4]. All these research and development efforts offer new opportunities for us to systematically design the “immune system” of a smart grid [21], where each individual participant continually performs self-assessments to deter, detect, respond to and restore grid components from unpredictable contingencies, and at the same time optimizing its performance in a decentralized manner [2,16].

Technically speaking, loads and generation in a smart grid must ultimately balance in real time to maintain stable. When line contingencies happen, the power flow will be redistributed to other lines based on the operational conditions of the system. Further, due to the physical capacity constraint of transmission lines, a small number of line contingencies may result in overload or failures in other lines. In this case, it would be necessary to shed some amount of loads and generation such that the power overload on other lines can be avoided. Specifically, this work aims to address two important issues to prevent the occurrence of cascading failures. The first and most important is to quickly shed a minimum amount of loads and generation to secure the grid after contingencies happen. This is because both under-shedding and over-shedding may cause unnecessary damages/costs for grid participants. The second is to make appropriate compensations for heterogeneous load-shedding participants. In current power systems, the compensations are usually determined by pre-signed contracts [32], which cannot reflect the real-time operational status of the system during the contingencies. As for the increasing number of active participants in a smart grid, it would be desirable to make compensation for individual participants by taking into consideration their heterogeneous shedding costs in real time. By doing so, if the compensations can cover the shedding costs for each individual participant, power loaders and generators will be motivated to participate in the autonomous load shedding process during line contingencies.

To mathematically formulate the above-mentioned two issues, this work first approximate the complex power flows in a smart grid using a dc model, i.e., the linearized active power flow model [14]. Then, the grid is modeled as a directed network, where each node represents a bus and each edge represents a transmission/distribution line. By doing so, the load-shedding problem is formulated as a network optimization problem for minimizing the total shed amount under the power flow constraints. Further, to fairly compensate load-shedding participants, the concept of load-shedding fairness is introduced based on the criterion of proportional fairness [29,23].

This work presents a fair load-shedding algorithm to solve the load-shedding problem in a decentralized manner. Based on the algorithm, each agent representing a loader/generator in a grid need only monitor the operational situations in their local areas and interact with their neighboring agents to coordinately determine the amount of loads/generation they should shed during line contingencies. From the perspective of grid security, there are two major steps in the algorithm: the first step aims to prevent the contingencies spreading to other lines by shedding a necessary amount of loads and generation, while the second step aims to recover as many shed loads/generation as possible to reduce the total amount of load shedding. From the perspective of load-shedding fairness, an embedded feedback mechanism is involved in the first step to facilitate communications among agents in terms of load-shedding compensations. Specifically, a focal loader (or generator) determines the total amount of compensations based on compensation requests from its downstream (or upstream) neighbors on the one hand, and adjust its request to its upstream (or downstream) neighbors on the other hand. During this process, the focal loader (or generator) does not need to know the exact cost functions of its downstream/upstream neighbors. By doing so, the marginal compensation prices for per unit of shed loads/generation can be collectively and fairly determined by all load-shedding participants.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section ‘Problem statement’, we briefly introduce the dc power flow model and formally formulate the load-shedding problem by taking into consideration the load-shedding fairness. In Section ‘A decentralized fair load-shedding algorithm’, we present the decentralized fair load-shedding algorithm associated with an embedded feedback mechanism. In Section ‘Experimental results and discussions’, we validate and demonstrate the properties of the algorithm by carrying out experimental studies on the standard IEEE 30 bus system. Finally, we conclude this paper and list several issues that are worth to be further pursued in Section ‘Conclusion and future work’.

In this section, we formally define the load-shedding problem in the face of line contingencies and present the issue of load-shedding fairness.

                         is constrained by its transmission capacity. When line contingencies happen, some demand may not be met due to the reduced transmission capability of the power grid. In this case, shedding some amount of loads by cutting off supply to some consumers is necessary to protect the transmission infrastructures and avoid cascading failures [9]. Furthermore, due to the constraint of load-generation balance, the same amount of generation should also be reduced by generators.

                        Here, Eq. (4) represents the power flow constraints under line contingencies. Moreover, the transmission constraint of a system consists of both the physical transmission capacity μ of each edge (i.e., Eq. (5)) and the angular constraint of the power flow model (i.e., Eq. (6)). Based on the dc power flow model, the power flow on

A useful property can be given based on the Lemma 1.1 proposed by Bienstock and Verma [10].

According to the lemma, if we could maintain the load-generation balance during the load-shedding process, there must be a solution for the phase angle

                         at each node 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    v
                                 
                                 
                                    i

                        . Hence, the load-shedding algorithms in this paper focus mainly on the maintenance of the load-generation balance instead of the adjustment of phase angles.

                        ’s downstream loaders may need to shed some amount of loads to prevent the cascading failures. While at the same time, i’s upstream generators need to reduce the same amount of power generation to maintain the load-generation balance. Here, we mainly introduce the load shedding of j’s downstream loaders. Suppose that the system will compensate each loader who participate in the load shedding with respect to the amount of loads it shed. Therefore, the total amount of compensations will depend on the participated loaders

                        . Since in reality loaders may evaluate their shedding costs differently, we use a function

The load-shedding fairness for generators can be defined in a similar way. Specifically, this work aims to solve the load-shedding problem in a decentralized manner, such that (i) the loaders and generators can respond to unpredictable line contingencies to prevent cascading failures; (ii) the load-generation balance can be maintained in real time; and (iii) a minimum amount of loads and generation can be fairly shed by heterogeneous participates.

In reality, the advanced communication technologies in a smart grid allows power buses to communicate and interact with each other to maintain grid reliability. Therefore, in this paper, we assume that there is an intelligent agent with certain computational capability located at each node of a given network

                     . Each agent updates its profile by communicating with its neighbors, and adaptively determines the amount of shed loads or generation when line contingencies happen.

An agent i’s profile consists of two components, i.e.,

With respect to load shedding, over-shedding of loads or generation may cause unnecessary shedding costs. Meanwhile, under-shedding of loads or generation may fail to prevent the cascading failures, which may cause tremendous damages. Therefore, the load-shedding algorithm in this paper complies with the following two steps:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Step 1 (Load shedding): The agents coordinate and interact with their neighbors to fairly reduce the same amount of loads and generation so as to re-balance the grid.


                                 Step 2 (Load recovery): The agents gradually recover as much as generation, and at the same time, maintain the load-generation balance.

In reality, loaders or generators may evaluate their shedding costs variously due to different factors such as the operational conditions and the contents of interruptible contracts [6]. Therefore, it would be helpful to appropriately compensate the potential loaders and generators so as to motivate them participate in the load shedding. In the following, we introduce an embedded feedback mechanism to determine the load-shedding compensations in real time based on the proportional fairness criterion, i.e., the optimization problem (7)–(9) in Section ‘The load-shedding fairness’.

Each agent in the load-shedding algorithm need only communicate with its upstream and downstream neighbors. Suppose a line contingency happens on

By doing so, agent j does not need to know the exact cost functions of its downstream neighbors to determine the compensations for per unit shed loads.

The above analysis shows that there is an embedded feedback mechanism for load-shedding fairness at the system level, where a focal agent (i) determines the marginal compensations for per unit of shed loads based on the requests from its downstream neighbors, and at the same time (ii) update its compensation request to its upstream neighbor based on the announced per unit compensation. An illustration of the interaction procedure between k and j for fair load shedding is shown in Fig. 2

Generally speaking, the load recovery problem is similar to the maximum flow problem in networks [18], which has been extended to other problems such as the maximum flow network interdiction problem [3], and the network inhibition problem related to the vulnerability of power grids [26]. However, the problem and algorithm for power grid are unique in terms of the following two aspects:
                           
                              •

                                  is accessible from g. The agents’ profiles and updating rules in our algorithms are particularly designed based on such an observation.

Since it is hard to predict the quantity of power flow on each edge before a stable state is reached, we must also prevent the overload on any edges when we recover the same amount of generation and loads for g and

                                  power flow. By doing so, no edge will overload during the recovery process.

Moreover, for the security reason, the recovery process must be implemented in a sequential order. According to the algorithm, the edge capacity in the residual network will significantly affect the recovery process. In other words, the residual capacity of each edge plays important roles in recovering loads and generation after the load shedding. This provides a new angle of view to make reliability policies in terms of managing the capacity of transmission lines.

In this section, we demonstrate the properties of the fair load-shedding algorithm by conducting an experimental study on the standard IEEE 30 bus system.

The system consists of 30 buses and 41 transmission lines. There are 6 generators, 6 transmission intermediaries and 18 loaders (see Fig. 3
                         in the work of Donde et al. [15]. To demonstrate the performance of the fair load-shedding algorithm, we slightly modify the values of active power injections and phase angles in Table 1
                         such that there is a natural power flow conservation at each bus. For the line reactance, we use the same values as described in the work of Donde et al. [15].

There are four parameters that should be specified in this paper:

Based on the concept of N-resilient grids [7], we consider over-provisioning of lines capacity by a constant fraction (the factor of safety K) of the initial power flow, i.e.,

We first investigate the relationship between the severity of a line contingency and the amount of shed loads needed to prevent cascading failures. When a line contingency happens, if no load-shedding algorithm is implemented, the contingency may cause the overload of other lines and trigger cascading failures. This work uses the number of overloaded lines caused by a line contingency to represent its severity. Fig. 3 shows the experimental results for each line contingency, where the factor of safety K is set to 1.5. The stair values show the number of overloaded lines caused by a corresponding line contingency, while the stem values show the amount of shed loads needed to prevent cascading failures. Intuitively, the less severe a line contingency is, the less loads it may need to shed. However, it is not the case. It can be observed that although lines 10 and 29 can only cause one line to be overload, the amount of loads needed to shed is more than those that may cause large number of overloaded lines (e.g., line 36). Actually, the shed loads depend on the position of the line in the system as well as the operational conditions of the system in the face of contingencies, which emphasizes the necessity of the real-time decentralized load-shedding algorithms. Moreover, some contingencies may cause only small number of overloaded lines at the earlier stage and suddenly result in a large number of overloaded lines. For example, the contingency on line 32 can cause the overload of lines 20 and 30. However, the failure of line 30 may further result in at least 8 overloaded lines. Such phenomenon can be verified by real-world blackouts that small failures trigger the failure of critical lines and further cause a large-scale blackout [5].

We then focus on demonstrating the properties of our algorithms for different scenarios of line contingencies. Donde et al. [15] have identified three transmission lines (i.e., lines 28, 29 and 36) as critical ones in the IEEE 30 bus system, whose removal may cause severe contingencies. Accordingly, this work implements the proposed algorithms for the same line failures and their combinations. Fig. 4
                         shows the load-shedding results and marginal compensation prices for some agents after the first step of the fair load-shedding algorithm for six scenarios of line contingencies, where the shedding ratio for each loader is calculated by the fraction between actual shed loads and its original loads. The black bars show the results of an algorithm without considering load-shedding fairness, while the white bars show the results of the fair load-shedding algorithm. It can be observed that there are more participants affording the required shed loads in the fair load-shedding algorithm (e.g., contingencies on Line 28, Line 29, Lines 28 and 29, and Lines 28 and 36). More importantly, the fair load-shedding algorithm can determine the marginal compensation price λ for each agent based on real-time power flows to achieve load-shedding fairness. For different focal agent in our embedded mechanism, there will be different marginal compensation prices. Based on the shedding cost functions adopted in our experiments, the more loads are required to shed, the lower the marginal compensation price will be. (Note that in reality, different loaders may have different shedding cost functions.) For example, for the line contingency on line 29 requires to shed all available loads of bus 21, the marginal compensation price 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    λ
                                 
                                 
                                    21
                                 
                              
                           
                         is equal to 1. While the compensation for other agent (e.g., 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    λ
                                 
                                 
                                    10
                                 
                              
                           
                        ) will be larger than 1. In this case, to achieve the criterion of proportional fairness, more compensations may be needed. Moreover, for different contingency scenarios, agents may have different marginal compensation prices. For example, in Fig. 4, the marginal compensation prices for bus 7 are different for scenarios Line 36 and Lines 28 and 36.

With respect to the convergence speed of the fair load-shedding algorithm, we carry out simulations for different step sizes, i.e., 
                           
                              γ
                              =
                           
                         0.2, 0.3 and 0.4. Fig. 5
                         demonstrates the updating results for contingencies on Line 28 and Line 36, respectively. It can be observed that the step size can significantly affect the convergence speed of the algorithm. The larger the step size is, the faster the algorithm converges. The results also show that even with different step size, the algorithm can finally converge to the same value. That is, the required loads can be shed successfully. However, we cannot immoderately use large step size to improve the convergence speed because our simulations also reveal that if the step size is too large, the algorithm will not converge any more. In reality, the step size can be determined based on expert experiences. We further study how line capacity affects the recovery results (i.e., step 2) of our load-shedding algorithms. Fig. 6
                         demonstrates the recovery processes for two contingency scenarios (i.e., Line 28, and Lines 28 and 36) with respect to different factor of safety 
                           
                              K
                              =
                              1.2
                              ,
                              1.3
                              ,
                              1.4
                           
                         and 1.5. The results show that after the contingencies happen, a large mount of loads are shed at the first round based on the first step in our algorithm. Subsequently, some load will be recovered gradually based on the second step in our algorithm. However, due to capacity limitation, not all loads can be recovered. The larger the line capacity is, the more loads will be recovered, the less loss the line contingencies will cause. Table 2
                         shows the final results of the fair load-shedding algorithm for six contingency scenarios with the factor of safety 
                           
                              K
                              =
                              1.5
                           
                        . The first column shows the contingencies happened on different line(s); the second column shows our load-shedding algorithms; the third column shows the amount of loads shed at each loader buses; and the final column shows the total amount of shed loads calculated by corresponding algorithms.

In this paper, we have concentrated on the problem of how to prevent the occurrence of cascading failures in a smart grid. Different from the practical under-voltage load shedding and under-frequency load shedding, we have paid special attention to the problem of how to shed the loads and generation before cascading failures happen. Specifically, the power flow dynamics is approximated by the dc power flow model. Then, the load-shedding problem is formulated as a constrained network optimization problem by taking into consideration the load-shedding fairness. Along this line, we have presented a decentralized fair load-shedding algorithm with an embedded feedback mechanism to (i) determine the load-shedding compensations in real time based on the proportional fairness criterion, and (ii) minimize the total amount of shed loads and generation after line contingencies happen. Experimental studies on the IEEE 30 bus system have been carried out to exhibit the properties and effectiveness of the algorithm.

The decentralized algorithm proposed in this paper may help gain more insights into the prevention of cascading failures in a smart grid. However, there are still some issues that are worth to be considered in the future:
                        
                           •
                           Although a focal agent in the embedded feedback mechanism do not need to know the exact shedding costs of each load-shedding participant, one important issue is how to motivate the participants to announce compensation requests based on their real shedding cost functions.

We have proposed one way to determine the load-shedding compensations based on the proportional fairness criterion, however, there may be other realistic ways to determine compensations in real time such as the criterion to reduce the total load-shedding costs.

Since it is difficult to obtain the reactance values of transmission lines in a real-world power system, in this paper, we have only simulated our algorithms in the IEEE 30 bus system. In the future, we would apply use our algorithms to analyze and evaluate the reliability of real-world power systems, such as the North American power grid [1,24], by approximately determining their system parameters.
