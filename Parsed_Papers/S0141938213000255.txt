                  This paper presents a new pixel circuit with all-p-type TFTs for AMOLED displays. The proposed pixel circuit can effectively compensate for the threshold-voltage shift of the driving TFT, the degradation of OLED and the parasitic resistance of the power supply line. And thus, the brightness uniformity of AMOLED displays can be enhanced. It is shown that the nonuniformity of the OLED current with an average value of 7.3% can be achieved by the proposed pixel circuit, while that of the conventional 2T1C pixel circuit is 73%. Moreover, a high contrast ratio can be also obtained by the proposed pixel circuit since there is no light emitting except for the emission period.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) displays have attracted much attention due to various advantages such as wide viewing angle, fast response time, low power consumption, light weight and high brightness [1]. The AMOLED is usually realized using low temperature polysilicon thin film transistors (LTPS TFTs) technology [2,3]. LTPS TFTs can be used not only for the pixel circuit of AMOLED but also for the integration of the peripheral driving circuits on the same substrate [4–6]. However, the threshold voltage of LTPS TFTs in the AMOLED panel differs from each other due to the random distribution of grain boundaries in the polysilicon material [7–9], which results in nonuniform gray-scale over the display area. Moreover, the threshold voltage of OLED degrades during long-term operation [10,11]. On the other hand, for the application in large display size, the voltage drop caused by the parasitic resistance through the power supply electrode should be also taken into account [12]. As a result, the conventional two-TFT one-Capacitance (2T1C) pixel circuit is not suitable for AMOLED displays with high quality due to its nonuniform OLED current. In the design of AMOLED pixel circuit, the compensation techniques should be developed to eliminate the effect of the threshold voltage shift of LTPS TFTs, the degradation of OLED and the parasitic resistance of power supply line on the brightness uniformity of AMOLED displays.

The driving schemes of pixel circuits can be classified into current programming methods [13–15] and voltage programming methods [16–18]. The current programming methods can compensate for both the mobility variations and the threshold voltage variations of TFTs. However, the voltage programming methods are more attractive to AMOLED display due to their fast programming time. Lin and Shieh [12] proposed an effective ac driving scheme to compensate the voltage drop caused by the intrinsic parasitic resistance of the power supply line. However, the threshold voltage shift of the driving TFT has not been compensated in the proposed pixel circuit. Lu et al. proposed a five-TFTs and one-Capacitor pixel circuit to compensate for the threshold voltage shift of the p-type driving TFTs and the drop in the supply voltage [19]. However, there is evident current flowing through OLED in the first two stages except for the emission stage, resulting in lowering the contrast ratio of AMOLED displays. Both the 4T1C pixel circuit developed by Ono and Kobayashi [20] and the 3T2C pixel circuit by Chaji and Nathan [21] can compensate for threshold voltage shift of the driving TFT. However, the proposed pixel circuit needs a programmed power supply which makes peripheral driving circuits of AMOLED displays be complicated. So they may be not suitable for AMOLED displays with high quality.

In this paper, we present a new pixel circuit with all p-type TFTs for enhancing the brightness uniformity of AMOLED displays. The proposed pixel circuit can not only compensate for the threshold voltage shift of the driving TFT and OLED, but also compensate for the voltage drop caused by the parasitic resistance of the power supply line, as well as has a high contrast ratio.


                     Fig. 1
                     a shows the schematic diagram of the proposed pixel circuit and its driving scheme. This circuit is composed of five TFTs and two storage capacitors (C
                     1 and C
                     2). Where T2 is used for a current source and the other TFTs are used for a switching function. V
                     data, V
                     dd, and V
                     ss represent a voltage data signal line, a constant voltage source line, and a ground line, respectively. V
                     ctr1, V
                     ctr2, and V
                     ctr3 are the control signal lines. The operational scheme of the proposed pixel circuit is divided into three stages as shown in Fig. 1b, which are described as follows.

(1) Initialization and threshold-voltage detecting period: V
                     ctr3 signal goes to high voltage to turn off T4, V
                     ctr1 and V
                     ctr2 goes to low voltage to turn on T1, T3 and T5. V
                     data is set as zero. The voltage at node C (VC
                     ) is charged up to V
                     dd through T5. Simultaneously, the voltage at node A (V
                     A) is charged up through T5, T2, and T3 until T2 is turned off. And then V
                     A is equal to V
                     dd
                     +
                     
                        V
                     
                     th, where V
                     th is the threshold voltage of the driving TFT (T2) and it is negative for p-type TFTs. Consequently, the gate-source voltage of T2 stored at C2 is the threshold voltage of T2, i.e., V
                     C2
                     =
                     V
                     gs
                     =
                     V
                     th. Note that, the OLED does not emit any light during this period since T5 is on and then VC
                      is charged up to prevent OLED from emitting.

(2) Data input period: V
                     ctr1 remains low and V
                     ctr3 remains high, and V
                     ctr2 signal goes to high voltage to turn off T3. During this period, a negative data voltage is input through T1. VC
                      remains to be V
                     dd. And then V
                     A will become V
                     dd
                     +
                     V

                     1/(C
                     1
                     +
                     C
                     2))V
                     data due to the capacitor coupling effect since C
                     1 is in series with C
                     2 with node A floating. Consequently, the stored voltage in C
                     2 will be maintained as V
                     th
                     +(C
                     1/(C
                     1
                     +
                     C
                     2))V
                     data until the data is updated in the following frame. It is obvious that there is still no current flowing through OLED in this period since T5 is on and T4 is off.

(3) Emission period: V
                     ctr2 remains high to keep T3 off, while V
                     ctr1 goes to high voltage to turn off T1 and T5 before V
                     ctr3 goes to low voltage to turn on T4. During this period, the OLED is turned on for emitting light. And then the voltage at node C will decrease to be V
                     dd–V
                     OLED, where V
                     OLED is the turn-on voltage of OLED in the emission period. Since the storage capacitor C
                     2 continues to sustain the gate-source voltage (V
                     gs) of T2 as V

                     +
                     C
                     2)) V
                     data, consequently, V
                     A becomes V
                     dd–V
                     OLED
                     +
                     V
                     th
                     +(C
                     1/(C

                     data. The corresponding OLED current is determined based on the V
                     GS of T2 since T2 is working in the saturation region. As a result, the OLED current can be expressed as

                     ox are the channel width, the channel length, the field-effect mobility, and the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, respectively. As seen from (1), the OLED current is only affected by the data voltage, and it is independent of the threshold voltage of T2 and OLED, as well as the power supply.

The operational scheme described above is the ideal situation for the proposed pixel circuit. And the effect of the parasitic parameters (such as parasitic resistances and parasitic capacitors) will be discussed carefully as follows. Fig. 2
                      shows the schematic diagram of the proposed pixel circuit including parasitic parameters which may affect its operation. As seen from (1), the OLED current is independent of power supply as seen from (1) for the proposed pixel circuit. That is because the stored voltage in C
                     2 is maintained as V
                     th
                     +(C
                     1/(C

                     2))V
                     data in the emission period and the corresponding OLED current is only dependent on it. Therefore, the parasitic resistance of the power supply line will not affect the operation of this circuit. However, it should be indicated that the value of V
                     dd should satisfy the condition that T2 is still working in the saturation region when the maximum current follows through the parasitic resistance. For the corresponding 2T1C pixel circuit as shown in Fig. 3
                     , the parasitic resistance of the power supply line may cause a voltage drop when the driving current passes through it. This phenomenon causes the brightness to be nonuniform from the top to the bottom in the panel.

Generally, the TFT parasitic capacitor is due to the overlap between source/drain electrode and gate electrode. In this paper, we assume the gate/source overlap and the gate/drain overlap are identical for all TFTs, and then C
                     gs
                     =
                     C
                     gd. Moreover, Cxi
                      represents the C
                     gs/C
                     gd of Ti (i
                     =1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The effect of parasitic capacitors on the operation of pixel circuit is that the stored voltage in C
                     2 will vary due to the capacitor coupling effect when the control signals jump. At the beginning of the period (2), the V
                     ctr2 signal goes to high voltage to turn off T3 after the threshold voltage of T2 has been detected at the end of the period (1). And then, the node A turns into the charge conservation state after T3 is turned off. As a result, the variation of the voltage at node A due to capacitor coupling effect by Cx
                     
                     3 can be approximated as

As seen from (6), it is clear that the variation on V
                     AC due to capacitor coupling effect will affect the precision of the threshold voltage compensation. However, since the parasitic capacitor is much smaller than C
                     1 or C
                     2, ΔV
                     AC should be much smaller than the shift of threshold voltage (ΔV
                     th). So the effect of parasitic capacitors can be ignored although it can not be avoided in the pixel circuit. And the parasitic capacitors can be minimized by improving the precision of TFT technologies.

The effectiveness of the proposed pixel circuit may be confirmed by SMART-SPICE simulation with the RPI poly-Si TFT model (Level=36). The circuit parameters are indicated in Table 1
                     . The mobility and threshold voltage of TFTs are chosen as 60cm2/Vs, and −2V, respectively. Moreover, the OLED is modeled by a diode-connected TFT in parallel with a capacitor (C
                     OLED). And the threshold voltage of the diode-connected TFT is set as 4V which is corresponding to the characteristics of a typical OLED. In the simulation, the value of the TFT parasitic capacitor (Cx
                     
                     1, Cx

                     ox is 50nF/cm2 and the overlap length between TFT source/drain and gate electrode is 1μm.

                     2 is not changed. The OLED current is rapidly increased to the working point and then the OLED emits light stably until the data is renewed the following frame. Therefore, the operational scheme and compensation principle of the proposed circuit are reasonable and correct. It is also shown that a high contrast ratio can be achieved by the proposed pixel circuit since there is no current following through the OLED except for the emission period. Furthermore, the capacitor coupling effect induced by the parasitic capacitors does not affect the operation of the proposed pixel circuit. The whole programming time is less than 40 us and so the proposed pixel circuit may be applied to the small or medium AMOLED displays with high quality.

                     th_TFT, ΔV
                     th_OLED, RP
                     ) may result in an obvious nonuniformity of the OLED current for the conventional 2T1C circuit. So, they should be all taken into account during the development of compensation pixel circuits. Whereas, the proposed pixel circuit is immune to the threshold-voltage shift of the driving TFT (ΔV

It is shown that the nonuniformity of the proposed pixel circuit is significantly reduced with an average value of 7.3% compared with that of the conventional 2T1C pixel circuit with an average value of 73%. Therefore, the proposed pixel circuit can effectively compensate for the threshold-voltage shift of TFTs, the degradation of OLED and the parasitic resistance of the power supply line in AMOLED displays.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper presents a new voltage-programmed pixel circuit with all-p-type TFTs for AMOLED displays, which is composed of five TFTs, two storage capacitors and three control lines. The proposed pixel circuit can effectively compensate for the threshold-voltage shift of the driving TFT, the degradation of OLED and the parasitic resistance of the power supply line. We also analyze the effect of the parasitic parameters on the operation of the proposed pixel circuit. It is shown that the OLED current nonuniformity is evidently restrained by the proposed pixel circuit compared with the conventional 2T1C pixel circuit, and thus, the brightness uniformity of AMOLED display will be enhanced. Furthermore, a high contrast ratio can be achieved by the proposed pixel circuit since there is no current flowing through the OLED except for the emission period.
