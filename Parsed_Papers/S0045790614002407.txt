                  An important issue to be addressed when data are to be published is data privacy. In this paper, the problem of data privacy based on a prominent privacy model, 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           e
                           )
                        
                     -Anonymous, is addressed. Our scenario is that when a new dataset is to be released, there may be, at the same time, datasets that were released elsewhere. A problem arises because some attackers might obtain multiple versions of the same dataset and compare them with the newly released dataset. Although the privacy of all of the datasets has been well-preserved individually, such a comparison can lead to a privacy breach, which is a so-called “incremental privacy breach”. To address this problem effectively, we first study the characteristics of the effects of multiple dataset releases with a theoretical approach. It has been found that a privacy breach that is subjected to an increment occurs when there is overlap between any parts of the new dataset with any parts of an existing dataset. Based on our proposed studies, a polynomial-time algorithm is proposed. This algorithm needs to consider only one previous version of the dataset, and it can also skip computing the overlapping partitions. Thus, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is reduced from

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Privacy preservation should be the first priority to be addressed for data sharing between business collaborators. Over the past decade, various privacy preservation techniques have been proposed [1–5]. When the data are to be shared, such techniques can be applied prior to sharing, and the privacy-preserved data can be used for such purposes. However, the data are often changed all the time. Applying the privacy preservation techniques to the data each time can result in different versions of privacy-preserved data. Comparing them can lead to a privacy breach, which is called an incremental privacy breach [6].

In this paper, we present an algorithm for preserving the privacy of the data when the data are not static, i.e., when the records are appended continuously. The focused privacy preservation model is based on (k, e)-Anonymous [5], which is one of the most prominent models.

Based on the 
                           
                              (
                              k
                              ,
                              e
                              )
                           
                        -Anonymous privacy preservation model, the data to be shared are composed of identifier attributes such as the ID or name, quasi-identifier attributes such as gender or age, and sensitive attributes such as salary or disease [3]. To preserve the privacy, all of the identifier attributes in the data must be removed first. This removal typically leaves only the quasi-identifiers and the sensitive data remain.

Thus, the task is to prevent a linkage between the quasi-identifier attributes and the sensitive attributes [3,7–9]. The 
                           
                              (
                              k
                              ,
                              e
                              )
                           
                        -Anonymous model [5] breaks or un-links the associations by first partitioning the data. Then, the sensitive values are shuffled within each partition. The conditions for the partitioning of the (k, e)-Anonymous model are that the number of distinct sensitive values of each partition must be at least k, and the error of each partition must be at least e. The error is the difference between the maximum and the minimum of the sensitive values in each partition.

An algorithm that generates optimal partitioning, i.e., minimizing the sum of the errors, has been proposed in [5]. The complexity of the data partitioning algorithm is O(
                           
                              
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                        ), where n is the number of data tuples.

To illustrate the effectiveness of the 
                           
                              (
                              k
                              ,
                              e
                              )
                           
                        -Anonymous model, let us consider the following example. The data in Fig. 1
                        (a) has the attributes “Age” and “Gender” as the quasi-identifier attributes and the attribute “Salary” as the sensitive attribute. Suppose that the k value is set to 3 and the e value is set to 2000. Then, the data in Fig. 1(a) can be partitioned with respect to the k and the e values, as shown in Fig. 1(b). As a matter of fact, the number of distinct sensitive values in each partition is at least 3, and the difference between the maximum and minimum value of each partition is at least 2000. After the shuffling, it can be seen that the associations between the sensitive attribute and the quasi-identifier attributes are un-linked, and thus the privacy can be preserved.

Once the data are to be queried or shared, the privacy-preserved data can be utilized safely. For example, suppose that a query to determine the sum of the salaries of the males is issued. The result of the query from the non privacy-preserved data in Fig. 1(a) is 341,000. At the same time, the result from the privacy-preserved data in Fig. 1c) is 340,000–343,000. It can be seen that there is only a slight difference between the exact answer and the privacy-preserved answer. This type of query can be considered to be an aggregation query, which is fundamental for any further data analysis, e.g., OLAP or machine learning algorithms. Retaining the ability to answer this type of query means that a high utility of the privacy-preserved data can be obtained. In [5], it is reported that the optimal solutions from the 
                           
                              (
                              k
                              ,
                              e
                              )
                           
                        -Anonymous model can achieve less than 10% of the relative error of the aggregation query.

If we consider only an individual privacy-preserved dataset, privacy can be preserved with regard to the k and e values. However, considering two or more versions of the datasets from different points in time could lead to the incremental privacy breach. Let us consider the following example. Let k be 3 and let e be 2000. Suppose that the two versions of privacy-preserved datasets at time 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                         and time 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         are given as in Fig. 2
                        (a) and (b) respectively. (Note that the name attribute in the figure is only for referencing and that both datasets have been privacy-preserved optimally.) Suppose that the attacker knows that Bob’s data, i.e., for a 52-year old male, are collected and exist in the dataset at time 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                        . Obviously, his data are in partition 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                         of the 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                                 
                                    1

Subsequently, when the new version of this dataset is released at time

                        , the attacker can observe that Bob’s data are not in partition

                         of both datasets. It obviously can reveal that the sensitive attribute value of “Alice” and “Hank” might be 88,000–89,000. This causes a privacy which causes a privacy breach with regard to the k and e value of the (k, e)-Anonymous model.

The proposed algorithm is based on our theoretical studies on the effects of multiple dataset releasing. Such studies can allow us to reduce the computational complexity enormously, especially because it requires considering only the previous version of the dataset against the dataset to be released and not all of the released datasets. At the same time, the privacy is not compromised, i.e., the result of the privacy-preserved dataset is exactly the same as considering all of the released dataset. Thus, the complexity reduces from O(

In recent decades, various privacy preservation models and techniques have been proposed to prevent the discovery of any individuals sensitive values. In general, a dataset for such work can be considered to be divided into three parts, which are the identifier, the quasi-identifier, and the sensitive attributes. Before the dataset is published, a fundamental concern is that the identifier attribute should be deleted as the first step. Unfortunately, this deletion is not sufficient for privacy preservation. The attacker can use background knowledge, e.g., knowing the other information about the victim from a publicly released dataset, to re-identify the target, which can be accomplished easily by overlapping the identifier-deleted dataset with the background knowledge through the quasi-identifier, e.g. age, sex, or postal address [3]. Subsequently, the sensitive data are disclosed.

However, k-anonymity [3] is the first well-known privacy preservation model. This model transforms the quasi-identifier attribute value by generalization, in such a way that each tuple in the dataset has the same value as with at least k tuples. The tuples in a group that have the same quasi-identifier value can be considered to be in an equivalence class. After the generalization, the overlapping through quasi-identifier attributes can re-identify only the equivalence class, but it cannot re-identify an individual tuple. In addition to the conditions of the model, the transformation must consider the tradeoff between privacy and utility [11]. There are a few measurements for the utility, such as information lossy and lossless conditions [12], the data mining workload [8,13,14], classification [15,16], and aggregation query answering [5]. Optimal solutions for the k-anonymity problem with respect to the many proposed measures of utility have been proven to be NP-hard [9].

Based on the k-anonymity model and the generalization techniques, extensions to improve the privacy protection are proposed. These attempts are varied in terms of the privacy definition, utility objectives, and types of sensitive attributes. For example, the (
                        
                           α
                           ,
                           
                           k
                        
                     )-Anonymity model [4] defines the privacy conditions in such way that each equivalence class must have at least k tuples as in a k-anonymity model that has an additional condition, i.e., the frequency of a sensitive value is at most α in each class. In the l-diversity model [2], the privacy condition is that the number of distinct sensitive values must be at least l for each equivalence class. Both the (
                        
                           α
                           ,
                           
                           k
                        
                     )-Anonymity model and the l-diversity aim at preventing a homogeneous attack against each equivalence class, i.e., when the attacker knows the equivalence class of the victim through the quasi-identifier attributes and all of the sensitive values of the class are the same. Thus the attacker can conclude the sensitive values of the victim. In [1], a t-closeness privacy model that is based on the sensitive values distribution in each equivalence class is proposed. The model defines the privacy condition for the sensitive attribute values such that the difference between the distance of the values within each equivalence class and the distance of the values within the whole dataset must be at most t. The distance applied in this work is the earth mover’s distance [17]. The model applies the Incognito algorithm [18] to generalize the dataset until all of the equivalence classes satisfy the t condition.

                     -Anonymous [5] is the first well-known privacy model that applies a permutation technique, instead of generalization. The concept of the permutation technique is to break the linkage between the quasi-identifier attribute and the sensitive attribute by shuffling the sensitive values. Although the identifier of any tuple can be linked or revealed by overlapping through the quasi-identifier with the dataset from the other sources. The identifier cannot be linked to the sensitive values after the shuffling. The privacy preservation method based on the 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           e
                           )
                        
                     -Anonymous model begins with partitioning the dataset into partitions and then shuffling their sensitive values within each partition. The privacy conditions for the partitioning phase are that the number of distinct sensitive values of each partition must be at least k and the error of each partition must be at least e. The error is defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum sensitive values in each partition. For the utility, this model aims at the accuracy of the aggregation query answers, e.g., the sum, maximum/minimum, or average values of the sensitive data. Instead of answering the query in exact values, the model answers the query in the form of intervals in which a high accuracy can still be achieved.

However, preserving the privacy without considering the changes to the dataset can lead to incremental privacy breaches. In [6], a few types of incremental privacy breaches, i.e., the difference attack, intersection attack, and record-tracing attack, are identified even when the k-anonymity and l-diversity are applied. Basically, when the attacker compares multiple versions of privacy-preserved datasets, breaches can occur.

Currently, many techniques have been proposed to tackle the incremental privacy breach problem [19–24]. Almost all of them have indicated the process of attacking when the datasets are published continuously. In [19], the author proposed an algorithm for detecting the incremental attacking and for updating the published datasets without any breach. In [20], the authors proposed an algorithm for solving the problem with the k-Anonymous model for the incremental data scenarios problem. In [21], the work has been extended to cover the cases in which deletion and updating are allowed. Such work has been further extended to handle the data stream in [22], where the proposed algorithm must capture the continuous nature of the streaming data and where storing in the repository is prohibited. In [23], the authors proposed the model for grouping and indexing the given datasets based on the similarity of quasi-identifiers values. Each group is to be distributed to each server on the cloud. When incremental tuples are added, the similarity is computed to further distributed such new tuples to the corresponding server. Though, the incremental data are to be considered as our work, however, only the efficiency issue is addressed unlike our work which focuses on the privacy issue in the incremental data scenarios. In [25], the authors develop an incremental approach to preserve the privacy for the supervised data mining workload. The frequency discretization technique is applied to control the distribution within the class. Though it does not require the entire data to be processed again when adding the new data, their privacy model does not consider incremental privacy breach as our proposed work. For the 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           
                           e
                           )
                        
                     -Anonymous model[24], the authors proposed an algorithm for preserving the privacy that is based on the original model along with an auxiliary index to further improve the efficiency. However, the incremental privacy breach, as described in this paper, has not been addressed. The solution from their proposed work can only preserve the privacy in each version of dataset individually.

Another important privacy preservation model is orthogonal to our work and is called differential privacy [26,27]. This approach is based on the concept of statistical databases [28]. Differential privacy attempts to ensure that the removal or addition of any tuple in the dataset does not substantially change the results of the data analysis. An individual is protected regardless of the attacker’s background knowledge. If an intruder possesses background information about all of the tuples in the dataset except for one tuple, then he or she will not be able to infer the absence of the tuple with a high probability. The closeness of the randomized outputs on both of the databases is determined by a privacy parameter ε. Higher values of ε imply weaker privacy guarantees. Such models can be considered to be more complex compared with 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           
                           e
                           )
                        
                     -Anonymous, and the two models can be applied to each other. For example, the algorithm for providing differential privacy can be applied in the shuffling phase of the 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           
                           e
                           )
                        
                     -Anonymous to further strengthen the protection. At the same time, in this work, we aim at defining, determining, and preventing the incremental privacy breach based on 
                        
                           (

                     . These observations will help to develop an algorithm in the next section. Obviously, a naive approach to address the proposed problem is to verify a new version of the dataset against previous datasets to determine whether it leads to an incremental privacy breach. Evidently, such an approach can be costly as a result, the observations aim at reducing the computational cost while the result must be the same as in the naive approach.

Before we provide further discussion, we note here that the result of the privacy preservation based on the 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           e
                           )
                        
                     -Anonymous in [5] is optimal. In other words, the result partitions always generate minimum sum of errors. Obviously, such a partition cannot be split further; otherwise, the result cannot satisfy the k and e conditions. Additionally, this approach does not lead to any incremental privacy breach because it does not have any previous released dataset.

Thus, we present an observation for the incremental privacy breaches from

From the proposed theorem in the previous section, we can propose an algorithm that preserves the privacy in the incremental data scenarios as shown in Fig. 13
                     . This algorithm is based on the existing non-incremental privacy preservation that is proposed in [5]. However, not all previously released datasets are used as the input; only the previous version of the dataset is used. From Theorem 1, it can be seen that the current partition, which is specified by indexes i and j, must fully cover a partition in the previous dataset

Obviously, if the current partition does not lead to an incremental privacy breach that is subjected to

                     . Then the current partition does not lead to an incremental privacy breach with all of the previous released datasets as well. The determination of the incremental privacy breach searches only in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 P

                                 1
                              
                           
                           ]
                        
                     . Thus, the complexity of the incremental privacy breach detection becomes 
                        
                           O
                           (

                     . In the worst case, the overlap determination cannot skip the incremental privacy breach determination within all of the current partitions; thus, the complexity of our proposed algorithm becomes 
                        
                           O

To clarify the proposed algorithm, let us consider the following example. Suppose that the datasets

                                 0
                              
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      are given as shown in Fig. 14
                     . The algorithm begins with scanning all of the possible partitions in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                     . To save some space, let us discuss the situation when i
                     =5 and j
                     =1; evidently, the maximum value of the current partition (86,000 in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                     ) is less than the maximum value of the first partition of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                        
                      (87,000). The current partition can be discarded for any further computation. Then, when i
                     =6 and j
                     =1, it can be seen that the current partition fully covers the first partition in

                                 0
                              
                           
                        
                     ; thus, the incremental privacy breach is to be determined. In this case, there is no incremental privacy breach, so the algorithm continues to determine whether the current partition leads to the privacy breach when subjected to the k and e condition. On the other hand, when i
                     =7 and j
                     =3, the current partition also fully covers the first partition in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D

                     ; however, an incremental privacy breach occurs. Thus, this consideration is discarded. In the end, the optimal solution without any privacy breach of

                     -Anonymous approach [5] and an incremental breach prevention algorithm in [6]. The dataset contains 14 attributes over 48,000 tuples. The “capital-loss” attribute is selected to be the sensitive values. Eight of the attributes are selected to be the quasi-identifier, as in [5]. Thus, the remaining number of tuples in the dataset is 1427 tuples. The range of the “capital-loss” values is 155–3900, with 89 distinct values. For each experiment, the dataset will be divided into two equal parts, the first part is used as the static part of the data, while the latter will be used as the incremental data. For the incremental part of a dataset, it will be divided further into ten equal parts, for appending to the dataset. Once all of the parts of the data are appended to the dataset, the execution time is subsequently reported. The efficiency is evaluated in terms of the execution time when the four parameters are changed, i.e. the k value, the e value, the size of the incremental dataset

                     , and the number of partitions of the static dataset. Additionally, the percentage of discarded rounds for the incremental privacy breach determination is reported to present its relationship with the efficiency. A high percentage reflects the high efficiency that the algorithm can obtain. The resulting numbers that are reported here are five times the average.

We compare our proposed algorithm to a naive re-applying algorithm that re-applies the existing static algorithm proposed in [5] as a baseline, to further prevent an incremental privacy breach. The idea of the algorithm is as follows. First, for each considered partition of the dataset to be released 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                        
                     , the (k, e)-Anonymous condition is evaluated. If it satisfies the condition, then the partition is considered for any incremental privacy breach occurs against all of the released datasets. If such a partition has an incremental privacy breach with at least one of the released datasets, then the current partition can be discarded. For the incremental privacy breach determination, the algorithm must compute the difference and the intersection results between the current considered partition and each partition for each released dataset. For simplicity, suppose that the number of tuples in each released dataset is n, and the number of released datasets is m. The complexity of this computing as well as the whole algorithm is 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 m
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     .

In the first experiment, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm when the value of k is varied. Such a value is varied from 3 to 15, to evaluate its effect. As in previous work, we set the value of e to be 20 and the incremental part to be 10 percent of the size of the static dataset.

The execution time of the proposed algorithm and the naive re-applying algorithm is presented in Fig. 15
                        . Note that the result is shown on a the logarithmic scale. The average execution time of the naive re-applying algorithm is 29,715 seconds. At the same time, the execution time of the proposed algorithm is in the range of 17–64s. Clearly, the proposed algorithm is highly efficient because of the theoretical studies. In Fig. 16
                        , the experimental result of the proposed algorithm is presented in detail. It can be seen that the execution time of the proposed algorithm decreases when the values of k is increased. The reason behind the decrease is that all partitions in the previous dataset depend on the k value. The range of some partitions in the previous partitioned dataset can be expanded when the value of k is increased. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can discard an incremental privacy breach determination increasingly well.

In this experiment, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm when the value of e is varied. Such an e value is varied from 20 to 500, to evaluate its effect. We set the k value at 2, and the size of the incremental part is set at 10 percent of the size of the static dataset.

The execution time of the proposed algorithm and the naive algorithm is presented in Fig. 17
                        . The execution time of the naive algorithm is 5374s. At the same time, the execution time of the proposed algorithm is in the range of 14–65s. The result is similar to the previous experiment, i.e., the execution time of the proposed algorithm is much less than that of the naive algorithm. The detailed experiment results when the e value is varied are presented in Fig. 18
                        . Obviously, when the e value is increased, the execution time of the proposed algorithm decreases. The reason behind this decrease is that all of the partitions in the previous dataset depend on the value of e. The range of some of the partitions in the previous partitioned dataset can be expanded when the value of e is increased. Thus, the proposed algorithm can discard an incremental privacy breach determination better when the value of e is increased.

In this experiment, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm when the number of partitions in the static dataset is varied to see its effect. The variation is set at 3–22. We set the k value at 2, and the e value is changed to relate the numbers of the partitions.

From the results in Figs. 19 and 20
                        
                        , we can see that when the number of the partitions in the static part of the dataset is increased, the execution time of the proposed algorithm is also increased. The reason behind the increase is that the number of partitions is in reverse proportion to the parameters k and e. When the k and e values are decreased, the number of partitions is increased. Additionally, the ranges of some of the partitions in the previous partitioned dataset are reduced when the k and e values are decreased. Thus, the proposed algorithm can discard an incremental privacy breach determination less when the number of the partitions is increased. However, compared with the naive algorithm, the proposed algorithm is still clearly efficient.

In the last experiment, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm when the size of the incremental dataset (
                           
                              |

                        ) is varied. The variation in the set at the percentage of the whole data to be appended is 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%, and 14% of the size of the static dataset. We set the k value and the e value at 5 and 100, respectively.

The execution time of the proposed algorithm and the naive algorithm is presented in Fig. 21
                        . The execution time of the proposed algorithm is in the range of 13–23s. At the same time, the average execution time of the naive re-applying algorithm is 7190s. Fig. 22
                         shows the detailed execution time of the proposed algorithm in addition to the percentage of the incremental privacy breach determination discard. Obviously, when the size of the incremental part is increased, the execution time of the proposed algorithm increases. Additionally, the percentage of the discard is also decreased. This finding means that the proposed idea is less efficient when the size of the incremental part increases. However, considering that optimal solutions without any privacy breach can still be always guaranteed, and the high percentage of the discard of the privacy breach determination. It can still be claimed that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient and effective.

In this paper, we address the incremental privacy breach problem based on the

                     -Anonymous model. The characteristics of the effects of multiple dataset release are observed theoretically. We propose that an incremental privacy breach occurs when there is overlap between a partition range of a new dataset and any partition of any existing dataset. Based on such studies, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm with 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              
                                 pn
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      in which n is the number of tuples. With the proposed algorithm, only the most-recent previously released dataset must be considered rather than all of the previous datasets. In addition, not all of the partitions in the previous dataset must be considered for an incremental privacy breach determination; some of them can be discarded from further computing by our proposed observation. Based on the fact that our proposed work always guarantees the optimal result, we can conclude that our algorithm is both effective and highly efficient, as is confirmed by the experiment results.

In our future work, we will further investigate the systematic problem in which the subset of the datasets is to be queried, and the attackers can attempt to accumulate the knowledge from each query for the attack. Additionally, the concurrency control issue, in which multiple users might add, delete, or query the dataset at the same time, will be considered.
