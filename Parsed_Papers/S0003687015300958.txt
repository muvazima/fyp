                  Objectives
                  This review applied a human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) paradigm to assess individual, work system/unit, organization, and external environment factors generating barriers to patient, provider, and informal caregiver personal health record (PHR) use.
               
               
                  Methods
                  The literature search was conducted using five electronic databases for the timeframe January 2000 to October 2013, resulting in 4865 citations. Two authors independently coded included articles (n = 60).
               
               
                  Results
                  Fifty-five, ten and five articles reported barriers to patient, provider and caregiver PHR use, respectively. Barriers centered around 20 subfactors. The most frequently noted were needs, biases, beliefs, and mood (n = 35) and technology functions and features (n = 32).
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The HF/E paradigm was effective in framing the assessment of factors creating barriers to PHR use. Design efforts should address literacy, interoperability, access to health information, and secure messaging. A deeper understanding of the interactions between work systems and the role of organization and external environment factors is required.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

As clinician and patient roles evolve, responsibility for health management is shifting from clinician-governed to patient-controlled (Wasson et al., 2012). The continuing development of consumer health information technology (IT), health IT designed for use by lay people, supports this change in roles by enabling patients to actively engage in health management both alone and in partnership with formal healthcare providers (i.e., providers) (Center for Advancing Health, 2010). This engagement through consumer health IT has been accelerated by market forces such as the proliferation of consumer-facing mobile health applications (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 2012; Greenspun and Coughlin, 2012) and has been promoted by the Meaningful Use initiative within the United States (The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), 2013a; Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2015): Stage 2 of this initiative (The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), 2013a) incentivizes increased health information exchange, patient-controlled data, requirements for e-prescribing and incorporating lab results, and electronic transmission of patient care summaries across multiple settings. The recently proposed Stage 3 guidelines (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2015) extend the Stage 2 requirements for patient engagement by increasing the requirements regarding the proportion of a provider's patients who have interacted with their health records (i.e., viewed, downloaded, or transmitted their health records) and used secure messaging through the electronic health record (EHR) (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2015).

Patient engagement in health management, however, does not solely rely on actions taken by patients and providers. Rather, health management in home and community settings often depends upon the active participation of other individuals (Valdez and Brennan, 2015; Skeels, 2010), including informal caregivers (i.e., caregivers). Caregiver as well as patient and provider interest in accessing and exchanging health information has been documented (Friction and Davies, 2008). The Patient Engagement Framework (National eHealth Collaborative and Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Foundation, 2014), championed by the Healthcare Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) and the National eHealth Collaborative (NeHC), outlines a vision for Meaningful Use Stages 3 and 4 to further support, through consumer health IT, the full range of individuals (e.g., caregivers, family, friends, clergy) involved in patients' health management. The need to attend to caregivers' perspectives has also been recently identified within the HF/E literature (Holden et al., 2013, 2015).

Despite widespread development and promotion of consumer health IT, usage rates have remained relatively low (Valdez et al., 2015b). Proposed explanations for these low patient usage rates include low numeracy and limited technology experience (Taha et al., 2013), difficult login procedures (McInnes et al., 2013), limited family support for using advanced technologies (Mayberry et al., 2011), and fears concerning the misuse of stored information (Tjora et al., 2005). Reasons for low provider usage rates include no prior email communication with patients (Crotty et al., 2013), medical practice location (Wynia et al., 2011), and concerns regarding appropriate reimbursement and liability (Wynia et al., 2011). Low caregiver usage rates are associated with caregiving responsibilities for a child who has a nonsevere illness (Byczkowski et al., 2014), slow Internet connection (Tom et al., 2012), insurance type (Tom et al., 2012), and fear of discrimination from insurance companies (Weitzman et al., 2012). Given the multi-dimensionality of these rationales, HF/E frameworks should be systematically applied to understand barriers to patient, provider, and caregiver consumer health IT use.

Previous research in HF/E has focused on the impact of work system factors on healthcare providers' clinical health IT use, such as EHR and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) (Holden et al., 2013; Carayon and 2006; Fuji et al., 2008; Nazi, 2013; Urowitz et al., 2012). These studies demonstrate that health IT use in professional settings is shaped not only by individual characteristics, but also by a wider range of work system factors. Multiple models of the work system (Carayon and 2006) emphasize that system outcomes are influenced by interactions between users, tasks performed, tools used to accomplish these tasks, and the physical, social, and organizational environments in which users are embedded (Holden et al., 2013). While work system models traditionally characterize the sociotechnical systems of professional work, more recent models translate this concept for patients and caregivers (Holden et al., 2013; National Research Council, 2011; Carayon et al., 2006). These models enable the concept of the work system to be applied to healthcare work conducted by both healthcare providers and lay people, facilitating the study of work system factors in the context of consumer health IT use. In this review, barriers are categorized using the HF/E paradigm developed by Karsh and colleagues (Karsh et al., 2006). Although this paradigm targets patients and providers, we extend and apply it to caregivers.

This review focuses on a specific type of consumer health IT, personal health records (PHRs), because Meaningful Use Stages 2 and 3 as well as the Patient Engagement Framework promote increased patient, provider, and caregiver PHR use within the United States. Though varyingly defined (Archer et al., 2011; Connecting for Health Personal Health Working Group, 2003; The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), 2013b), PHRs in the present study are “Internet-based set[s] of tools that allow people to access and coordinate their lifelong health information and make appropriate parts of it available to those who need it” (Connecting for Health Personal Health Working Group, 2003), (p3). Common PHR functionalities include the ability to access lab results, engage in secure messaging with providers, request prescription renewals, schedule appointments, authorize referrals, and view and update medication and allergy lists (Archer et al., 2011). Studies included here report on PHRs that vary in terms of available features and of organizations through which patients were enrolled (e.g., employer, government agency, primary care physician). In contrast to previous reviews of PHRs (Archer et al., 2011; Jabour and Jones, 2013; Amante et al., 2014), this review is systematic, restricted to empirical peer-reviewed articles, focused on work system barriers to use by patients, providers, and caregivers, and based on an HF/E paradigm.

@&#METHODS@&#

Our review was restricted to studies in which users were asked to engage with PHRs in the context of their everyday lives. Studies focused solely on lab-based usability testing or system demonstrations were excluded. This review categorized all factors identified as barriers in quantitative, mixed methods, and qualitative studies. Traditionally, the term “barrier” is defined as “a law, rule, problem, etc., that makes something difficult or impossible” (Merriam-Webster). However, for the purposes of this review the term “barrier” has been extended to allow factors associated with decreased PHR use such as individual characteristics (e.g., race, age) to be conceptualized as barriers. The scope did not include conducting a meta-analysis to assess the degree to which each factor affected PHR use. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (Moher et al., 2009) criteria were adopted to the extent possible; however, we could not adopt the standards in full. For example, due to the range of methodologies among included articles, we were unable to assess risk of bias in a consistent manner.

A health science librarian and a computer science librarian were consulted in developing the search strategy, including the search terms. A range synonymous with personal health record and barrier (see Table 1
                        ) was used to ensure that all related articles were included in the initial screening. The search was performed using five electronic databases during October 2013: PubMed, CINAHL (excluding MEDLINE records), Engineering Village (Compendex and INSPEC), IEEE Xplor, and ACM Digital Library. To keep search strategies consistent across databases, controlled vocabulary was not used. All searches were limited to articles published between January 2000 and October 2013.

Title screening consisted of reviewing search results for duplicates and publication in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings. Duplicates were screened for manually by the first author and the RefWorks duplicate finder tool (ProQuest LLC, 2010). Ulrichsweb was used to exclude non-peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. If a conference proceeding was not listed on Ulrichsweb, we determined whether it was peer-reviewed based on the call for participation.

Abstracts considered eligible and included in full-text screening (a) mentioned PHRs and (b) related to patients', providers', and/or caregivers' experiences with PHRs. Excluded abstracts (a) focused solely on provider-facing electronic systems, (b) focused on technology with functionality limited to symptom tracking without integration into other PHR functions, (c) focused on self-management or telemedicine systems (unless this had been integrated into a PHR and the article examined both components), (d) were introductions or prefaces to a special issue, conference proceedings, or book, (e) were review articles, and/or (f) were not written in English.

Two authors (MJT & RSV) independently coded 100 (2.5%) of the abstracts for eligibility. The first set of 50 abstracts was used to finalize inclusion and exclusion criteria. The second set was used for calculating inter-rater reliability. The resulting value for Cohen's kappa statistic (κ=.90) was interpreted as strong (McHugh, 2012). When discrepancies occurred, decisions were discussed and resolved through consensus-building. Decisions were documented and subsequently used by the first author to include or exclude the remaining abstracts.

Articles excluded during the initial full-text screening (a) met abstract exclusion criteria, (b) were opinion articles, (c) were formative papers, (d) were not full papers, (e) described paper-based systems, (f) focused on system architecture, and/or (g) were unavailable after exhausting the University of Virginia's library resources. Two authors (MJT & RSV) independently screened 10% of the full-text articles (n = 21) before engaging in decision making similar to that described for abstract screening. The first author then completed the first round of full-text screening.

A second round of full-text screening ensured that included articles focused on PHRs implemented in participants' everyday lives. During this round, articles were excluded if the PHR was (a) not used, (b) used only during a demonstration, and/or (c) not implemented in participants' everyday lives. Two authors (MJT & JDR) individually reviewed all articles during this round. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, according to Cohen's kappa statistic (McHugh, 2012) (κ=.67). Discrepancies were resolved through consensus-building and unresolved differences were referred to the senior author (RSV).

Two authors (MJT&JDR) independently extracted the following:
                           
                              •

Because the studies reviewed implemented a range of qualitative, descriptive, and mixed method approaches, statistical significance could not be reported for all barriers. However, for studies reporting statistical significance, only statistically significant barriers were extracted for analysis.

Karsh and colleagues' HF/E paradigm specifies four work system levels (see Table 2
                        ) (Karsh et al., 2006). The original model refers to individual factors as patient and provider factors. However, because we extended the model to caregivers, we refer to this work system level as individual factors. Individual factors are characteristics of the person (e.g., weight, personality). Work system/unit factors are tasks performed (e.g., searching for health information) and the tools and technology used to accomplish these tasks (e.g., search engines). Organization factors are characteristics of the home and community (patient- and caregiver-focused) or healthcare institution (provider focused). External environment factors are characteristics of an individual's outside environment (e.g., clinics [caregiver- and patient-focused] or external clinics [provider-focused]). As noted, organization and external environment factors depend on the population being assessed.

Data were entered into Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office Professional, 2010) and analyzed using qualitative content analysis methods (Graneheim and Lundman, 2004; Sandelowski, 2010; Sandelowski, 2000; Hsieh and Shannon, 2005). Using the HF/E paradigm as an overarching framework, barriers were coded both inductively and deductively (see Fig. 1
                        ). Deductive coding matched barriers to existing elements of the framework; however, when a quote did not fit an existing category, we created a new code (i.e., inductive coding). Simultaneous coding was used when content extracted from an article reflected more than one factor and/or subfactor. Two authors (MJT & JDR) independently coded all extracted data. Decisions were discussed and discrepancies resolved through consensus-building. Unresolved differences were referred to the senior author (RSV).

@&#RESULTS@&#

The search, using PubMed, CINAHL, Engineering Village (Compendex and INSPEC), IEEE Xplor, and ACM Digital Library, produced a total of 4865 records. After title, abstract, and full-text screening, 60 articles remained for data extraction and synthesis (see Fig. 2
                        ).

Included studies employed a range of approaches for understanding barriers to PHR use (see Appendix A). Forty-five articles focused exclusively on patient work systems (McInnes et al., 2013; Tjora et al., 2005; Ancker et al., 2011; Burke et al., 2010; Day and Gu, 2012; Goel et al., 2011; Gu and Day, 2013; Guy et al., 2012; Hess et al., 2007; Kahn et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2009; Krist et al., 2011; Lau et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2013c; Lober et al., 2006; Mayberry et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2007; Nagykaldi et al., 2012; Nielsen et al., 2012; Osborn et al., 2013; Sarkar et al., 2010, 2011; Schnipper et al., 2008; Tsai et al., 2012; Tuil et al., 2006; Vodicka et al., 2013; Wade-Vuturo et al., 2013; Wagner et al., 2012, 2010; Wang et al., 2004; Weingart et al., 2006; Wen et al., 2010; Wiljer et al., 2010; Zickmund et al., 2008; Zulman et al., 2011; Emani et al., 2012; Nazi, 2010; Nazi et al., 2013; Wald et al., 2009; Tenforde et al., 2012; Denton, 2001; Goldner et al., 2013; Gordon et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2005), three exclusively on provider work systems (Crotty et al., 2013; Wynia et al., 2011; Fuji et al., 2008), two exclusively on caregiver work systems (Byczkowski et al., 2014; Britto et al., 2013), seven on patient and provider work systems (Nazi, 2013; Urowitz et al., 2012; Wald et al., 2010; Earnest et al., 2004; Jung et al., 2011; Do et al., 2011; Poon et al., 2007), two on patient and caregiver work systems (Tom et al., 2012; Weitzman et al., 2012), and one on patient, provider, and caregiver work systems (Woods et al., 2013). Sample sizes ranged from 10 to 100,617. A majority reported barriers to using tethered systems (n = 47), were based in the United States (n = 50), and were classified in the medical sciences journal domain (n = 54). Over half (n = 37) used quantitative designs; the remaining studies used mixed methods (n = 15) or qualitative designs (n = 8). Data collection included a variety of instruments, with most employing surveys (n = 41).

Participant demographic characteristics varied across the studies (see Appendix A). Of 28 reporting patient health conditions, diabetes was the most frequent (n = 14). Twenty-nine studies reported patients' average age, with only two reporting an average age less than 40. Thirty-one reported patients' race, most frequently Caucasian (n = 31) or African American (n = 16). Thirteen reported patient participants of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Five studies focusing on provider work systems reported the type of medical practice, with two relating to primary care. Three reported provider participants' average age (ranging from 41 to 51 years). Three studies focusing on caregiver work systems reported the relationship between the caregiver and patient, all of which were parents or guardians. Only one study reported caregivers' race (primarily Caucasian) and only one reported caregivers' average age (36 years).

In total, work system barriers were classified under 19 of the 22 subfactors described by Karsh and colleagues and were noted at all levels of the work system. Barriers to both patient and provider use were categorized in 16 of the 22 subfactors, while barriers to caregiver use were categorized in eight. In addition to the subfactors identified from the HF/E paradigm, one new subfactor, behavior, was identified for patient, provider, and caregiver work system barriers. Thus, the total number of subfactors identified for each population was 17, 17, and 9, respectively. Fig. 3
                         lists the subfactors identified for each population, illustrating subfactors unique to specific populations and those shared by multiple populations. None were identified as unique to caregivers.

A majority of articles (n = 55) reported patient work system barriers to using PHRs in at least one of the four HF/E paradigm levels: individual (n = 46), work system/unit (n = 39), organization (n = 20), and external environment factors (n = 25). All examples provided in the Results section are either direct quotes from the authors of an article or direct quotes from participants in qualitative studies. Barriers within patient work systems were identified for four subfactors related to individual factors (see Table 3
                         and Appendix A). Patients' skills, employment, knowledge, training, and education, such as awareness of system features and computer literacy were recognized as barriers to PHR use. Patients' demographics such as age, gender, ethnicity, language, and marital status were described as barriers. Barriers related to patients' needs, biases, beliefs, and mood focused on perceived PHR value, degree of need or existence of alternative technologies, and communication preferences. Patients' behavior was acknowledged as a barrier, including health service utilization, practice of a healthy lifestyle, and norms for technology use and communication.

Barriers within patient work systems were identified for five subfactors related to work system/unit factors (see Table 4
                         and Appendix A). Barriers related to system task demands, complexity and difficulty related to issues encountered when using the PHR, such as unintuitive navigation and password recovery. Barriers to patient use related to time and sequence demands focused on provider and system response times and the PHRs' fit with patients' everyday routines. Availability of usable technology including Internet, computer, and smartphone access, was described as a barrier to patients' use. Technology functions and features was the most frequently reported work system/unit subfactor and posed barriers to patients because of challenging content (e.g., difficult terminology), inadequate privacy and security settings, missing functionality, and limited technology platform options. Barriers pertaining to physical layout and geography focused on the location where the patient lived and whether the patient used the system while hospitalized or after discharge.

Barriers within patient work systems were identified for five subfactors related to organization factors (see Table 5
                         and Appendix A). Barriers to patient use related to organizational policy/priorities focused on whether members of their home and community (e.g., family, friends) would have access to patients' PHRs. Organizational structure, or home and community members' presence at doctors' appointments and in the household, was recognized as a barrier. Available financial resources including household income, insurance status, and willingness to pay for PHR service, were identified as barriers. Staffing levels, or the availability of home and community members to assist patients with using PHRs, was categorized as a barrier. Barriers related to social climate/culture focused on home and community members' support, health status, and education.

Barriers within patient work systems were identified for three subfactors related to external environment factors (see Table 6
                         and Appendix A). Extra-organizational rules, standards, and legislation enforcement, such as third party access to PHRs, PHRs' interoperability with EHRs, and the ability/inability to contact multiple providers, were recognized as barriers. Patient barriers regarding industry social influences focused on patient–provider relationships and the value of the system to providers. Industry workforce characteristics, such as the degree of involvement from the healthcare team and issues related to provider work (e.g., difficulty responding to patient inquiries, inconsistencies in provider notes, and unavailability of clinical support), also presented barriers to patients.

Ten articles reported provider-related barriers to the use of PHRs on at least one of the four HF/E paradigm levels: individual (n = 7), work system/unit (n = 9), organization (n = 6), and external environment factors (n = 4) (see Table 7
                         and Appendix A). Barriers within provider work systems were identified for four subfactors related to individual factors. Providers' skills, employment, knowledge, training, and education, including awareness of PHRs and provider specialty, were described as barriers to providers' PHR use. Within the subfactor of age, gender, ethnicity, language, and marital status only gender was identified as a barrier to PHR use. Providers' needs, biases, beliefs, and mood, such as perceived PHR value, degree to which an alternative technology solution was perceived as feasible or appropriate, and beliefs regarding patient self-care, were described as barriers. Behavior, including use of EHRs, degree of engagement with PHRs, and prior use of alternative forms of technology, was also recognized as a barrier.

Barriers within provider work systems were identified for five subfactors related to work system/unit factors (see Table 8
                         and Appendix A). Barriers related to system task demands, complexity and difficulty focused on concerns regarding patients' expectations and issues encountered while using the PHR (e.g., cumbersome system interface and navigation). Time and sequence demands, such as time allotted to patient care, workload, timing of information access, and time required to use and learn the system, were identified as barriers. The availability of usable technology, specifically the lack of patient-accessible computers in waiting rooms, posed barriers to providers. Technology functions and features including accuracy of and patient access to sensitive information, missing functions, privacy, awkward security procedures, and general technical issues, were described as barriers. Barriers related to physical layout and geography focused on the clinic setting (e.g., rural or urban settings).

Barriers within provider work systems were identified for six subfactors related to organization factors (see Table 9
                         and Appendix A). Organizational policy/priorities, such as sensitive information permissions and lack of alignment with provider workflow, were recognized as barriers to providers' use. Barriers related to financial resources focused on the cost-benefit of using the system. Staffing levels, or the availability of healthcare institution staff to work with patients on PHRs, was described as a barrier. Providers had concerns regarding the rewards structure and whether or not they would be appropriately reimbursed for time spent reviewing PHRs. Inadequate training provided to healthcare institution staff and patients posed barriers to providers. Barriers associated with social norms and pressures included the healthcare institution staffs' technology use norms.

Barriers within provider work systems were identified for two subfactors related to external environment factors (see Table 10
                         and Appendix A). Extra-organizational rules, standards, and legislation enforcement, such as patient access to provider entered data and provider liability for all information within a patient's PHR, posed barriers to providers' use. Barriers related to industry social influences focused on the amount of time spent with patients and patients' expectations and assumptions (e.g., providers actively monitoring patients' health status on the portal).

Five articles reported caregiver-related barriers to the use of PHRs on at least one of the four HF/E paradigm levels: individual (n = 4), work system/unit (n = 4), organization (n = 1), and external environment factors (n = 1) (see Table 11
                         and Appendix A). Barriers within caregiver work systems were identified for three subfactors related to individual factors. Caregivers' skills, employment, knowledge, training, and education, including system awareness and experience using the Internet, were recognized as barriers to caregivers' use. Caregivers' needs, biases, beliefs, and mood, including the perceived system value, degree of need, comfort sharing medical information on the Internet, and communication preferences, posed barriers. Caregivers' behavior included the likelihood of receiving information from other sources and was described as a barrier.

Barriers within caregiver work systems were identified for four subfactors related to work system/unit factors (see Table 12
                         and Appendix A). Task demands, complexity and difficulty, such as the ease with which caregivers could access and use the system, were recognized as barriers. Barriers related to time and sequence demands focused on provider and system response times, Internet speed, and general time constraints. The availability of usable technology, including computer and Internet access, posed barriers to caregivers. Technology functions and features were described as barriers due to the lack of specific functions or features and concerns such as accessing frightening information.

Barriers within caregiver work systems were identified for one subfactor related to organization factors (see Table 13
                         and Appendix A). Financial resources, or the type of insurance caregivers have for their child, were recognized as barriers to caregivers.

Barriers within caregiver work systems were identified for one subfactor related to external environment factors (see Table 14
                         and Appendix A). Extra-organizational rules, standards, and legislation enforcement, or the sharing of data with external parties (e.g., government agencies, outside providers), posed barriers to caregivers.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Overall, the HF/E paradigm was comprehensive of the barriers identified in this review. Three subfactors included in that paradigm were not relevant and one additional subfactor was inductively derived. Size, weight, reach, and strength (individual factor), noise, temperature, and lighting (work system/unit factor), and management structure (organization factor) were included in the HF/E paradigm but not recognized as barriers in this review. The salience of these work system factors has also been identified in previous literature. For example, Smith and Sainfort (Smith and Sainfort, 1989) described factors similar to size, weight, reach and strength, noise, temperature and lighting, and management structure as influential in work system models focusing on stress reduction. These factors were similarly specified within the SEIPS 2.0 model (Holden et al., 2013), which focuses on provider, patient, and collaborative work systems. Additional work is needed to empirically determine if these theoretically identified work system factors serve as barriers to PHR use. Additionally, despite the applicability of the HF/E paradigm, one new subfactor was identified, behavior, which has been previously described as a germane work system factor in other domains, including stress reduction (Smith and Sainfort, 1989), computer security (Carayon, 2006), and self-care (Holden et al., 2015).

Overall, relatively limited attention to higher work system levels was demonstrated. A majority of the articles found barriers related to individual factors (n = 51) and work system/unit factors (n = 45); however, less than half found barriers related to organization factors (n = 26) and external environment factors (n = 27). More specifically needs, biases, beliefs, and mood (individual factor) (n = 35) and technology functions and features (work system/unit factor) (n = 32) were the most frequently recognized subfactors. This may be partly due to the familiarity and widespread use of models such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Holden and Karsh, 2010; Legris et al., 2003) and its derivatives, which emphasize the person–technology interaction and focus less on broader contexts.

There is a clear need to apply HF/E models and approaches that attend to higher levels of the work system. Identifying and understanding barriers at higher levels will require complementing traditional lab-based and task-oriented HF/E approaches with field-based approaches focused on the context of use. This will likely require HF/E professionals to include qualitative and mixed methods approaches (Desnoyers, 2004; Hancock and Scalma, 2004; Hignett and Wilson, 2004; Moray, 2000; Carayon et al., 2015). Using participatory design methods (Holden et al., 2013; Valdez et al., 2015b) that engage designers in patients', caregivers', and providers' naturalistic environments of use and reveal their perceptions of roles played by environmental factors (e.g., through interviews or focus groups) (Holden et al., 2015; Thompson and Valdez, 2013; Ancker et al., 2015) will be imperative.

Although Karsh and colleagues' HF/E paradigm was originally formulated for patients and providers, we found it feasible to apply it to caregivers. As with patients and providers, it was possible to map all identified barriers, except individual behaviors, to elements of the paradigm. However, few studies examined caregiver barriers, despite growing recognition within the HF/E and medical informatics communities of the critical role these individuals play (Tjora et al., 2005; Skeels, 2010; Chappell and Reid, 2002). As a likely consequence, barriers relevant to patients and providers centered on almost twice as many subfactors as those relevant to caregivers. As previously mentioned, the review found limited research focusing on organization and external environment factors. This general trend also held for caregivers; only two subfactors related to these phenomena were identified (see Fig. 3), despite evidence of the organizational and environmental challenges faced by caregivers (Werner et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2015; Streid et al., 2014). As encouraged by the Patient Engagement Framework (National eHealth Collaborative and Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Foundation, 2014), future research should include a focus on caregivers, specifically challenges they face at the organization and environmental levels.

Sociotechnical systems, including those specific to healthcare, comprise multiple individuals (Holden et al., 2013; Vincent, 2003). This review presents three distinct groups of individuals involved in patient care (i.e., patients, providers, caregivers). Although all may benefit from PHR use, this review demonstrates that each group has unique roles and is embedded in a different context. Consequently, work system models that explicitly represent the roles, contexts, and interactions of all actors jointly involved in the processes and outcomes of patient care are needed. This recommendation contrasts with existing work system models which, while theoretically enabling simultaneous representation of multiple individuals, do not distinguish between nor represent their overlapping vs. unique individual, work system/unit, organization, and external environment characteristics (Valdez et al. 2015). The phenomenon of overlapping work system factors existing at different levels is clearly illustrated here. For example, the degree of value providers find in PHRs is an individual factor for provider work systems (i.e., needs, biases, beliefs, and mood), but an external environment factor for patient work systems (i.e., industry social influences). Thus, sophisticated representations of work systems that account for intersections between what may, with less fidelity, be represented as multiple, separate work systems, are needed.

Although we did not conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the strength of the evidence, we did observe several repeatedly reported barriers. For example, level of education, degree of health and computer literacy, and access to technologies were recurring themes among barriers to patient and caregiver PHR use. According to an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report (2009) (Institute of Medicine, 2009), greater disparities exist among underserved populations, many of which experience these barriers. The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the National Institute on Aging (NIA), and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technologies (ONC) have prioritized development of consumer health IT aligned with laypersons' health management skills and health literacy (Alper et al., 2015; National Institute on Aging, 2013–2016; National Institute on Aging, 2010–2013a, 2013b). To prevent the growth of health and healthcare disparities caused by barriers to use, HF/E professionals must engage directly with underserved and elderly populations, ensuring that the next generation of consumer health IT is accessible and usable across demographics. Innovative solutions may be needed that focus not only on access through individually owned devices and text-based content, but also through community owned devices and voice-based content (Wells et al., 2015).

Another recurring theme was fear of accessing unwanted or frightening information (e.g., test results). To our knowledge, no policies exist that protect patients and caregivers from seeing such information. The absence of such policies may be partly due to a focus on management and control of health information access by others including providers, caregivers, and care partners (Sarkar and Bates, 2014). However, although the intent of objective 2C of the Federal Health IT Strategic Plan 2015–2020 (The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), 2014) is to protect the privacy and security of health information, the strategies it contains may be relevant to ensuring individual control over information access. For example, strategy 3 of objective 2C states, “Support the development of policies, standards, technology, guidance, and solutions to facilitate individuals' ability to manage, control, and authorize the disclosure of specific electronic health information.” This strategy could be extended to guidelines enabling individuals to manage, control, and authorize their own access to specific electronic health information. The ability to tailor personal access preferences will be necessary given that other patients have expressed the desire for faster release (Do et al., 2011) and greater accessibility (Krist et al., 2011) of test results. In other words, effort should be placed on allowing individuals to determine what information is presented in their PHRs and when it is made available, although a minimum waiting period under certain circumstances may be advisable (Do et al., 2011). Moreover, because elements of the medical record may be difficult for laypersons to understand, information access requires tools facilitating understanding and decision-making (Wagner et al., 2010; Do et al., 2011; Wiljer et al., 2010).

Patients, providers, and caregivers all commented on concerns regarding secure messaging. Both patients and caregivers worried that secure messaging could replace more personal modes of communication (i.e., calling). Similarly, providers expressed concerns that secure messaging would lead to increased workload and lost face-to-face interaction with patients. Despite all three groups' concerns, Meaningful Use Stage 2 (The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), 2013a) measure 17 calls for patients' ability to electronically message their providers. In design terms, this requires creating a solution to two conflicting viewpoints. Patients' and caregivers' fear of losing personal modes of communication may be partly due to not understanding how or when to use secure messaging. Thus, providing tutorials (Urowitz et al., 2012; Do et al., 2011) through the PHR either via web link or an embedded video may help patients feel more comfortable using another means to contact providers. However, as the use of secure messaging increases (Cronin et al., 2015), design solutions must also focus on lessening provider workload. One potential solution may be to implement a triage-based system that would route secure messages to appropriate staff members (Katz et al., 2003). Another option is to limit the number of characters allowed in messages, thus reducing the amount of text that must be read (Ye et al., 2010) and guiding the patient to use other forms of communication for in-depth inquiries.

Some barriers encountered in this review are well recognized within the HF/E and medical informatics communities. One frequently reported under work system/unit factors was that data entry was a time consuming and difficult task with which some patients needed assistance. This barrier may be addressed by traditional human factors methods (e.g., simplified user interface, capacity for multiple forms of data). These methods may be supplemented by training, such as through tutorials on data entry and retrieval. At a higher level of the work system, barriers related to system boundaries and lack of interoperability were also recurring themes. The need to address these barriers not only for PHRs, but also for EHRs, has been widely recognized within the medical informatics community and prioritized as a topic of research and intervention (The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), 2014; Otte-Trojel et al., 2015; Brennan et al., 2015).

Identifying barriers should serve as a foundation for devising design solutions, a key component of HF/E practice (Dul et al., 2012). This review demonstrates that constructing solutions to improve the experience of PHR use requires targeting barriers at all levels of the work system. This means not only targeting the individual, the task performed, and the technology used, but also the larger environment in which these interactions are embedded (Holden et al., 2013; National Research Council, 2011; Dul et al., 2012). Traditionally, when attending to contextual factors, HF/E professionals have focused on implications of these work system levels for technology design (i.e., determining how to design technology to align with contextual factors) (Valdez et al., 2015a; Marquard and Zayas-Caban, 2012; Moen and Brennan, 2005). Yet, as discussed during the recent HFES annual meeting, we acknowledge that the scope of our profession should be broadened to determine how to design and redesign these contextual environments. Current interventions to increase provider PHR use within the United States include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) EHR Incentive Program, which rewards healthcare providers who demonstrate meaningful use (i.e., improved patient care outcomes through meeting core objectives of Meaningful Use Stages 1, 2 and 3) with incentive payments (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2015). HF/E professionals should collaborate on designing other interventions at higher work system levels to address barriers to PHR use for providers, patients, and caregivers. For example, insurance companies enact patient wellness programs, which incentivize patients' participation in health-related activities such as exercising or attending wellness checkups (Department of Health and Human Services, 2013). Similar programs could address patient and caregiver barriers to PHR use.

The limitations of this review yield four directions for future research. First, included articles were limited to studies conducted in six countries, highlighting the need for work that explicitly addresses organization and external environment barriers arising in other national contexts. Second, the coding strategy used in this review focused on assigning barriers to specific work system factors. Future research should build on this by studying interactions between barriers within and across works systems. Third, this review is systematic in that specific criteria were used to determine article inclusion; however, the authors did not assess the level of evidence for the contribution of each work system factor to PHR use. This latter should be the focus of future inquiry. Lastly, although we consulted with one health science librarian and one computer science librarian to assist in our literature search, we acknowledge that developing an exhaustive search strategy is challenging. In retrospect, additional terms such as “impediment” and “obstacle” should be incorporated into future systematic reviews on this topic.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This review focused on patient, provider, and caregiver work system barriers to PHR use and is timely given developments intended to accelerate PHR use such as the recent proposal of Meaningful Use Stage 3 guidelines within the United States. The results highlight the need to address how organization and external environment factors hinder PHR use, as well as how such barriers can be overcome. Moreover, simultaneous attention to patients, providers, and caregivers lays the groundwork for developing new work system models that explicitly account for the unique and overlapping roles and contexts of distinct individuals within a sociotechnical system. Future design directions should address low health literacy, access to unwanted health information, secure messaging impacts on provider workflow, secure messaging appeal to patients and caregivers, ease of data entry, and interoperability. A key next step is to synthesize the level of evidence for each type of PHR use barrier for each work system to guide intervention design.
