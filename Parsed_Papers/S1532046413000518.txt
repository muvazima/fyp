                  The potential of plant-based remedies has been documented in both traditional and contemporary biomedical literature. Such types of text sources may thus be sources from which one might identify potential plant-based therapies (“phyto-therapies”). Concept-based analytic approaches have been shown to uncover knowledge embedded within biomedical literature. However, to date there has been limited attention towards leveraging such techniques for the identification of potential phyto-therapies. This study presents concept-based analytic approaches for the retrieval and ranking of associations between plants and human diseases. Focusing on identification of phyto-therapies described in MEDLINE, both MeSH descriptors used for indexing and MetaMap inferred UMLS concepts are considered. Furthermore, the identification and ranking consider both direct (i.e., plant concepts directly correlated with disease concepts) and inferred (i.e., plant concepts associated with disease concepts based on shared signs and symptoms) relationships. Based on the two scoring methodologies used in this study, it was found that a Vector Space Model approach outperformed probabilistic reliability based inferences. An evaluation of the approach is provided based on therapeutic interventions catalogued in both ClinicalTrials.gov and NDF-RT. The promising findings from this feasibility study highlight the challenges and applicability of concept-based analytic strategies for distilling phyto-therapeutic knowledge from text based knowledge sources like MEDLINE.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Therapeutic associations between plants and human diseases (“phyto-therapies”) have been recognized and acknowledged throughout history. In contemporary medicine, phyto-therapies comprise nearly one-third of commercial drugs [1]. For example, nearly half of the currently used chemotherapeutic cancer drugs are derived from predominantly plant sources [2]. Nonetheless, the rate of drug discovery based on natural sources has been relatively static over the past decade [3]. Such a trend, in conjunction with the growing need of pharmaceuticals, suggests an opportunity to devise new approaches to identify new drugs from natural sources. Botanicals have provided cures for various human ailments over the ages, and may thus be a potentially valuable source for new drug candidates. To date, there has only been limited exploration of new plant-derived pharmacological agents that leverage contemporary resources or methodologies [4].

Knowledge about the medicinal properties of plants and phytochemicals has been documented in traditional and modern peer-reviewed biomedical literature. To this end, biomedical literature resources may be a source for essential leads for the identification of pharmacological starting points [5]. The volume of biomedical knowledge continues to increase (e.g., MEDLINE is growing by 1.5 million citations a year) and thus will require the development of methods to extract information embedded within text resources to keep pace with the description of biomedical insights. Concept-based analytic techniques have been successfully applied in the biomedical domain for providing researchers with the ability to explore important associations between concepts from literature. Such approaches have been shown to support knowledge discovery and assist in validation of hypothesis driven biomedical studies [6]. In pursuit of uncovering valuable phyto-therapeutic leads, automated approaches may be of utility to sift through volumes of biomedical data to generate plausible testable hypotheses. When integrated with routine biological or ethnobotanical approaches, such hypothesis generation methods may identify associations that otherwise may not have been obvious from manual searches. However, limited attention has been given to the development of concept-based analytic approaches to support the identification of plant-based therapeutics. As with many concept-based analytic studies, identification of potential phyto-therapies faces the challenge of distilling enormous amounts of data to enable the discovery of potentially new knowledge.

Co-word analysis was devised by French bibliometrics experts at the Centre de Sociologie de l’Innovation of the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines of Paris and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in the late 1970s, and implemented in a system called “LEXIMAPPE” [7–9]. Since then, several systems have been developed that exploit keyword co-occurrence statistics to infer direct relations among biological entities. This method has been successfully employed in several fields [9,10]. Perhaps most relevant to the present study is the “ABC model” proposed by Swanson to discover hidden relations among entities [11,12]. The ABC model states that if there exist known associations between entities A and B, and between B and C, then it can be inferred that there may be a hidden association between entities A and C.

In the context of high-throughput data extraction, concept-based systems have shown promise [13–15]. Controlled vocabularies or ontologies representing concepts are helpful in dealing with variations in terminology and expressions in literature [16,17]. Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems have been developed that can determine concept equivalence and similarity from text [18]. Use of controlled vocabularies or ontologies, in combination with NLP systems, to postulate new associations between biological entities from unstructured text has enabled flexible searches of biomedical text at varying levels of granularity [19,20].

The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) controlled vocabulary [21] along with concepts catalogued in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus [22] have been widely used in concept-based systems for literature-based knowledge discovery in biomedical domain from bibliographic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, which indexes over 20 million biomedical citations) [23–25]. There have been only a few studies to date that apply such concept-based approaches to identify potential phyto-therapies. One study used MeSH-based co-word cluster analysis to reveal some important topics relative to Chinese herbal drugs [23]. Another study demonstrated the use of MeSH descriptors and UMLS semantic types within the context of Swanson’s ABC model to identify potential therapeutic uses of Curcuma longa 
                     [26]. There remain significant opportunities to use concept-based analytic approaches to identify phyto-therapeutic knowledge embedded within biomedical literature.

The goal of this study was to explore concept-based analytic approaches for phyto-therapeutic hypothesis discovery. Specifically, an approach was developed to identify potential phyto-therapeutics from MEDLINE-indexed biomedical literature by analyzing relationships between three types of entities: (1) ‘plant or plant related’; (2) ‘signs and symptoms’; and (3) ‘disease or syndrome.’ Direct associations were first identified between ‘plant or plant related’ and ‘disease or syndrome’ entities and ranked using co-occurrence scores. Next, inferred associations were also identified between plants and diseases by leveraging relationships that shared ‘signs and symptoms’ entities using Swanson’s ABC model, leveraging either a probabilistic reliability based inference or a Vector Space Model (VSM) for scoring best putative linkages. Results were evaluated relative to phyto-therapies associated with clinical trials (from ClinicalTrials.gov) or indexed in a reference drug terminology (NDF-RT). Such resources were chosen for the evaluation of the correlations in this study as these were considered to be the best available sources associated with contemporary medicine that catalogue in some way plant-based treatments that have been accepted, validated, or have received considerable attention towards validation. The promising results of this feasibility study suggest that concept-based analytic approaches may be used to identify potential phyto-therapies from within existing stores of biomedical knowledge as reflected in biomedical literature.

The main goal of this study was to extract and rank associations between plants and human diseases from MEDLINE records using a concept-based approach. Two relationship datasets were developed and used for this study: (1) MeSH descriptors and (2) concepts predicted using the Metamap NLP system. These data sets are referred to as “MeSH based” and “MetaMap based,” respectively. Examples of the entities associated with each of the datasets are shown in Fig. 1
                     .

A Ruby script that leveraged the Entrez utilities via the BioRuby gem was used to generate a list of PubMed identifiers (PMID) associated with MeSH descriptors of interest. Three categories of MeSH descriptors were the subject of interest in this study:
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 Plant-related MeSH descriptors: The plant-related descriptors were defined as those that included either plant names or phytochemicals. For plant names, all descriptors included within the MeSH hierarchy “Plants [B01.650]” were considered. For phytochemicals (plant-associated chemicals), all descriptors from the MeSH hierarchy “Chemicals and Drugs [D]” were considered excluding “Inorganic Chemicals [D01]” and “Enzymes and Coenzymes [D08].” This initial list was then screened through a comprehensive list of phytochemicals listed in Dr. Duke’s Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical database [27]. Dr. Duke’s database contains information related to activity of phytochemicals and ethnobotanical uses of plants. This database has been used in published studies as a reference source for medicinal plant information [28–30]. The screening of MeSH descriptors against the phytochemical list was performed by approximate string matching as implemented by the “Amatch” Ruby gem. Finally, only those phytochemical descriptors with at least one activity listed in Dr. Duke’s Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Database were kept.


                                 Signs and Symptoms MeSH descriptors: All MeSH descriptors included within the “Signs and Symptoms [C23.888]” hierarchy.


                                 Disease MeSH descriptors: All the MeSH descriptors included within MeSH “Disease [C]” hierarchy were included except those included within “Animal Disease [C22],” “Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms [C23],” “Occupational Diseases [C24],” “Substance-Related Disorders [C25],” and “Wounds and Injuries [C26].”

The MetaMapped MEDLINE Baseline Results were used from the 2011 MEDLINE/PubMed Baseline Repository (created on November 19, 2010), which consists of a MetaMap analysis of 19,569,568 Medline citations. A Ruby script was used to extract UMLS concepts associated with three UMLS semantic types: (1) Plant (Unique identifier T002, “plnt”): All the concepts included within this semantic type were considered without any screening. This semantic type includes concepts that are plant names along with the names of plant parts. For MetaMap based dataset, phytochemicals were not considered; (2) Sign or Symptom (Unique identifier T184, “sosy”): All concepts included within this semantic type were included. This semantic type includes observable manifestations of disease or conditions experienced by patient; or (3) Disease or Syndrome (Unique identifier T047, “dsyn”): All concepts included within this semantic type were included; This study only considered those concepts that were common to both the MeSH based and MetaMap based datasets. Two levels of scope were used for this study: (1) Title and Abstract and (2) Utterance (as determined by the MetaMap). The UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs), their respective semantic types, PMID and utterance id were extracted and stored into a MySQL database.

Two types of associations were explored in this study. Direct associations were defined as the co-occurrence of two concepts within the same scope (i.e., MeSH list, title and abstract level, or utterance level). By contrast, indirect associations were defined as hidden associations between two concepts via linking concepts (Fig. 2
                     ).

Direct associations were determined by identifying co-occurring concepts from the aforementioned three categories. Within the scope of the present study, three types of associations were identified (1) ‘Plant or Plant related’ (plnt) 
                        
                           ⇔
                        
                      ‘Sign or Symptom’ (sosy); (2) ‘Sign or Symptom’ (sosy) 
                        
                           ⇔
                        
                      ‘Disease or Syndrome’ (dsyn); and (3) ‘Plant or Plant related’ (plnt) 
                        
                           ⇔
                        
                      ‘Disease or Syndrome’ (dsyn). The direct associations were scored using the approaches described in Box 1 (Eqs. (1) and (2)). In Eq. (1), the connection between two co-occurring term is scored as the conditional probability of the occurrence of a concept given that of the second concept. The approach in Eq. (2) uses the term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf–idf) measure to evaluate how important an association of one concept is to another concept in a collection of concepts. After direct associations between concepts of semantic types plnt, sosy and dsyn were identified and scored, inferred association scores were calculated for links between plnt concepts and dsyn concepts linked via sosy concepts. Inferred associations were ranked using the two approaches as described in Box 1 (Eqs. (3) and (4)). The first approach (Eq. (3)) evaluates the probabilistic reliability of an inferred association calculated using direct association scores as calculated from Eq. (1). The second approach uses a Vector Space Model (VSM) that takes into consideration the degree of similarity between vectors using a cosine similarity metric (Eq. (4)). A final score was calculated for potential plant-disease relationships that incorporated both the direct and inferred links as follows:
                        
                           Box 1
                           
                              Two approaches were used to score the direct associations:

To evaluate the relevance of the proposed links from the analyses, plant-related therapies and disease relations were extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov [31] and the National Drug File Reference Terminology [NDF-RT] [32]. ClinicalTrials.gov, hosted by the National Institutes of Health in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration, is the largest registry of clinical trials conducted around the world. The Veterans Health Administration’s NDF-RT is a concept-oriented terminology that contains information about drugs and ingredients, including potential uses.

In ClinicalTrials.gov, plant-related interventions can be found under the main category of “Dietary Supplements.” The interventions from this category and their equivalent MeSH descriptors as well as UMLS concepts were identified using the UMLS Terminology Services (UTS) API 2.0 via a Java program. Only those interventions present in both the MeSH based dataset and MetaMap based dataset were considered. Specific disease associations were then identified via a Ruby script using RESTful API calls to ClinicalTrials.gov. The associated terms were finally processed using MetaMap to identify preferred UMLS concepts (including MeSH descriptors).

NDF-RT was acquired from a local installation of RxNorm, which was downloaded on July 2, 2012. Plant related interventions were identified as those under the class ‘HERBS/ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES’ (NUI N0000029634). For this class, relevant UMLS concepts (including MeSH descriptors) were identified from the ‘RXNCONSO’ and ‘RXNSAT’ tables. The therapeutic associations for each candidate interventions were then identified from the table ‘RXNREL’ by querying RxNorm for the relations ‘may_treat’, ‘may_prevent’, ‘may_be_treated_by’ or ‘may_be_prevented_by’.

Precision and recall for identifying candidate plant-disease associations relative to the evaluation datasets were calculated as follows:

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Medicinal use of plants has been long studied and there is a growing body of biomedical literature describing potential plant-based therapeutics. The extraction of potential knowledge from biomedical literature requires the development of concept-based analytic approaches and mapping of concepts to relevant terminologies, which continues to be a challenging area of active research [18,19,33]. The identification of mentions of therapeutic applications of herbs in both historical and contemporary texts may result in an important resource for subsequent bioprospecting tasks. However, the methodology for extracting useful information from such resources has, to date, been cumbersome and time consuming [5]. Computational approaches to analyze the deluge of embedded phyto-pharmaceutical knowledge in biomedical literature may enable the prioritization and potential validation of pharmacological leads. This is made possible through the use of a range of ranking methodologies that can use available data to prioritize potential medicinal plant species associated with specific diseases. In other contexts, these types of strategies have been used for mining meaningful relationships from literature-based knowledge to facilitate identification and prioritization of candidate genes for diseases and drug targets [34–36]. In the context of potential medicinal plants, it would be an essential step to narrow down the research focus to only suitable candidates. Furthermore, the identification of high priority plant species may, in combination with additional biomedical data, allow for determining the practical feasibility to pursue drug exploration. This study explored the potential of concept-based analytic approaches to identify potential therapeutic associations between plants and human diseases from biomedical literature.

For the MeSH based analysis, a list of plant-related MeSH descriptors was generated that were either in the “Plant [B01.650]” MeSH hierarchy or a phyto-chemical indexed in Dr. Duke’s Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Database. A total of 1506 MeSH descriptors were identified (1155 plants and 351 phytochemicals). Dr. Duke’s database includes additional plant related terms (e.g., cholesterol, ecdysone, estrogens, estrone, and testosterone) that were deemed hard to conceptually associate as exclusively phytochemicals. However, these terms can be associated with plants as provided in Dr. Duke’s Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Database. Therefore, descriptors were kept based on a rule of including MeSH chemical descriptors that were catalogued in Dr. Duke’s Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Database with at least one listed activity. Signs and Symptoms MeSH descriptors used for this study totaled 315. Disease or Symptom MeSH descriptors used for this study totaled 4110. For this study, direct interactions were identified and scored (using the scheme described in Box 1) based on co-occurring MeSH descriptors that had at least one publication in common (Table 1
                        ).

For the MetaMap based dataset, 11,995 distinct UMLS concepts with the semantic type plnt were extracted from the MetaMapped MEDLINE Baseline Results. The number of UMLS concepts with the semantic type sosy or dsyn was respectively 2432 and 19,188. Direct interactions were identified and scored between UMLS concepts of semantic type plnt and dsyn using co-occurrence statistics as described in Box 1 (Table 2
                        ).

In order to compare the relative performance of inferring associations using the MeSH based and MetaMap based datasets, concepts common to both datasets were isolated and used separately for evaluation. Table 3
                         provides the number of direct associations identified. In summary, a total of 1145 plant, 142 signs and symptoms and 2579 disease concepts were found in common among the MeSH based and MetaMap based datasets.

Inferred associations between plants and diseases from the MeSH based and MetaMap based datasets were determined using their respective complete lists of sign or symptoms. Herbal and traditional systems of medical diagnosis involve tracing the precursory and typical symptoms to underlying patterns of “disharmony.” The available knowledge, as reflected in literature, related to herbal and traditional systems presents several challenges. The published data about medicinal applications of plants are mostly associated with ethnobotanical studies or derived from ethnobotanical surveys. Such explorations use descriptions of visible clinical manifestations (i.e., signs and symptoms) to communicate with traditional healers for identification of similar disease states and their respective botanical treatment. This is especially the case for botanical treatments identified from ancient herbal texts. Hence, signs and symptoms associations are important in the selection of potential phyto-therapies. Based on this premise, this study demonstrated an approach to identify inferred associations between plant related and disease related concepts using signs and symptoms as a link. Co-occurrence scores were used to identify occurrence of plant related or disease concepts in the context of sign or symptoms entities. An example of such inferred hypothesis is depicted in Fig. 3
                         where our model suggests a use of Pelargonium spp. for the treatment of Bronchitis. The plant concept (“Prelargonium spp.”) is connected to the disease concept (“Bronchitis”) via their respective associations with the concepts (chest pain, cough and dyspnea) included within semantic type “signs and symptoms.”

In addition to potential therapeutic associations, the high scoring interactions mined from both the MeSH based and MetaMap based datasets also identified potential toxicity relationships. Table 4
                         shows examples of some of the high scoring toxicity associations identified from our analysis. Owing to the shared nature of signs and symptoms and disease or syndrome concepts describing both toxicity and therapeutic potential, separation of these two classes would require additional steps to determine of specific context. The extraction and classification of such toxicity relationships of herbal interventions from free text appears to be a challenging, yet essential, task. A possible approach may be to adapt a machine learning based relation extraction system that could distinguish toxic versus therapeutic relations. The strength of such an approach lies in the ability to select specific features for learning and subsequent classification. For example, feature vectors can be used represent appropriate contextual relations within a given scope of text, potentially providing robust discriminatory characteristics for a classification model. Such an approach has been shown to work well for the extraction of adverse drug effect relationship from corpora [37] as well as for filtering spam e-mail messages [38]. Nonetheless, it may still be worth considering other statistical or logic-rule based techniques that may not require as involved a training process.

Concept-based associations between plants and their therapeutic uses were extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov using MeSH descriptors (including plant and phytochemicals). The full set of association scores used for evaluation is provided in Supplemental Table 1 (MeSH), 2 (Metamap-Abstract) and 3 (Metamap-utterance). Table 5
                         shows some of the high scoring inferred interactions (Metamap based) for which no direct interactions were present in MEDLINE. Some of the low scoring associations were manually evaluated based on examining ClinicalTrials.gov descriptions. It was found that such associations were either incorrectly indexed under a given plant related intervention or were not the major focus of the study. For example, ‘Humulus’ listed as ‘hops’ shows “Male Infertility” in trial ‘NCT00756561’. However the actual study is about “The purpose of this investigational study is to find out what hormones are present in healthy male testicles using fine needle aspiration.” “Frangula” includes two studies: NCT00767156 and NCT00739713 where sea buckthorn (Hippophae sp.) is the major intervention. “Fragaria” (strawberry) is associated with gastrooesophageal reflux in study NCT01101646. However, in the actual intervention in that study is rabeprazole sodium, which happens to be administered in a strawberry flavored vehicle.

The interventions listed in NDF-RT included plant terms or phytochemicals or were listed as herbal preparations including several ingredients. Since both plant and phytochemicals were included in the initial MeSH based dataset, the overall MeSH based scores are provided for the associations (Supplemental Table 7). The low scoring interactions from the MeSH based data did not have direct MeSH descriptor based association scores. Such associations were tested in the MetaMap dataset (focusing on only plant concepts). It was found that such associations had higher MetaMap based inferred scores. It was also noticed that for a given association a related disease term was scored much higher. For example, Borago was associated with Nutrition Disorder and Deficiency diseases with low scores, however it was highly scored with the term Malnutrition.

As an evaluation of the MeSH based and Metamap based datasets the predicted associations were compared to those found in ClinicalTrials.gov. The set of association scores for plant and disease concepts common to MeSH and Metamap based datasets used for evaluation are provided in Supplemental Table 4 (MeSH), 5 (Metamap-Abstract) and 6 (Metamap-utterance). The assumption for this evaluation was that ClinicalTrials.gov reflected a list of possible plant-disease associations based on clinical trials. Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                         show the precision and recall of the probabilistic and tf–idf scoring methods. Comparison of direct associations only and direct+indirect associations show that addition of inferred scores significantly improves the recall values. “Cut-off” values were defined as minimum threshold scores for associations as calculated using Eq. (5) to be considered as relevant. Tables 6 and 7
                        
                         show the precision and recall values at a cut-off value of 0.1 (using the tf–idf scoring scheme). For the evaluation relative to ClinicalTrials.gov, the tf–idf scoring scheme appears to perform better than the probabilistic approach. It is important to note that the results from this evaluation only reflect the plant and disease therapeutic associations that are of enough clinical interest to suggest a clinical trial. However, it is important to keep in mind that only few of the plant or plant related interventions may have been tested clinically even though several indications of medicinal uses exists within the biomedical literature. Therefore, false positives associations in this evaluation may not be truly false relationships; they are only possible associations that are not associated with a clinical trial. The distribution of false positives that have direct interactions relative to citation support is listed in Table 8
                        .

The number of plant and disease associations as extracted from NDF-RT was 64. The dataset also included phytochemical based information with few mentions of actual plant sources. To provide a reasonable size of dataset for evaluation of the MeSH based and Metamap based datasets, the phytochemicals were associated with plants that serve as major source. The set of association scores for plant and disease concepts common to MeSH and Metamap based datasets used for evaluation are provided in Supplemental Tables 8 (MeSH), 9 (Metamap-Abstract) and 10 (Metamap-utterance). However, such associations scored lower when compared to the ClinicalTrials.gov dataset. The final scores remained mostly less than 1.0 (only 12.06% exceeded >1.0) on a scale of 0–2. When the original (plant+phytochemical) dataset was scored using the initial MeSH based dataset (which included both plants and phytochemicals) those associations scored significantly higher (Supplemental Table 7). As was observed with the ClinicalTrials.gov dataset based evaluation, the recall values were significantly improved by addition of inferred associations (Figs. 6 and 7
                        
                        ) and the tf–idf scoring method performed better. Tables 6 and 7 show the precision and recall values at a cut-off value of 0.1 (using the tf–df scoring scheme). Finally, as with the ClinicalTrials.gov based evaluation, it is important to emphasize that the false positive rate may have been artificially high; the distribution of false positive that have citation support is listed in Table 8.

Two datasets (MeSH based and Metamap based) were used in this feasibility study to assess the applicability of automated extraction of therapeutic associations between plants and human diseases. The results were evaluated using two datasets, ClinicalTrials.gov (Figs. 4 and 5) and NDF-RT (Figs. 6 and 7). The figures show precision and recall values at different cut-off values aiming to provide a comparative view of the approaches explored in this study, notably: (1) Direct versus Direct+inferred, (2) Probabilistic versus VSM scoring. It was found that the incorporation of inferred associations in addition to direct associations significantly improved the recall values in both evaluation datasets. Between the two scoring schemes, VSM preformed better than probabilistic reliability for both evaluation datasets. Within a defined document space, the tf–idf weighing strategy used in VSM provides a way to highlight rare interactions. VSM approaches therefore perform well with the measuring of the similarity of semantic relations as evident from literature [39–41]. The VSM approach that is built on an explicit relatedness to a distributional hypothesis also helps filter noisy data in terms of deprioritizing trivial relationships from a given document space and instead emphasizes the similarity of contexts that associate a given set of terms. The MetaMap processed dataset was evaluated at two levels of scope: (1) Title and Abstract and (2) Utterance. It was observed that recall values at the utterance level were lower without significantly affecting the precision for both evaluation datasets (Table 6 and Figs. 5 and 7). A comparison of associations derived from MeSH descriptors used for MEDLINE indexing to MeSH descriptors extracted using MetaMap is also provided. From this study, it can be seen that associations derived from text (Title and Abstract) processed using MetaMap provide higher recall values (although slightly affecting the precision) for the same collection of terms (common to MeSH and MetaMap based dataset) when compared to MeSH descriptors associated with MEDLINE indexing. The generally lower overall precision and recall scores can be mainly attributed to the fact that, even though there are several indications for therapeutic use of plants within contemporary literature, there is a general lack of translational efforts to apply such findings specifically for drug discovery. More specifically, the false positives from this study may simply not have been tested or described in the chosen gold standards (ClinicalTrials.gov or NDF-RT). The availability of a gold standard, which is vetted by domain experts (e.g., ethnobotanists) is therefore an essential next step for more accurate assessment of automated approaches such as the ones used in this study. Additionally, the improvement of automated systems will undoubtedly require the direct input from ethnobotanical and other relevant domain (e.g., clinical and botanical) expertise.

This preliminary study evaluated the applicability of concept-based analytic approaches for identifying and ranking of phyto-therapeutic associations embedded within biomedical text (as indexed by MEDLINE). The results of this study demonstrate the use of controlled vocabularies (e.g., MeSH) for systematically developing inferences from text. Although the study did reveal several domain-specific issues, it appears promising to extend this study to incorporate a wider breadth of corpora. In particular, there may be utility in applying the techniques demonstrated in this study to traditional or ethnobotanical texts, such as those that have been made publicly available by initiatives such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library [42] Such an integrative approach that brings together legacy and contemporary ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge may lead to the identification of potential plant based medicines that have been overlooked.

Herbal medicine has been practiced for many years. Diagnosing ailments in herbal medicine involved a conceptualization of underlying disharmony based on required risk, signs and symptoms, as well as causal examination [28,43]. Zhang proposed hierarchical latent class (HLC) models to discover latent structures, and applied HLC models to discover the latent variables in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnosis of kidney deficiency syndromes [44]. The development of concept-based analytic approaches for retrieval of knowledge related to herbal medicine requires the reliable identification of concepts and accurate inference of relationships between them. Concept-based analytic approaches have shown potential for the identification of important drug associations from biomedical literature, such as identifying gene-drug or gene-disease interactions and potential repurposing of drugs [45–47].

This study explored the feasibility of concept-based knowledge discovery for extracting and ranking potential phyto-therapies that are embedded within biomedical literature. The results suggest that there is promise in probabilistic or vector based approaches to provide valuable phyto-therapeutic leads. However, a more detailed statistical comparison of the inferences from the probabilistic and Vector Space Model will be needed to validate the potential viability of phytotherapies.

MeSH based analysis for direct scores are conceptually more reliable because MeSH annotations in MEDLINE are expert curated. MeSH descriptors thus provide more contextual information about the entries in MEDLINE. However, a significant limitation is that MeSH descriptors may represent a lesser level granularity when compared to the breadth of available UMLS Metathesaurus concepts. On the other hand, Natural Language Processing system based inferred concepts might result in word ambiguity issues. For example, even with limiting the MetaMapped predicted concepts to semantic type ‘plant,’ there were ambiguous concepts identified (e.g., Genus Anemia and Lens plant) that resulted in high-ranking false positives. Table 9
                         provides some examples of word ambiguities encountered in this study. Future work will require using additional word sense disambiguation methods that can utilize contextual information, such as has been developed previously [48]. These types of challenges may be used as motivation for the development a phyto-specific NLP system to extract plant names, phytochemicals, and potential relationships with disease to overcome the problems associated with word ambiguities.

The inference model implemented in this study was based on a Vector Space Model (VSM) to predict interactions between plant and disease related concepts. VSM has been used widely in context of information retrieval systems for relevance ranking of documents according to query [49,50]. The proposed inference approach adapted in this study follows the diagnostic criteria dependent on signs and symptoms for uncovering hidden associations using known interaction from co-occurrence statistics. The utility of such an approach is its ability to extract and link plant-related and disease-related concepts even when the text only mentions symptomatic use of specific plant-related entities. It may also be interesting to identify phyto-therapeutic associations that are connected via pathophysiological concepts (either in place of, or in addition to, signs and symptoms). An additional scoring scheme is also provided which calculates the reliability of inference using probabilistic approach. Future work will involve carrying out a more in depth statistical comparison of similarity measures for scoring and ranking associations of interest.

A major challenge with the use of computational approaches for identification of plant-based therapeutics is the evaluation of the validity of potential associations, since there are no current “gold standard” references for phyto-therapies. The use of ClinicalTrials.gov and NDF-RT as evaluation datasets resulted in seemingly poor recall and precision statistics; however, neither of these evaluation datasets should be considered complete catalogues for phyto-therapies, nor were either designed for tracking exclusively phyto-therapies. Indeed, closer examination of false positive associations from either evaluation dataset resulted in identification of peer-reviewed literature evidence for the validity of the associations. The potential health benefits are mentioned for dietary supplements, which is the category under which most herbal combinations are dispensed. During the course of the present study, several databases were explored to identify concrete relationships listed that could be organized relative to current ontologies (as indexed in the UMLS). For example, the Therapeutic Target Database includes a section for nature derived drugs categorized as “Approved Drugs, Clinical Trial Drugs and Preclinical Drugs” [51]; however, while species of origin is provided, their specific use is described using broad therapeutic classes. TCM-ID is another database that provides information related to TCM formulations that provides detailed clinical manifestations of specific herbal formulae but does not provide a compiled list of plant species names [52]. Such a resource that compiles plant-based therapeutic associations that are accepted and validated by contemporary scientific methodologies is essential. Creation of such a resource would require manual curation after thorough assessment of evidence, perhaps in combination with automated techniques for identifying putative correlations. Future work will thus require additional mining of catalogued relationships to develop a more complete “gold standard” of plant-disease relationships, such as those that have been catalogued in popular drug resources like Drugbank and PharmGKB.

The medicinal aspects of plants reported in literature are varied ranging from symptomatic associations, physiological activity, disease or even broader pharmacological categories. Such is the case even with several medicinal plant databases. Lack of specific context renders the limited applicability of such knowledge. Concept-based computational models leveraging semantic granularity may provide more efficient ways to deal with such problems and extract or rank embedded knowledge. Future work will thus include the exploring of relationship strengths at different levels of abstraction (e.g., leveraging the hierarchical structure of ontologies). This may be useful in retrieving and ranking the overall strength of a given plant-disease association.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Here, a feasibility study is presented that aims to identify plant-based therapeutic relationships from vast biomedical literature contained within MEDLINE. The proposed methodology uses a concept-based approach to provide the ability to extract and rank direct and inferred associations from within MeSH based and Metamap based datasets. The validation of the identified phyto-therapies in this study was based on data derived from ClinicalTrials.gov and NDF-RT. Based on these two datasets, and of the two scoring methodologies used, it was found that Vector Space Model approaches outperform probabilistic reliability based inferences. The results highlight several challenges and opportunities for exploring plant therapeutic data from literature sources that may be incorporated into future studies. Besides the challenge of unavailability of a comprehensive “Gold Standard” of medicinal plants and potential applications for treatment of disease, several additional issues were highlighted in this study. These include the need to develop: (1) approaches to distinguish therapeutic versus toxicity plant-disease relationships; (2) address word sense disambiguation issues that are specific to plant nomenclature; (3) approaches to define and extract phyto-therapeutic relationships between concepts in addition to simple extraction of defined semantic type concepts. This study also supports the application of semantic granularity based models for phyto-domain specific information retrieval in addition to semantic similarity based models. Collectively, the findings of this study may inspire automated systems that are specific to the identification of potential phyto-therapies from existing historical and contemporary literature.
