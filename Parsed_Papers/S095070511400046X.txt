                  In multiple attribute decision making (MADM), different attribute weights may generate different solutions, which means that attribute weights significantly influence solutions. When there is a lack of sufficient data, knowledge, and experience for a decision maker to generate attribute weights, the decision maker may expect to find the most satisfactory solution based on unknown attribute weights called a robust solution in this study. To generate such a solution, this paper proposes a robust evidential reasoning (ER) approach to compare alternatives by measuring their robustness with respect to attribute weights in the ER context. Alternatives that can become the best with the support of one or more sets of attribute weights are firstly identified. The measurement of robustness of each identified alternative from two perspectives, i.e., the optimal situation of the alternative and the insensitivity of the alternative to a variation in attribute weights is then presented. The procedure of the proposed approach is described based on the combination of such identification of alternatives and the measurement of their robustness. A problem of car performance assessment is investigated to show that the proposed approach can effectively produce a robust solution to a MADM problem with unknown attribute weights.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

With a view to solving a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problem, the assessments of alternatives on each attribute are usually aggregated after being weighted by attribute weights. The aggregated assessments of alternatives are then used to generate a solution to the MADM problem. Different attribute weights may create different solutions to the problem. As a result, attribute weights significantly influence solutions to the problem.

In literature, there are three categories of methods to determine attribute weights, comprising subjective, objective, and hybrid methods [40]. Subjective methods use the subjective preference of a decision maker to determine attribute weights (e.g., [2,8,13,21,22,28–31,34,36–38,59]). Differently, objective methods use a decision matrix to determine attribute weights (e.g., [4,5,7,9,10,35,40,45]). The subjective preference of a decision maker and a decision matrix are synthetically employed in hybrid methods to determine attribute weights (e.g., [12,25,41]). However, different subjective methods may elicit different attribute weights. There is no single method that can guarantee more accurate attribute weights and further more satisfactory solutions than others [9,10]. Different objective methods are designed on different principles, such as the principle of maximum contrast [9,10] and the combination principle of maximum contrast and minimum correlation [40]. When a decision maker has a lack of sufficient data, knowledge, and experience, he or she will be unsure about which principle is the best to generate the most appropriate attribute weights and further the most satisfactory solution. To guarantee the most satisfactory solution for the decision maker in this situation, all attribute weights in a feasible or predefined weight space rather than a set of attribute weights generated by a specific method should be considered. More specifically, the decision maker would prefer one alternative supported by more sets of attribute weights to be the best to the others in the satisfactory solution. Such a solution is called a robust solution based on unknown attribute weights in this study.

To generate a robust solution, except attribute weights, the assessments of a decision maker need to be flexibly modeled. In a real situation where data for assessing alternatives against criteria are partially or completely unavailable, or the knowledge of the decision maker for alternative evaluation is not sufficient, the decision maker is more likely to give uncertain (or imprecise) assessments. To model various kinds of uncertainties such as ignorance, fuzziness, interval data, and interval belief degrees in a unified format, the evidential reasoning (ER) approach was developed in the 1990s. It has been under development in recent years [6,19,44,50,54–56] to uniformly solve uncertain MADM problems. In particular, precise and interval numbers can be handled in the ER approach by converting them into distributed assessments [44], similar to the conversion of machine measurements into subjective assessments in the evaluation of new product development [24]. The above analysis shows that the extension of the ER approach to model and solve uncertain MADM problems with unknown attribute weights is a new and significant exploration, which is different from most existing MADM methods (e.g., [1,3,11,23,49,58]).

For this purpose, we firstly identify which alternatives can become the best with the support of at least one set of attribute weights. Then, the robustness of each identified alternative is measured from two perspectives, i.e., the optimal situation of the alternative and the insensitivity of the alternative to a variation in attribute weights, which is used to compare the identified alternatives. The iterations of the two steps are intended to develop a robust ER (RER) approach to generate a robust solution in the ER context.

The main contributions of this paper include the following: (1) the identification of alternatives that can become the best based on unknown attribute weights; (2) the measurement of robustness of each identified alternative from two perspectives; and (3) the development of the RER approach.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the preliminaries related to the RER approach. Section 3 introduces the RER approach. Section 4 presents an investigation regarding car performance assessment to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the RER approach. Section 5 compares the RER approach with the ER approach and other objective methods of determining attribute weights to reveal the advantages of generating a robust solution. Finally, this paper is concluded in Section 6.

For the convenience of describing the RER approach, in the following we introduce basic notations and the solution process of the ER approach.

In this section, we describe the identification of alternatives that may become the best and the measurement of robustness of the identified alternatives from two perspectives in the ER context. The RER approach based on the two contributions is then demonstrated.

When w is known, a solution to a MADM problem can be found based on the assessments B(e

                           l
                         can become the best. Finding the solutions to the optimization model for M alternatives, we can obtain the possible set of best alternatives denoted by M
                        
                           b
                        . Suppose that ∣M
                        
                           b
                        ∣ denotes the cardinality of M
                        
                           b
                        . Then, ∣M

                        ∣ sets of attribute weights can be correspondingly obtained to guarantee that any alternative a
                        
                           l
                         in M

                         can be the best, which are denoted by w

                        L).

After the possible set of best alternatives, i.e., M
                        
                           b
                         is decided, the remaining problem is to measure the robustness of the alternatives in M
                        
                           b
                         so as to compare the alternatives by their robustness. It is described as follows.

As mentioned in Section 1, the robustness of an alternative in M
                           
                              b
                            is measured from two perspectives. In this subsection, we firstly introduce the first perspective, i.e., the optimal situation of the alternative, which is characterized by the maximal regret and the average incompatibility of the alternative.

In the MRA, an alternative with smaller maximal regret is better than the others. To facilitate the comparison of alternatives, we define the minimal satisfaction of an alternative a
                           
                              l
                            (l
                           ∈{1,…,
                           M}) as M
                           
                              c
                           (a
                           
                              l
                           )=−(max
                              j≠l
                           (u
                           max(a
                           
                              j
                           ))−
                           u
                           min(a
                           
                              l
                           )), which is opposed to the maximal regret. Accordingly, an alternative with larger minimal satisfaction is better than the others. The calculation of u
                           min(a
                           
                              l
                           ) and u
                           max(a
                           
                              l
                           ) in Section 2.1 indicates that M
                           
                              c
                           (a
                           
                              l
                           ) is limited to [−1,1]. When M
                           
                              c
                           (a
                           
                              l
                           )>0, the alternative a
                           
                              l
                            absolutely dominates the others. Although the minimal satisfaction of the alternatives in M
                           
                              b
                            can be used to compare them, it cannot guarantee a robust solution to the MADM problem. In general, the more incompatible the best alternative is with the others, the more robust a solution is. Therefore, a combination of the minimal satisfaction and the average incompatibility for the alternatives in M
                           
                              b
                            is used to measure the first perspective of robustness of the alternatives.

Suppose that the average incompatibility of an alternative a
                           
                              l

                           ∈
                           M
                           
                              b
                            is denoted by C

                           ). By using the compatibility measure between two BSs denoted by cm in Definition 5, the compatibility between the aggregated assessments B(y(a
                           
                              l

In other words, compared with the others, the alternative remains the best when there is a larger variation in attribute weights.

                              b
                           ). On the other hand, there are significant differences between RN
                           1(a
                           
                              l

                              l
                           ). Firstly, two deviation variables are included in the model in Eqs. (14)–(20) to implement the concurrent maximization of M
                           
                              c

                              l
                           ). However, they are not required for the two pairs of optimization problems in Eqs. (22)–(25) and (26)–(29), respectively. Secondly, the model in Eqs. (14)–(20) is used to obtain the concurrently maximum M
                           
                              c

                              l
                           ) with one set of optimized attribute weights. The resulting RN
                           1(a
                           
                              l
                           ) cannot reflect the insensitivity of the alternative to a variation in attribute weights. In contrast, the insensitivity can be measured by RN
                           2(a
                           
                              l
                           ) because any set of attribute weights which generates M
                           
                              c

In practice, θ is decided by a decision maker according to the knowledge, experience, preference, and risk attitude of the decision maker, application constraints, the historical setting, and the decision context. The weighted geometric mean method is unsuitable for combining RN

                              l
                           ) because the resulting RN(a
                           
                              l
                           ) by the method is unreasonable when RN
                           1(a

                              l
                           ) is equal to zero. An alternative a
                           
                              l

                              l
                           ) is considered to be more robust than the others to become the best.

In real situations, a decision maker may change his or her risk attitude as time passes. Therefore, the utilities of assessment grades from the decision maker are not always precise values. A case in point is that when decision environment is changed, the decision maker may change his or her risk attitude from risk seeking to risk aversion or change the degree to which he or she seeks risk. Such a change has a significant influence on RN

In this section, a car performance assessment (CPA) problem adapted from [50] is resolved to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the RER approach. All optimized problems in the CPA problem are solved by Matlab.

To use the RER approach to solve the CPA problem, we firstly describe the problem using Steps 1–4 in the procedure of the RER approach.

For the sake of simplicity, only the first iteration is handled because the most robust choice of the decision maker is decided in the iteration. Step 11 is thus omitted. In the following, we focus on a change in the most robust choice with the four sets of u(H
                                 
                                    n

                                 =1,…,6) and a variation in the relaxation coefficient θ.


                                 Table 7 shows that the most robust choice of the decision maker is changed with different sets of u(H

                                  remains unchanged with a variation in the relaxation coefficient θ. In other words, c

                                  in the first iteration may be changed with a variation in the relaxation coefficient θ. Suppose that θ is changed from 0.1 to 0.9 with a step of 0.2, RN(c

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

In this section, we compare the RER approach with the ER approach [6,19,44,50,54–56] and other objective methods of determining attribute weights. We also discuss the ability of the RER approach to be used in a variety of applications developed and other possible applications via a combination of the RER approach and group decision making (GDM) methods.

In the ER approach, attribute weights are necessarily needed to implement attribute aggregation and generate solutions. There exists the correspondence between attribute weights and solutions. Therefore, the robustness of solutions generated by the ER approach is not guaranteed. Compared with the ER approach, the RER approach has many advantages: (1) it requires no information regarding attribute weights, except their lower bounds, which guarantees that each attribute proportionally contributes to a solution; (2) it does not generate a solution using only a specific set of attribute weights; (3) it relies on the robustness of alternatives in several iterations to generate a robust solution, which is more reliable and credible than a solution generated by the ER approach using a specific set of attribute weights; (4) it allows intervals of utilities of assessment grades and five types of relevant constraints, particularly the completely unknown intervals of utilities of assessment grades, which significantly enhances the flexibility of the RER approach; (5) it may generate a robust solution in which the best alternative dominates others independent of the relaxation coefficient θ in Eq. (31), when handling intervals of utilities of assessment grades or fixed utilities of assessment grades; and (6) it may generate a unique choice of the best alternative when multiple alternatives are identically considered the best using the MRA in the ER approach. Particularly, the RER approach can handle the completely unknown attribute weights, which is different from most MADM methods (e.g., [1,3,11,23,49,58]).

The first five advantages have already been demonstrated by the numerical example in Section 4. The sixth advantage is demonstrated as follows.

                     6 are identically determined to be the best by use of the MRA. However, the RER approach presents a different case. Under the same constraints on u(H

In the RER approach, a decision maker does not need to provide precise attribute weights, which is similar to objective methods of determining attribute weights. Thus, we compare the RER approach with four objective methods, comprising the entropy method [9], the standard deviation (SD) method [10], the CRITIC (Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation) method [10], and the CCSD (correlation coefficient and standard deviation integrated) method [40]. To facilitate the comparison, the four methods are extended to handle the lower bound of w
                     
                        i
                      (i
                     =1,…,
                     L) and handle distributed assessments in the ER approach. The distributed assessments are still used in the RER approach.

In the ER approach, M alternatives are compared by their minimal satisfaction, so the entropy of the minimal satisfaction of each alternative on one attribute can be used to measure the contrast intensity of the attribute. Because an attribute with higher contrast intensity has more significant influence on solution stability than others, the attribute should be assigned a larger weight. In other words, attribute weights can be determined by means of the entropy of the minimal satisfaction of alternatives on attributes.

In the CRITIC method, the covariance between the distributed assessments of alternatives on two different attributes is used to calculate the correlation coefficient between the two attributes. The coefficient is then combined with the SD of the assessments of alternatives on attributes to determine attribute weights.

To use the CRITIC method to determine attribute weights, a correlation coefficient matrix among attributes is constructed based on the correlation coefficient of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets [27] as

Intervals of utilities of assessment grades and relevant constraints can be incorporated into the above four optimization models extended from the four methods. To compare the RER approach with the four methods, we use the four extended models under the conditions specified in Section 4.1 to determine attribute weights and generate solutions to the CPA problem. The obtained attribute weights, [u
                        min(c
                        
                           l
                        ), u
                        max(c
                        
                           l
                        )] (l
                        =1,…,6), and rank-order of c
                        
                           l
                         (l
                        =1,…,6) using Matlab are presented in Table 9
                        .


                        Table 9 shows that the best choice of the decision maker generated by the four methods is c
                        1, different from c
                        3 generated by the RER approach. This is mainly because the insensitivity of alternatives to a variation in attribute weights is not handled in the four methods. The optimization models extended from the four methods involve L equations; thus, each model can determine a unique set of w
                        
                           i
                         (i
                        =1,…,
                        L), which generates a unique solution. In contrast, the RER approach handles the insensitivity of alternatives to a variation in attribute weights when generating a robust solution to the CPA problem.

In summary, the RER approach can be used in a wide range of applications in which a decision maker gives distributed assessments and is unsure about attribute weights generated by a specific method. Striking applications include environmental impact assessment [43], business performance assessment [46,47], organizational self-assessment [32,51], contractor selection [33], safety and risk analysis and synthesis [42], and product design and selection [52,53].

Besides these applications, the RER approach may combine with GDM methods to generate robust solutions to uncertain multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems, such as the selection of engineering project management software [14–16], the selection of preferentially developed industries [17], and the evaluation of new product development [24].

The determination of attribute weights is an important step in MADM, which usually influences final solutions. However, when a decision maker is not sure about attribute weights generated by a specific method, he or she will not regard a solution produced by the attribute weights as the most satisfactory solution. In this situation, depending on all attribute weights in a feasible or predefined weight space to create a solution can be reasonable for the decision maker to find the most satisfactory solution, particularly when the assessments from the decision maker are uncertain. Such a solution can facilitate a robust comparison between any two alternatives and thus be called a robust solution. The RER approach has been described in this paper and applied to generate a robust solution to the CPA problem. It is compared with the ER approach and four objective methods of determining attribute weights to reveal its advantages. The contributions of this paper include the following: (1) the identification of alternatives that can become the best with the support of at least one set of attribute weights; (2) the measurement of robustness of each identified alternative; and (3) the development of the RER approach that can generate a robust solution and also handle intervals of utilities of assessment grades and five types of relevant constraints.

Although the exploration in this paper underlies the generation of a robust solution to a MADM problem with unknown attribute weights in the ER context, it cannot handle more complex situations where interval and fuzzy uncertainties are included in the assessments of a decision maker. In the next step, the RER approach will be extended to handle interval and fuzzy uncertainties, which may be applied to the trustworthiness assessment of hospital information systems [18], the evaluation of manufacturer’s vehicle [26,57], the selection of cargo ship designs [44], and the assessment of talented performers in the entertainment industry [48]. We also expect to combine the RER approach with GDM methods to solve MAGDM problems under the extended conditions, which can be the applications mentioned in Section 5.
