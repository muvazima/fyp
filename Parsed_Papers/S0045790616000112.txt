                  High concentration photovoltaic (HCPV) modules employing high-efficiency III–V solar cells promise greater system-level efficiency than conventional photovoltaic (PV) systems. Nevertheless, the output power of an HCPV system is very sensitive to rapidly fluctuating tracking errors and weather patterns. The fractional open circuit voltage (FOCV) based maximum power point (MPP) tracking technique benefits from simplified processing circuits with speed response. To investigate the feasibility of using the FOCV technique for MPP estimation on HCPV modules, a theoretical model and simulation are presented in this study. A MATLAB-based MJSC circuit model of an HCPV module with buck-type converter and load is proposed and validated. In addition, the magnitude of the optical loss caused by Fresnel lens shape deformation and air mass (AM) ratio is modeled and quantized. The FOCV technique is then employed and compared with the conventional perturb and observe (P&O) method on the HCPV module under varying irradiance and temperature conditions to study its effectiveness. The results suggest that the FOCV technique could help an HCPV module to attain greater power efficiency.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

High concentration photovoltaic (HCPV) technology has gained growing attention in recent years, with HCPV systems based on multi-junction solar cells (MJSC) representing a breakthrough for solar electricity production by utility companies. In December 2014, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE announced a new world record of 46% efficiency for an MJSC, with this technology developed by Soitec, CEA-Leti and Fraunhofer ISE [1]. MJSCs are based on a selection of III–V compound semiconductor materials. Each sub-cell of an MJSC converts part of the incoming photons of the sunlight in the wavelength range between 300 and 1750nm into electricity. To offset the cost of expensive semiconductor materials, small MJSCs are used with comparatively inexpensive Fresnel lenses in an HCPV module. Point-focus based HCPV modules must be always mounted on two-axis solar trackers to help the lens concentrate direct sunlight onto the cells. In order to reduce the cost of the electricity that is produced, it is important that the HCPV module is operated at its maximum power point (MPP), which is tracked by different maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques. However, due to the rapidly fluctuating tracking errors caused by varying environmental conditions, a simple MPPT algorithm with fast response is needed for an HCPV system [2].

The most common MPPT methods include the Perturb and Observe (P&O), Incremental Conductance (IC) and Hill Climbing (HC) algorithms. Other soft-computing MPPT techniques include the use of a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) [3–5]. However, these methods require complex mathematical operations, and therefore a digital signal processor is typically needed to implement them. In contrast, the Fractional Open Circuit Voltage (FOCV) and Fractional Short Circuit Current (FSCI) techniques have simpler algorithms, but their accuracy is limited [2, 3, 6]. The FOCV method exploits the nearly linear relationship between a PV module's open-circuit voltage (VOC
                     ) and its voltage at the MPP (Vmp
                     ) under varying irradiance and temperature levels. Compared with the FSCI technique, the FOCV technique benefits from having less circuit losses [7].

In a previous study, titled “A Rapid Maximum Power Measurement System for High-Concentration Photovoltaic Modules Using the Fractional Open-Circuit Voltage Technique and Controllable Electronic Load”, the experiment results demonstrated that the FOCV technique is able to estimate the MPP of the HCPV modules with high accuracy under static conditions [2]. To further build a model for investigating the feasibility of using the FOCV technique for MPP estimation on HCPV modules under dynamic conditions, a theoretical model and simulations are presented in this study. A MATLAB-based MJSC circuit model of an HCPV module with buck-type converter and load is proposed and validated. In addition, the magnitude of the optical loss caused by Fresnel lens shape deformation and air mass AM ratio is modeled and quantized. The FOCV technique is then employed and compared with the conventional P&O method on the HCPV module under varying temperature and irradiance conditions to study its effectiveness. Furthermore, the power loss caused by VOC
                      measurement of the FOCV algorithm is modeled to estimate its effect.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed simulation model of an HCPV module and the MPPT algorithms. The effects of temperature and irradiance are discussed. Section 3 presents experimental results and a comparison between two MPPT techniques. Finally, Section 4 concludes this paper.

Triple-junction solar cells (TJSCs) are commonly employed in HCPV modules. A TJSC can be considered as being composed of three p-n junction subcells connected in series. Each subcell can be represented by an equivalent circuit model. The commonly used models for a TJSC are single- and two-diode models, both of which are adequate for practical applications, with the I–V curve having a good fit to the experimental data [8–10]. This study presents a single-diode model for a TJSC as presented in Fig. 1
                        . Based on this, the cell I–V curve can be mathematically expressed as

The short circuit current ISC
                         of the triple-junction solar cell is limited by the smaller photocurrent of the top and middle subcells [11]. In addition, the VOC
                         of the triple-junction solar cell can be obtained from the reference VOC
                         at one sun by applying a logarithmic correction with concentration using [12, 13]

is the concentration ratio, which can be expressed as the ratio of the photocurrent IL
                         of the triple-junction solar cell at C-suns (C×) to that at one-sun (1×) intensity. Further, VOC
                        (C) and VOC
                        (1) are open-circuit voltages at C-suns and one-sun intensity, respectively, n is the effective diode ideality factor of the triple-junction solar cell, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the electrical charge of the electron.

The amount of incident light directly affects the generation of charge carriers, and thus the current generated by the device. The light-generated current IL
                         of the elementary cells, without the influence of the series and parallel resistances, is difficult to determine. Because the shunt resistance and series resistance in practical devices are sufficiently large and low, respectively, IL  ≈  ISC is thus generally assumed [14]. In addition, IL
                         depends linearly on the solar irradiance, and is also influenced by the temperature according to the following equations:

To investigate the feasibility of using the FOCV technique for MPP estimation on HCPV modules, the HCPV module is modeled using MATLAB/Simulink software. The MATLAB/Simulink programming tool is specifically designed to model data flows using graphical design language and is integrated with the MATLAB system. For the sake of simplicity, the HCPV module is first modeled with only one TJSC. The TJSC model is derived from three sub-layer models connected in series as illustrated in Fig. 1. An HCPV module is usually composed of a number of individual TJSCs connected in series and parallel, which could be modeled based on the one TJSC model. The Spectrolab C3MJ TJSC was chosen for modeling. Table 1
                         shows the characteristics of the C3MJ TJSC, as provided by the manufacturer. The basic model of the one TJSC is created according to Eqs. (1)–(8). Note that all the models designed in this paper are based on the reference value as the standard test condition (STC), 850W/m2, and 25°C. Fig. 2
                         shows the simulation model of the TJSC. The diode reverse saturation current I0
                         is calculated by Eq. (8) with consideration of the temperature effect. In addition, the light-generated current IL
                         of the elementary cells are calculated from solar irradiance by Eqs. (6) and (7). Furthermore, the shunt current Ish
                         are calculated by equation with consideration of series and shunt resistance of the cell. The light-generated current IL
                        , shunt current Ish
                        , and diode reverse saturation current I0
                         are then used for output current of the TJSC calculation using Eq. (2).

The maximum power of an HCPV module could be described as a function of normal irradiance (G), air mass (AM), temperature (T) and wind speed (W):

                         for the model defined in [15]. In the model, Tlens
                         and Tcell
                         are assumed to be proportional to the direct normal irradiance with additional exponential influence on the wind speed. The factor 1/2 was included in the exponent to estimate the effective wind speed parallel to the module, which depends on wind direction.

The cell temperature (Tcell
                        ) derived from Eq. (11) could be used for temperature effects calculation as described in Section 2.2. In addition, the magnitude of the optical loss caused by Fresnel lens shape deformation depends on the temperature of the lens (Tlens
                        ) and its thermal expansion coefficient [16]. The impact this lens warping effect has on its optical performance is linked to the particular photovoltaic receiver over which the lens concentrates light. Therefore, the equivalent irradiance loss due to the warping effect could be calculated. Furthermore, it is usually assumed that the main reason for spectral changes is the air mass [17]. As a result, the equivalent normal irradiance (Gin
                        ) with consideration of the warping effects and the loss due to air mass (AM) is calculated by

                        ≤2 the irradiance is kept constant. Fig. 3
                         shows the simulation model of the lens and cell temperature calculation. The equivalent normal irradiance (Gin
                        ) and the cell temperature (Tcell
                        ) are further sent to the TJSC model for output current calculation.

The block diagram of an HCPV module model with integrating the lens model, the temperature effects calculation model, and the TJSC model is shown in Fig. 4
                        , where G and T are the solar irradiance and ambient temperature, respectively. In addition, V, I and P are the output voltage, current and power of the HCPV module. The simulation of the HCPV module has been carried out using MPPT based on the P&O and FOCV techniques.

P&O and FOCV techniques are compared in this study for MPP estimation on an HCPV module. To simulate the MPPT performance, the modeled HCPV module with one TJSC is combined with the MPPT technique to generate its maximum performance.

The P&O technique operates by periodically perturbing the PV module terminal voltage and comparing the output power with that of the previous perturbation cycle. The flow diagram of the P&O technique is shown in Fig. 5
                        . If the operating voltage of the HCPV module changes in step size ΔV and the power increases, the control system moves the operating point in the same direction; otherwise the operating point is moved in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the implementation of the P&O algorithm using the MATLAB/Simulink is shown in Fig. 6
                        . The power delivered by the HCPV module becomes an input for this algorithm. The input is then perturbed with an adjustable step. Afterward, the data is stored in memory and then used in the next instruction. If the step change in the perturbation is large, then the response time to achieve the maximum power is fast, although the oscillations near MPP will also be large. On the other hand, if the step change is small, the oscillations will be very small at the MPP, but the tracking time will be very long. Therefore, selecting the appropriate step size is the key for the P&O method to achieve the desired effect.

The FOCV technique exploits the nearly linear relationship between the Vmp
                         of a solar cell and its VOC

where the proportionality factor KFOCV
                         is around 0.89 for the modeled TJSC (C3MJ, Spectrolab, USA), which depends slightly on the irradiance conditions [2]. The flow diagram for the MPPT control with FOCV is given in Fig. 7
                        . The operating voltage VOP
                         is obtained by multiplying KFOCV
                         with the measured VOC
                         of the HCPV module. In addition, the output power of the module is derived by multiplying VOP
                         with the measured operating current IOP
                         at VOP
                        . The FOCV algorithm can be implemented using MATLAB/Simulink, as shown in Fig. 8.
                        
                     

As shown in Figs. 6 and 8, each of the proposed simulation model consists of three main subsystems, an HCPV module, an MPPT controller, and a DC/DC converter with load. These subsystems can be modeled and tested separately and then interconnected to form the whole system in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The main role of a converter is conditioning the produced power of HCPV modules to meet the load requirements. In addition, it can be used for matching the I-V curve with output load in order to extract maximum power from HCPV modules. In this study a buck converter has been used based on impedance adaptation capability. For the sake of simplicity, the efficiency of the buck converter is assumed as 100%. The impedance of the output load is set at 1 Ω. The power flow is controlled by adjusting the on/off duty cycle (D) of the converter. Therefore the average output voltage is determined by the following equation.

                        where VO
                         and IO
                         denote output voltage and current of the converter connected to load; Vi
                         and Ii
                         are input voltage and current of the converter, which are equal to V and I of the HCPV module, respectively. According to maximum power transfer theory, maximum power is being transferred from source to load when source impedance is equal to the load impedance. Therefore, the impedance matching between the HCPV module and the load can be done by adjusting the duty cycle of the DC/DC converter.

In this work, the P&O and FOCV techniques were implemented in MATLAB/Simulink simulation software as a controller to study the output power of the HCPV module during dynamic conditions. Two scenarios were applied to study the response of the two MPPT techniques under rapidly irradiance and temperature changes. In scenario 1, a simulation was performed with step changes in irradiance (G), as illustrated in Fig. 9
                     . During this the simulation temperature was fixed at 25°C. In scenario 2, the simulation was performed with a change in temperature (T), as shown in Fig. 10
                     . During this simulation the irradiance was fixed at 850W/m2. The step size ΔV of the P&O method was set as 1–8% of the VOC
                      of the TJSC at STC for comparison with the FOCV method, with KFOCV
                      ranging from 0.86 to 0.94.

The performance is assessed in terms of the percentage of energy generated from the HCPV module during simulation time, which can be calculated from the following equation:

                     where ηmppt
                      is the tracking efficiency of the MPPT algorithm, Emppt
                      is the energy extracted from the algorithm, which can be calculated by the integral of the HCPV module output power Pmppt
                      over time; Emax
                      and Pmax
                      denote the maximum energy and power of ideal MPPT, respectively. For battery load, the voltage of the battery usually presents little variation, it will be the module current which determines the output power. Therefore, the energy extracted from the algorithms could be estimated by the output charge of the module, which is calculated by the integration of the current over time [18]. In this study, energy is estimated by the integration of the power over time for the resistance load. The integration of the HCPV module output power is calculated using the trapezoidal method via the MATLAB function trapz.


                     Fig. 11
                      shows the tracking efficiency of the P&O technique with different step sizes under the two scenarios. In addition, Fig. 12
                      illustrates the tracking efficiency of the FOCV technique with different KFOCV
                      under the two scenarios. Table 2
                      compares the best tracking efficiencies of the two methods under the two scenarios. It is observed that under scenarios 1 and 2 the total energy outputs of the HCPV module extracted from the FOCV technique are around 10% and 9%, respectively, more than those found with the P&O technique.


                     Figs. 13
                      and 14
                      show the dynamic responses of the HCPV module output power under the two scenarios. During the two simulations, the step size ΔV of the P&O method and the KFOCV
                      of the FOCV method were set at the respective values with best performance, as shown in Table 2. In this study, the sampling rate is set at 100Hz, therefore the two algorithms continuously change the operating voltage every 10ms. The power curve of the FOCV technique executes spikes which touch the horizontal axis indicating the VOC
                      measurements. The longer the duration of the spikes, the larger the power lose it will cause. In this study, the duration of every VOC
                      measurement is set around 5ms. In addition, the measurement is taken place every 100ms. As a result, the tracking efficiency loss of the FOCV technique caused by this power lose is around 5%. The output power of the HCPV module in response to scenario 1 with variations in irradiance is demonstrated in Fig. 13. It is evident that during rapid changes in irradiance the FOCV method outperforms the P&O method. It is observed that even in the stable state of P&O algorithm, there are still gaps between the maximum power delivered by the P&O and the FOCV algorithms. The gaps are due to the system oscillates around the MPP throughout the P&O process, and this results in loss of energy. Although reducing the perturbation step size will minimize these oscillations and the gaps, however it will slow down the MPP tracking system. In addition, as illustrated by Fig. 14, the P&O method could not track the MPP on time during temperature changing duration (0.3–0.6s) and the output power performs larger damping. As a result, the MPP tracking speed of the P&O method is relatively slow in the case of rapid changes in temperature, consistent with the results obtained in an earlier work [19].

The output power of an HCPV system is very sensitive to rapidly fluctuating tracking errors and weather patterns. In this study the P&O and FOCV techniques were implemented on a theoretical model of an HCPV module and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The preliminary simulation results suggest that the FOCV method performed better than the classic P&O method under varying irradiance and temperature conditions. In simulation scenarios 1 and 2 the total energy outputs of the HCPV module extracted from the FOCV technique are 10% and 9%, respectively, more than those found with the P&O technique. In addition, simulation results show that the dynamic response and MPP tracking speed of the P&O method are relatively slower than those of the FOCV method. It is observed that in the stable state of P&O algorithm, the system oscillates around the MPP and results in loss of energy. Although reducing the perturbation step size will minimize these oscillations and the gaps, however it will slow down the MPP tracking system. However, when regularly measuring the open circuit voltage (VOC
                     ), the HCPV module is disconnected from the load by turning off the switch of the DC/DC converter, which will also result in power loss. Future studies could further improve the power stability by integrating capacitor into the HCPV or converter circuit. This study provides a theoretical model of an HCPV module and the implementation of MPPT methods on it, which could be employed for further evaluations of different MPPT algorithms on an HCPV system. Nevertheless, this study examined the power output of an HCPV module model with only one TJSC in uniform insolation conditions. Future studies could explore HCPV modules with a number of TJSCs connected in series and parallel under partially shaded conditions.
