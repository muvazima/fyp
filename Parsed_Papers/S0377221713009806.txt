                  This paper considers a discrete-time priority queueing model with one server and two types (classes) of customers. Class-1 customers have absolute (service) priority over class-2 customers. New customer batches enter the system at the rate of one batch per slot, according to a general independent arrival process, i.e., the batch sizes (total numbers of arrivals) during consecutive time slots are i.i.d. random variables with arbitrary distribution. All customers entering the system during the same time slot (i.e., belonging to the same arrival batch) are of the same type, but customer types may change from slot to slot, i.e., from batch to batch. Specifically, the types of consecutive customer batches are correlated in a Markovian way, i.e., the probability that any batch of customers has type 1 or 2, respectively, depends on the type of the previous customer batch that has entered the system. Such an arrival model allows to vary not only the relative loads of both customer types in the arrival stream, but also the amount of correlation between the types of consecutive arrival batches. The results reveal that the amount of delay differentiation between the two customer classes that can be achieved by the priority mechanism strongly depends on the amount of such interclass correlation (or, class clustering) in the arrival stream. We believe that this phenomenon has been largely overlooked in the priority-scheduling literature.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In multiclass queueing systems, where multiple types (or classes) of customers compete for the use of the same resources, scheduling disciplines are used to determine the order of service for customers of different types. One particular type of scheduling that has received substantial attention in the queueing literature is priority scheduling (Jaiswal, 1968; Takagi, 1991; Williams, 1980; De Clercq, De Turck, Steyaert, & Bruneel, 2011; Min & Yih, 2010; Jin & Min, 2007; Zeltyn, Feldman, & Wasserkrug, 2009; Feng & Umemura, 2009; Walraevens, Fiems, Wittevrongel, & Bruneel, 2009; Gamarnik & Katz, 2009; Walraevens, Fiems, & Bruneel, 2006, 2008; Walraevens, Steyaert, & Bruneel, 2005; Maertens, Walraevens, & Bruneel, 2007; Abate & Whitt, 1997; Maertens, Walraevens, & Bruneel, 2008; Chang & Harn, 1992; Choi, Choi, Lee, & Sung, 1998; Drekic & Grassmann, 2002; Fiems, Walraevens, & Bruneel, 2007; Hashida & Takahashi, 1991; Laevens & Bruneel, 1998; Lee & Lee, 2003; Mehmet Ali & Song, 2004; Subramanian & Srikant, 2000; Sugahara, Takine, Takahashi, & Hasegawa, 1995; Takine, 1999; Tham, Yao, & Jiang, 2002; Van Houdt & Blondia, 2006; Walraevens, Steyaert, & Bruneel, 2004; Walraevens, Steyaert, & Bruneel, 2002; Zhao, Li, Cao, & Ahmad, 2006; Chen & Zhang, 2000; Adan, Sleptchenko, & Van Houtum, 2009; Maertens, Bruneel, & Walraevens, 2012), where customers are partitioned in a number of distinct classes and the order of service is based on the classes customers belong to. E.g., class-1 customers have (service) priority over all other classes, class-2 customers have priority over all classes except class 1, etc. Typical applications where priority scheduling is used are, amongst others, packet switches in modern telecommunication networks (Choi, Lee, & Un, 1997; Walraevens et al., 2005; Fayza, 2010), where delay-sensitive packets (e.g. telephony, teleconferencing, video) are given preferential treatment above delay-tolerant packets (e.g. file transfer, e-mail), or emergency services in hospitals, where patients requiring urgent intervention are given priority over regular patients (Min & Yih, 2010; Jacobson, Argon, & Ziya, 2012).

In classical priority queueing models, it is generally assumed that the different classes of customers occur randomly and independently in the arrival stream of customers into the system. In this paper, however, we explicitly wish to examine the effect of interclass correlation (or class clustering) in the arrival process of a two-class priority queue on the performance of this queue. In particular, we are interested to know whether the degree to which customers of the same type have the tendency to arrive closely together (i.e., “clustered”), or, conversely, the degree to which such customers have the tendency to be spread in time and mixed with customers of the other type, have a substantial impact on the performance of a two-class priority queueing system. In order to do so, we superimpose a two-state Markovian interclass correlation model (with arbitrary transition probabilities) on top of a regular general independent arrival-process model for the aggregated customer stream.

For this model, we first derive the probability generating function (pgf) of the total number of customers in the system, as well as the pgf of the delay (system time) of an arbitrary customer. These results can be easily retrieved from the well-known analysis of a single-class discrete-time queueing model with general i.i.d. arrivals and deterministic single-slot service times (Bruneel & Kim, 1993; Vinck & Bruneel, 1995). Various performance measures of practical use, such as the total mean system content and the (global) mean delay of an arbitrary customer, can be easily derived from this pgf. Next, we analyze the queueing performance of the high-priority customer class (i.e., class 1). This requires the solution of a single-class queueing model with Markovian arrival interruptions. We are able to obtain explicit expressions for the pgf’s of the class-1 system content and the class-1 customer delay, and from this, performance measures such as the mean number of class-1 customers in the system and the mean delay of an arbitrary class-1 customer. Finally, combining all the latter results, we are also able to derive explicit expressions for the mean number of low-priority (i.e., class-2) customers in the system and the mean delay of an arbitrary class-2 customer.

The resulting formulas and a number of numerical examples reveal that the priority mechanism does what it is designed for, i.e., favor high-priority customers in terms of a lower mean delay than low-priority customers, as long as the interclass correlation is sufficiently low. For high to very high interclass correlation, however, the delay-differentiation capabilities of the priority mechanism are reduced significantly, and even disappear completely when the interclass correlation approaches +1. We believe that this phenomenon is not well recognized in most of the priority-queueing literature, because the arrival process of the various types of customers is usually chosen quite arbitrarily and not given much attention. The current paper proves – by means of closed-form results – that class clustering is not to be neglected in the context of priority queues.

We consider a discrete-time queueing system with infinite waiting room, one server, and two types (classes) of customers, named 1 and 2. As in all discrete-time models, the time axis is divided into fixed-length intervals referred to as slots. New customers may enter the system at any given (continuous) point on the time axis, but services are synchronized to (i.e., can only start and end at) slot boundaries.

In order not to complicate matters, we model the service process of the system as simply as possible in this paper. Specifically, we assume that the service times of all customers (belonging to either class 1 or class 2) are deterministically given by one slot each. More general models for the service process will be the subject of future investigations.

The arrival process of new customers in the system, however, which is the main concern of this paper, is characterized in two steps.

First, we model the total (aggregated) arrival stream of new customers by means of a sequence of i.i.d. non-negative discrete random variables with common probability mass function (pmf)

                     We call the total number of arrivals in one slot an arrival batch in the sequel.

The mean batch size, i.e., the (total) mean number of arrivals per slot, in the sequel referred to as the (total) mean arrival rate, is given by
                        
                           (1)

                                    A
                                 
                                 
                                    ′
                                 
                              
                              (
                              1
                              )
                              .
                           
                        
                     
                  

Next, we describe the occurrence of the two types (1 and 2) in the sequence of the consecutively arriving customer batches. First of all, we assume in this study that each arrival batch contains only one type of customers, i.e., either all type-1 customers or all type-2 customers. The case where customers of both types may be present in the same batch has been considered in many existing studies and is therefore not included here; we further comment on this in Section 6. We further assume that both customer classes are “mixed” in the arrival stream, but that there may be some degree of “class clustering” in the arrival process, i.e., customer batches of any given type may (or may not) have a tendency to “arrive back-to-back”. Mathematically, this means that the types of two consecutive batches may be non-independent. Specifically, we assume a first-order Markovian type of correlation between the types of two consecutive batches, which basically means that the probability that the next batch belongs to a given class depends on the type of the previous batch.

It should be noted that our arrival model is a non-classical “mixture” of independent arrivals (on the aggregated level) and correlated arrivals (for each customer class individually). It is not to be confused with classical single-class Markovian arrival models such as, for instance, in Ali Khan and Gani (1968), Pakes and Phatarfod (1978), Bruneel (1985, 1988), Bruneel and Steyaert (1996), Mehmet Ali and Song (2004), Gao, Wittevrongel, Walraevens, and Bruneel (2008), and Claeys, Steyaert, Walraevens, Laevens, and Bruneel (2013). There are two main reasons for this choice. First, the lack of correlation in the aggregated arrival process makes the analysis easier; secondly, it is our explicit intention to study the impact of interclass correlation, i.e., correlation between the arrivals of the two customer types, as “purely” as possible, i.e., without possible interference of other sources of correlation. For the same reason, we have kept the service process as simple as possible (in particular, uncorrelated from customer to customer).

                      denote the type (i.e., 1 or 2) of the batch arriving during slot k. The transition probabilities of the Markov chain that determines the types of the consecutive batches are then defined as (see Fig. 1
                     )

The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows. In Section 3, we first retrieve the pgf of the total number of customers in the system from existing results in the literature. Explicit expressions for the mean number of customers in the system and for the average delay of an arbitrary customer are easily obtained from this. Next, we concentrate on the analysis of the number of class-1 customers in the system: an expression is derived for the pgf of this number and a method is described to determine the two remaining unknowns in that expression. Again, performance measures such as the mean number of class-1 customers in the system and the mean class-1 delay are obtained from this. Combining all the above, we then derive expressions for the mean number of class-2 customers in the system and the mean class-2 delay. All these derivations are valid for arbitrary choices of

                     . The special case of geometric arrivals, in which completely explicit closed-form results (in terms of the original system parameters only) can be obtained, is considered in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss some numerical examples and also focus on the case of strong positive interclass correlation, i.e., the limit where 
                        
                           γ
                           →
                           +
                           1
                        
                     . Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

In this section, we summarize the main mathematical derivations needed to arrive at the desired performance measures of this priority queueing system, i.e., the mean system contents and the mean customer delays (per class and globally). There are basically three steps in the analysis. In a first step, we focus on the total system content (class 1+class 2), which is, in fact, not affected at all by the priority mechanism and identical to the total system content in a single-class system with (e.g.) a first-come-first-served queueing discipline. The second step concentrates on the performance of the high-priority class, i.e., class 1. It is not difficult to see that the service of class-1 customers is not affected by the possible presence of class-2 customers in the system, as class-1 customers have absolute (service) priority over class-2 customers and all service times are equal to 1. This implies that the class-1 performance of the system can be investigated by means of a single-class model as well, albeit with Markovian arrival interruptions in this case. In a third step, we combine the results of steps 1 and 2 to deduce the main performance characteristics of class-2 customers.

It should be noted that our approach avoids the joint analysis of class 1 and class 2, i.e., only single-class systems have to be analyzed. This reduces the mathematical complexity of the analysis substantially, as the dimension of the (Markovian) state spaces is reduced by 1 unit in each step. The only price to pay is that we do not get any results on the joint distribution of the class-1 and class-2 system contents with this approach. However, this is not the focus of the current paper, as we are mainly interested in the effect of interclass correlation on the delay differentiating capabilities of the priority rule. We note that the joint analysis of class 1 and class 2 could, in principle, be achieved by using a three-dimensional state description for the system, composed of the numbers of class-1 customers and class-2-customers along with the state of the Markov chain that describes the types of the consecutive batches in the arrival stream. This, however, would lead to very complicated equations for the joint pgf of the system state, involving a.o. implicitly defined functions, from which it is far from obvious to derive explicit formulas for the relevant performance measures of the system. The reader is referred to references (Walraevens et al., 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006; Maertens et al., 2007, 2008) for more details on this approach, in the context of other priority queueing models.

                         can be viewed as a legitimate pgf). Now, it can be shown by means of Rouché’s theorem from complex analysis (Gonzáles, 1992; Bruneel & Kim, 1993) that the denominator of Eq. (21) has exactly two zeroes inside the closed unit disk of the complex z-plane, one of which is equal to 1, as soon as the stability condition (17) is fulfilled. It is clear that these two zeroes should also be zeroes of the numerator of Eq. (21), as

These results explicitly and very clearly show the influence of the various system parameters on the delay performance of the priority system. As could be expected intuitively, the mean delays depend on the first two moments of the arrival process (as represented by the quantities 
                        
                           λ

                     ). It is not surprising that the global mean delay 
                        
                           E
                           [

                      goes to infinity as the total mean arrival rate

                      approaches its limiting value 1, dictated by the stability condition of the (total) system. This is not necessarily the case for the mean class-1 delay: 
                        
                           E

                           ]
                        
                      only goes to infinity if the mean class-1 arrival rate 
                     
                        
                           λ
                           
                              
                                 π
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      approaches 1, regardless of the class-2 arrival process, which is due to the fact that class-2 customers are, in fact, “invisible” for class-1 customers. This implies that the high-priority part of the queueing system may even be stable when the low-priority part and the total system are unstable. Finally, the low-priority queue is only stable when the total system is stable, i.e., when the total mean arrival rate 
                        
                           λ
                        
                      is strictly less than 1.

                      in this case.) We note that the global mean delay

                      are identical in the three figures. However, it is striking that the amount of delay differentiation that can be achieved between the two customer classes depends very strongly on the amount of interclass correlation 
                        
                           γ
                        
                     . The delay differentiation is highest when the interclass correlation is negative and lowest when it is positive. The intuitive reason for this is that, for negative and small positive values of 
                        
                           γ
                        
                     , the two customer types are more or less well mixed in the arrival stream, which implies that the priority scheduling can really change the order of service of customers (of different classes); for high to very high positive interclass correlation, however, customers of each type tend to arrive clustered in time, such that only rarely customers of both types are in the system simultaneously, and therefore, the priority rule does not really interfere with the order of service.

As a second example, we consider the case of geometric arrivals treated in Section 4.

The figure very clearly illustrates that the delay differentiation achieved by the priority scheduling rule remains more or less intact as long as the interclass correlation is not too high. However, when the class clustering increases to high values (say,

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have studied in this paper a simple discrete-time two-class priority queueing model, assuming independent (aggregated) arrivals from slot to slot combined with a general first-order Markovian interclass correlation model from slot to slot. For general arrival distributions, we have derived the main performance measures of the system in semi-analytical form, i.e., we have obtained explicit expressions for such quantities as the mean system content and the mean customer delay (globally, and also for both customer classes individually) in terms of the basic parameters of the model and one parameter (
                        
                           
                              
                                 z
                              
                              
                                 ˆ
                              
                           
                        
                     ) which is only implicitly known through a non-linear equation that it satisfies. For the special case of geometric arrivals, we have even been able to derive fully closed-form expressions for the main performance measures in terms of the original system parameters only.

The results reveal that the interclass correlation in the arrival process has a very direct and great influence on the amount of delay differentiation that the priority rule can achieve between the two customer classes in the system. We have observed that, in fact, strong positive interclass correlation completely destroys the delay-differentiating capabilities of the priority scheme.

One main restriction in our model is the assumption that all customers arriving in the system during the same slot are necessarily of the same type. In an earlier paper (Maertens et al., 2012), we investigated a (mathematically) less complicated priority queueing model than the one considered here, namely, with the restriction that there is no interclass correlation between customers entering the system in different slots (i.e., 
                        
                           γ
                           =
                           0
                        
                      in the current terminology), but there may or may not be correlation between the types of the customers belonging to the same arrival batch (i.e., interclass correlation within the same slot). We observed in Maertens et al. (2012) that, even in this case without interclass correlation beyond the slot boundaries, assuming all customers of the same batch to have identical types leads to decreased delay differentiation as compared with the case where customer classes can be mixed inside the same arrival batch, but the delay differentiation cannot be annihilated. The current paper somehow extends the interclass correlation that may exist between the arrivals inside a slot beyond the slot boundaries and shows that it can actually be devastating for the main goal of the priority scheduling rule, i.e., to favor the delay performance of one customer class at the cost of a worse delay performance of the other class. We consider this to be the main qualitative conclusion of our paper.

The model considered in this paper was fairly simple, the main goal being to examine the effect of interclass correlation on the delay differentiating capabilities of priority scheduling in a conceptual manner. In future work, we may consider various extensions to this basic model, such as multiple servers, more general service-time distributions, more than two priority classes, and non-independent (aggregated) arrivals.
