                  This paper uses the setting of a volleyball game and an exotic sports betting on the point difference of volleyball games to test whether people correctly understand the probabilities related to outcomes of a process which follows a binomial distribution. We find that people consistently underestimate the probabilities of outcomes that correspond to extreme ends of the distribution. This is consistent with the extremeness aversion bias documented in decision making studies. Whereas previous studies on the extremeness aversion bias find the existence of the bias in a consumer choice setting, we document that this bias also exists in an investment setting. We find evidence of learning behavior over time; however, it is not sufficient to eliminate the bias.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

How people make decisions under uncertainty is vital in all fields of business. And when faced with uncertainty, understanding of the probability distribution that underlies the uncertain event is essential in making rational decisions. However, one of the difficulties in empirically testing different methods of decision analysis lies in that the decision problem in the real world is not structured enough. For example, the decision maker cannot provide exact estimations of the probability distribution (Weber, 1987). This paper overcomes such obstacle in examining people's decision making behavior by utilizing a unique betting of volleyball games in which the outcome follows a binomial distribution. We uncover a significant bias that participants underestimate outcomes that lie at either ends of the binomial probability distribution.

The finding of people's biased behavior in this study is consistent with the extremeness aversion effect documented in decision making studies (Chernov, 2004; Simonson & Tversky, 1992; Tversky & Simonson, 1993). According to the extremeness aversion bias, a choice which lies at the extreme end of a relevant continuum tends to be viewed as less attractive than an option with moderate values. While prior studies find the existence of the extremeness aversion bias in people's consumption behavior (for example, consumers avoid purchasing the most expensive or the least expensive product), we find that the extremeness aversion bias also occurs in people's betting or ``investment'' behavior. We find that the extremeness aversion bias not only exists in a decision making setting in which real money is at stake, but the size of the bias is large enough to cause market inefficiency and generate opportunities for making large profit. Specifically, in a setting with an unconditional expected return of less than −50 percent due to low payout rate, a simple strategy of exploiting the bias would have yielded a return of more than 45 percent during the entire existence of the game.

The other focal point of this study is that we also explore how fast the market participants learn from their biased behavior which triggers market anomaly. The field of behavioral economics has discovered numerous market anomalies which stem from biases in human behavior.

                           Schwert (2003) provides a review of the vast literature on market anomalies. Shiller (2003) and Barberis and Thaler (2003) present a review from a behavioral perspective.
                      However, once an anomaly is detected, examining how market participants react to or learn from such anomaly presents more challenge. One attempt to address the issue of how fast market participants learn from certain behavioral bias is conducted through an experimental approach in a laboratory setting (e.g., Camerer & Ho, 1999; Charness & Levin, 2005; Erev & Roth, 1998; Ho & Weigelt, 1996; Roth & Erev, 1995). The area of operational research is also applying these methods into explaining important issues such as the newsvendor behavior.

                        2
                        For example, Schweitzer and Cachon (2000) initiated the study of behavioral issues such as mean anchoring, demand chasing, and inventory error minimization in explaining newsvendor mean ordering behavior. Bostian et al. (2008) show that demand chasing can lead to the “pull-to-center” behavior. Kremer et al. (2010) test the validity of the random error framework in explaining newsvendor mean ordering behavior. Rudi and Drake (2011) develop observation bias theory and study its impact on ordering level and adjustment behavior.
                     
                  

In this study, by using a novel sports betting data which includes betting behaviors of market participants, a better link between participants’ aggregate learning behavior and market efficiency is constructed on a natural setting without relying on laboratory experiments. One of the most desirable features of the sports betting market, in contrast to a typical financial market, is that the scope of the pricing problem is reduced. Whereas assets traded in a typical financial market is priced based on an infinite horizon of cash flows, contracts in the sports betting market have a well-defined termination point at which each value of an asset (or a bet) becomes certain. And because contracts in the sports betting market are isolated from external influence, we can bypass many problems such as endogeneity and omitted risk factors which complicate the study of market efficiency in traditional financial markets. Therefore, by using sports betting market data, it is relatively easy to test whether prices are efficient forecasts of outcomes. For this reason, the sports betting market is often used as a platform for testing market efficiency.

We find that the inefficiency in our betting market which stems from people's biased behavior is gradually corrected. However, the speed of learning is weak and to date (after 4 years or 389 rounds of betting), the bias that leads to market inefficiency still exists. We also find that participants incorporate the information contained in the previous betting result by increasing their bets on these outcomes in the next betting sequence. This result is in line with the newsvendor orders’ tendency to chase demand (adjusting order quantities towards prior demand) as found in Ben-Zion, Cohen, Peled, and Shavit (2008), Bostian, Holt, and Smith (2008), Kremer, Minner, and Van Wassenhove (2010), Rudi and Drake (2011), and Schweitzer and Cachon (2000). Since the results of the games in our sample are independent across time, our results imply that demand chasing in newsvendor can arise due to not only the predictable pattern of demand but also the intrinsic uncertainty component. We also provide other implications of people's learning behavior, such as people putting more weight on the evidence when the outcome is consistent with their prior expectation.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a review of the literature on sports betting and on learning process. In Section 3, we describe the data used in the study. The detection of market inefficiency is shown in Section 4 and the learning curve is analyzed in Section 5. In Section 6, we conduct a test of the favorite-longshot bias, which is a well documented anomaly in the betting market, as an alternative hypothesis. We provide a discussion of our results in Section 7. Section 8 concludes the paper.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Based on the simplicities of the sports betting market in that the outcome has a fixed termination point and is less influenced by external factors, sports betting market is often used as a platform to test market efficiency. Hausch, Ziemba, and Rubinstein (1981), Sauer (1998), and Vaughan Williams (1999) provide reviews of studies that use the sports betting market to test market efficiency.

                           3
                           As another application of sports, studies in operational research utilize the easiness of information interpretation and of measuring performance in sports, and study the cause and effect of coaching changes (Bachan, Reilly, and Witt, 2008; Bruinshoofd & ter Weel, 2003; Flores, Forrest, and Tena, 2012; Frick, Barros, and Prinz, 2010; Hope, 2003; Kahn, 1993; Tena & Forrest, 2007). Results of these studies shed light on the association between managerial changes and the organization's performance, which can be more difficult to empirically test in other settings.
                        
                     

The natural question that arises is why people participate in betting where the expected return is negative. One explanation can be derived from the curvature of people's utility function. Friedman and Savage (1948) assume a convex segment within an otherwise concave utility function. Based on such assumption, people in certain area of the utility curve have incentive to gamble even at negative expected return, and this is consistent with the stylized fact that poor people rather than the rich are more likely to play lottery. On the other hand, Markowitz (1952) argues that if the current wealth level lies at a convex segment of the utility curve, then people of any wealth level can have the incentive to gamble. Quandt (1986) shows that such local risk preference model yields the necessary condition for market equilibrium in which low-probability, high-return outcomes (longshots) have inferior returns than high-probability, low-return outcomes (favorites). This phenomenon, referred to as the ``favorite-longshot bias”, has become the most documented market anomaly in the sports betting market. Thaler and Ziemba (1988) and Sauer (1998) review the evidence of the favorite-longshot bias. Recent studies offer various explanations for the favorite-longshot bias (Cain & Peel, 2004; Golec & Tamarkin, 1995; Julien & Salanié, 2000; Ottaviani & Sørensen, 2008; Snowberg & Wolfers, 2010). We explore the existence of favorite-longshot bias in our sample in Section 6 of our study.

An important psychological motive of bettors can be the pleasure or consumption benefit of gambling (Kallick, Suits, Dielman, & Hybels, 1979; Kusyszyn, 1984). Conlisk (1993) formally incorporates this component by adding the extra utility of gambling to the standard expected utility function of wealth. This model implies that the risk-seeking behavior of betting is possible without relying on the convexity of the utility function. There are also theories on betting which do not rely on rational investor assumption and are based solely on behavioral propositions. For example, prospect theory states that the utility function is concave over gains and convex over losses, and that people tend to overweight the tails of the probability distribution, thus having preference for assets with skewed payoff (Barberis, 2012; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Thaler & Ziemba, 1988). Other theories which motivate gambling behavior from behavioral perspective include people exhibiting incorrect evaluation of uncertain outcomes (Gilovich, 1983) and people having erroneous beliefs about their skills (Griffiths, 1990).

Many studies in Decision Science and in Economics find that people's behavioral or cognitive biases lead to suboptimal decision making. Attempts to address the learning activity from behavioral bias can be conducted through an experimental approach in a laboratory setting (e.g., Camerer & Ho, 1999; Charness & Levin, 2005; Erev & Roth, 1998; Ho & Weigelt, 1996; Roth & Erev, 1995) or in a non-laboratory setting by analyzing empirical data. The former method has the inherent limitation of being confined in a laboratory which shields participants from external factors that may affect their decision making in the real world. As for the latter approach of using real world empirical data, studies typically focus on investors' specific investment activity or on security analysts' behavior. For example, Kaustia and Knüpfer (2008) and Chiang, Hirshleifer, Qian, and Sherman (2011) examine investors' learning with respect to IPO subscription activity, Strahilevitz, Odean, and Barber (2011) studies learning with regard to stock repurchase activity, and Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick (2009) examine the case of 401(k) saving. As for studies on analysts' behavior, Mikhail, Walther, and Willis (2003) find that the degree of analysts' underreaction to prior earnings information decreases as their experience increases. Markov and Tamayo (2006) use aggregate consensus data and explain the predictability in financial analysts' forecast errors based on the analysts' rational learning behavior.

While the aforementioned studies examine learning behavior of different subjects, these studies still have a limitation in the sense that the results do not provide direct implications on market efficiency. The reason is because, first of all, the samples used in these studies represent only a small subset of the respective market. Second, activities examined in the above studies do not provide investment return performance measures with which we can measure the degree of market inefficiency. For example, the finding that analysts become more accurate with experience (Markov & Tamayo, 2006; Mikhail et al., 2003) provides an evidence of learning, but whether the process leads to market efficiency is not clear. Third, even if the return performance measure can be constructed for certain investment activity of investors, the critical issue lies in the difficulty of identifying the true benchmark number for detecting market inefficiency. The complexity in finding the fair value or fair return of an asset is also apparent if we were to use an aggregate market data in order to estimate the degree of market efficiency. For example, when we examine how the stock price responds to earnings announcement and discover the existence of post-earnings announcement drift, we face the difficulty in identifying what should be the “true” stock price in the case of market efficiency. In our study, by utilizing the simplicities of the betting market in which (1) the scope of the pricing problem is reduced and (2) the benchmark outcome follows a simple binomial probability distribution, we can provide a cleaner test of people's learning behavior.

The data of this study comes from Korea's Sports Toto, which is the only legalized sports betting in Korea.

                        More information on the Korean sports betting market is available at the following website: http://www.sportstoto.co.kr/en/main/main.asp.
                      Among the different betting choices available in Sports Toto, we examine the Volleyball Special Double since the outcome specifically follows a binomial probability distribution.

In volleyball games, matches are best-of-five sets. A set is played to 25 points (the fifth set, if necessary, is played to 15 points) and each set must end by at least a 2-point difference. In Volleyball Special Double, participants predict the following outcomes for each of the two matches: (1) score difference in the first-set of the game (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-or-more point difference), regardless of the set winner and (2) set score (3-0, 3-1, 3-2, 2-3, 1-3, 0-3). Choosing the outcome of only one match is not offered in Sports Toto.

The volleyball games offered in Volleyball Special Double include Korean domestic volleyball league games (V-League) and international games, such as the FIVB World League, during their respective seasons.
                           5
                        
                        
                           5
                           A potential concern is that preferences towards a specific team can distort the betting behavior. However, because we define extreme events as the least point difference of 2-points and the most point difference of 7+ points regardless of who is the winning team, the symmetric nature of the extreme events makes us believe such a concern would not bias the results. We do conduct a robustness check by excluding games in which the Korean national team is playing in an international match (where the potential for biased betting is the greatest), and find that our results remain qualitatively similar.
                         Two games offered in the Volleyball Special Double are played by different teams. As for the time of the game, in some cases, both games start at the same time. In other cases, the second game starts 2 hours after the start of the first game. Betting in these games open one or two days before the date of the match and closes 10 minutes prior to the start of the first match.

Payoffs in the Volleyball Special Double are determined in a parimutuel fashion, in which bettors who correctly predict the outcomes of the games share the prize pool. The Sports Toto agency takes 50 percent of the bet amount and pays out only the remaining 50 percent of the betting pot to the winning ticket holders. Therefore, the prize pool consists of only 50 percent of the total amount of money wagered for the event. In addition, if the winning payout is greater than 100 times the bet amount, a tax of 22 percent is automatically levied on the prize amount.

                           6
                           Odds are quoted in the decimal odds system. For example, if you win a bet in which the odds were 10, you receive 10 times the amount of your bet. On an after-tax basis, if you win a bet in which the quoted odds were 200, you receive 200 × (1 − 0.22) = 156 times the amount of your bet.
                         
                        Table 1
                         shows that during the entire existence of this betting market, the mean after-tax winning payout is 670.5 times the bet amount and the median after-tax payout is 321.4 times the bet amount. Most of the betting rounds have a winning payout that is greater than 100 times the bet amount, which are subject to a 22 percent tax. Thus, with an unconditional expected return of −50 percent plus the 22 percent tax in many cases, this betting market seems to be a poor investment for a rational investor. However, a sizable amount is bet in this market. As can be seen from Table 1, throughout the existence of the Volleyball Special Double, the total amount of bets made is 41,513,929,000 Korean Won, which is equivalent to about 37,739,935 U.S. Dollars.

                           This assumes the exchange rate of 1 U.S. Dollar = 1100 Korean Won.
                         Per betting round, the average amount of the betting pool is 106,719,612 Korean Won, or about 97,018 U.S. Dollar.

                         The website not only provides real-time odds information for the current games offered in the market, but also contains the archives of betting and payout information for past events. That is, for the current games scheduled to be played, participants have access to real-time odds, which will change over time until the betting closes. In addition, the archives of the betting data show the final odds information for each possible outcome of each betting round.

                           Since the data provides the betting behavior of aggregate participants, the notion of learning in this study is based on learning by a representative participant or a collective learning of the market, as in Markov and Tamayo (2006).
                        
                     

The data in this study comprise the entire dataset of the Volleyball Special Double since its inception in May 31, 2008 until 2012 (the last betting offered in 2012 was in December 26, 2012). There are a total of 389 betting rounds during this period. Because each betting round involves two matches, and for each match, there are six different set scores (3-0, 3-1, 3-2, 2-3, 1-3, 0-3) and six different first-set score differences (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-or-more point difference) to choose from, betting data for (62)2 = 1296 possible outcomes are observed per betting round. For the entire sample, there is a total of 1296 × 389 = 504,144 observations, each of which links a possible outcome to a potential winning payout associated with that outcome.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The process of points in a volleyball game (as is the case in tennis, which is examined in many studies including Klaassen & Magnus, 2003) can be constructed using a binomial distribution as shown in Fig. 1
                     .

As can be seen from Fig. 1, for a set to end in a 2-point difference, the score process has to pass either 24-23 or 23-24. Therefore, if we let p be the fundamental probability of a team winning a point, the probability of a set ending in a 2-point difference is as follows.

Based on this binomial distribution process, Table 2
                      shows the theoretical probabilities of the final score difference in a set. Numbers in Table 2 show that unless one team is greatly superior to the other team (in which case the probability of a set ending in a difference of 7-or-more points dominates the probabilities of other cases), the probability of a set ending in a 2-point difference is greater than the probability of a set ending in any other specific number. It is also intuitively easy to understand as to why a 2-point difference would occur more often than a 3-point difference or a 4-difference, etc. Because the winning team of a set must have at least a 2-point advantage for the set to end, if the score of the set-winning team is provisionally fixed at 25 points, the other team's score can be either 23, 24, or 25 for the set to eventually end in a two-point difference. On the other hand, to have a 3-point difference, the other team's score must only be 22, and to have a 4-point difference, it must only be 21, and so on.

Using the realized outcomes of all games offered in Volleyball Sports Double, we summarize the actual occurrence of each number's outcome for the score difference in the first-set. The results in Table 3
                      confirm that a 2-point or 7-or-more point difference occurs more frequently than a difference in other numbers. The difference in occurrence between either 2-points or 7-or-more-points and each of the other numbers is statistically significant at the 95 percent level. This greater percentage of occurrences for a 2-point or a 7-or-more-point difference, compared to other numbers, is also consistent over time.

In this section, we formally examine any systematic difference between the realized outcomes of the first-set score difference and the participants’ betting behavior of the first-set score difference. For each of the 1296 possible outcomes per betting round, the betting data archive shows the potential payout odds for each possible outcome. We convert each potential payout odds into the “perceived” probability by taking into account the 50 percent payout ratio.

In order to focus our analysis on the betting patterns concerning the first-set score difference, which follows a binomial distribution, we construct the participants’ perceived probability for each value of the first-set score difference by aggregating across all possible set scores. This calculation is performed by cumulating the outcomes across different set scores, and then taking the average across all the betting rounds from 1 through 389.

The results for these perceived probabilities of the first-set score difference are shown in Table 4
                        .

We can now compare the participants’ perceived probability (shown in Table 4) against the realized probability (shown in Table 3). According to the realized outcome of each first-set score difference in Table 3, the fair amount of bets made for a 2-point difference in the first-sets of both games would yield a probability of (25.58 percent)2 = 6.54 percent.
                           10
                        
                        
                           10
                           This is because the two games offered in Volleyball Special Double are independent of each other. In many cases, one of the games is a men's match and the other is a women's match. For a few cases which feature two men's matches or two women's matches, we checked for the possibility that the second game may be affected by the first game (for example, the result of the first game determines the fate of another team's playoff chance in the second game) and found no such case.
                         However, Table 4 shows that the corresponding perceived probability is only 4.50 percent. Similarly, for a combination of 2- and 7-or-more point differences, the fair probability based on realized outcomes would be 25.58 percent × 29.31 percent = 7.50 percent. The corresponding perceived probability from participants’ betting activities is only 3.72 percent for a 2-point first-set difference in the first game and a 7-or-more-point first-set difference in the second game, and only 3.46 percent for a 7-or-more-point first-set difference in the first game and a 2-point first-set difference in the second game. Finally, outcomes of a 7-or-more-point first-set difference in both games have a realized probability of (29.31 percent)2 = 8.59 percent. The corresponding perceived probability based on participants’ betting behavior yields only 4.58 percent.

The same relationship holds if we focus attention on only one of the games. For example, the perceived probability that the first-set of the first game ends in a 2-point difference, summed across all outcomes of the second game, is 18.75 percent. Similarly, the corresponding perceived probability for the first-set of the second game is 18.13 percent. Both of these numbers are less than the realized probability that the first-set ends in a 2-point difference, which is 25.58 percent. For a 7-or-more-point difference, the perceived probabilities are 17.53 percent and 18.71 percent for the first and second games, respectively. These are much smaller than the realized probability that the first-set ends with a 7-or-more-point difference, which is 29.31 percent.

The above results show that there is a discernible biased pattern in betting behavior relative to the realized probabilities of outcomes. Specifically, participants seem to underbet two-point and 7-or-more-point difference in the first-set score, which are betting options that are extreme in terms of statistical ordering (they represent the smallest and the largest margins of victory in the first set of a match). The result that participants avoid choosing extreme choices is consistent with the extremeness aversion effect, documented in decision making studies such as Simonson and Tversky (1992), Tversky and Simonson (1993), and Chernov (2004).

Taking account of the result that participants underbet extreme choice outcomes, we consider three cases of betting strategies that utilize this bias. If the size of the above mentioned bias is large enough, then there may be opportunities for generating profit. The results of each betting strategies are shown in Table 5
                        .

In the first type of strategy shown in Panel A, the bettor bets on both extreme choices of the first-set score difference (combinations of 2- and 7-or- more point differences) and on all possible set scores. This strategy spans (2 × 6)2 = 144 different cases of possible winning outcomes.
                           11
                        
                        
                           11
                           The cost of implementing the strategy is minimal because participants can mark multiple choices on their betting tickets. In other words, rather than having to mark 144 different betting tickets, participants can mark different combinations of choices in one betting ticket. In this case, participants can mark on a 2-point and a 7-or-more-point difference and mark all available choices of the set score on their betting ticket.
                         We normalize the betting amount so that the bettor bets one unit for each betting opportunity. Therefore, for each betting round, he is betting 1/144 units per outcome of his choice. Using this strategy, the bettor would have yielded 128.01 units after-tax
                           12

                           The quoted payout odds in the Korean sports betting market are stated in a pre-tax payout amount. In order to account for the 22% tax that is charged on winning outputs greater than 100, the after-tax payouts are calculated by multiplying the quoted odds by 0.78 for quoted odds that are greater than 100.
                         for an investment of 51 units in 2008, 178.17 units after-tax for an investment of 95 units in 2009, 87.86 units after-tax for an investment of 79 units in 2010, 68.36 units after-tax for an investment of 80 units in 2011, and 101.93 units after-tax for an investment of 84 units in 2012. The corresponding after-tax returns are 151.00 percent, 87.55 percent, 11.22 percent, −14.55 percent, and 21.34 percent for each year. Although there is a case of a negative return in one of the 5 years of observation, that negative return of −14.55 percent is still much superior compared to the unconditional return of this sports betting market, which is −50 percent plus an additional 22 percent tax on winning tickets with payouts greater than 100 times the bet amount. Over the entire period, this strategy yields 564.33 units for an investment of 389 units, providing an average return on investment of 45.07 percent. These results show that the discrepancies between the probability implied by the actual betting behavior and the probability based on realized outcomes are large enough to generate profit opportunities even under a 50 percent pre-tax payout rate and a tax of 22 percent. Another notable result in Table 5 is that the winning ticket is realized 123 times out of 389 betting opportunities, which is approximately once every three tries. Therefore, this naive strategy returns not just superior profit, but is easily implementable due to the high frequency of winning.

To examine that the superior return of betting on extreme choices is not driven by only one end of the extremes, we next consider two alternative strategies. In the first alternative betting strategy shown in Panel B, the bettor bets only on a 2-point difference in the first-set of each game and on all outcomes of the set score. Since there are six different possible set scores for each of the two games, this strategy results in 62 = 36 combinations of choices for each betting round. Therefore, by fixing the bet amount to be one unit for each betting opportunity, he is betting 1/36 unit per each possible outcome of his choice. If all his winning payouts are added together under this betting strategy, in 2008, he would have ended up with 57.40 units after-tax with an investment of 51 units. This is equivalent to a return of 12.56 percent. For the following years, the rates of returns are 251.33 percent, 3.72 percent, 10.10 percent, and −38.59 percent. Over the entire period, the realized percentage return is 57.53 percent. As for the frequency of winning bets, the bettor realizes a winning ticket more than once every 11 times.

In another alternative betting strategy shown in Panel C, the bettor bets on a 7-or-more-point difference in the first-sets of both games and on all outcomes regarding the set score. Since this case also results in 62 = 36 combinations of choices for each betting round, he also would be betting 1/36 units per outcome. Using this strategy, the bettor would have yielded returns of 373.31 percent, −3.06 percent, 30.23 percent, 8.70 percent, and 111.85 percent each year. For the entire sample period, this strategy provides an average return on investment of 80.28 percent and the frequency of realizing a winning ticket of 10.28 percent.

These results show that the high return generated by utilizing the extreme avoidance bias is driven not by just one of the extreme numbers, but by both ends of the extremes.
                           13
                        
                        
                           13
                           As with many studies documenting market anomaly, there is a concern of data mining or data snooping, which refers to the practice of searching backward for all possible betting patterns yielding superior returns. We believe that data mining is not a problem in this study for the following reasons. First, it is surprising to find a large return for using a very simple strategy of choosing extreme choices in the betting ticket. Second, after the initial discovery of the bias, which was documented in the first draft of the paper (which used data only up to 2010), we find that the anomaly still holds for periods after that. Therefore, testing for the bias for years 2011 and 2012 serves as an out-of-sample test and we find that the bias still exists.
                         When we compare the return from betting on both extremes versus betting on either one end of the extremes, we find that the average realized return (45.07 percent) is lower if he bets on both ends than if he bets on either one end of the extreme (57.53 percent and 80.28 percent). However, bettors experience a lower risk by using the strategy of betting on both ends of the extremes compared to betting on just one. For example, the standard deviation of returns from betting on both extremes is 5.19, whereas the standard deviation of returns is 14.70 and 11.83 from betting on a 2-point and 7-or-more point difference, respectively. Moreover, the frequency of realizing a winning ticket is greatly enhanced using this strategy of betting at both extremes: the bettor has a winning ticket approximately once every three tries.

One major difference between a typical lottery game and the sports betting market examined in this study lies in the probability of winning, and therefore, in the actual feasibility of generating profits. In a typical lottery game, even when there are opportunities of positive expected profit, whether it is due to the existence of unpopular numbers or a large rollover of pot money, it is almost impossible to implement a profit-generating strategy. This is because with limited wealth and an extremely small probability of winning, the participant is likely to go bankrupt (known as “gambler's ruin”) before realizing a winning ticket (MacLean, Ziemba, & Blazenko, 1992; Thaler & Ziemba, 1988; Ziemba, Brumelle, Gautier, & Schwartz, 1986).
                           14
                        
                        
                           14
                           A similar argument is provided by Abrams and Garibaldi (2010), who use the portfolio theory in order to prove that even when the expected returns are positive, the variances in the rates of return are so large that a lottery cannot be a good investment.
                         On the other hand, in the case of the sports betting market that is examined in this paper, a simple strategy produces a winner 123 times out of 389 cases, or almost once every three tries. Therefore, the strategy can be implemented without falling prey to the “gambler's ruin.”

The results so far suggest that (1) there is a large discrepancy between the perceived probabilities and the probabilities based on realized outcomes of a binomial distribution and (2) there is some evidence of a learning effect among participants, as the return generated by utilizing the bias generally diminishes over time. To further address this issue, we examine the trend in the betting tendencies of participants. If participants learn over time that certain outcomes are underbet relative to their realized probabilities of occurrence, more bets will be made for these outcomes over time, thereby reducing the gap between the perceived and realized probabilities. In order to observe the trend of these perceived probabilities based on participants’ betting behavior, we estimate the following regression:

                     In Eq. (4), pt
                      represents the perceived probability of either a 2- or a 7-or-more point difference in the first-set of each game in the t
                     th betting round, as calculated in Eq. (2). t is the trend variable which corresponds to the sequential betting order in the sample (starts at 1 and goes up to 389). It is the main variable of interest in examining the learning effect.

                        15
                        We also use an alternative measure of the trend variable using calendar time and the results are qualitatively similar to those using the numerical order trend variable.
                      For expositional purpose, the trend variable is divided by 100 in the regression. ɛ
                        i
                      is assumed to be a N(0, σ
                     2) error term.

We also control and test for other factors that can affect people's perceived probabilities of outcomes. First, studies such as Roth and Erev (1995), which experiment reinforcement learning, show that the learning curve is steep at first and then levels off as experience increases. To incorporate the possible nonlinearity of learning, we add a quadratic term of the trend. Second, the influence of the feedback in each round can depend on the strength of the evidence, which forms the content of the feedback. Griffin and Tversky (1992) argue that people update their beliefs based on the 'weight' and the 'strength' of new evidence. Weight refers to statistical informativeness, such as sample size. Strength refers to the magnitude of the new evidence. In our data, weight is the same for each game outcome, whereas strength differs by the size of the payout odds. For example, for the same realized outcome of the games, the strength of the evidence is greater when the winning bet receives a payout of 1000 compared to the case when the payout is only 10. We test this conjecture by including variables that contain information about the previous betting round. Specifically, we include a dummy variable win which takes a value of one if the previous betting sequence resulted in a 2- or 7-or-more point difference for the first sets of both games. We also include the variable payout which is the natural logarithm of the after-tax winning payout of the previous betting order. We hypothesize that people's decisions of betting on extreme choices are affected by (1) whether the previous sequence resulted in an extreme outcome and (2) the payoff of the winning ticket in the previous betting sequence. We include not only the payout variable but also the interaction term between the previous winner dummy variable and the previous payout variable in order to capture the magnitude of the new information contained in the previous betting sequence. These variables also capture the potential self-serving bias, where the bettor attributes wins to their ability (therefore putting more weight to the information contained in the outcome) and discredits losses due to bad luck (therefore putting less weight to the information contained in the outcome).

                        We thank an anonymous referee for pointing out the self-serving bias. Due to the aggregate nature of our sample data, we are unable to control for the self-serving bias at the individual level. Our control variables of win, payout, and win∙payout is controlling for the informational content contained in the previous betting round at the aggregate level of betting.
                     
                  

The results of the regression are shown in Table 6
                     . In Model 1, we include only the trend variable and thus the model represents the simplest form of testing the learning effect. The coefficient of the trend line is positive and statistically significant at the 99 percent confidence level. This result suggests that participants exhibit learning behavior as they receive feedback on outcomes. Previous studies on decision making find that debiasing of judgment errors is a difficult task and offer various techniques for debiasing different types of judgment errors (Arkes, 1991; Fischhoff, 1982). The results of this study indicate that the extremeness aversion bias found in people's decision making can be debiased through providing relevant feedbacks that show the superior performance of extreme choices arising from people's avoidance of these choices. However, the speed of debiasing or learning is slow, as the regression result suggests that the perceived probability of extreme outcomes increased by 3.34 percent (0.858 × 389/100) over 389 rounds of betting.

In Model 2, we control for other factors that can affect the people's perceived probabilities of extreme outcomes.
                        17
                     
                     
                        17
                        All the results are qualitatively similar when we use only a subset of these variables as control variables.
                      The results in Model 2 show that the perceived probabilities of a 2-point and 7-or-more-point difference are positively associated with the betting order and are negatively related to the squared term of the betting order. This result implies that the strength of learning is declining over time and is consistent with the findings of Roth and Erev (1995). According to Model 2, we find that the increase in the perceived probability during the existence of the market (4 years or 389 rounds) is only 3.5 percent (=2.086 × 389/100 + (−0.307) × (389/100)2).

The coefficient of win, the previous winner dummy, is positive and statistically significant. This result shows that when people receive information on the occurrence of an outcome in which the first-set ends in a 2- or 7-or-more point difference, they incorporate the new information by increasing their bets on these outcomes in the next betting sequence. This result is in line with the newsvendor orders’ tendency to chase demand (adjusting order quantities towards prior demand) as found in an experimental setting of Bolton and Katok (2008), Bostian et al. (2008), and Rudi and Drake (2011).

The coefficient of the payout variable itself is statistically insignificant, which shows that when the games in the previous round of betting did not end in either a 2- or 7-or-more point difference in the first sets of both games, that payout amount does not affect the decision making in the current round of betting. The interaction term between the previous winner dummy variable and the previous payout variable captures the spirit of Griffin and Tversky (1992), who argue that people will update their beliefs more when the strength of the evidence is stronger. In the setting of this study, an outcome of 2- or 7-or-more first set score difference coupled with a high payout will have a greater strength of evidence, which predicts a positive coefficient of the interaction variable. However, the results in Model 2 show that the coefficient is negative.

                        18
                        
                           Gleason and Lee (2003) also find evidence that does not support Griffin and Tversky (1992). Specifically, Gleason and Lee (2003) examine the post-revision price drift and find that the market does not make a sufficient distinction between analyst forecast revisions that provide new information (information with stronger strength) and revisions that merely move toward the consensus (information with weaker strength).
                      That is, when the previous betting sequence ended in an outcome with a 2- or 7-or-more point difference, people update their beliefs more when the payout is smaller. Because smaller winning payout represents an outcome with greater perceived probability, the result implies that people generate a bigger reaction when they are reinforced by new evidence that supports their prior of high-probability event.

Previous results showed that, using a regression analysis, people exhibit learning behavior toward lessening of the extremeness avoidance bias. We now check how the perceived probability of extreme outcomes changes over time in comparison to a fair benchmark probability of these outcomes. The results are depicted in Fig. 2
                     . The benchmark probability used is the probability according to the realized outcomes, which is measured in two ways. The first method is based on all realized outcomes for the entire sample period. Specifically, the benchmark probability for betting on the extreme choices of the first-set difference would be (0.2558 + 0.2931)2 = 30.13 percent. In Fig. 2, this benchmark probability is noted as the “overall average of benchmark probability.” Another measure of the benchmark probability is calculated by including only those games that were played before the specific games offered in the betting round. This benchmark better reflects the participants' information set at the time of their betting. In Fig. 2, this benchmark probability is noted as the “moving average of benchmark probability.” Fig. 2 shows that the moving average benchmark probability changes through time as more games are added to the sample, and converges to the overall average of benchmark probability.

The results in Fig. 2 reveal that the perceived probability is always less than the benchmark probability. The difference between the benchmark probability and the perceived probability represents the size of the extremeness aversion bias. The results of Fig. 2, along with the results of the regression analysis in Table 7
                     , show that although the size of the bias is decreasing over time as people exhibit learning behavior, the speed of learning is rather slow and the perceived probability has yet to converge to the fair level suggested by realized outcomes.

As mentioned earlier, the most well-documented anomaly in the sports betting market is the favorite-longshot bias. Under the parimutuel market structure, such as this Volleyball Special Double, the favorite-longshot bias suggests that favorites are relatively underbet, while longshots are relatively overbet. If the favorite-longshot bias exists in Volleyball Special Double, the result of the study may just be a manifestation of the favorite-longshot bias, instead of reflecting the extremeness aversion effect. It is also interesting in its own right to examine whether the bias exists in Volleyball Special Double, where the payoff odds of each outcome is much greater than a typical sports betting market. While the favorite-longshot bias is found in many betting markets, a few studies find cases in which the reverse favorite-longshot bias exists.
                        19
                     
                     
                        19
                        Examples of markets found to have a reverse favorite-longshot bias are Hong Kong horse racing markets (Busche & Hall, 1988) and the U.S. baseball and hockey betting markets (Woodland & Woodland, 1994, 2001).
                      
                     Cain and Peel (2004) provide explanation for these discrepancies by arguing that there is a meta-relationship between odds and returns and the reason as to why the favorite-longshot bias is observed in some sports and not (or even reverse bias) in others is because in any one sport, people only observe a part of the probability range. In the Volley Special Double market, in which the probability distribution of the outcome is known (that is, a binomial distribution), whether the favorite-longshot bias exists is an empirical question.

In order to examine the possible favorite-longshot bias, we first rank all possible bets according to their odds. If the favorite-longshot bias exists in the market, there should be a significant relationship between the size of odds and the ex-post return. The nature of the ex-post return in our betting market is that for each betting round, only one bet (the winning bet) has a large positive return and the rest of the other bets have a −100 percent return. After sorting all 504,144 bets in the sample according to their odds, we categorize the odds into deciles. We then find the average returns for all bets in each odds decile. The results are shown in Fig. 3
                     . Bets which have odds that are in the lowest 10 percent of the sample are categorized into Decile 1. These are bets which participants believe to have the greatest probabilities of occurrence, hence, lower payoff in the case of a winning bet. On the opposite end of the spectrum, bets which have odds that are in the highest 10 percent of the sample are categorized into Decile 10. These are bets which participants believe to have the lowest probabilities of occurrence, hence, a higher payoff in the case of a winning bet. If the favorite-longshot bias exists in our sample, then we should observe a decreasing return as the odds increase. However, the results in Fig. 3 show that there is no discernible pattern of return in relation to the size of the odds. In other words, the returns to bets do not seem to be related to the probability of winning. To corroborate our results, we run a regression in which the ex-post return is the dependent variable and the odds decile is the independent variable. Our level of observation is each betting outcome which totals 504,144 bets. Result in Table 7 shows that the decile variable is statistically insignificant. This evidence shows not only that the results of this study are not driven by the favorite-longshot bias, but also that the well-documented favorite-longshot bias in a typical sports betting market does not exist in the setting in which the probability distribution of the outcome is known.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

An exotic sports betting market of Volley Special Double provides us with an ideal platform to examine people's decision making under a known probability distribution of the outcome. We find a bias in participants' decision making behavior in the form of extremeness aversion which results in market inefficiency and a chance to generate a large profit which averaged 45.07 percent during the sample period. The size of the return is much greater than the returns documented in other abnormal returns in sports betting. By making use of the favorite-longshot bias, Ziemba and Hausch (1986) document that bettors can generate a return of about 4–5 percent for the shortest odds in horseracing. Another study that document profit-generating strategies include Gray and Gray (1997), who also show a positive return of 4–5 percent in the NFL (National Football League) in the U.S using discrete-choice probit model based strategies. Compared to these numbers, it is surprising that the return generated by our simple strategy that takes advantage of the extremeness aversion bias creates such a big return.

We find that the market inefficiency caused by the biased betting behavior is gradually corrected through the feedback of realized outcomes. However, the speed of learning is weak and to date (after 4 years or 389 rounds of betting), the bias that leads to market inefficiency still exists. The slow learning behavior we find is consistent with the conservatism of people in slowly updating beliefs in the face of new evidence (Edwards, 1968) and the underreaction of the market (Barberis, Sheifer, & Vishny, 1998; Chan, Jegadeesh, & Lakonishok, 1997; Cutler, Poterba, & Summers, 1991; Jegadeesh & Titman, 1993, etc.). By comparison, Mikhail et al. (2003) examine how the degree of analysts' underreaction changes as their experience increases, and show that they take an average of 8 years to reduce underreaction to their forecast errors by 44 percent. The result of our study that the perceived probability moves toward the benchmark fair probability by only 3.3–3.5 percent in 4 years indicate that in a market where participants are less sophisticated (than stock analysts), it takes even longer for the market to reduce the degree of bias.

In addition, we find some interesting facet of people's learning behavior. First, the positive coefficient of the previous winner dummy variable implies that if the previous betting round resulted in extreme outcomes (previous winner dummy variable equals one), then participants increase their bets on these extreme outcomes in the next betting sequence. This result is in line with the newsvendor orders’ tendency to chase demand as found in an experimental setting of Bostian et al. (2008) and Rudi and Drake (2011). Because the results of the games in our sample are independent across time, our results suggest that demand chasing can arise due to not only the predictable or stationary pattern of demand but also the intrinsic uncertainty component of demand pattern.

Secondly, the negative coefficient of the interaction variable between the previous winner dummy and the previous payout variables implies that people generate a bigger learning effect as the realized outcome is consistent with their prior belief (which leads to a smaller number of previous payout due to heavier betting). One interpretation of this result can be inferred from Bloomfield, Libby, and Nelson (2000), who develop a model in which an investor receives a noisy signal about the reliability of the information. They show that this noisy signal affects the degree of investors' reaction, which can lead to either underreaction or overreaction of the market. Similarly, Liang (2003) attributes the post-earnings announcement drift to investors’ information processing bias; overconfidence in less reliable information and underconfidence in more reliable information. The result of our study implies that one way of how people assess information reliability depends on whether the information contained in the signal is consistent with people's prior expectation. Specifically, we find that people are more receptive to new evidence when the evidence supports their prior, rather than when the evidence contains a greater element of surprise. An alternative explanation of this finding is the self-serving bias in the aggregate level, where bettors attribute wins to their ability (therefore putting more weight to the information contained in the outcome) and discredit losses due to bad luck (therefore putting less weight to the information contained in the outcome).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this study, we use an exotic sports betting market of volleyball games to examine people's betting behavior with regard to outcomes that follow a known probability distribution. We find a biased betting behavior in the market which is consistent with the tendency of people to avoid choosing extreme choices. Whereas previous studies in decision making examine this extremeness aversion bias with respect to people's consumption behavior in a laboratory environment, we find that this bias also exists in a natural setting of a sports betting market which involves real money. Our results show that the magnitude of this bias is large so that even under the 50 percent payout rate of the sports betting market setting, the bias leads to an overall average return of greater than 45 percent. The market inefficiency is gradually corrected as participants exhibit some learning behavior. In the face of new evidence, participants update their posteriors in the right direction, but by too little magnitude, relative to the rational benchmark. To date (after 4 years or 389 rounds of betting), the amount of bets made on extreme choices does not yet reach the appropriate level as indicated by the realized outcomes.

Our findings provide the following implications. First, even when the decision maker has knowledge about the probability distribution of the outcome (in our case, it is the simple binomial distribution), market inefficiency caused by the bias of market participants can lead to the underreaction phenomenon of the market. Second, there is a chasing behavior of betting participants, similar to the demand chasing in the newsvendor orders, even when the events are independent over time. Lastly, one of the ways of how people assess information reliability depends on whether the information contained in the signal is consistent with their prior expectation.

One limitation of our study is that we are limited to data at the aggregate level. Obtaining data at the individual level with bettor identification and the time stamp of betting would enable us to test more theories on decision making and its effect in the market across different dimensions. For example, we can explore how decision making process is different for various demographics and how each individual's decision making process evolves over time. Specifically, we can examine whether a cognitive bias is driven by a certain set of market participants or is exhibited by the whole population. And the test of whether people imitate other people's betting over time and how it relates to the aggregate market movement as modeled by Cenci, Cerquetti, and Peccati (1996) also seems to be an interesting idea to explore empirically. Such research would be possible with the consent of the betting market organizer to release the data.
