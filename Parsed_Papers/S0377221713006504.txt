In this study, we use a linear programming relaxation standpoint to compare integer formulations for the k-club problem. The comparisons involve formulations known from the literature and new formulations, built in different variable spaces. For the case k
                     =3, we propose two enhanced compact formulations. From the LP relaxation standpoint these formulations dominate all other compact formulations in the literature and are equivalent to a formulation with a non-polynomial number of constraints. Also for k
                     =3, we compare the relative strength of LP relaxations for all formulations examined in the study (new and known from the literature). Based on insights obtained from the comparative study, we devise a strengthened version of a recursive compact formulation in the literature for the k-club problem (k
                     >1) and show how to modify one of the new formulations for the case k
                     =3 in order to accommodate additional constraints recently proposed in the literature.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Given an undirected graph G
                     =(V,
                     E) and an integer k, a k-club S is a cluster of nodes such that any two of its elements can reach each other through at most k
                     −1 intermediate cluster members. If k
                     =1, then every cluster member is directly linked to all the others and S is a clique (Bomze, Budinich, Pardalos, & Pelillo, 1999; Sorensen, 2004; Alidaee, Glover, Kochenberger, & Wang, 2007; Martins, 2010). If k
                     >1, a k-club can be interpreted as a distance-based relaxation of a clique.

The need for graph models to represent clusters was first noted during the 1970s in the literature of social networks analysis (Alba, 1973;Mokken, 1979). It was also noted then that the clique model is too restrictive for many real-world applications for not all social relations require face-to-face interaction. In fact, social relations are frequently established through intermediaries. This explains the importance of clique relaxation models for social sciences.

Recently, the OR community has produced a significant number of studies on clique-related models with applications in both the social sciences as well as other fields such as computational biology (Blażewicz, Formanowicz, & Kasprak, 2005; Balasundaram, Butenko, & Trukhanov, 2005; Butenko & Wilhelm, 2006) and data mining (Boginski, Butenko, & Pardalos, 2006).

For any k
                     >1, the k-club problem is to find a maximum cardinality k-club of a graph. The k-club problem is NP-hard (Bourjolly, Laporte, & Pesant, 2002). The computational performance of all the approaches reported in the literature depends on the value of k and the edge density of the graph. To be able to devise better exact and approximate approaches, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of the problem from a theoretical point of view. A detailed study of the non-hereditary nature of k-clubs for k
                     >1 is presented in Mahdavi Pajouh and Balasundaram (2012). In this study, we investigate the relative strength of the LP relaxations of integer programming formulations for the k-club problem built in different variable spaces.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide definitions, terminology, and notation. Section 3 contains the motivation and an overview of the study. Section 4 contains a review of the literature on k-club models. Sections 5 and 6 are devoted to the comparison of models and the development of enhanced versions, from the linear programming standpoint. In Section 7 we derive a formulation for a problem that has recently been proposed in the literature: a variant of the 3-club problem with additional robustness constraints. Conclusions are presented in Section 8.

Given an undirected graph G
                     =(V,
                     E) and a node v
                     ∈
                     V, we represent by N
                     
                        v
                      the set of all nodes adjacent to v, and call it the neighbourhood of v. The distance dist
                     
                        G
                     (u,
                     v) between two nodes u and v is the minimum number of edges needed to link them, and the diameter diam(G) is the maximum distance between any u and v. If S
                     ⊆
                     V, the subgraph induced by S is G
                     [S]
                     =(S,
                     E(S)), where E(S) is the set of edges with both end nodes in S. For any k
                     ⩾1, if diam(G
                     [S])⩽
                     k, S is a k-club. A k-club S
                     ⊆
                     V can be represented by its incidence vector X
                     =(x
                     1,…,
                     x
                     ∣V∣). If C is a subset of nodes and s, t
                     ∈
                     V⧹C, we say that C is an s
                     −
                     t node cut set if C intersects all chains that link s and t.

Formulations with variables to represent only nodes are called natural whereas formulations with additional variables to represent edges, chains or paths are called extended. A formulation is compact if the number of its variables and constraints is bounded from above by a polynomial function of the number of nodes. If an integer linear programming formulation is represented by [F], then [F]LP represents its linear programming (LP) relaxation, their optimal values are represented by Z[F] and Z[F]LP, and their feasible sets are represented by S[F] and S[F]LP, respectively. Feasible solutions to LP relaxations of natural (resp. extended) integer formulations are represented by

                     ⩽ Z[F2]LP, and we say that [F1]LP is stronger than [F2]LP and formulation [F1] dominates [F2]. If Proj
                        x
                     (S[F1]LP)=Proj
                        x
                     (S[F2]LP), then [F1] and [F2] are LP-equivalent.

Like many other combinatorial optimization problems, the k-club-problem has alternative integer linear programming formulations that are stated with different sets of variables. The first formulation in the literature, proposed in Bourjolly et al. (2002), is a compact extended formulation with node and chain variables. Following Almeida and Carvalho (2012), we shall call it the chain formulation and denote it by [F_C]. Since two-edge chains t
                     =(i,
                     r,
                     j) that link nodes i and j can be identified by the central node r, there is no need for chain variables to represent them. Based on this observation, Bourjolly et al. (2002) also proposed a simplified natural formulation for the case k
                     =2. Very recently, four new formulations have been proposed for k-clubs. Veremyev and Boginski (2012) present a compact extended recursive formulation (henceforth referred to as [F_R]) derived from a nonlinear model by a linearization procedure that takes into account the structure of k-clubs. For k
                     =3, Almeida and Carvalho (2012) propose a node cut set natural formulation [F_S] with a non-polynomial number of constraints and a compact extended formulation [F_N] with node and edge variables. For the case k
                     =2, Carvalho and Almeida (2011) devise a natural formulation whose constraints define facets of the 2-club polytope P2c. This formulation, based on Bourjolly et al.’s model, is obtained by lifting redundant constraints.

Many authors have carried out comparative studies of alternative formulations for important combinatorial optimization problems – e.g. tree problems (Magnanti & Wolsey, 1995) and travelling salesman-related problems (Gouveia & Voss, 1995; Oncan, Altinel, & Laporte, 2009). To the best of our knowledge, no similar study can be found in the literature for the k-club problem. Veremyev and Boginski (2012, pp. 320–321) comment on the tightness of binary formulations based on the results obtained with a set of test instances. They guess that their recursive formulation “is generally at least as good (or, at the very least, not substantially worse) than the one by 
                     Bourjolly et al. (2002)” and that their formulation “is rather tight for larger values of k”. Almeida and Carvalho (2012) have proved that formulation [F_N] dominates chain formulation [F_C] for k
                     =3, and they present a weakened version of [F_N] which is LP-equivalent to [F_C]. The authors also prove that for k
                     =3 node cut set formulation [F_S] dominates [F_N], but do not show how to strengthen the latter to obtain a formulation LP-equivalent to the former.

With this study we aim to investigate the relative strength of the LP relaxations of different formulations for the maximum k-club problem. Since the formulations are stated with different sets of variables, the comparisons are made by projecting the LP feasible sets onto the space of node variables. The insight gained into the k-club structure by means of these comparisons may be of help to explore possible ways to formulate related problems, as illustrated in Section 7 with the R-robust k-club problem recently proposed in the literature by Veremyev and Boginski (2012).

First, for the case k
                     =3, we show how to modify [F_C] in order to obtain an enhanced version [F_EC], which is LP-equivalent to [F_S]. Then, we address the tightness of the recursive formulation [F_R] in comparison with the tightness of [F_C] and show that the conclusion depends on the value of k: for k
                     =3 [F_R] dominates [F_C] but the dominance does not hold for k
                     =4. For k
                     =3, we also show that [F_R] is dominated by [F_EC].

Based on the insight gained from the comparisons of [F_R], [F_C], and [F_EC] for k
                     =3, we derive a strengthened version of [F_R] that is valid for any k
                     >1, denoted by [F_ER]. We then show that for k
                     =3 [F_ER] and [F_EC] are LP-equivalent.

We conclude the paper with a formulation for the R-robust 3-club problem, introduced in the literature by Veremyev and Boginski (2012). To the best of our knowledge, there is in the literature no other formulation for the robustness condition when k
                     >2.

To set the grounds for the comparisons presented in the following sections, we shall first review integer programming formulations in the literature.

To simplify the notation, we will denote by

                                 k
                              
                           
                        
                      the set of all pairs of nodes that cannot belong simultaneously to a k-club, because their distance in G
                     =(V,
                     E) is greater than k, and by 
                        
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                           
                        
                      the set of all pairs of nonadjacent nodes whose distance in G
                     =(V,
                     E) does not exceed k.

The formulation proposed in Bourjolly et al. (2002), with node and chain variables, can be presented as follows. For any two nonadjacent nodes i, j

                        V, let

Constraints (2) impose that a pair of nonadjacent nodes in a k-club must be linked by at least one selected chain with at most k edges. Constraints (3) impose the inclusion in the k-club of all nodes in selected chains. Conditions (4) and (5) define the variables as binary.

Constraints (6) impose that each pair of selected nodes must be linked by at least a path with at most k edges. Constraints (7) and (8) define paths with two edges. Constraints (9) and (10) define the recursion for paths with three or more edges. Constraints (11) define the recursion variables as binary.

Recursive formulation [F_R] has size O(k∣V∣2).

For the case k
                        =3, Almeida and Carvalho (2012) propose two alternative formulations – neighbourhood formulation [F_N] and node cut set formulation [F_S]. The rationale for [F_N] and [F_S] is summarized next.

Consider a pair of nonadjacent nodes i and j of G
                        =(V,
                        E). They may be included in a 3-club S only if at least one of the following conditions holds:
                           
                              (I)
                              There is a node r in S that is a neighbour of i and j, i.e., r
                                 ∈(N

                                 );

There are two adjacent nodes in S, p and q, such that p is a neighbour of i, and q is a neighbour of j, i.e., p

Conditions (12) are packing constraints. Neighbourhood constraints (13) impose that two nonadjacent nodes i and j cannot be both in a 3-club unless a common neighbour is in the 3-club or a pair of neighbours, p and q, of i and j respectively, linked by an edge, are in the 3-club. Constraints (14) guarantee that an edge (i,
                        j) is used if and only if both its end nodes belong to the 3-club. Constraints (15) define edge variables as nonnegative.

Conditions (12) are packing constraints. Node cut set constraints (16) impose that, if two nonadjacent nodes i and j are both selected for the 3-club, then a common neighbour of i and j or one node from each

Node cut set formulation [F_S] dominates neighbourhood formulation [F_N] (Almeida & Carvalho, 2012).

For k
                     =3, Almeida and Carvalho (2012) show that chain formulation [F_C] is dominated by formulation [F_N], which is in turn dominated by natural formulation [F_S]. They also show how to modify [F_C] to obtain a chain formulation, LP-equivalent to [F_N]. All these formulations are compact, except for [F_S], which has a non-polynomial number of node cut set constraints. The comparisons in Almeida and Carvalho (2012) suggest that if we aim to obtain a chain formulation LP-equivalent to [F_S], we have to devise more stringent constraints to link node and chain variables. The intuition for the new linking constraints is provided by the example in Almeida and Carvalho (2012, p. 157): the dominance of [F_S]LP over [F_N]LP may be strict only when there is at least one pair

A chain that includes edge (i,
                     p) (resp. (q,
                     j)) can only be used if node p (resp. q) is in the 3-club, and to include a pair of nonadjacent nodes i and j in the 3-club, there is no need to select more than one chain with three edges. Therefore, constraints (19) can be lifted to

                     . This version of constraints (18) imposes the extra condition that at most one chain with three edges can be selected to link nodes i and j in the induced subgraph. The condition is not restrictive for the 3-club problem, but it is incompatible with multiple-chain conditions for robustness that have been recently proposed in the literature (see Section 7). By contrast, the lifting of constraints (19) to constraints (22) and (23) strengthens the LP relaxation of the integer model and paves the way to the introduction of robustness conditions.

The dominance of [F_EC] over [F_C] may be strict. An illustration is provided by the graph depicted in Fig. 1(a)
                     .

For k
                     =3, the number of variables in [F_EC] and [F_C] is O (∣V∣4). In practice, the number of variables in [F_EC] is significantly smaller than the number of variables in [F_C] because all variables that represent chains with two edges as well as many variables that represent chains with three edges are eliminated.

In this section, we compare the LP relaxations of the integer models described in Sections 4 and 5, for the case k
                     =3. In these relaxations, constraints (4), (5), (11), and (20) are replaced by

In Section 6.1, we establish the LP-equivalence of [F_EC] and [F_S]. In Section 6.2, we show that formulation [F_R] is dominated by enhanced chain formulation [F_EC] and dominates chain formulation [F_C]. Based on the comparative study made for the case k
                     =3, we propose an enhanced version of [F_R] which is valid for the k-club problem, for any k
                     >1. We then establish the LP-equivalence between [F_EC] and this enhanced version of [F_R] for k
                     =3. In Section 6.3, we show that there is no dominance relation between formulations [F_N] and [F_R].

The rationale used to derive formulation [F_EC] suggests that with constraints (22) and (23) we may obtain a chain formulation as strong as [F_S] from the LP relaxation standpoint. In this section we present a formal proof that [F_EC] and [F_S] are, in fact, LP-equivalent.

To prove that [F_EC] and [F_S] are LP-equivalent, we shall show that the feasible set of [F_S]LP is the projection of the feasible set of [F_EC]LP onto the x-space.

As pointed out by Veremyev and Boginski (2012), a theoretical comparison of the tightness of the LP relaxation of their formulation [F_R] with that of the LP relaxation of [F_C] is a very challenging task, due to the recursive nature of [F_R]. As we shall show next, the result of the comparison is not independent of the value of k: [F_R] dominates [F_C] for k
                        =3, but the dominance does not hold for k
                        =4.

We shall conclude this section by showing that [F_EC] dominates [F_R] for k
                        =3.

We shall first show that [F_R] dominates [F_C] for the case k
                        =3. Recalling the rationale presented in the proof of Proposition 2, it is quite intuitive that constraints (7) play an important role in any comparison of [F_R]LP and [F_C]LP for k
                        =3. Given a pair

The dominance of [F_R] over [F_C] for k

The study of the relations between [F_EC]LP and [F_R]LP for k
                           =3 gives hints on how to strengthen the recursive formulation from the LP relaxation standpoint for any integer k
                           ⩾3. Note that for k
                           =2, [F_C] and [F_R] are essentially the same (Veremyev & Boginski, 2012).

For k
                           =3, the dominance of [F_EC]LP over [F_R]LP stems from two reasons: the elimination of all variables that represent chains

By construction, [F_ER] dominates [F_R].
                              Proposition 5
                              Z [F_ER]LP
                                 
                                 ⩽Z[F_R]LP.

The dominance of [F_ER] over [F_R] may be strict. An illustration is provided by the graph depicted in Fig. 2(b).

It is quite intuitive that if k
                                 =3, [F_EC] and [F_ER] are LP-equivalent.

The proof of Proposition 6 follows the rationale used in the proof of Proposition 4. A detailed proof is presented in Appendix B.

                                 For k

                                    LP

For k
                        =3, formulation [F_C] is dominated both by [F_N] and [F_R], but the dominances stem from different reasons. The dominance of [F_N] over [F_C] is due to the substitution of E
                        
                           ij
                         for E(N
                        
                           i
                        ,
                        N
                        
                           j
                        ) in the last term of inequalities (13) (Almeida & Carvalho, 2012). The dominance of [F_R] over [F_C] is, roughly speaking, a consequence of (7). It is then natural to suspect that in the x-space the feasible sets of [F_N]LP and [F_R]LP are different and no inclusion relation holds for them.

The graph used to illustrate the dominance of [F_R] over [F_C] (see Fig. 1(c)) can also be used to show that in the x-space a feasible solution for [F_N]LP may not be feasible for [F_R]LP.

On the other hand, in the x-space a feasible solution for [F_R]LP may not be feasible for [F_N]LP. An illustration is provided by the graph depicted in Fig. 3
                        .

Since there is no inclusion relation in the x-space between the feasible sets of [F_R]LP and [F_N]LP, there is no domination relation between [F_R] and [F_N].

For the case k
                        =3, neighbourhood formulation [F_N] is more compact than any other formulation in the literature. Since, also for k
                        =3, [F_EC] and [F_S] are LP-equivalent, and [F_S] dominates [F_N], we can conclude that [F_N] is also dominated by [F_EC]. Note that there is no way of imposing constraints on the set of three-edge chains that link each pair of nodes 
                           
                              {
                              i
                              ,
                              j
                              }
                              ∈
                              
                                 
                                    N
                                 
                                 
                                    3
                                 
                              
                           
                         using only node and edge variables. However, it is possible to derive [F_EC] from [F_N] by introducing chain variables and adding valid inequalities for the 3-club polytope.

Let us consider again variables

                         (see Section 5), and let us add constraints (18), (20), (22), and (23) to [F_N]. After adding these constraints, constraints (13) can be replaced with

Now, edge variables z
                        
                           ij
                         play no role in the formulation and can be dropped, together with constraints (14). To summarize, (13) and (14) in [F_N] can be replaced with 18 and (20)–(23). Thus, by introducing chain variables

                                    pq
                                 
                                 
                                    ij
                                 
                              
                           
                         and lifting variable linking constraints, [F_N] is transformed into [F_EC]. This procedure provides an alternative proof of the dominance of [F_S] over [F_N] presented in Almeida and Carvalho (2012).

The large number of variables added to [F_N] to transform it into [F_EC] raises the question of the magnitude of the difference Z [F_N]LP
                        −Z [F_EC]LP. An upper bound on this difference is easy to derive by considering a variant of formulation [F_S], denoted by [F_S

A k-club is by definition a subset of nodes of a graph which induces a subgraph with diameter at most equal to k. If k is small, a k-club represents a cluster with good connectivity between each pair of its members– every member needs at most k
                     −1 intermediaries to reach any other member. If the underlying graph represents a communication network, the diameter has been considered a natural way of describing the reliability of the network (Boesch, Harary, & Kabell, 1981). However, a k-club is a fragile structure in that if one of its elements breaks down by accident, the communications among members may be severely affected. A k-club is also quite vulnerable to external attacks: the destruction of a selected single element (node or link) may render the communication among members totally impossible. To identify network clusters that combine good connectivity among members with better reliability properties, Veremyev and Boginski (2012) introduced the new concept of R-robust k-club, which extends the original k-club definition by imposing the additional condition that there must be at least R internally node-disjoint paths between every pair of cluster members. A key feature of this new concept is that the elimination of up to R
                     −1 elements will not destroy the k-club structure, which means that the R-robust k-clubs have much better error and attack tolerance characteristics than k-clubs (Veremyev & Boginski, 2012). As pointed out by the authors, developing mathematical programming approaches for finding large network clusters with good error and attack tolerance characteristics is not an easy task.

For the case k
                     =2, all distinct paths that link a given pair of nodes i and j are internally node-disjoint, since each path is either edge (i,
                     j) or a two-edge path of the form (i,
                     r,
                     j) with node r in N
                     
                        i

Constraints (26) impose that each pair of selected nodes must be linked by at least R paths with at most k edges. Constraints (27)–(30) define the number of two-edge paths that link each pair of nodes, and constraints (31)–(33) define the number of paths with three or more edges that link each pair of nodes. Constraints (34) define the path variables as nonnegative and integer.

While for k
                     =2 the conditions “R internally node-disjoint paths” and “R distinct paths” are equivalent, for k
                     >2 the latter is considerably weaker than the former, since distinct paths may share even all inner nodes. This means that the error and attack tolerance properties of R-robust k-clubs are not guaranteed by conditions (26)–(34) and (4). For k
                     =3, the error and attack tolerance properties of R-robust k-clubs can be guaranteed by adapting formulation [F_EC], as described next.

Given a pair of nodes i and j not linked by an edge in G, constraints (22) and (23) impose that at most one chain that includes node p and at most one chain that includes node q can be selected to link them in the induced subgraph. Furthermore, in formulation [F_EC], variables

                                 ij
                              
                           
                        
                      are defined only for (p,
                     q)∈
                     E such that p
                     ∈(N
                     
                        i
                     ⧹N
                     
                        j
                     ) and q
                     ∈(N
                     
                        j

                        i
                     ). Thus, chains represented by variables 
                        
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 pq
                              
                              
                                 ij
                              
                           
                        
                      are internally node-disjoint with two-edge chains that link i and j (which are represented by their central nodes). In short, all that is missing to model R-robust 3-clubs is a set of variables to identify each chain with three edges that links pairs of nodes i and j, linked by an edge in G.

For each pair of nodes i and j adjacent in G, let us define variables

Conditions (37) and (38) impose that each pair of nodes must be linked by at least R selected chains with at most three edges. Conditions (39)–(41) impose that all nodes in selected chains that link adjacent nodes are included in the solution and that these chains are internally node-disjoint.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have presented a comparative study of the LP relaxations of integer formulations for the k-club problem. The comparisons involved models known from the literature and three new models. Some models are valid for any k
                     >1 whereas some other were designed for the case k
                     =3.

For the case k
                     =3, the connections among all these formulations are synthesised in Fig. 5
                     . For generic formulations [F_∗] and [F_•], [F_∗] → [F_•] means that the LP relaxation of [F_∗] is stronger than the LP relaxation of [F_•], and [F_∗]↔[F_•] means that [F_∗] and [F_•] are LP-equivalent. Thick arrows represent the relations derived in this study and thin arrows represent relations derived in Almeida and Carvalho (2012). A dashed line between [F_∗] and [F_•] means that there is no relation between their LP relaxations.

For k
                     =4, we showed that [F_R]LP is not stronger than [F_C]LP.

Based on the insight obtained by comparing [F_EC] and [F_R] for k
                     =3, we devised [F_ER] for the k-club problem and showed that it dominates [F_R], for any k
                     >1. In addition, we have derived a formulation for the maximum R-robust 3-club problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formulation in the literature for the maximum R-robust 3-club problem.
