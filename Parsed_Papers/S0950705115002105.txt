                  Q-matrix is the intermediary between attribute mastery patterns and responses in cognitive diagnostic assessment; therefore, Q-matrix plays a very important role in the assessment. Currently, lacking of reliable method of inferring and validating the expert-specified Q-matrix is the main problem. Based on the algorithm of Liu et al. (2012), three modified algorithms are proposed. There are two major differences between the algorithm of Liu et al. and the modified algorithms, one is to modify the item parameters from fixed to unfixed, the other is to use an “incremental” Q-matrix estimation, which some items named as “base items” have been correctly prespecified, others (or called as new items or raw items whose attributes have not been specified) need to be specified. The modified algorithms “incrementally” add new items to the “base items” one by one, estimate the item parameters and Q-matrix jointly, rather than estimate all of the items simultaneously which would bring more “noise” to affect the accuracy of estimation. Simulation studies showed that the modified algorithms could get satisfactory results, and the empirical study showed that the proposed algorithms could offer useful information about the Q-matrix specification.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Based on responses, cognitive diagnostic assessment (CDA) infers the attribute mastery patterns (AMPs) of examinees by means of cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) [1,2]. However, the responses are observable while the AMPs are potentially and unobservable. In the diagnostic process, the Q-matrix plays an important role in test development in that it embodies the attribute blueprint or cognitive specifications for test construction [3]. Many CDMs were built around the Q-matrix, such as DINA (Deterministic Input Noisy “AND” gate) model [4,5], DINO (Deterministic Input Noisy “OR” gate) model [6], NIDA (Noisy Input Deterministic output “AND” gate) model [7], RSM (Rule Space Model) model [8–10], AHM (Attribute Hierarchy Method) model [3,11], G-DINA (generalized deterministic inputs, noisy “and” gate) model [12] (de la Torre, 20011), etc. An integrative review about some important CDMs can be found in the book wrote by Rupp, Templin and Henson [13], and the book contains a comprehensive summary of many classical CDMs and their recent developments.

Typically, Q-matrix is specified by field experts based on their experiences and domain knowledge. However, due to the different experience of experts, as well as the differences of their awareness and understanding towards an identical test knowledge, the built Q-matrixes are not exactly the same and usually there are disagreements. Until today, the Q-matrix of the famous “fraction Subtraction data” [14] is still highly controversial [15,16]. Some researchers have conducted extensive studies on Q-matrix theory. A successful skills diagnosis critically depends on high quality Q-matrix development [17]. Having a correctly specified Q-matrix is crucial for parameter estimation and for the identification of underlying attributes of examinees [18], and a misspecified Q-matrix may lead to substantial lack of fit and, consequently, erroneous attribute identification [18,19].

In this case, it is imperative to study more efficient and objective methods to specify the Q-matrix, because Q-matrix will seriously hamper the implementation of CDA in large-scale and affect the validity. Unfortunately, this area has not attracted enough attention and only a few studies such as de la Torre [26] proposed an empirical method to validate the Q-matrix, and the method needs to set a cut point to determine the appropriate item-vector, but this may be a problem in real conditions; DeCarlo [15,16] recognized the uncertainty in the Q-matrix via a Bayesian extension of the DINA model, and his method can be used to validate the partial elements of item-vectors, not the whole item vector; Liu et al. [19,20] proposed a Q-matrix inference algorithm, put forward the relevant theoretical foundation and inferred the Q-matrix from responses. Liu et al. algorithm is an objective definition approach of Q-matrix. On the one hand, the algorithm of Liu et al. [19,20] was based on a good initial Q matrix, on the other hand, it also needed to know item parameters at advance, and its application was limited by these two assumptions. Chiu [21] introduced a Q-matrix refinement method based on the nonparametric classification method (namely based on hamming distance), and Chiu’s method relied heavily on item numbers as well as the test blueprint; Huo and de la Torre [22] was targeted to extend the δ2-based method to derive the Q-matrix of the subsequent test form, and this method also needed to set a cut point to determine the appropriate item-vector; Xiang [23] considered the elements of Q-matrix as continuous variables and studied a nonlinear penalized estimation of Q-matrix, and then set a cut point to convert to 0 and 1. Relative to the method of Liu et al., Xiang’s estimation method has no advantages in terms of accuracy. Chung [24] estimated the Q-matrix for cognitive diagnosis models in a Bayesian framework, and Chung’s method was an exploratory method. From other perspectives, such as mathematics and biology, Xiang et al. [25] considered the Markov chain inversion approach to identify the Q-matrix (transition rates of ion channels), but their method could not be applied to CDA.

The algorithm of Liu et al. assumed that there was already a prespecified Q-matrix at hand, which might have a few errors such as 3 error-specified items in all the 20 items, while the remaining 17 items were correctly specified. Liu et al. [19] considered when the attributes numbers were 3, 4 and 5, the fixed item parameters (slip and guessing parameter) was 0.2, 3 error items in all the 20 items, the algorithm had a high probability to recover the correct Q-matrix, when the number of examinee was 2000 or more, the successful recovery rate was 100%, when the number was 1000, the successful recovery rate was greater than 98%, even if the number was 500, the algorithm was also very likely to recover the correct Q-matrix.

On the one hand, the algorithm of Liu et al. considers item parameters as fixed values and this assumption may not hold in practice. Therefore, the authors in this article consider modifying the algorithm of Liu et al., removing the assumption and estimating item parameters and Q-matrix simultaneously, so that the modified algorithms are more suitable for practical applications; on the other hand, the algorithm of Liu et al. assumes that most of the items in the prespecified Q-matrix have been correctly defined, which also may limit the application of the algorithm. Therefore, based on the algorithm of Liu et al., this study considers only a few items (notates as

                     ) are correctly defined, and more items (notates as

This article is organized as follows: the section of theoretical background is a presentation of the notation, estimation procedures and the corresponding algorithms. The section on simulation includes simulation studies to assess the performance of the proposed estimation methods. The empirical study is conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm based on “fraction subtraction data”. Some discussions are given in the last section.

Suppose a situation that N examinees are participating in a CDA consisting of J items and K attributes. The paper is based on DINA model and the algorithm of Liu et al. It may be noticed that the proposed algorithms are in fact generic in the sense that it is implementable to a large class of CDMs besides the DINA model. The concepts concerned, DINA model and Liu et al. algorithm are introduced first, and the notations and representations remain the same as those in the paper of Liu et al. [19] for the convenience of readers.

Attribute: In CDA, the attribute usually refers to knowledge, skill or trait required to solve the item or problem correctly and it is a fine-grained description of knowledge mastery status.

T-matrix: Liu et al. [19] introduced the T-matrix to infer the Q-matrix from response data. The T-matrix is central to the construction of the estimator, and it describes the relationship between item response distribution and AMPs’ distribution. For more detailed description, please see Liu et al. [19]. We only provide an illustrate example to introduce the process of constructing a T-matrix.

                               will affect the recovery ratio. Generally, most of the items in

                               are correctly specified and only a few items are error-specified. If

                               contains too much error-specified items, the successful recovery ratio will decline quickly.

Due to the drawback of the algorithm 1, if only a few items are correctly specified or only the specification of a small part of items are certain, consider modifying the algorithm 1 and adopting an incrementally joint estimation of item parameters and Q-matrix.

Suppose there are only a few correctly specified items, and name these items as “base items” (notated as

                        ) and those items need to be specified or defined as “raw items” (notated as

                           Remark 2
                           In algorithm 2, the number of the “base items” will affect the recovery ratio, especially when the number of examinees is small or moderate. When the number of “base items” and “examinees” are small, the inference Q-matrix may still contains a few error-specified items, if algorithm 1 is used to estimate the Q-matrix which is inferred by algorithm 2, the successful recovery ratio would be increased.

Algorithm 3 is the same as algorithm 2 except for step (6) as follows:
                           
                              (1)
                              Use the Q-matrix inferred by algorithm 2 as the starting point of algorithm 3, and use algorithm 1 to estimate the Q-matrix, thus the output of step (6) is the estimated Q-matrix.


                        Fig. A.3 is the flow chart of Algorithm 3.
                           Remark 3
                           Relative to algorithm 2, algorithm 3 has one more step. When the number of “base items” or the number of examinees is small or moderate, the Q-matrix inferred by algorithm 2 will not be the same as the correct Q-matrix and it may contains several error-specified items. In this situation, using algorithm1 to estimate the overall items can improve the performance of algorithm 2.

To evaluate the viability of the three algorithms systematically, and investigate the performance of the proposed algorithms, a simulation study is considered. The data are generated based on DINA model under different settings and a comparison is conducted between the estimated Q-matrix and the correct Q-matrix.

Using the same method of Liu et al. [19] to generate data is considered, four 20-item Q-matrix (3,4 5 and 6 attributes for each), the slip parameters and guessing parameters are drawn from an uniform distribution, where the interval is [0.05,0.25]. In addition, the attributes are generated from a uniform distribution for the population of examinees, that is

                        =500, 1000, 2000 and 4000, 100 data sets are generated under such a setting. To examine the impact on the robustness of the joint algorithm by different numbers of error items, considers 3, 4 and 5 error-specified items out of the total 20 items. For each of the error-specified items, the corresponding row of Q-matrix is sampled uniformly from all the possible K dimensional binary vectors excluding the true vector and the zero vector, namely each of these rows is a uniform sample of

                        . For the case shown in Fig. 1, the algorithm just missed the true Q-matrix by one entry; for the case in Fig. 2, the algorithm in fact passes the correct Q-matrix and moves to another one. Both cases indicate that the true Q-matrix does not minimize the objective function 
                           
                              S

It can be seen from Table 1, Figs. 2 and 3
                        , to get the estimated Q matrix always correct, that the sample size of the joint estimation algorithm needs to be greater than 500 when the attributes number is 5. The Q-matrix estimated by the algorithm may not be able to reach the correct Q-matrix (Fig. 2), or pass the true Q-matrix and move to another one (Fig. 3), and the algorithm does not identify the Q-matrix successfully. Therefore, in both cases, it is effective to increase the number of examinees. Liu et al. [19] proposed an early stopping rule which is a subjective strategy, and examining more objective stopping strategy is needed.

The results of algorithm 2 are given in Tables 2 and 3

Based on the data of Tables 2–5, both the SRR of incrementally joint estimation algorithm (algorithm 2) and the modified incrementally joint estimation algorithm (algorithm 3) are better than the joint estimation algorithm (algorithm 1). When examinees is 500, “base items” is 15, the algorithm 2 and algorithm 3 can 100% recover the correct Q matrix,

                        , while algorithm 3 requires only 8 “base items”. To

                        , its SRR has a certain degree of decline relative to other three Q matrixes.

It also can be seen that it is important to conduct an overall estimation after the incrementally joint estimation, especially when the “base items” or “the number of examinees” is small or moderate. The reason is that the estimated Q matrix based on incrementally joint algorithm may slightly differ from the correct Q matrix. Using the joint estimation algorithm to refine the Q matrix will get the correct Q matrix with a high probability.

                        , three “base items”, 500 examinees, the SRR of algorithm 2 is very low, but the SRR of algorithm 3 is 85%.

As can be seen from Fig. 4, consider

                        , the algorithm 3 has a high probability (above 90%) to recover the correct Q matrix as long as the number of examinees reach 1000 or more, even if the “base items” number is 3. If the number of examinees is 500, the SRR can reach over 90% as long as the “base items” number is 4 or more. Fig. 4 shows that when using algorithm 3, if the number of “base items” reaching 5 or more, 500 examinees is enough to correctly estimate the Q matrix.

As can be seen from Figs. 5–7, the algorithm 3 has a 100% probability to recover the correct Q matrix when the “base items” number reaches 8 or more, regardless the number of examinees. Figs. 5 and 6 also show that when the number of attributes is 4 or 5, and five “base items”, the SRR of algorithm 3 is less than 90% even if the examinees reach 4000, and these results indicate that when the number of attributes is 4 or 5, comparing to the examinees number, “base items” number will play a more important role. Fig. 7 shows that the SRR of

                         has a certain degree of decline relative to other Q matrixes.

                         are the executing times of the algorithms. It should be noted that all the time are the average time of the successful estimation. The results shows that: (1) the algorithm 1 has less executing time relative to the algorithm 2 and algorithm 3; (2) the algorithm 3 needs more time than the other two algorithms, and this is because the algorithm 3 is the combination of algorithm 1 and algorithm 2; (3) more attributes, more error items, or less base items will extend the executing time. The starting point of Algorithm 1 only contains less misspecifications, so algorithm 1 is the most time-efficiency method.

The data for this example represent a subset of the data originally described and used by Tatsuoka [14], and by de la Torre [12]. The data were responses from 536 middle school students to 11 fraction subtraction problems with the following four attributes: (1) performing basic fraction subtraction operation, (2) simplifying/reducing, (3) separating whole number from fraction, and (4) borrowing one from whole number to fraction. Table 9
                         gives the items used in this example, and the corresponding Q matrix.

The outputs of using the joint estimation algorithm to analyze the data are as follows. Only two items are suggested to be modified: item 1 and item 11. Table 10
                         only lists the different item vectors between before and after analysis.

Based on Table 10, the item 1 and item 11 are suggested to be modified. The difference between the original and suggested vector of item 1 is the attribute

                        , and this may due to the examinees simplifying the subtractor first then subtracting it from the minuend. The difference between the original and suggested vector of item 11 is the attribute

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Based on the algorithm of Liu et al., this article proposed three modified algorithms. The modified algorithms can estimate item parameters, Q-matrix and examinees’ attributes simultaneously. Under three different situations: (1)Only a few error specified items in the prespecified Q-matrix, when the attributes number is 3 or 4, the prespecified Q-matrix contains a few error specified items (such as 3 or 4 error specified item in 20 items), even if the examinees number is small (such as 500), the algorithm 1 has a high SRR (around 95%) to recover the correct Q-matrix; if the attributes number is 5 or 6, the algorithm 1 requires 1000 examinees or more to get a high probability to recover the correct Q-matrix. (2) Only a few correctly specified items in the prespecified Q-matrix or some “new items” need to be specified. When most of the items are error specified or unspecified (“raw items”), using algorithm 1 may has a low SRR because of importing too much “noise”. The algorithm 2 adopts an incremental estimation and estimates one item each time based on the “base items”, and this makes full use of the information currently available. With the algorithm going on, there would be more items to be specified till the end. (3) Only a few correctly specified items, and the examinees number is small or moderate, then the application of algorithm 2 will get a low SRR because the estimated Q-matrix always slightly differ from the correct Q-matrix. Algorithm 3 is the combination of the algorithm 1 and algorithm 2. Use the algorithm 2 first to estimate all “raw items”, then select the output of algorithm 2 as the starting point, and use algorithm 1 to estimate the Q matrix. This will greatly increase the SRR, especially when the number of examinees and “base items” is small or moderate, such as 
                        
                           
                              
                                 Q
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                     , 500 examinees and 3 “base items”, the algorithm 3 has a high SRR 85%. If there are 5 “base items”, algorithm 3 has a 100% probability to recover the correct Q matrix.

The three algorithms are applicable for different situations respectively. If doubts exist for the definition of only a part of items but not the majority of the items, the algorithm 1 can be chosen; On the other hand, If doubts exist for the definition of the majority of the items but not just a small part of items, or calibration is required for some “raw items”, the algorithm 2 or algorithm 3 may be chosen. Certainly, this algorithm selection strategy can be used with great flexibility, it is absolutely determined by the practical settings.

No matter whether item parameters are known, regardless of the number of examinees and “base items”, the modified joint estimation algorithms can recover the correct Q-matrix with a high probability, which would improves the feasibility of the algorithms in practice. However, the algorithms also present certain disadvantages: the first is that the prespecified Q-matrix must be ensured that it contains only a small part of error specified items or “base items” must be correctly specified. The measures to ensure the correctness of “base items” require further studies, and a practical way is the cooperation of different disciplines, field experts and statistician, etc.; the second is that the number of attributes is predetermined, how about the performance of the algorithms when the number of attributes is error, this means the prespecified Q-matrix may contain redundant attributes or lack of required attributes. Whether the algorithms will recover the correct Q-matrix or provide reliable information also requires further studies. Thirdly, extending the algorithms to many other cognitive diagnosis model also requires further studies. Multi-strategy is another important field, and the assumption that the examinees only use one strategy throughout the test is a precondition in this paper. Deep researches should base on multi-strategy situation. Finally, the aforementioned outputs were mainly based on simulation studies, and it should extend the algorithms to more real applications under more complex conditions, such as different attribute distributions and more complex Q matrixes (more items or more attributes in it).
