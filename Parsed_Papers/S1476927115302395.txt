                  As predominant component in the venom of many dangerous animal species, toxins have been thoroughly investigated for drug design or as pharmacologic tools. The present study demonstrated the use of size and hydrophobicity of amino acid residues for the purposes of quantifying the valuable sequence–structure relationship and performing further analysis of interactional mechanisms in secondary structure elements (SSEs) for toxin native conformations. First, we showed that the presence of large and hydrophobic residues varying in availability in the primary sequences correspondingly affects the amount of these residues being used in the SSEs in accordance with linear behavioral patterns from empirical assessments of experimentally derived toxins and non-toxins. Subsequent derivation of prediction rules was established with the aim of analyzing molecular structures and mechanisms by means of 114 residue compositions for venom toxins. The obtained results concerning the linear behavioral patterns demonstrated the nature of the information transfer occurring from the primary to secondary structures. A dual action mechanism was established, taking into account steric and hydrophobic interactions. Finally, a new residue composition prediction method for SSEs of toxins was suggested.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Toxins are proteins that predominantly constitute the venom of dangerous animals, such as snakes, scorpions, spiders, cone snails, sea anemones, insects and fish (Rash and Hodgson, 2002). Venom is strategically used when performing predation and defense, and often results in high morbidity and mortality rates, which have been reported as a serious hazard to public health in many countries (Ushanandini et al., 2006). Therefore, toxins have been actively investigated in basic research (Nagaraju et al., 2006; Whetstone and Hammock, 2007) as pharmacological and diagnostic tools (Harvey, 2002), templates for drug design, and therapeutic agent candidates, thereby transforming toxicity into profit. Animal toxins vary exceedingly in terms of their ability to endamage preys and threats due to diversified biological effects arising from the actions of venom (Cologna et al., 2009; Dokmetjian et al., 2009). These effects can include hemorrhagic, myotoxic, neurotoxic, hemolytic and proteolytic activities. For example, neurotoxic activity drastically influences neural transmission, and significantly alters muscular contraction and relaxation, respiration and cardiac function, which can have a potentially fatal effect on a prey or threat.

Multiple covalent disulfide bridges (Kong et al., 2004) formed by means of sequential distant cysteine residues (Matsunaga et al., 2009) strengthen native-state structures in toxins (or toxic proteins) (Redfern et al., 2008) as well as diminish macromolecule susceptibility to enzymatic digestion (Nayak et al., 1999), so that only a few toxic proteins without such bridges have been isolated and characterized in some breeds, e.g., scorpions (Zeng et al., 2005). In terms of function, toxins work as cell modulators through recognition and selective binding to ion channels (mainly calcium, chloride, potassium, and sodium) and membrane receptors (Restrepo-Angulo et al., 2010). In the case of ion channels (Gabashvili et al., 2007), toxins target these channels by blocking them, enhancing or decreasing their opening, preventing or slowing their inactivation, and modifying gating (electrophysiology). Thus, toxins affect various kinds of cells, alter fundamental physiological processes, and subsequently inflict severe biological effects (Cologna et al., 2009; Dokmetjian et al., 2009).

Functional native configurations of toxins and non-toxins (or other proteins that are not labeled as toxins) have secondary structure elements (SSEs) as underlying constituents, mainly α-helices and β-pleated sheets formed by strands. They are commonly divided into four classes: mostly α; mostly β; mixed α and β; and few secondary structures (Orengo et al., 1997). The process for predicting SSEs from the primary sequence isvery challenging. It has been thoroughly investigated using different approaches and specific details regarding the molecular forces stabilizing secondary structures and, significantly improving the process. However, the performance of prediction methods is still dependent on some peculiar features of the water-soluble and transmembrane proteins (Majorek et al., 2009). Another issue is related to secondary structural classes, where better predictive analyses usually occur for α classes (Gromiha and Selvaraj, 2004). Therefore, the greatest challenge should be to improve the prediction accuracy for β and mixed classes (Midic et al., 2007; Best and Mittal, 2010) of the interspersed α/β or segregated α+β forms (Lindström et al., 2009).

Size (steric hindrance) and hydrophobicity (hydrophobic clustering) are considered to be universal and common attributes of residues in toxins and non-toxins. These two attributes have long been recognized as the indispensable and primary determinants of the native folded state (Chothia, 1984; Ramachandran and Sasisekharan, 1968), and both were examined here. Excluded volume or steric interactions comprise the main factor involved in biomolecular structural organization (Richards, 1977), SSE packing (Jiang et al., 2003) and molecular interplays (Halperin et al., 2002). Computational simulations (Rocha et al., 2009), statistical analyses of known macromolecular conformations (Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1996) and structure prediction methods (Zhang et al., 1998) point to the fact that hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions are very important and represent valuable driving forces required to maintain biological folding and stability.

In the present study, first we demonstrated five linear relations between the availabilities of large and hydrophobic residues by means of primary structures and how these residues can be employed by SSEs in the functional conformations of small toxins and non-toxins. Next, we performed an analysis of molecular structures and mechanisms in toxins through direct comparison of real and predicted residue compositions, which we surmised would reveal complementary (or predominant) contributions of residue size and hydrophobicity in 80% (or 20%) of SSEs. In order to carry out proper analysis a purely empirical approach was used, taking into account sequence and structure data extracted from experimentally determined macromolecules. A mathematical formulation utilizing representative measures of primary, secondary and tertiary structures, as well as computational algorithms allowing automatic processing of our sample choice, empirical approach and mathematical formulation, were employed during the investigation.

The native macromolecules in our dataset were obtained from a special set containing toxins and non-toxins. However, many elusive and redundant macromolecules are already deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000). Thus, we defined the following criteria and restrictions: primary structure consisting solely of natural amino acids (among the 20 genetically encoded types); complete information provided regarding whole residue sequences and secondary structures; and use of unrelated proteins having either different residue sequences (pairwise sequence identity below 25%) or SSEs with at least four different residues.

Several chain extensions were initially investigated, taking into account the above restraint conditions, which resulted in choosing the 35-residue proteins for analysis. This extension allowed maximization of the quantity of exemplars; of 39 proteins, 8 were toxins and 31 were non-toxins (for more details about these toxins, see Table S1a in Supplementary materials). Furthermore, our dataset also included all the toxins with 36–40 residues that are currently available in the PDB archives and under the conditions above, totaling 32 toxins.

In addition to being of remarkably diverse origins, our 71 unrelated toxin and non-toxin chains exhibited diverse biological roles and were present in several subcellular locations, as well as being involved in many biochemical processes. For instance, in humans the 35-residue non-toxins 1PB5, 1ZWD, 2ODB, 2OV2 were classified as signaling, hormone, binding and transferase, respectively.

We selected and used various proteins with diversified sequences and structures that were in compliance with the selection criteria above, since the present research was based on two omnipresent and common attributes of residues, size or volume and hydrophobicity, which operate in various environmental circumstances and sustain specialized biological functions. Twenty natural amino acids were simplified according to their sizes (and hydrophobicities) by means of reduced binary codification, denoted as Large/Small, or LS (Zamyatnin, 1984), and Hydrophobic/Polar was denoted as HP (Nozaki and Tanford, 1971; Fauchere and Pliska, 1983). The amino acids were considered large if above an arbitrary apparent molar volume of 129Å3 (Glu), and hydrophobic was defined as a hydrophobicity index above 0.18kcal/mol (His). From the smallest to largest in terms of size (with HP codes in parentheses), small amino acids were presented as follows: Gly (P), Ser (P), Ala (H), Cys (H), Asp (P), Thr (H), Asn (P), Pro (H); and the large ones were presented in a similar manner: Glu (P), Val (H), Gln (P), His (H), Met (H), Leu (H), Ile (H), Lys (P), Phe (H), Tyr (H), Arg (P), Trp (H).

While analyzing 35-residue proteins, we observed low sequence similarity and an extensive number of large or bulky residues, denoted as n
                        L and varying from 6 (1Y03 and 1Y04) to 30 (1QP6). Hydrophobic or carbon-rich residues, denoted as n
                        H, ranged from 13 (1QP6, 1SSE) to 29 (1SPF); n
                        L was observed to have more widespread values than n
                        H. All the relevant data concerning the primary sequence for every protein is provided in terms of its total number n
                        i, with the subscript term i referring to large (L) and hydrophobic (H) residues observed in primary or secondary structures; thus, i={L, H}. Therefore, the toxins and non-toxins were labeled according to their n
                        i. For instance, the non-toxins owning strands are: 1E4R (with n
                        L
                        =17, n
                        H
                        =18); 1WO9 (10, 21); 2ODB (21, 18) and 2OV2 (23, 17).

The toxins and non-toxins have regular SSEs (cylindrical helices and extended strands) with overall lengths L
                        j, and real compositions t
                        i,j of large and hydrophobic residues leading to the percentage fractions p

                        i,j can range from zero, in the case of SSEs (L
                        j
                        >5) having no large and hydrophobic residues, to 100.0%, in a case of only these residues being present. The subscript index j is related to helices (h) or strands (e), so that j={h, e}.

The values of L
                        j and those of real t
                        i,j in three-dimensional native conformations were taken from PROMOTIF at the PDBsum database (Laskowski et al., 2005). All very short SSEs (L
                        j
                        ≤5) were reassigned as coil (Eisenhaber et al., 1996) and, thus, they were not considered. For toxins, we compared the real and predicted compositions (Δt
                        i,j) of large and hydrophobic residues in the SSEs using the following calculations:

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The proteins analyzed exhibited quite diversified primary (n
                        i and disulfide bridges), secondary (L
                        j, t
                        i,j, p
                        i,j, Δt
                        i,j) and tertiary (R
                        G) structures, diverse biological activities, and striking structural dissimilarities between toxins and non-toxins (Fig. 1
                        ).

Among 39 PDB proteins, 8 toxins had more limited amounts of large residues n
                        L, ranging between 12 and 19. They represented cysteine-rich macromolecules with disulfide cross-linkages (Fig. 1a), which are typically required in secreted proteins that act in an extracellular milieu. They owned shorter helices (Fig. 1b), and many helices together with strands (Fig. 1b,c). These toxins were also among the more tightly packed ones, having small R
                        G (Fig. 1d). On the other hand, the non-toxins were present in greater quantities along with 31 exemplars, had more widespread numbers of large residues and longer helices and strands, and possessed more diversified compactness (8.0Å≲
                        R
                        G
                        ≲16.0Å). Accordingly, non-toxins were considered as a reference while attempting to investigate the relationship between primary and secondary structures. These four measures (Fig. 1a–d) revealed configurational diversities and were fundamental to the universality and accuracy of the results demonstrated below.

In order to determine the nature of the information transfer from the primary sequence to specific SSEs, the 35-residue toxins and non-toxins were inspected via their fractions p
                        i,j of large and hydrophobic residues with regard to the numbers n
                        i of these residues for a set of 80 points on the scatter plots. Fig. 2
                         demonstrates that non-toxinsshowed values for p
                        i,j vs. n
                        i adjusted in a linear way, and only p
                        H,e values were adjusted with straight lines for both toxins and non-toxins. The straight line equations are as follows:
                           
                              (4)
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       p
                                       
                                          i
                                          ,
                                          j
                                       
                                    
                                    =
                                    m
                                    
                                       n
                                       i
                                    
                                    +
                                    b
                                 
                              
                           
                        where m and b are the angular and linear coefficients, whose values are specific for each p
                        i,j (Eqs. (5)–(9) in Fig. 2).

First, analysis of just the non-toxins and their Eqs. (5)–(8), shown in Fig. 2, showed that the spiral helices effectively employed the size and hydrophobicity of the available amino acid residues in primary structures, as demonstrated by the upward-sloping straight lines (Eqs. (5) and (7)) and high coefficients of correlation denoted as R . The extended strands functioned in a manner similar to that of the helical structures, but only for residue sizes (Eq. (6)), because hydrophobicity (Eq. (8)) was almost constant at an appropriated value of p
                        H,e of 55%. The sloping straight lines (Eqs. (5)–(7)) showed that as more large/hydrophobic residues were being disposed by primary sequences, more were also being employed by the SSEs. Line close to horizontal (Eq. (8)) indicates a suitable value of p
                        H,e which was fairly insensitive to accessible n
                        H. The sequence–structure relationship (Eqs. (5)–(8)) also proved to be quite efficient, direct, and it was essential that it be taken into account in order to properly modulate the formation and maintenance of the SSEs.

The template non-toxins usually showed residue stereochemical attributes (size and hydrophobicity) acting concurrently and having a twofold effective mechanism with both points (p
                        L,j and p
                        H,j) being concentrated around the regression lines for helices and strands. However, in some cases one attribute prevailed over the other due to its single effective mechanism, such as the underlined protein 1PXQ, that is, the farthest point from the straight line at p
                        L,h (Eq. (5)). In these cases, the protein instantly utilized a compensatory resource with a value p
                        H,h located very close to its line (Eq. (7)), as indicated by an arrow. A similar argument can be applied to all non-toxins farthest from the straight lines in three other graphs.

Still for the non-toxin subset, two remarkable features of primary and secondary structures were observed: (1) there were differences in the point arrangements that were dependent on the availability of the residue types, since large residues dominated on the right with values of n
                        L exceeding 18 when compared with hydrophobic residues, which were rather predominant on the left with n
                        H being less than 22; and (2) degenerate and approximate fractions p
                        i,j were associated with the same value of n
                        i, e.g., five near values of p
                        L,h (non-toxins 1IIJ, 1KD8A, 1KD8B, 1SPF, 1ZWD), when the value of n
                        L was equal to 27. These two features with regard to variables n
                        i and p
                        i,j allowed the use of these variables for the following purposes: to measure information transfer from the primary sequences to the SSEs; to express Eqs. (5)–(8) in a more precise manner due to the diversified point distributions; and to disclose specific and strategic employment of both residue attributes from the primary to secondary structures.

The relationships between p
                        i,j and n
                        i (Eqs. (5)–(9), Fig. 2) revealed that the linear behavioral patterns for native helices and strands resembled a twofold mechanism originating for most of the proteins, or in some cases showed a single mechanism, such as the underlined toxins 1C49 and 1ROO and the non-toxin 1PXQ at p
                        i,h (Eqs. (5) and (7)). The hydrophobic residues in strands (p
                        H,e) acted differently in two macromolecular subsets, mainly because the non-toxin strands utilized an almost horizontal straight line (Eq. (8)) and the toxin strands employed a line with an upward slope from left to right (Eq. (9)). The difference between both equations p
                        H,e was similarly observed with regard to the degree of chain compactness, measured by the radius of gyration R
                        G (Fig. 1d), inasmuch as four non-toxins with strands were more loosely wrapped (1E4R, 1WO9, 2ODB, 2OV2, with R
                        G equal to 9.3, 11.3, 14.9, 15.0Å, respectively) and the toxins had compact globular chains from 1SIS (R
                        G
                        =8.2Å) to 1LMR, 9.1Å.

Although we dealt with limited amounts of structural data provided for p
                        i,j vs. n
                        i, the mathematical formulae (Eqs. (5)–(9)) were validated in two ways. First, we employed subgroups of 35-residue proteins in similar experiments, such as crossing validation tests of statistical methods (Efron et al., 2004). For example, in data points for three subgroups consisting of 31 (non-toxins in Fig. 2), 39 (together our 31 non-toxins and eight toxins) and 55 (our 39 [non-]toxins taken together with another 16 proteins possessing posttranslational modifications), we respectively found approximate helix equations whose angular coefficients m (Eq. (5)) were equal to 2.6, 2.4, and 2.5, and m (Eq. (7)) were equal to 3.2, 3.2, and 3.2. Similarly, for strand equations, the coefficients m (Eq. (6)) were equal to 2.3, 2.3, and 2.6. Second, our Eqs. (5)–(9) were revalidated and the dual mechanism was measured more effectively and judged, based on precise stereochemical predictions for all the toxins extracted from 35 to 40 residues, as described in two subsections below.

As for the associative analysis performed in relation to p
                        i,j and n
                        i, the residue sizes and hydrophobicities seemed to contribute differently, as can be seen from the values of the angular and linear coefficients (m and b), considering that in p
                        L,j both straight lines were less sloped (with m
                        ≈2.5 and b positive, Eqs. (5)–(6)) than in p
                        H,j with m
                        ≈4.0 and b negative (Eqs. (7) and (9)). The strategic availability of the large and hydrophobic residues from the primary structures and their subtle and specific uses in the SSEs (by the linear behavior Eqs. (5)–(9)) highlight the direct and simple occurrence of information transfer between protein structures. Linear behavior is not as challenging as nonlinear behavioral patterns, which include exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric and power regressions. In contrast to linear relations, nonlinear equations often consist of a set of parameters and are dependent on one or more independent variables. Therefore, many feasible nonlinear fittings can be made when describing disposable data.

Thus far we have discussed linear behavioral patterns between p
                        i,j and n
                        i for non-toxins, and demonstrated their equivalence (Eqs. (5)–(7)) and divergence (Eqs. (8)–(9)) with toxins. It is now important to perform further research and derive the prediction rules for structure and mechanism surveys in toxins based on these behavioral patterns. This can be done through estimation of the most probable amount (or predicted t
                        i,j) of large and hydrophobic residues in SSEs from p
                        i,j (Eqs. (1) and (4)) as follows:

In a case of known numbers n
                        i and lengths L
                        j, we were able to predict the compositions of large and hydrophobic residues in tubular helices and strands of flat β-sheets by means of t
                        i,j (Eq. (10)), and then compare the predicted compositions with their real or exact values for toxins (Table 2
                        ) by using the Δt
                        i,j (Eq. (2)). Specifically, for predicted t
                        H,e, a self-prediction process should be employed from Eq. (9), based on the linear behavioral patterns of the p
                        H,e according to Eqs. (9) (and (8)), which are unlike to appear in the toxin (and non-toxin) subsets.

We can substantiate that the residue sizes in 35-residue toxins (Table 2) usually acted in a manner concurrent with the hydrophobicities via a twofold mechanism, whereas Δt
                        L,j and Δt
                        H,j
                        ≤1.5 appeared concomitantly in 20 compositions Δt
                        i,j for 10 (three helical (Table 2a) and all seven strand (Table 2b) structures) out of 12 SSEs. At times, one residue attribute prevailed over the other by a single mechanism presented here withhydrophobicity actively dominating in the helices of the underlined toxins 1C49 and 1ROO with just Δt
                        H,h
                        ≤1.5 in Table 2a.

Helices of 1C49 and 1ROO employed a single mechanism with dominating hydrophobicity (Δt
                        H,h
                        ≤1.5), which had some peculiar configurational or functional features, due to the steric or volumetric attributes of the residues in the native conformations. Two members of the Charybdotoxin family 1C49 (and 2PTA) showed bad (and good) values of t
                        L,h, probably due to subtle configurational details and because of a significant difference in 1C49 when compared with 2PTA in terms of a natural point mutation in the N-terminus region of a helix in the 7th residue with Glu7 (large, in 1C49) and Pro7 (small, in 2PTA). In addition, 1C49 had two large and one small residues (Lys8, Gln9 and Cys10) on the C-terminus side of Glu7 showing many Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) correlations, which were not discovered in 2PTA (Klenk et al., 2000). As a consequence, there was an altered helical configuration with 310-helix in 1C49, and 2PTA had a α-helix. Insufficiently or badly estimated t
                        L,h (>1.5) can be related to functional aspects in 1ROO due to many large residues (mainly Arg and Lys) being transferred from the primary sequence to the helices, which represented essential residues for binding to voltage-gated potassium channels, and thereby caused 1ROO to act as a channel blocker (Tudor et al., 1996).

The same procedures that were adopted for the SSEs of 35-residue toxins, were extended to 32 toxins with 36, 37, 38, 39 and 40 residues in 23 venomous organisms. For more detailed information on these toxins, see Table S1b in Supplementary materials.

The 32 toxins in our benchmark dataset had 15, 15 and two toxins with two, one and no SSEs allowing, 45 SSEs formed by 19 helical and 26 strand structures. We were able to use the previous Eqs. (5)–(9) (Fig. 2) for the purpose of prediction by the Eq. (10) in bigger toxins for further investigation–in that case, for other toxins of N residues, the alteration of the slopes m, multiplying them by 35 together with the normalization of n
                        i factor from zero to one by dividing n
                        i by N, was sufficient. Initially, we made predictions of the composition for the large and hydrophobic residues in the helical structures, summarizing 38 values of Δt
                        i,h (Table 3
                        ).

Among 19 toxins with helix structures (Table 3), 13 employed a twofold mechanism through steric and hydrophobic attributes (both Δt
                        i,h
                        ≤1.5). The other six underlined toxins (1AGT, 1CHL, 1C56, 1ECI, 3HPW, 3ODV) benefited from only one residue attribute (just one Δt
                        i,h
                        ≤1.5), hydrophobicity, except for 1C56 with just Δt
                        L,h
                        ≤1.5.

When we examined the steric and hydrophobic interactions for 26 strand structures by analyzing 52 values of Δt
                        i,e (Table 4
                        ), we found that the protein strands in particular used the hydrophobic residues by means of a dual fraction p
                        H,e (Eqs. (8)–(9)) inside the prediction equation t
                        H,e (Eq. (10)), and we showed the best predictions utilizing both p
                        H,e for each t
                        H,e in Table 4.

Twenty-six toxins with strand structures (Table 4) often proceeded using a twofold mechanism (Δt
                        L,e and Δt
                        H,e
                        ≤1.5 in 21 toxins). Sometimes, the insufficient strength (Δt
                        L,e
                        >1.5) of the residue size was promptly compensated by excellent (Δt
                        H,e
                        ≤0.5) or good (0.5<Δt
                        H,e
                        ≤1.5) action of hydrophobicity in five underlined toxins (1CW6, 1J5J, 1KQI, 2K4U, 2M36).

In 12 out of 26 natural toxins with strands (1C56, 1DL0, 1HLY, 1KQI, 1MTX, 1M2S, 1QKY, 2H1Z, 2JP6, 2K9O, 2Z3S, 3ODV) (Table 4), the compositions t
                        H,e of hydrophobic residues could be predicted better by fractions p
                        H,e of less compact (Eq. (8)) instead of more compact (Eq. (9)) conformations. Thus, these toxins utilized a twofold (in 11 among 12 toxins) or single mechanism (at 1KQI) in lieu of a single or insufficient (whether used the Eq. (9)) mechanism. These toxins indicated that Eq. (8) was not exclusive of less compact conformations. The compositions t
                        H,e reinforced the selective, precise and nontrivial character by means of both linear relations (Eqs. (8) and (9)).

In summary, our 40 target toxins with 35–40 residues had 24 helical and 33 strand structures with 57 compositions Δt
                        L,j and Δt
                        H,j (Tables 2–4); a total of 44 were twofold mechanisms (Δt
                        L,j and Δt
                        H,j
                        ≤1.5 by 16 helices and 28 strands) and 13 were single mechanisms (just one Δt
                        i,j
                        ≤1.5 by eight helices and five strands). In the 13 toxins with just one Δt
                        i,j
                        ≤1.5, hydrophobicity was shown to be an essential ingredient in 12 cases (in just helices of 1C56 (Table 3) the residue size is more efficient). These cases clearly demonstrated the fundamental role of hydrophobic interactions in helices and strands of small globular toxins, as has been found for globular proteins in other research (Pace et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012; Lin and Zewail, 2012). The current empirical–mathematical–computational approach in the SSEs of toxins is being increasingly applied to additional toxins, toxin inhibitors, and toxin-like proteins (e.g., defensins, growth factors, several proteins from the innate immune systems, proteases and their inhibitors (Naamati et al., 2009)) resulting in very promising findings (Rocha, 2014).

The present article presents a thorough case (or non-statistical) study aiming to determine five straight line equations (from n
                     i to p
                     i,j, Fig. 2) for the purpose of identifying the nature of information transfers from primary to secondary structures in nativeconformations of (non-) toxins over 80 trials. The results also demonstrated the peculiarities of twofold and single mechanisms, thoroughly analyzed through 114 residue compositions (t
                     i,j and Δt
                     i,j, Tables 2–4), which are specific for each target toxin being examined. This article was based on four key features: empirical surveys completed for natural (non-) toxins; a mathematical formulation (Eqs. (1)–(10)) for the proteins; performance evaluations of the linear equations p
                     i,j, which were successfully validated by three-fold cross-validation-like testing and revalidated by means of right predictions Δt
                     i,j; and computational algorithms used to automate empirical surveys, mathematical formulation, and performance evaluations of p
                     i,j and Δt
                     i,j.

Performing quantitative analysis of the sequence–structure relationship (Eqs. (5)–(9)), we separately identified the specific contributions of residue size and hydrophobicity to secondary structure-based protein topologies, taking in account the fact that primary structures (n
                     i) include the necessary information for the SSEs (p
                     i,j) in the correct minimal-energy configurations. Our results indicate that hydrophobic residues are decisively distinctive in helices through simple linear behavior (p
                     H,h, Eq. (7)), and in strands through dual behavior (p
                     H,e, Eqs. (8) and (9)) for loosely and tightly compacted proteins. Decisive distinctions between helical and strand structures (analogous to p
                     H,h and p
                     H,e) have been recognized in other studies (Scheraga, 1973; Levitt and Chothia, 1976; Go and Taketomi, 1978; Frishman and Argos, 1996), and also favor more suitable understanding for α than β and mixed α-β classes (Gromiha and Selvaraj, 2004; Midic et al., 2007; Best and Mittal, 2010; Lindström et al., 2009) (see Section 1). Dual behavior of p
                     H,e might result from the presence of long-range interactions into hydrophobic interplays, and non-local hydrogen-bonds into strands forming flat β-sheets (Scheraga, 1973; Go and Taketomi, 1978; Israelachvili and Pashley, 1982). The connection between p
                     H,e and compactness seems to be consistent with the observation that, in general, packing by itself does not lead to SSE formation (Socci et al., 1994; Maritan et al., 2000), but can be capable of influencing the mechanisms and rates of the folding process (Tarragó et al., 2003; Galzitskaya et al., 2008).

About 80% of the SSEs (or 44 helices and strands) employed a twofold mechanism in the target toxins, with the other 20% of the SSEs having a predominance of residue size or hydrophobicity by a single mechanism. At the molecular level, such dual effective mechanism represents evidence for selective attributions of steric and hydrophobic interactions at vital moments in the formation, consolidation and maintenance of the SSEs. It also excludes occurrence of bad mechanisms (both Δt
                     i,j
                     >1.5) by the 114 stereochemical predictions Δt
                     i,j, as well as indicates that our predictions are quite revealing, taking into account the simplicity of the approach used and the conformational complexity of the protein chains assessed.

In the present study, we clearly established the research objectives, bases and prospects for a new composition prediction method for SSEs in order to objectively quantify steric and hydrophobic interactions, better understand the sequence–structure relationship, and distinguish molecular mechanisms, especially for venom toxins. In the future, we plan to implement a web server for this prediction method, and thus adding to other web resources (Kong et al., 2004; Naamati et al., 2009) that are currently available for analyses of toxins.
