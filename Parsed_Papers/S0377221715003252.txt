                  Risk prices are calculated as the certainty equivalents of risky assets, using a recently developed non-expected utility (non-EU) approach to quantitative risk assessment. The present formalism for the pricing of risk is computationally simple, realistic in the sense of behavioural economics and straightforward to apply in operational research and risk and decision analyses.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The intrinsic price of a risky asset of random monetary value X is the certainty equivalent cp
                      of the probability distribution p(X). The term “intrinsic” refers to risk quantification within a given accounting system rather than to risk prices extrinsically determined by the market for the asset. In the framework of utility theory, the certainty equivalent of a risk p is implicitly defined by the requirement

                                 ∈
                                 P
                                 ,
                              
                           
                        
                     where U is a real-valued utility functional defined on a space P of probability distributions and cp, cp
                      ∈ P, is the degenerate risk which gives the result X = cp
                      with certainty. In Eq. (1) and throughout this research note, we do not accordingly distinguish between real numbers x and degenerate probability distributions which give X = x with certainty. We also abbreviate p(X = x) as p(x), as is usual elsewhere.

Procedures to specify certainty equivalents are useful in theoretical and applied risk research. They can help to rank-order risk preferences in simple and consistent ways, to determine intrinsic risk prices in finance and insurance applications and to provide experimental tests of theories of utility (Becker, DeGroot, & Marschak, 1964; Farquhar, 1984; Denuit, Dhaene, Goovaerts, Kaas, & Laeven, 2006). But within the theoretical frameworks of EU and non-EU theory, they rarely admit explicit solutions of Eq. (1) for cp
                      (Denuit et al., 2006). Alternatively, to solve Eq. (1) for cp
                      by numerical approximation, the utility and probability weighting functions on which representations of U are typically based must often be determined empirically (for a compilation of the extensive literature, see van de Kuilen & Wakker, 2011) or chosen ad hoc as parametric functions (Stott, 2006) and then fitted to the experimental data. The latter step demands, in addition, considerable methodological effort (for review, see Abdellaoui, Bleichrodt, & L'Haridon, 2008). As for general methodological foundations, recent experimental results and reference to the literature on risk-pricing behaviour, see Blavatskyy and Köhler (2009, 2011).

In the following, Eq. (1) will be solved for cp
                      within a recently developed axiomatic framework of status quo dependent risky choice involving a non-EU utility functional U. U accommodates systematic violations of EU theory of various kinds observed in risky choice experiments (Geiger, 2008, 2012). It will be shown that cp
                      possesses an explicit representation solely involving the cumulative probabilities of gain and loss associated with p and a few exogenous parameters that are not related to p. This result will then be extended to utility preferences for multivariate risks. Applications to recent experimental results on risk pricing behaviour will also be indicated. The present formalism for the intrinsic pricing of risk may thus be of theoretical and practical use in wide areas of operational research and risk management.

We consider a convex set P of simple probability distributions p defined on a compact real interval I. A person's attitude towards a given risk p is assumed to be governed, besides by p, by his or her neutral reference point x
                     0, x
                     0 ∈ I, status quo risk s, s ∈ P, and relative persistence ε of p in the presence of s, that is, overall probability ε of Tp
                      > Ts
                     , where Tp
                      and Ts
                      are the uncertain times to resolution of p and s. Accordingly, ε(Tp
                      > Ts
                     ) generally varies with p for given status quo s.

                        1
                        The interpretation of ε as ε(Tp
                            > Ts
                           ) is as in Geiger (2012), but differs from that in Geiger (2002, 2008), where ε is defined as the complementary probability ε(Tp
                            ≤ Ts
                           ) obtained by substituting ε → 1 – ε. Our formal results remain unaffected by this change in denotation, but the present specification of ε is appropriate in applications as it gives the correct limiting behaviour of the utility function in the boundary cases ε = 0 and ε = 1 (Geiger 2012).
                      To avoid trivial cases, s is non-degenerate and involves at least some chance of gain s(x) > 0 for some x > x
                     0, x ∈ I, and some risk of loss s(x´) > 0 for some x´ < x
                     0, x´ ∈ I. In applications of the formalism, the parameters x
                     0, ε and s will normally be measurable or can be estimated with some confidence by standard statistical methods (status quo risk) and multivariate survival, or hazard rate, analysis (probability ε(Tp
                      > Ts
                     )). Without loss of generality, x
                     0 is normalised to x
                     0 = 0. As an option of choice, to stay in one's status quo (i.e., choose s given s) amounts to selecting the degenerate risk 0 given s, that is, adding nothing to s with certainty. Hence, cs
                      = 0. As for the axiomatic foundations and for more detailed explanations of the approach, see Geiger (2002, 2008).

To state the basic equations of utility preference for which Eq. (1) is to be solved, the following variables must be defined (Fig. 1
                     ): λp
                      = (1 – Fp
                     (0))/(1 – p(0)) and 1 – λp
                      respectively are the overall relative probabilities of gain and loss (Fp
                      is the cumulative distribution of p) so that p = p
                     +
                     λp
                      + p
                     –(1 – λp
                     ), where p
                     +(x) = p(x)/λp
                      and p
                     –(x)  0 for x > 0, p
                     –(x) = p(x)/(1 – λp
                     ) and p
                     +(x)  0 for x < 0, and p
                     +(0) = p
                     –(0) = p(0) if 0 < λp
                      < 1. If, on the other hand, λp
                      = 1 or λp
                      = 0, then p
                     ± = p, respectively. The expected gain (loss) is

                     where A(p) is a parameter-dependent elementary algebraic function (parameters ε, s; see Geiger, 2008, pp. 131–132). In Eq. (5), ε(Tp

                     ) is tacitly assumed. U and u are unique up to positive affine transformations of the utility scale. They are normalised to u(p, 0) = 0, u(p, –1) = –1, U(0) = 0 and U(–1) = –1. It is important to note that in Eq. (4) the assessment of p in terms of cumulative gains and losses is a consequence of the general principles underlying the approach, notably the assumption of a neutral reference point and an axiom of status quo dependence of risk preferences. As for the empirical significance of the cumulative probabilities of success and failure in risky choice, see Fennema and Wakker (1997), Payne (2005) and Diecidue and van de Ven (2008).

The dependence of u on x has been made explicit elsewhere. Here, it suffices to note that u(p, x) is everywhere smooth and strictly increasing in x so that cp
                      exists for all p ∈ P (Geiger, 2002, 2008). For a > 0, let Xa

The initial value of x
                     0 must be added to the right-hand side of Eq. (15) if our previous normalisation x

                     Eq. (15) is the intended result. The right-hand side of (15) does not explicitly depend on the utility function. Rather, cp

                     0 and s determining

                     + and pure risk p = p
                     –, in which cp
                      = μ;p
                     . If p persists while s resolves first with certainty (ε = 1), one has cp
                      =

                      is a linear function of λp
                      (EU limit; see Eqs. (13) and (14)). For λp

                     0 may not vanish. In particular, decision makers are risk averse (prone) towards p

                      > 0 (μs
                      < 0). Generally, risk aversion (proneness) prevails if f(

                     , λp
                     ) > 1). The example of Fig. 2(a) shows cp
                      as a function of μp
                      for a risk averse status quo, μs
                      > cs
                      = 0 and, consequently, 
                        
                           μ
                           p

                      = 0. It demonstrates that there may be risks with positive μp
                      for which cp
                      is negative. Conversely, if his status quo is unfavourable (µs
                      < 0, 
                        
                           μ
                           p
                           0
                        
                      < 0), the decision maker may feel forced to “gamble for resurrection” and turn risk prone (cp
                      > μp
                     ). He thus assigns a positive cp
                      to p even though μp
                      is negative (Fig. 2(b), hatched area). According to Eq. (15), cp
                      satisfies the “positive homogeneity” condition 
                        
                           c
                           p
                           0
                        
                      = acp, a > 0 (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) – in agreement with Eqs. (7).


                     Fig. 3
                     (a) shows the typical risk-seeking (risk-averse) attitude in experimental pricing tasks for lotteries with a low (high) probability of gain (Blavatskyy & Köhler, 2009). Individuals were asked to state selling prices for binary lotteries presented to them in the experiments. The statements were subject to limited ranges of admissible prices imposed on subjects via the experimental setup. Blavatskyy and Köhler (2009) offer an explanation for the observed variability in risk attitude. It is based on a constant relative risk aversion utility function combined with a model of random risk-pricing behaviour. Fig. 3(b) suggests that the experimental results may admit an alternative, much simpler explanation in terms of Eq. (15) once the elicited median selling prices of the test lotteries are interpreted as certainty equivalents. Blavatskyy and Köhler (2009) point out the conditions under which this interpretation would be correct, and discuss the relevant literature. The method they employed in the experiment may indeed elicit the true certainty equivalents even in non-EU applications. Comparison between Fig. 3(a) and (b) suggests that the utility model behind Eq. (15) can, in principle, fit the data with some reasonable accuracy. The approximation in Fig. 3(b) has been achieved by specifying the parameters x

Under moderately restrictive conditions of utility independence

                        Of two or more real random variables, one variable is said to be utility independent of the others if the risk of change in this variable (e. g., decreased health) is assessed, in utility terms, independently of the values at which the other variables (e. g., one's economic wealth or income) are currently held.
                      of multivariate random variables, the non-EU model of Eqs. (3) and (4) can be extended to multi-dimensional, though not necessarily monetary, risk attributes (Geiger, 2012, App. B). Let P be a convex set of simple probability distributions defined on a compact interval

                     . If p is the joint finite discrete probability distribution of a random vector (X
                     1, …, XN
                     ) in 
                        I
                     , a certainty equivalent of p always exists (Geiger, 2012, Theorem 2). It is a real vector 
                        c
                     
                     
                        p

                        I
                      so that (X

                     ) = 
                        c
                     
                     
                        p
                      obtains with certainty and U(p) = U(
                        c
                     
                     
                        p
                     ). The problem, then, is how to define the intrinsic price of p, as measured by a single real number c, and which of the Xi

                     s should that be, that is, take on the value c with certainty.

To solve this problem, observe that 
                        c
                     
                     
                        p
                      is no longer uniquely determined if N ≥ 2. In fact, 
                        I
                      can always be chosen so that, for every i ≤ N, there exists a vector

                     's are straightforward to determine. On the utility independence assumption of the approach, U(p) has been given a multilinear representation in terms of the single-attribute utility functions uXi

                      of p (Geiger, 2012, App. B). This representation allows for calculating U(p) with the use of the single-attribute utility functions of Eq. (3). Consider the case U(p) ≥ 0 first. In Eq. (3), replace p by

                      = U(p) = 0 in Eq. (16), one trivially has

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#


                     Eq. (15) has been argued to be accessible to empirical test, with the use of standard certainty equivalent techniques, as are reviewed in Blavatskyy and Köhler (2009, 2011). Tests can be based directly on stated indifferences between risks (e. g., lotteries offered to individuals in choice experiments) and certainty equivalents. The tests dispense with cumbersome elicitations of utility and probability weighting functions. Yet interpretations of the experimental results in terms of the conceptual framework of Eq. (15) require measurements or estimates of a few exogenous parameters. These can, in principle, be obtained by standard statistical methods.


                     Schmidt and Zank (2012) have questioned the observability of one such parameter in behavioural experiments, namely, the reference point x
                     0. They suggested that reference dependence can be derived from behaviour and that the reference point arises endogenously. In contrast, the present utility model presumes that the existence and location of reference points can often be observed although they may show high subjective variability. Thus, often people quite consciously and positively state their aspiration levels in medical decision making (Bleichrodt, 2007); or in business applications reference points may be exogenously imposed on decision makers as the buying prices of risky goods or services, or as limits of profitability.
