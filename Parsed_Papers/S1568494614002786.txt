                  The integrated machine allocation and facility layout problem (IMALP) is a branch of the general facility layout problem in which, besides selecting machine locations, the processing route of each product is determined. Most research in this area suppose that the flow of material is certain and exact, which is an unrealistic assumption in today's dynamic and uncertain business environment. Therefore, in this paper the demand volume has been assumed as fuzzy numbers with different membership functions. To solve this problem, the deterministic model is first integrated with a fuzzy implication via the expected value model, and thereafter an intelligent hybrid algorithm, including a genetic algorithm and a fuzzy simulation approach has been applied. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated with a set of numerical examples. The results show the effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm in finding the IMALP solutions.
