                  This paper presents a new efficient and robust smooth-threshold generalized estimating equations for generalized linear models (GLMs) with longitudinal data. The proposed method is based on a bounded exponential score function and leverage-based weights to achieve robustness against outliers both in the response and the covariate domain. Our motivation for the new variable selection procedure is that it enables us to achieve better robustness and efficiency by introducing an additional tuning parameter 
                        γ
                      which can be automatically selected using the observed data. Moreover, its performance is near optimal and superior to some recently developed variable selection methods. Under some regularity conditions, the resulting estimator possesses the consistency in variable selection and the oracle property in estimation. Finally, simulation studies and a detailed real data analysis are carried out to assess and illustrate the finite sample performance, which show that the proposed method works better than other existing methods, in particular, when many outliers are included.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Longitudinal data sets arise frequently from many subject-matter studies, such as medical and public health studies. Generalized linear models (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) are powerful and popular technique for modeling clustered and longitudinal data, in particular, for repeated or correlated non-Gaussian data, such as Binomial or Poisson type response that is commonly encountered in longitudinal studies. The challenge in analyzing longitudinal data is that it is difficult to specify the full likelihood function when responses are non-normal. This motivated Liang and Zeger (1986) to develop an approach of generalized estimating equations (GEE) which is a milestone in the development of methodology for longitudinal data analysis. Moreover, the well-known GEE approach only requires specification of marginal mean and covariance function. Recent research works on the GEE method include Xie and Yang (2003), Wang et al. (2005a), Balan and Schiopu-Kratina (2005) and Wang (2011) and so on. However, the GEE method is in principle very similar to the weighted least squares method, which does not possess robust property. In the longitudinal data set, one outlier in the subject level may generate a set of outliers in the sample due to repeated measurements. Hence, robustness against outliers is a very important issue in longitudinal studies. Recently, the traditional robust

                     -estimations (e.g. Huber’s estimation) for longitudinal data have attracted much attention and have been discussed in many literatures. An incomplete list of recent works on the robust GEE methods include Fan et al. (2012), He et al. (2005), Qin and Zhu (2007), Qin et al. (2009), Wang et al. (2005b) and Zheng et al. (2013). These above papers all use the Mallows-type weights to downweight the effect of leverage points and adopt the Huber’s score function on the Pearson residuals to dampen the effect of outliers in the response.

Although the Huber’s score function is a robust modeling tool, it has limitation in terms of efficiency of estimation, which stimulates a lot of work about finding other bounded score functions to achieve better robustness and efficiency. Here we only list a few. Yao et al. (2012) investigated a new estimation method for the classical nonparametric model based on a local modal regression (LMR). Liu et al. (2013) and Zhang et al. (2013) extended the LMR method to single index models and semiparametric partially linear varying coefficient models respectively. The outstanding merit of the procedure is that it can achieve both robustness and efficiency by introducing an additional tuning parameter. Wang et al. (2013) adopted a similar view and proposed a class of robust regression estimators based on exponential squared loss. To be more specific, for the linear regression model

In this paper, we first extend the bounded exponential score function

Variable selection is a technique of selecting a subset of relevant covariates for constructing reliable statistical models. Various penalty functions (such as Lasso, adaptive Lasso, SCAD) have been used to select significant variables among all the candidate variables for independent data. But variable selection is also a fundamentally important issue for the analysis of longitudinal data, which could greatly enhance the prediction performance of the fitted model and select significant variables. For example, Fan et al. (2012) proposed penalized robust estimating equations with the SCAD penalty for longitudinal linear models. Wang et al. (2012) considered the SCAD-penalized GEE for analyzing longitudinal data with high-dimensional covariates. These variable selection methods mentioned above are based on estimating equations and the SCAD penalty function which is singular at zero. Thereby, these estimation procedures require convex optimization, which incurs a computational burden. Ueki (2009) developed smooth-threshold estimating equations that can automatically eliminate irrelevant parameters by setting them as zero. As far as we know, Ueki’s method is in principle applicable to the procedures based on estimating equations. Moreover, this approach possesses the oracle property in the sense that Fan and Li (2001) suggested. Motivated by the idea of Ueki (2009) and Li et al. (2013) developed smooth-threshold generalized estimating equations (SGEE) for longitudinal generalized linear models. In this paper, we focus on marginal longitudinal generalized linear models and develop an efficient and robust variable selection method based on the bounded exponential score function and smooth-threshold estimating equations. Our contributions are the following: (i) we establish root 
                        n
                     -consistency and asymptotic normality of estimators. (ii) We use the Mallows-type weights to downweight the effect of leverage points and adopt the bounded exponential score function

                      on the Pearson residuals to dampen the effect of outliers in the response. (iii) The proposed method can automatically eliminate inactive predictors by setting the corresponding parameters to be zero and estimate nonzero coefficients simultaneously.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The main results are described in Section  2, including the efficient and robust smooth-threshold estimating equations (ERSGEE) and their asymptotic properties and influence function. In Section  3, an efficient algorithm is proposed to implement the procedures. Moreover, we discuss how to select the tuning parameter 
                        γ
                      and other regularization parameters so that the corresponding ERSGEE estimators are robust and sparse. In Section  4, we apply a number of simulations to assess the finite sample performance of our method by comparing with other variable selection procedures. A real data analysis is also presented in this section to augment our theoretical results. Some concluding remarks are given in Section  5. The proofs of the main results are relegated to the Appendix.

                         may dampen the effect of outliers in the response, and result in a robust estimator by solving the estimation equations (3), it will lose some efficiency in some cases. That is, the robust Huber’s estimator is slightly less efficient than non-robust estimation when there are no outliers, e.g. Fan et al. (2012), He et al. (2005), Qin and Zhu (2007) and Qin et al. (2009), etc. Moreover, estimation equations (3) are only suitable for marginal longitudinal linear regression models. Hence, it is necessary to look for a new efficient and robust method for marginal longitudinal GLMs. In this paper, we focus on the marginal longitudinal GLMs. Denote the first two marginal moments of

                        , then we can obtain a sparse solution. But we cannot directly obtain the estimator of

                         by solving (6). The main reason is that the ERSGEE not only includes the unknown nuisance parameters 
                           α
                         and 
                           ϕ
                        , but also involves

                           γ
                        , which need to be determined by the observed data. Detailed discussions of selecting these parameters are listed in Section  3.

                                       n
                                    
                                 
                               consistency of the regression coefficient estimation. Theorem 2 suggests that the ERSGEE possesses oracle property (Fan and Li, 2001) when we choose proper 
                                 λ
                               and 
                                 τ
                              . That is, with probability approaching 1, the ERSGEE can correctly select the nonzero coefficients, and estimate them as efficiently as the ERGEE does as if we knew in advance the correct submodel.

Now, we study the robustness property of the ERSGEE. As we know, for robust estimation, the influence function is a convenient and essential tool to measure the local robustness (Hampel et al., 1986), which characters the impact of an infinitesimal proportion of contamination. The influence function of a statistical function

                               by solving (7), we also need a initial estimator

                               which can be obtained by using the ERGEE estimator

                              . From our simulation experiences, we can see that this robust method provides an useful and stable initial estimator

                                          (

                               which is not sensitive to outliers.

To implement the procedures described in Section  3.2, we need to choose the regularization parameters 
                           
                              (
                              λ
                              ,
                              τ
                              )
                           
                        . One can select 
                           
                              (
                              λ
                              ,
                              τ
                              )
                           
                         by optimizing some data-driven criteria which can balance goodness of fit and model complexity. In order to simplify the calculation, we adopt 
                           τ
                           =
                           1
                         in our simulation studies. Following Li et al. (2013), we use PWD-type criterion to choose these parameters. That is, we choose 
                           λ
                         as the minimizer of

In this section, we consider simulation studies to assess the performance of the proposed estimators from three aspects: (1) the effect of using the true working correlation matrix as compared with misspecified working correlation structure, (2) robustness against outliers, and (3) efficiency comparison with some recently developed methods. We also apply our proposed method to a real-world longitudinal data set.


                        
                           Example 1
                           In this example, we consider the marginal longitudinal linear regression model as well as the marginal longitudinal Poisson regression model. The main goal is to compare the proposed ERGEE by solving Eqs. (5) with the conventional GEE (Li et al., 2013) and RGEE (Fan et al., 2012). RGEE is defined through the same Eqs.

                        . Similar to the model (17), we assume that the true correlation structure within the 
                           i
                        th subject is exchangeable correlation structure with correlation coefficient 0.7. The regression coefficients of model (18) are the same as those of the model (17). The response variable is conducted using multivariate Poisson data generator proposed by Yahav and Shmueli (2012). The replication time is 200 for each experiment.

To illustrate the effect incorporating within-cluster correlation on estimation efficiency, two kinds of working correlation matrices are considered: exchangeable working correlation (exch) and first order autoregressive working correlation structure (ar1). In our simulations, the

In addition, we note that model (18) is more challenging than model (17) since the Poisson response contains much less information than the continuous response.

                        . Several observations can be found from the above two tables. Firstly, under 
                           
                              Case
                           
                           0
                        , our proposed ERGEE performs equally well as the GEE estimate since their bias, SD and AMSE have little difference, and the ERGEE estimate generally achieves smaller SD than that of the RGEE estimate. These results indicate that our proposed method seems to perform no worse than GEE estimate by introducing an additional tuning parameter 
                           γ
                         which controls the degree of robustness and efficiency for the estimators. That is, to some extent, the ERGEE estimator will lose less efficiency when the data contains no outliers compared with other robust estimators. Secondly, the GEE method can impact greatly in terms of SD and AMSE when data contain outliers which implies that it is not a robust approach. Furthermore, the ERGEE estimate performs obviously better than the other two methods for the contaminated data. Thus, we can conclude that the proposed estimation procedure can achieve better robustness and efficiency and outperform both GEE and RGEE, in particular, when many outliers are included.

                           In this example, we investigate the performance of the proposed ERSGEE estimate and compare it with existing variable selection methods, such as SGEE proposed inLi et al. (2013) and RSGEE which is similar to that of Fan et al. (2012). Note that SGEE is obtained by solving the estimating equations (2.4) of Li et al. (2013) and the criterion (4.1) in their article is used to select regularization parameter

                              , and other settings are the same. For sake of comparison, we adopt the notation (C, IC, CF) to identify the variable selection results. The C means the average number of zero regression coefficients that are correctly estimated as zero, IC presents the average number of non-zero regression coefficients incorrectly set to zero, and correct fit (CF) depicts the proportion of times that the correct model is selected.


                        Tables 3 and 4
                        
                         summarize model selection properties of SGEE, RSGEE, ERSGEE and their corresponding oracle’s methods for two different working correlation matrices and three different cases. Several observations can be seen from the two tables. Firstly, under 
                           
                              Case
                           
                           0
                        , AMSE of all methods decrease and their CF approach to 1 and the values in the column labeled C become more and more closer to the true number of zero regression coefficients in the models as the number of subjects 
                           n
                         increases. These are consistent with the oracle property. Moreover, ERSGEE seems to perform no worse than SGEE in terms of CF, although acceptable loss of efficiency in our method can be detected from slightly larger AMSE (total) in Table 3. Secondly, for the contaminated data (
                           
                              Case
                           
                           1
                         and 
                           
                              Case
                           
                           2
                        ), our method apparently outperforms the other two methods in terms of estimation efficiency and variable selection. For example, in Table 3, CF of ERSGEE is about 90% with the moderate sample size 
                           n
                           =
                           200
                        , which indicates ERSGEE can correctly identify the true model under contaminated data, but CF of the other two methods are no more than 80%. Hence, ERSGEE estimate has great gain of efficiency over RSGEE method. Thirdly, it is not surprised that the performances of variable selection procedures and estimation efficiency based on the correct correlation structure (exch) work better than those based on the incorrect correlation structure (ar1). However, we also note that the performance does not significantly depend on working covariance structure. Finally, for a given correlation structure and contamination situation, the larger the sample size 
                           n
                        , the better all methods perform.

                              . From Table 5, we can see that the proposed method is still able to correctly identify the true submodel and works remarkably well even for the high dimension case with outliers. This shows that our method may be extended to the scenario with increased number of variables, which is a quite challenging issue, and the study of our method with the diverging variables in theory needs further investigation in the near future.

In summary, the simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method is not only able to accommodate the effect of outliers and improve the efficiency of parameter estimation but also can perform robust variable selection under contamination.

We now apply the proposed method to analyze a real data set from an epileptic seizure study. Details of the study design can be found in Wang et al. (2005b) and Xu and Zhu (2012). In this study, the response variable is the number of seizures in a two-week period and our concern here is whether the drug helps to reduce the rate of epileptic seizures or not. Following Wang et al. (2005b), we consider the same covariates including treatment (0 for placebo, 1 for drug), logarithm of age (log age), baseline seizure count (which is divided by 4 and then log-transformed), and the interaction between treatment and baseline seizures. As in Wang et al. (2005b), we analyze this data set with ar1 working correlation assumption under the framework of a longitudinal Poisson regression model. But the number of covariates is only 5 (including intercept), it cannot be used to carry out variable selection. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ERSGEE method, we adopt a similar strategy of Guo et al. (2013) by adding 10 irrelevant variables which are randomly drawn from Uniform(0, 1) to the longitudinal Poisson regression model. Accordingly, there are 15 covariates, among which the last 10 covariates (denoted as

                        ) are known to be irrelevant variables, and the first 5 variables might be relevant to the response. We fit the 15-dimensional sparse longitudinal Poisson regression model using the three methods which include the SGEE, RSGEE and ERSGEE. To verify our efficient and robust variable selection procedure, we re-analyzed the data set by including some outliers in the response variable. Two cases were considered in the analysis, a single outlier and 2% contaminated observations. For each case, the outliers were randomly generated by increasing the value

Although we cannot know the true parameter, we can compare the change of the estimated regression coefficients for different cases, for example, no outliers, a single outlier and 2% outliers. If the change is very small, we have reasons to believe that the corresponding method is robust. As we can see from Table 6, there is little difference for estimated regression coefficients of RSGEE and ERSGEE under different types of contaminations. But the regression coefficients of SGEE vary hugely from no outliers to 2% outliers. These results indicate RSGEE and ERSGEE are robust estimators but SGEE is not. Meanwhile, we also find the sample standard errors for the estimated coefficients of our method are almost uniformly smaller than those of the RSGEE estimator, which clearly show that our method is more efficient.

From Table 7, we can see that the first five variables have very high selected frequencies for all methods, which indicates that these variables may be very significant in longitudinal Poisson regression model. In addition, SGEE is clearly affected in direction estimation by adding outliers since its correlation has changed significantly but the other two approaches are not. More importantly, our proposed method results in a final model with smaller size.

From the real data analysis, again, we come to a conclusion that our proposed method is not only an efficient variable selection method but also has good robustness for longitudinal generalized linear models even if many outliers are included.

In this paper, we develop an efficient and robust smooth-threshold estimating equations for automatic variable selection in the marginal longitudinal generalized linear models that allow for non-Gaussian data and nonlinear link functions. Our proposed estimate and variable selection method are able to control the influence of outliers which have been checked by simulation studies and a real data analysis. The distinguishing characteristic of the proposed method is that it introduces additional tuning parameter 
                        γ
                      which can be automatically selected using the observed data in order to achieve both robustness and efficiency. Moreover, we have proved that our estimate is consistent in variable selection and enjoys the oracle property followed in Fan and Li (2001). In addition, our estimation procedure can be implemented using an iterative algorithm that alternates between a modified Fisher scoring for the regression coefficients and robust moment estimation of the correlation and scale parameters 
                        α
                      and 
                        ϕ
                     . Specifically, based on the discussion in Section  2.3, we know that the influence function is bounded with respect to outliers in either the response or the covariate domain.

There are some directions to further extend this work. Firstly, when the number of covariates

                              n
                           
                        
                      increases as the number of clusters 
                        n
                      increases (such as, Wang et al., 2012 and Cho and Qu, 2013), it is an interesting future research topic for us to use the ERSGEE procedure. Secondly, we can apply our method to other marginal longitudinal semiparametric models, such as single-index models, partially linear single-index models and varying coefficient models, to obtain a robust and efficient estimation.
