                  Multistage stochastic programs show time-inconsistency in general, if the objective is neither the expectation nor the maximum functional.
                  This paper considers distortion risk measures (in particular the Average Value-at-Risk) at the final stage of a multistage stochastic program. Such problems are not time consistent. However, it is shown that by considering risk parameters at random level and by extending the state space appropriately, the value function corresponding to the optimal decisions evolves as a martingale and a dynamic programming principle is applicable. In this setup the risk profile has to be accepted to vary over time and to be adapted dynamically. Further, a verification theorem is provided, which characterizes optimal decisions by sub- and supermartingales. These enveloping martingales constitute a lower and an upper bound of the optimal value function.
                  The basis of the analysis is a new decomposition theorem for the Average Value-at-Risk, which is given in a time consistent formulation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Coherent risk measures have been introduced by Artzner et al. in the pioneering papers (Artzner, Delbaen, & Heath, 1997) and (Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, & Heath, 1999). The set of axioms, which are proposed there, is widely accepted nowadays. Approximately 10 years later the same group of authors considered risk measures again in a multistage framework in Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, Heath, and Ku (2007). These authors notice that the Average Value-at-Risk, the most important risk measure, is not time consistent in the sense specified in their paper. Importantly, they relate time-consistency to the fundamental dynamic programming principle, known as Bellman’s principle (cf.  Fleming and Soner, 2006).

For giving a precise definition of time-consistency (time inconsistency, respectively) one has to distinguish between time-inconsistent risk measures and time-inconsistent decision problems.

Artzner et al. consider the following notion of time-inconsistency in Artzner et al. (2007): a risk measure ρ applied to a random variable Y is said to be time-consistent, if knowing the value 
                        
                           ρ
                           (
                           Y
                           |
                           F
                           )
                        
                      for all conditional distributions for any conditioning σ-algebra 
                        F
                      is sufficient to calculate its unconditional value ρ(Y). Their counterexample, showing that the Average Value-at-Risk is time-inconsistent in this sense, is reconsidered and resolved in this paper below (Fig. 2
                     ).

The notion of time-consistent decision problems is related, but slightly different: a multistage stochastic decision problem is time-consistent, if resolving the problem at later stages (i.e., after observing some random outcomes), the original solutions remain optimal for the later stages.


                     Shapiro (2009, p. 144), referring to a tree-structured problem, remarks that for time-consistency of a problem the solution at each stage is not allowed to depend on random parameters, which cannot follow this stage (i.e., in the language of trees, lie in other subtrees): “It is natural to consider the conceptual requirement that an optimal decision at state ξt
                      should not depend on states which do not follow ξt
                     , i.e., cannot happen in the future. That is, optimality of our decision at state ξt
                      should only involve future children nodes of state ξt
                     . We call this principle time consistency.”


                     Carpentier, Chancelier, Cohen, de Lara, and Girardeau (2012, p. 249) formulate the property as follows: “The sequence of optimization problems is said to be dynamically consistent if the optimal strategies obtained when solving the original problem at time t
                     0 remain optimal for all subsequent problems. In other words, dynamic consistency means that strategies obtained by solving the problem at the very first stage do not have to be questioned later on.”

In order to enforce time-consistency for decision problems significant efforts and investigations have been initiated to identify classes of multiperiod risk measures which lead to time-consistency and allow stagewise decompositions. To this end, nested conditional risk measures have been proposed by Shapiro and Ruszczyński (Ruszczyński, 2010; Ruszczyński & Shapiro, 2006; Shapiro, 2009) (cf. as well Shapiro, 2012) and the recent paper by Carpentier et al. (2012). Here, we follow a different path.

First, we will maximize the acceptability rather than minimize risk. This is for ease of presentation of the results. Since acceptability measures can be seen as the negatives of risk measures this is no restriction. Secondly, we stick to the problem of maximizing the acceptability of the final outcome, where the acceptability is measured by a plain distortion measure, not by a nested one. We believe that nested risk or acceptability measures are difficult to interpret and are not what decision makers would understand under multistage risk or acceptability.

As a measure for acceptability we use initially the Average Value-at-Risk (
                        
                           
                              AV
                              @
                              R
                           
                           )
                        
                      defined below in (1), and explain later how the results extend to general distortion measures. As illustration of time-inconsistency of decision problems involving 
                        
                           AV
                           @
                           R
                        
                      consider the example displayed in Fig. 1
                     . Suppose that the decision has to made, which out of the two tree processes is to be selected for the criterion to maximize the final 
                        
                           
                              AV
                              @
                              R
                           
                           
                              10
                              
                              percent
                           
                        
                     . It can be easily seen that looking at the conditional 
                        
                           AV
                           @
                           R
                        
                     ’s at intermediate time 1, the left tree has to be preferred to the right one. Looking at the same criterion, but at time 0, the preference is opposite. Therefore, this introductory example confirms the fact that in general the maximization of the 
                        
                           AV
                           @
                           R
                        
                      of the final outcome leads to time-inconsistency of decisions.

This paper is based on a new decomposition of the 
                        
                           AV
                           @
                           R
                        
                      and related measures. The decomposition measures risk on conditional level only, and it recovers the initial risk measure by collecting the conditional risk measures via an expectation. In this setup the risk profile has to be adapted conditionally, such that the conditional risk profile is not static any longer.

Additional information changes the perception of risk. The adaptive choice of appropriate measures of risk complies with the course of action of a risk manager who adjusts the preferences whenever additional information is available. The decision maker is less reluctant, if an observation reveals that the future will be bright, but conversely she or he will be more strict if losses at the end become more likely. This gives rise to defining an extended notion of a conditional risk measure, which is not just the same risk measure applied to conditional distributions, but which may be a different functional for different conditional distributions, depending on its respective history.

By involving adapted conditional risk measures it is possible to recover dynamic programming principles for multistage stochastic programs. Moreover verification theorems, which are central in dynamic control, are established here for multistage stochastic programs. The dynamic programming equations presented are based on the dual representation of the risk measure, and different to those provided by Shapiro (2009). The presented approach allows a characterization of optimal solutions of a multistage stochastic program in terms of enveloping sub- and supermartingales. It is shown that a solution of a multistage problem evolves as a martingale over time, where different risk measures are encountered at each stage.

Dynamic programming equations notably cannot remove the time inconsistency, which is inherent to these problems. But these equations come along with verification theorems, and it is their purpose to enable checking, if a given policy is optimal. By assessing the enveloping sub- and supermartingales it is moreover possible to provide upper and lower bounds, such that the quality of a given multistage policy can be assessed with these sub- and supermartingales as well.


                        Section 2 provides the setting for the Average Value-at-Risk, as this risk measure is basic for the presentation. Next, the conditional version is considered. The decomposition theorem, the central statement of this paper, is contained in Section 4 and Section 5 characterizes its properties. Section 6 introduces the multistage optimization problem. Section 7 exposes the dynamic programming formulation, while the subsequent Section 8 introduces the martingale representations, which are in line with dynamic programming.

We reduce the conceptual description of the problem to the Average Value-at-Risk, 
                        
                           AV
                           @
                           R
                        
                     . This reduction is justified, as more general coherent risk measures—distortion risk measures—are composed in a linear way of Average Value-at-Risks at different levels. Further, Kusuoka’s theorem provides all version independent (also known as law invariant) risk measures via distortion risk measures (cf., for example, Pflug & Römisch, 2007), such that this reduction is without loss of generality.

The Average Value-at-Risk is considered in its concave variant involving the lower quantiles of the distribution function FY
                      of the random variable Y,

Attempts to define a conditional Average Value-at-Risk for a smaller sigma algebra

An extension to this initial definition considers a level parameter α, which depends on the history (we are grateful to Werner Römisch for pointing out the references Cheridito and Kupper ([2009,2011], Section 2.3.1) and Detlefsen and Scandolo (2005)). This setting is broad enough to allow a decomposition.

Here the level α is not considered fixed and constant any longer, but

It is enough to employ Z ∈ L
                              ∞ in (5), as L
                              ∞ is dense in the dual. For a complete treatment of the domain and the dual consider Pichler (2013).

Given the Average Value-at-Risk conditionally on

                      how can one reassemble the Average Value-at-Risk at time 0? This is the content of the next theorem, which contains a central result on the Average Value-at-Risk in multistage situations. It is the basis for the martingale representation and the verification theorems in multistage stochastic optimization, which are presented in Section 8 then.

This section elaborates that the conditional Average Value-at-Risk at random level basically preserves all properties of the usual Average Value-at-Risk. The properties are essential in the following section for multistage stochastic optimization, where the problem is reconsidered for all sigma algebras in the filtration.

In addition to the defining equation (5) for the Average Value-at-Risk at random level there is a further representation, which follows the classical equivalence of (2) and (3) (cf. Ruszczyński, 2010, p. 242). The proof is along the lines of the classical equivalence and rather technical.

The problem formulation (12) applies for optimal investment problems, it can be found in multistage decision models for electricity management as well. In applications (cf. Eichhorn, Heitsch, & Römisch, 2010) a reformulation of (12) to account for the multistage situation is typically considered, which involves a stochastic process ξt

The dynamic programming principleis the basis of the solution technique developed by Bellman (1957) in the 1950s for deterministic optimal control problems. They have been extended later to account for stochastic problems as well, where typically

                        
                           (i)
                           the objective is an expectation and

the transition does not depend on the history, but just on the current state of the system—that is to say for Markov chains.

The decomposition of the Average Value-at-Risk elaborated in Theorem 6 is the key which allows to define—in line with the classical dynamic programming principle—a value function with properties analogous to the classical theory. The new value function overcomes the restrictions (i) and (ii), as we shall employ a risk measure in the objective, and the value function explicitly depends on the history. The value function is then used in Section 8 to state the verification theorems.

The theory developed below applies to more general acceptability functionals (risk functions), other than the Average Value-at-Risk, it includes in particular all approximations of law invariant acceptability functionals by Kusuoka’s theorem of the form

For Markov processes the value function is—in a natural way—a function of time and the current status of the system. In order to derive dynamic programming equations for the general multistage problem it is necessary to carry the entire history of earlier decisions. This is respected by the following definition.

Among influential papers and attempts to obtain dynamic programming equations for multistage programming are the papers by Shapiro (2009) and Römisch and Guigues (2012), which address the time consistency aspect. A focus on Bellman’s principle is given in Artzner et al. (2007).

In this paper we demonstrate by use of an example that a naïve composition of risk measures is not time consistent. We introduce the conditional Average Value-at-Risk at random risk level. The central result is a decomposition, which allows to reassemble the Average Value-at-Risk given just the conditional risk observations. For this purpose it is necessary to give up the constant risk level and to accept a random risk level instead. The random risk level is adapted for each partial observation and reflects the fact that risk has to be quantified by adapted means, whenever information already is available.

The risk levels, which have to be applied at different levels, are not known a priori, they come along with the solution of the entire problem. This is of course in line with time inconsistency, which is intrinsic to these types of problems. However, dynamic programming principles can still be derived, they can be stated as verification theorems. Those verification theorems are formulated by employing enveloping super- and submartingales.They can be used to check, if a given policy for a stochastic program is optimal or not. Further, the sub- and supermartingales provide useful lower and upper bounds for the objective of the stochastic program.
