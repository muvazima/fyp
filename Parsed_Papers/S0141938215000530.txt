@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Scientists and researchers are conducting research in search for suitable host lattices that can be used to prepare phosphors for white light emitting phosphors. Current research topics on phosphors are focused on the generation of white light that can be used in light emitting diodes (LEDs) [1]. White LEDs have several advantages over conventional fluorescent lamps such as reduced power consumption, compactness, efficient light output, and longer lifetimes. The strategies used to produce white light in LEDs include combining blue LED with a yellow phosphor or UV-LED with blue, green and red phosphors or blue, green and red LEDs [2,3]. Luminescence materials doped with Dy3+ have recently drawn considerable interest because it emits white light. Given that Dy3+ with 4f9 configuration has complicated f-block energy levels, various possible transitions between these levels are highly selective and show sharp line spectra [4,5].

In general, Dy3+ exhibits three visible emission bands including the blue emission (460–480nm) corresponding to the 4F9/2
                     →
                     6H15/2 transition, the yellow emission (550–580nm) corresponding to the hypersensitive transition 4F9/2
                     →
                     6H13/2 (ΔJ
                     =2) and the feeble red emission (640–680nm) corresponding to the transition 4F9/2
                     →
                     6H11/2 
                     [6–9]. Consequently, white light can be obtained by creating the appropriate mixture of blue and yellow emissions. Moreover, phosphors doped with Dy3+ ions based on their line type f–f transitions, can emit narrow emissions in the visible range, resulting in high efficiency and high lumen equivalence. As a result, there has been growing interest in developing Dy3+ doped phosphors with high absorption in the n-UV to blue range [10–12]. As is known to all, alkaline earth silicates have attracted interest in the field of white light emitting phosphors since they are suitable hosts due to their suitable energy, band structure, high physical and chemical stability, easy preparation and low cost [13,14].

The luminescence properties include the thermoluminescence (TL) photoluminescence (PL) as well as mechanoluminescence (ML) of the material. TL or more specifically Thermally Stimulated Luminescence (TSL) is stimulated thermally after initial irradiation given to a phosphor by some other means (α-rays, ß-rays, γ-rays, UV-rays and X-rays). TSL is the phenomenon of emission of light from a solid which has been previously exposed to ionizing radiation under conditions of increasing temperature. In another words TL is one of the possible ways to investigate the trap states of the materials. When light of sufficient energy is incident on a material, photons are absorbed and electronic excitations are created. Eventually, these excitations relax and the electrons return to the ground state. If radiative relaxation occurs, the emitted light is called PL [15]. Luminescence induced during any mechanical action on materials is known as ML. ML can be excited either by grinding, rubbing, cutting, cleaving, shaking, scratching, crushing, compressing, or by impulsive deformation of solids. It can also be excited by thermal shocks caused by drastic cooling or heating of materials or by the shock-waves produced during exposure of samples to laser pulses or ultrasonic waves. ML also appears during the deformation caused by the phase transition or growth of certain crystals as well as during separation of two solids in contact. ML has been observed in insulators, semiconductors as well as in conductors [16].

ML has found various important applications such as impact sensors in spacecrafts (the emission intensity can be used to determine the kinetic energy of impact), fracture sensor, damage sensor, stress sensor for the visualizations of stress field near the crack-tip, stress distribution in the solids, and quasidynamic crack-propagation in solids. Thus, many researchers have been focused on the investigation of phosphors with high ML [17]. Until now, some phosphors with high ML, such as red phosphors BaTiO3–CaTiO3:Pr [18], green phosphors SrAl2O4:Eu [19], yellow phosphors ZnS:Mn [20], and blue phosphor CaYAl3O7:Eu [21], have been developed. However, the requirement of application for ML sensors still is not satisfied with the development of ML materials. At the same time, the high stabilities, such as resistance of water, thermal stability, are also very important for the application of ML. More ML phosphors with strong ML intensity and high stability are needed.

Mellite are a large group of compounds characterized by the general formula M2T1T2
                     2O7, (M=Sr, Ca, Ba; T1
                     =Mn, Co, Cu, Mg, Zn; T2
                     =Si, Ge), have been investigated widely as optical materials. Due to their tetragonal and non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, lanthanides or transition metals can be accepted easily as constituents or dopants by the melilites, allowing the synthesis of high-quality doped single crystals [22]. Recently SrCaMgSi2O7 phosphor has attracted great interest due to its special structure features, excellent physical and chemical stability. They have been studied widely with Eu2+ doping, which shows that a bluish-green emission and long persistent luminescence by co-doping with some other rare earth ions. Solid state reaction technique is a traditional phosphors synthesis techniques is widely used to prepare silicate phosphors because samples prepared using this method have good luminescence and very good morphology, which has advantage over the other techniques [23].

In the present paper, we report the structural characterization and luminescence properties in dysprosium doped strontium calcium magnesium di-silicate (SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+) phosphor. The SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was prepared by the high temperature solid state reaction method. Investigation of the crystal structure, surface morphology and elemental analysis of sintered phosphor were determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were applied to investigate the different starching modes of prepared phosphor. Optical properties were also investigated on the basis of thermoluminescence (TL), photoluminescence (PL), long afterglow (decay) and mechanoluminescence (ML) properties.

The powder sample of dysprosium doped strontium calcium magnesium di-silicate namely SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was prepared by the high temperature solid state reaction method. The raw materials are strontium carbonate [SrCO3 (99.90%)], calcium carbonate [CaCO3 (99.90%)], magnesium oxide [MgO (99.90%)], silicon di-oxide [SiO2 (99.99%)] and dysprosium oxide [Dy2O3 (99.99%)], all of analytical purity, were employed in this experiment. Boric acid (H3BO3) was added as flux. Initially, the raw materials were weighed according to the nominal compositions of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. Then the powders were mixed and milled thoroughly for 2h using the mortar and pestle. The ground sample were placed in an alumina crucible and subsequently fired at 1250°C for 3h in an air. In order to investigate the crystal structure of the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor, we also prepare Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ and Ca2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphors at same temperature. At last the nominal compounds were obtained after the cooling down of programmable furnace.

The crystal structure of the prepared SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Powder XRD pattern has been obtained from Bruker D8 advanced X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation and the data were collected over the 2θ range 10—80°. The crystal structure of the sample was verified with the help of Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standard Data (JCPDS) file. The surface morphology of the prepared SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was determined by the FESEM. The samples were coated with a thin layer of gold (Au) and then the surface morphology of prepared phosphor were observed by FESEM utilizing ZIESS Ulta Plus-55 operated at the acceleration voltage of 5kV. An EDX spectrum was used for the elemental (qualitative and quantitative) analysis of the prepared phosphor. FTIR spectra were recorded with the help of IR Prestige-21 by SHIMADZU for investigating the finger print region (1400–400cm−1) and functional groups (4000–1400cm−1) of prepared phosphor. The FTIR spectra were collected in the middle infrared region (4000–400cm−1) by mixing the potassium bromide (KBr, A.R. grade) with prepared SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The TL glow curves were recorded with the help of TLD reader 1009I by Nucleonix (Hyderabad, India Pvt. Ltd.). In the TL study, the mass of the sample was fixed (8mg), and every time takes the fresh sample for observation. The excitation and emission spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu (RF 5301-PC) spectrofluorophotometer. This spectrofluorophotometer provides corrected excitation and emission spectra in 200–400nm and 400–750nm ranges, respectively. Commission international de I’Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity coordinates were calculated in terms of the emission spectra. The long afterglow (decay) curves were obtained using a Perkin Elmer fluorescence spectrometer with the proper excitation under a UV lamp (365nm). The ML measurement was observed by the home made lab system comprising of an RCA-931A photomultiplier tube (PMT). The ML glow curve can be plotted with the help of SM-340 application software installed in a computer attached with the storage oscilloscope. All measurements were carried out at the room temperature.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS@&#

In order to determine the crystal structure, the powder XRD analysis has been carried out. XRD patterns of the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor with the Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ and Ca2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphors are shown in Fig. 1
                        (a)–(c). The standard XRD patterns of SrCaMgSi2O7 were not found in the International Center for Diffraction Data (ICDD) database but compared with the standard patterns of Sr2MgSi2O7 (JCPDS 75-1736) and Ca2MgSi2O7 (JCPDS 77-1149) [24,25], it could be seen that the major diffraction peaks of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ are similar for both alkaline earth silicates. The result reveals that the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor has the same crystal structure as Sr2MgSi2O7 and Ca2MgSi2O7 phosphors. In addition, the location of its diffraction peaks is between that of the corresponding peaks for Sr2MgSi2O7 and Ca2MgSi2O7 phosphors, which indicates that the change of alkaline earth ions induces a small effect on the structure of the sample [17].

These results reveals that the crystal structure of the Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+; SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ and Ca2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphors has an akermanite type structure which belongs to the tetragonal crystallography with space group P

                        m, this structure is a member of the melilite group and forms a layered compound [26,27]. Fig. 2
                        (a)–(c) shows the XRD patterns of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+; SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ and Ca2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphors on the (211) crystal planes. In addition, the location of major diffraction peaks shifted towards higher angle compared with that of the corresponding peaks for Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor.

FESEM studies were carried out to obtain information about surface morphology of the synthesized phosphor. The surface morphology of the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor is shown in Fig. 3
                        (a) and (b) with different magnification. The surface morphology of the particles were not uniform and they aggregated tightly with each other. In addition, the agglomeration of particles is a common practice and expected in phosphor prepared by high temperature solid state reaction method. From Fig. 3(a) and (b) the FESEM image, it can be observed that the prepared sample consists of particles with different size distribution.

The chemical composition of the powder sample has been measured using EDX. Fig. 4
                         shows the EDX spectra of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. Table 1
                         shows the compositional elements of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor, which is compare with the standard element. EDX is a standard procedure for identifying and quantifying elemental (qualitative and quantitative) composition of sample area as small as a few nanometers. Their appeared no other emissions apart from strontium (Sr), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), oxygen (O) and dysprosium (Dy) in EDX spectra of the phosphor. In the spectrum, intense peaks of compositional elements are present which confirm the presence of elements in SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor.

FTIR spectra have been widely used for the identification of organic and inorganic compounds. Fig. 5
                         shows the FTIR spectra of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The appearance of the band related to the stretching vibrations of OH groups (∼3433.89cm−1) in the IR spectrum, is the evidence of hydration resulting from the absorption of atmospheric moisture. The asymmetric stretching of (CO3
                        2−) carbonates can be observed in ∼1963.53cm−1. These bands are due to the slight carbonation of the raw materials [SrCO3 and CaCO3]. The vibration band of ∼1631.78cm−1 are assigned due to the Mg2+ and bending of the sharp peaks in the region of ∼1414.48cm−1 are assigned due to the Sr2+ 
                        [28,29].

According to the crystal structure of SrCaMgSi2O7, the coordination number of strontium and calcium can be 8 and 6. Therefore, Sr2+ and Ca2+ can occupy two alternative lattice sites, the eight coordinated site [SrO8 (Sr1 site) and CaO8 (Ca1 site)] and the six coordinated site [SrO6 (Sr2 site) and CaO6 (Ca2 site)], and other two independent cations sites, namely Mg2+ [MgO4] and Si4+ [SiO4] also exist in the crystal lattice. Mg2+ and Si4+ cations occupy the tetrahedral sites. Dy3+ ions can occupy four alternative lattice sites and the coordination number of dysprosium can be 6–9 (Dy1, Dy2, Dy3 and Dy4 respectively). Its hard for Dy3+ ions to incorporate the tetrahedral [MgO4] or [SiO4] symmetry but it can easily incorporate octahedral [SrO8 and CaO8] or hexahedral [SrO6 and CaO6]. Another fact that supports that the radius of Dy3+ (0.99Å) are very close to that of Sr2+ (about 1.12Å) and Ca2+ (about 1.12Å) rather than Mg2+ (0.65Å) and Si4+ (0.41Å). Therefore, the Dy3+ ions are expected to occupy the Sr2+ and Ca2+ sites in the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The two peaks in the finger print region ∼863.06, 706.46cm−1 are assigned due to the Ca2+ ions [30].

In the presented spectrum the absorption bands of silicate groups were clearly evident. According to previous studies on silicate materials, the position of the bands in the 800–1200cm−1 region can provide information about the number of bridging oxygen atoms, bonded to silicon atoms. The intense band ∼1071.30, 974.67cm−1 was assigned to the Si–O–Si asymmetric stretch and Si–O symmetric stretch. The bands ∼669.81, 624.61cm−1 are due to the Si–O–Si vibrational mode. The vibration band around ∼496.06cm−1 is assigned due to the Mg2+, which is based on the Mg–O modes. The groups [Si2O7] constitute diorthosilicates, are the main structural elements of melilites [31–34].

TL is the emission of light, which can be observed when it is heated. TL is observed under three conditions. Firstly, the phosphors must be either semiconductor or an insulator. Secondly, the material ability to store energy when exposure radiation. Thirdly, the luminescence emission is released by heating the material [35]. However, if the ionizing radiation is incident on a material, may be some of its energy absorbed, the material will store the energy with the release in the form of visible light when the material is heated. Furthermore, the TL material does not emitting light again by simply cooling with re-heating, but it must first be exposure to ionizing radiation [36].


                        Fig. 6
                         shows the TL glow curve of Dy3+ doped SrCaMgSi2O7 phosphors with different UV irradiation time (5, 8, 10, 15 and 20min) at 365nm UV source at heating rate of 5°C/s. TL glow curve peaks were occurred 119.56°C and these peak positions remains constant with UV irradiation time. From TL glow curve, it is seen that, initially TL intensity increase with increasing UV irradiation time. TL intensity are maximum for 10min of UV irradiation, after that they start to decrease. It is predicted that, with the increasing UV irradiation time, greater number of charge carriers are released which increases the trap density results in increase of TL intensity (density of charge carrier may have been increasing), but after a specific irradiation (10min) time, traps density starts to destroy results in decrease in TL intensity. Decreasing of charge carriers density is may be a reason for the low TL intensity at higher irradiation time.

As is well known, the existence of suitable charge traps in host lattice is responsible for long lasting phosphorescence. The duration of long lasting phosphor depends on the number of captured electrons/holes, and successively, the number of captured electrons/holes relies on the concentration and the depth of traps. Therefore, the appropriate depth of traps is crucial for long afterglow. If the depth of the trapping levels is too low, the phosphor would show a fast decay, which does not last for a long time. On the contrary, if it is too deep the phosphor will no longer show phosphorescence. Generally, it is considered that the shallower the trap is, the lower the temperature of TL peak [37]. On the mechanism of long afterglow, it is a common viewpoint that during the excitation period the energy of incident light is partly stored in the form of captured charges; those captured charges can be thermally released from the traps at room temperature to result in the characteristic emission of the luminescence ion. Because the release of the captured electrons is durative, the luminescence of the materials shows the property of long life [38,39].

Evaluation of kinetic parameters, i.e. the activation energy (E) of the traps involved in the TL emission, the order of kinetics (b), and the frequency factor (s), associated with the glow peaks of the thermally stimulated luminescence, is one of the most studied subjects in the field of condensed matter physics and a complete description of the thermoluminescent characteristics of a TL material requires to obtain these parameters. There are various methods for evaluating the trapping parameters from TL glow curves. For example, when one of the TL glow peaks is highly isolated from the others, the experimental method such as peak shape method is a suitable method to determine kinetic parameters.

The effect of different UV exposures on the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor and different TL parameters like trap depth, shape factor and frequency factor is calculated. In our case, shape factor (μg
                        ) is lies between 0.42–0.44, which indicates that it is a case of non-first order kinetics, approaching towards second order, responsible for deeper trap depth resulting in the long afterglow.

In order to study the luminescent properties of the phosphor, the excitation and emission spectra of the prepared SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was recorded and shown in Fig. 7a
                        . The excitation spectra were observed in the range of 200–400nm and emission spectra were recorded in the range of 400–750nm. The excitation spectrum in the range 200–400nm consists of the f→f transition of the Dy3+ ion. The excitation spectrum of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor shows strong absorption at 325nm and less intense absorptions at 237, 267 and 364nm, which are ascribed to the transitions from the ground state to excitation states in the 4f9 configuration of Dy3+ but not easy to be clearly assigned due to the dense and somewhat overlapped levels of 4f configuration of Dy3+ in the high energy region. When the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was excited at 325nm, simultaneous emissions of blue (478nm), yellow (580nm) and red (674nm) position were observed. Notice that the red emission is less intense than the blue and yellow emissions. These three different emission bands originated from the one origin owing to their having the same excitation wavelength. The transitions involved in blue, yellow and red bands of Dy3+ ion are well known and have been identified as 4F9/2
                        →
                        6H15/2, 4F9/2

                        6H13/2 and 4F9/2
                        →
                        6H11/2 transitions respectively. One can also find that the emission lines of Dy3+ are broadened somewhat because there are several Stark levels for the 4F9/2
                        →
                        6HJ levels [43].

It is well known that the former weak blue emission at 478nm (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H15/2) is corresponded to the magnetic dipole transition, which hardly varies with the crystal field strength around Dy3+. While the later stronger yellow emission at 580nm (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H13/2) belongs to the hypersensitive forced electric dipole transition, which is strongly influenced by the outside surrounding environment. According to the Judd–Ofelt theory [44], when Dy3+ locates at a low symmetry local site without inversion symmetry, a yellow emission according to the electric dipole transition (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H13/2) will be dominant. Conversely, a magnetic dipole transition (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H15/2) will predominate in the emission spectra, resulting in a strong blue emission. In our case (Fig. 7b
                        ), the yellow emission (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H13/2) will dominate. The strong yellow emission is also beneficial to decrease the color temperature of the phosphor and generate warm white light emission. Moreover, the hardly perceptible transition (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H13/2) emission at 674nm can be observed, which is also due to the disordered crystal field and is corresponding to the structural study. It is notice that the red emission is less intense than the blue and yellow emissions. It is well known that the (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H13/2) transition is hypersensitive and therefore, its intensity strongly depends on the host, while the (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H15/2) transition is less sensitive to the host. The optical properties of the material are often influenced by the structure of the matrix and synthesis technique [45].

When trivalent metallic ions, such as Dy3+ are incorporated into a host lattice and substitute divalent metallic ions, the charge balancing is necessarily required. Due to these chemically nonequivalent substitutions, an excess of positive charge in the host lattice must be compensated. One possible way of charge compensation mechanism is that two Dy3+ ions replace three Sr2+ ions to balance the charge of these phosphors, which create two Dyo

For SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ the incorporation of alkali metal ions can neutralize the charge generated by Dy3+ substitution for Sr2+, and thus stabilize the structure and enhance the luminescence. Dy3+ ions have been often used as co-dopants in the previously developed aluminate and silicate based materials. When divalent alkaline earth ions, such as Ca2+ or Sr2+, is substituted by trivalent Dy3+ in the alkaline earth silicates and aluminates, various defects can be induced due to the charge compensation mechanism [46].

However, in Dy3+ singly doped samples, which are in our current interest, Dy3+ is not only the supplier of traps but also an activator itself. A process of emitting the white light in SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor is illustrated schematically in Fig. 8
                        . After irradiation with the ultraviolet light (process numbered [1]), most of the excitation energy associated with the excited carriers (electrons or holes) will be transferred via the host directly to the luminescence centers, Dy3+, followed by the Dy3+ 4f emissions as the immediate luminescence (process [2]). However, part of the excitation energy will be stored when some of the excited carriers drop into the traps (process [3]), instead of returning to the ground states. Later, with thermal excitation at proper temperature, these carriers will be released from the traps and transferred via the host to the Dy3+ ions, followed by the characteristic Dy3+ emissions as long afterglow (process [4]). In the practical system, the electron traps and the hole traps may not be both equally abundant or important in terms of their contribution to the white light emission, as suggested in Fig. 8 
                        [31].

In general, color of any phosphor material is represented by means of color coordinates. The luminescence color of the phosphor excited under 325nm has been characterized by the CIE (Commission International de I’Eclairage) 1931 chromaticity diagram [47]. The emission spectrum of the Dy3+ doped SrCaMgSi2O7 phosphor was converted to the CIE 1931 chromaticity using the photoluminescent data and the interactive CIE software (CIE coordinate calculator) diagram as shown in Fig. 9
                        . Every natural color can be identified by (x, y) coordinates that are disposed inside the ‘chromatic shoe’ representing the saturated colors. The calculated chromaticity coordinates for the near white light emitted SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor is given by (x
                        =0.3687, y
                        =0.3669), which is in good agreement with the chromaticity coordinates of standard white light (x
                        =0.3333, y
                        =0.3333).


                        Fig. 10
                         shows the typical decay curves of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The initial afterglow intensity of the sample was high. The decay times of phosphor can be calculated by a curve fitting technique, and the decay curves fitted by the sum of two exponential components have different decay times.

                        . The results indicated that the, afterglow decay curves are composed of two regimes, i.e., the initial rapid decaying process and the subsequent slow decaying process.

Dy3+ is an important rare earth ion in the development of phosphors with long lasting afterglow, playing a crucial role. The dopant Dy3+ is a famous trap creating ion, which can greatly prolong the afterglow [48]. It is reasonable to consider that the role of doping Dy3+ ions is to introduce new types of traps or significantly increase the concentration of traps responsible for the afterglow. The afterglow intensity of the persistent phosphor depends on the densities of the traps electrons, while the duration of afterglow depends on the depth of the trapped electrons. The number of trapped charge carrier, in term, depends on the concentration of oxygen vacancies/Dy3+ and the trap depth of it. For a suitable trap depth, the trap concentration is directly depends on the dysprosium ions [49].

Mechanoluminescence (ML) (also known as Triboluminescence) is an important physical phenomenon where an emission of light is observed due to mechanical deformation of materials, when they are subjected to some mechanical stress like rubbing, cleavage, compressing, impulsive deformation, crushing, grinding, shaking, etc. [50]. This phenomenon has been observed in many kinds of solids including ionic crystals, semiconductors, metals, glasses and organic crystals. In the present ML studies, an impulsive deformation technique has been used. During the deformation of a solid, a great number of physical processes may occur within very short time intervals, which may excite or stimulate the process of photon emission. It is seen that when moving piston is released at particular height, then the ML emission also takes place [15].

When a load is applied to the phosphor, initially the ML intensity increases with time, attains a peak value and then decreases with time. Such a curve between the ML intensity and time of phosphors is known as the ML glow curve. Fig. 11
                         shows that the characteristics glow curve between ML intensity versus time for different heights (10, 20, 30, 40, 50cm). The phosphor was fracture via dropping a load [moving piston] of particular mass (400g) and cylindrical shape on the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The velocity of the moving piston, holding the impact mass, could be changed, by changing the height through which it was dropped. Every time for the ML measurement, the quantity of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was kept constant (8mg). The sintered SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was not irradiated by any excitation source. When the moving piston is dropped onto the prepared phosphor at different height, light is emitted. The photon emission time is nearly 2ms, when prepared SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor fractures. In these ML measurements, maximum ML intensity has been obtained for the 50cm dropping height and ML intensity increases with the falling height of the moving piston [27].


                        Fig. 11(inset) shows that the characteristics curve between ML intensity versus impact velocity of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The ML intensity increases linearly with the increases the falling height of the moving piston; that is, the ML intensity depends upon the impact velocity of the moving piton [
                           
                              
                                 
                                    υ
                                 
                                 
                                    0
                                 
                              
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    2
                                    gh
                                 
                              
                           
                         (where “g” is the acceleration due to gravity and “h” is the height through which the load is dropped freely)]. The ML intensity of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor increases with increasing the mechanical stress [48,31].

For the ML in SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor, three mechanisms are possible: (i) charged dislocation model, (ii) piezoelectrification induced electroluminescence model, and (iii) piezo-electrically induced de-trapping model. The charge dislocation model is not applicable because of these following experimental regions: (i) in elastic region the ML intensity of aluminate and silicate phosphors is repetitive, and (ii) intense ML appears when the phosphor is placed in inside transparent illustrating liquid and hydrostatic pressure is applied. As the dislocations cannot move under hydrostatic pressure the dislocation origin of ML is not possible. In the case of phosphor in nanometer size (1–10nm) the mean free path of de-trapped electrons is the order of the crystallite size, which is in the nanometer range. For such value of the mean free path the de-trapped electrons may not get sufficient energy for the impulsive excitation of luminescence centers. In fact, for the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphors of piezo-electrically induced de-trapping model may be applicable.

When a mechanical stress, such as compress, friction, and striking, was applied on the sintered SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphors, piezo-electric field can be produced. Therefore, in such phosphor the ML excitation may be caused by the local piezoelectric field near the impurities and defects in the crystals. During the impact on the material, one of its newly created surfaces gets positively charged and the other surface of the crack gets negatively charged. Thus, an intense electric field of the order of 106–107
                        Voltcm−1 is produced [51]. Under such order of electric field, the ejected electrons from the negatively charged surface may be accelerated and subsequently their impact on the positively charged surfaces may excite the luminescence center. Thus, depending on the prevailing conditions, recombination luminescence may be produced. For the impact velocity υ
                        0, the impact pressure P
                        0 will be equals to, P
                        0
                        =
                        Zυ
                        0, where Z is a constant. With increasing value υ
                        0 of the trap depth will decrease, therefore, for the trap depth beyond a particular pressure the traps will be unstable and they will be de-trapped, in which the number of de-trapped electrons will increases with the increasing impact velocity. Thus, the ML intensity will increase proportionally with increasing value of impact velocity (υ
                        0) [52].

As the impact velocity increases, the impact pressure also increases leading to the increase in the electric field at local region which causes the decrease in trap depth. Hence the probability of de-trapping increases. From Fig. 11(inset), it can be seen that with increasing impact velocity, ML intensity also increases linearly i.e., the ML intensity of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphors are lineally proportional to the magnitude of the impact velocity. When the surface of an object was coated with the ML materials, the stress distribution in the object beneath the layer could be reflected by the ML brightness and could be observed. Based on the above analysis these phosphors can also be used as sensors to detect the stress of an object [27,31].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In summary, dysprosium doped strontium magnesium di-silicate phosphor are successfully synthesized by the solid state reaction method. The result reveals that the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ has the same crystal structure as Sr2MgSi2O7 and Ca2MgSi2O7 and the crystal structure is consistent with standard tetragonal crystallography. From TL glow curve, initially TL intensity increase with increasing UV irradiation time and maximum for 10min irradiation time. It is predicted that, with the increasing UV irradiation time, density of charge carrier may have been increasing, but after a specific irradiation time, charge carriers density decreases, results in decreasing the TL intensity. Under the ultra-violet (UV) excitation, the prepared SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor would emit blue, yellow and red light with peak at 478nm, 580nm and 674nm corresponds to the transitions of 4F9/2
                     →
                     6H15/2, 4F9/2
                     →
                     6H13/2 and 4F9/2
                     →
                     6H11/2 respectively. The three emission bands of the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor combines to give out white light, which was confirmed from the calculated CIE coordinates which were found to be very close to standard white light for human eyes. It is worthy to note that the dependence between ML intensity of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ and the impact velocity is close to linearity, which suggests these phosphors can also be used as sensors to detect the stress of an object. Thus, the solid state reaction method furnishes a simple method for preparing a silicate based phosphors.
