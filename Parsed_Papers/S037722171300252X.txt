                  The notion of drawdown is central to active portfolio management. Conditional Drawdown-at-Risk (CDaR) is defined as the average of a specified percentage of the largest drawdowns over an investment horizon and includes maximum and average drawdowns as particular cases. The necessary optimality conditions for a portfolio optimization problem with CDaR yield the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) stated in both single and multiple sample-path settings. The drawdown beta in the CAPM has a simple interpretation and is evaluated for hedge fund indices from the HFRX database in the single sample-path setting. Drawdown alpha is introduced similarly to the alpha in the classical CAPM and is evaluated for the same hedge fund indices. Both drawdown beta and drawdown alpha are used to prioritize hedge fund strategies and to identify instruments for hedging against market drawdowns.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is one of the fundamental and most influential concepts in modern finance. It is closely related to portfolio theory and finds its application in portfolio risk management, fund performance measurement, security valuation, etc. The CAPM was developed by Sharpe [35], Lintner [16], and Mossin [22] and can be viewed from two perspectives:
                        
                           (i)
                           The CAPM is a reformulation of the necessary optimality conditions for the Markowitz’s mean–variance portfolio problem and, thus, inherently depends on the definition of risk as variance.

The CAPM is a single-factor linear model (security market line) that relates the expected returns of an asset and a market portfolio, in which the slope, called asset beta, serves as a measure of asset non-diversifiable (systematic) risk.

Owing to its idealized assumptions, e.g. the use of variance as a measure of risk and homogeneity of risk preferences, the CAPM fails to “predict” stock returns accurately enough. Moreover, extensive empirical evidence shows that factors other than market portfolio contribute to stock return variations. Nevertheless, the CAPM, being mathematically simple, still offers a quick quantitative insight into risk-reward interplay and remains a major benchmark for asset pricing. Since its conception, the CAPM has been extended largely in three main directions: (i) relaxing or changing the assumptions under which the CAPM was derived, (ii) identifying new factors as explanatory variables for stock returns, and (iii) using different risk measures for portfolio valuation; see [23,12] for detailed CAPM reviews. Prominent CAPM extensions in the first direction include an intertemporal CAPM [20] and Black-Litterman model [3] that incorporates investor views on asset returns. Also, to lessen beta intertemporal instability, Levy [15] and Fabozzi and Francis [10] introduced several definitions of bear/bull market and applied the CAPM to different time periods separately. The second direction is aligned with the arbitrage pricing theory (APT), which explains asset returns through linear models with several factors and is often viewed as an empirical counterpart of the CAPM. Exemplary contributions to the APT are the works of Ross [32], Banz [2], Rosenberg [31], Burmeister and Wall [4], etc. to name just a few, whereas the Fama and French three-factor model [11] is now widely accepted as a CAPM empirical successor. Recently, Ranaldo [24] suggested higher distribution moments as factors for hedge fund pricing. As for the use of different risk measures in place of variance, Markowitz [18] himself acknowledged the shortcomings of variance and proposed the mean-semivariance approach to portfolio selection. In fact, standard deviation and lower semideviation are particular examples of general deviation measures [27] that are not necessarily symmetric with respect to ups and downs of a random variable and can be customized to tailor investor’s risk preferences. Rockafellar et al. [28–30] developed mean-deviation approach to portfolio selection as an extension of the Markowitz’s mean–variance approach and generalized a number of classical results, including the one-fund theorem [28], the CAPM [29] and the existence of market equilibrium with investors using different deviation measures [30].

After 60years of intensive CAPM research, the search for an informative and yet simple one-factor model explaining stock returns continues. So far, the theoretical approach through the portfolio theory to finding risk or deviation measures for a portfolio problem that would improve the CAPM has had limited success. This could be partially explained by the fact that one-period models ignore sequential structure of returns. For example, if pairs of returns for an asset and a market portfolio corresponding to different time moments are reshuffled, the covariance of the returns will not be affected. However, from the investment perspective, the original return sequence and the reshuffled one are unlikely to be viewed equally. In fact, investors are concerned not only about magnitude of asset losses but also about their sequence. One of the measures that capture this phenomenon is based on asset drawdown, which at each time moment is the drop of the asset cumulative return from its peak value since the time of investment or monitoring. Usually, investors quit an investment fund after either a single large drawdown (greater than 20%) or a small but prolonged drawdown (over a year). As a result, active portfolio management imposes several constraints on fund drawdowns [5]. Funds can be compared by Managed Account Reports (MAR) ratio, which is similar to Sharpe ratio [36] and is defined as the ratio of fund compound annual return from inception to the fund maximum drawdown from inception. However, the MAR ratio and similar Calmar (Sterling) ratio (also based on the notion of drawdown) do not involve market portfolio, and thus, are unable to identify funds producing positive returns when the market portfolio is in drawdown. In other words, these ratios are not substitutes for drawdown beta, which can identify instruments for hedging against market drawdowns.

The goal of this work is twofold: (i) to define drawdown beta β
                     DD and to demonstrate empirically that β
                     DD is an informative measure of asset performance for hedging against market drawdowns and (ii) to lay down a theoretical foundation for β
                     DD through portfolio theory. Grossman and Zhou [13] were arguably the first to solve a portfolio problem with a constraint on portfolio relative drawdown with a single risky asset in a continuous-time setting, whereas Cvitanic and Karatzas [8] extended Grossman and Zhou’s approach to the case of several risky assets, and recently, Yang and Zhong [37] adopted the Cvitanic and Karatzas’ continuous-time solution to a discrete-time setting with a rolling time window. The line of research on portfolio optimization under drawdown constraints was further advanced in [34,7], where in particular, Cherny and Obloj [7] showed that in the setup of Grossman and Zhou, the problem of maximizing the long-term growth rate of the expected utility of wealth under a drawdown constraint could be reduced to an unconstrained problem with a modified utility function. Also, Elie and Touzi [9] studied an optimal consumption-investment problem with an infinite horizon and a drawdown constraint. Other relevant works on drawdown include capital allocation strategies with a drawdown constraint [21], mean–variance portfolio problem with drawdown constraints [1], drawdown modeling and estimation [19,17], and empirical studies [14]. At this point, it should be noted that for a given investment horizon, portfolio drawdowns are either a function in a continuous-time setting or a time series in a discrete-time setting, and while portfolio drawdowns can be constrained at each time period, they cannot be easily compared to drawdowns of other portfolios even for the same investment horizon. In other words, to characterize portfolio risk for the whole investment period, drawdowns (function or time series) should be translated into a single number, or, equivalently, into drawdown measure. For a single sample-path of portfolio return, Chekhlov et al. [5] proposed a drawdown measure, called Conditional Drawdown-at-Risk (CDaR), as the average of a specified percentage of the largest drawdowns over the investment horizon. In the followup work, Chekhlov et al. [6] extended CDaR definition for the multiple sample-path case and formulated a portfolio optimization problem with CDaR, which was reduced to linear programming with the Rockafellar–Uryasev formula for Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) 
                     [25,26]. In fact, CDaR possesses all the properties of a deviation measure: it is convex, positive homogeneous, nonnegative, and invariant to constant translation. This suggests that the approach used to derive the CAPM with general deviation measures in [28,29] can be applied to obtain the CAPM with CDaR. Several case studies on portfolio optimization with CDaR and real data from hedge funds are available at the University of Florida Financial Engineering Test Problems webpage.

This work derives necessary optimality conditions for a portfolio optimization problem with CDaR, similar to the one addressed in [6], and reformulates the conditions in the form of CAPM yielding definition for the drawdown beta β
                     DD. The drawdown beta has a simple interpretation and depends on the confidence level α
                     ∈[0,1] that determines the percentage of the largest drawdowns in CDaR with α
                     =0 and α
                     =1 corresponding to the average and maximum drawdowns, respectively. The drawdown beta and classical beta have a clear distinction: drawdown beta accounts only for periods when the market portfolio is in drawdown and ignores asset performance when the market portfolio goes up, whereas the classical beta evaluates correlation between returns of the asset and market portfolio over the whole period. To some extent, β
                     DD is similar to the bear market beta introduced in [10], which also concentrates on poor market performance, but in contrast to β
                     DD, has no portfolio optimization rationale.

The paper is organized into four sections. Section 2 formulates the portfolio optimization problem with CDaR and derives the necessary optimality conditions, which are then restated as CAPM in the multiple sample-path setting. Section 3 presents the CAPM with CDaR in the case of a single sample-path and evaluates β
                     DD for hedge fund indices from the HFRX database. It also introduces the drawdown alpha (similar to the classical alpha) as asset excess return compared to the CAPM prediction and evaluates drawdown alphas for the same hedge fund indices. Section 4 concludes the paper.

The classical CAPM establishes a linear relationship between the expected rate of return of an asset and the expected rate of return of a market portfolio, where the slope of the linear relationship is called asset beta and is defined as the ratio of the covariance of the asset and market portfolio rates to the variance of the market rate. If the asset beta and the expected rate of the market portfolio are known or given, the CAPM “predicts” the asset expected rate of return. However, asset beta can be defined differently thereby leading to a non-classical CAPM. In fact, it is closely related to a risk or deviation measure used in a portfolio selection problem yielding an optimal portfolio. This section formulates portfolio optimization problems with CDaR and presents their necessary optimality conditions in the form of the CAPM in the multiple sample-path setting.

As in the case of a single sample-path, the CDaR definition (3) includes two special cases: (i) for α
                        =1, D
                        1(w) is the maximum drawdown, also called drawdown from peak-to-valley, and (ii) for α
                        =0, D
                        0(w) is the average drawdown.

                        (x)) is a convex and positively homogeneous function of x (see [6]). The problem (6) is similar to Markowitz’s portfolio selection, in which portfolio variance is replaced by portfolio CDaR, whereas the problem (7) is used in active portfolio management, where w
                        
                           p
                        (x) is the portfolio profit; see [5]. The problems (6) and (7) are both convex and are equivalent in the sense that by varying Δ in (6) and ν in (7), the same set of optimal solutions (called efficient frontier) will be generated.

The portfolio problems (6) and (7) lead to the same necessary optimality conditions for portfolio weights, which can be stated in the form of CAPM. It is assumed that the constraint

The drawdown beta β

                      Portfolio 2 and S&P500 index being the instrument and the “optimal” portfolio, respectively, for the period from January 2005 to June 2012 with 90 monthly periods (T
                     =90) and τ
                     =90. Figs. 2 and 3
                     
                      both show the uncompounded cumulative rates of return for the AORDA Portfolio 2 and for the S&P500 index from January 2005 to June 2012. The S&P500 index peaked in October 2007, and its uncompounded cumulative rate of return from January 2005 to October 2007 was about 25.4%. From October 2007 to February 2009, the S&P500 index lost 70.28%, which was its maximum drawdown. During the same period, the AORDA Portfolio 2 earned 76.39%. Consequently, the MaxDD beta (α
                     =1) for the AORDA Portfolio 2 is given by β
                     DD
                     =−76.39%/70.28%=−1.09; see Fig. 2. If α

From October 2007 to February 2009 and from October 2007 to March 2009, the S&P500 index lost 70.28% and 61.74%, respectively, which were the two largest drawdowns. During the same periods, the AORDA Portfolio 2 earned 76.39% and 82.37%, respectively. Therefore, the CDaR beta for the AORDA Portfolio 2 with α
                     =0.978 is given by

Further, drawdown betas are used to analyze the performance of hedge fund indices from the HFRX database, which are benchmarks characterizing performance of a large universe of hedge fund strategies. Funds, included into an HFRX index, have either (a) at least $50 million under management or (b) a track record of greater than twelve months. For each hedge fund index, four betas are evaluated: average drawdown (AvDD) beta (α
                     =0), CDaR beta with α
                     =0.9, maximum drawdown (MaxDD) beta (α
                     =1), and the standard beta from the classical CAPM. The S&P500 index is used as a proxy for the market portfolio in place of the optimal portfolio. The results are shown in Table 1
                     . Of special interest are hedge fund indices with negative betas, which, in general, indicate the ability of an index to generate positive returns when the market goes down. The question is whether CDaR betas provide additional information on hedging capabilities, compared to the standard beta. Table 1 is ordered by the AvDD beta (third column). Numbers in brackets next to the 90%-CDaR beta, MaxDD beta, and the standard beta are ranks in the ordering by the corresponding column; e.g. EH: Short Bias Index is at the 33rd place according to the AvDD beta, however, it has the lowest standard beta that puts it on the first place in the ordering by standard beta. Table 1 shows that in the majority of cases, CDaR betas with different confidence levels demonstrate consistent performance, i.e. all three CDaR betas are either positive or negative. Nevertheless, this is not always the case. For instance, RV: Multi-Strategy Index shows the positive MaxDD beta, positive 90%-CDaR beta, and negative AvDD beta (see Fig. 4
                     ). This fund has good hedging characteristics and generates positive returns in the majority of cases when the market goes down (AvDD beta is negative). However, the positive MaxDD beta indicates that when the market was in the largest (maximum) drawdown, the fund lost money.

The absolute majority of funds in Table 1 have positive standard betas, which is not encouraging for hedging purposes; still, these funds have the negative AvDD betas, which indicates that, on average, they hedge the market. The conceptual difference between CDaR betas and the standard betas is that the standard beta accounts for the fund returns over the whole return history, including the periods when the market goes up, whereas CDaR betas focus only on market drawdowns and, thus, are not affected when the market performs well.

Obviously, the best hedging fund provides positive payoffs both for light and severe market drawdowns and, therefore, has negative CDaR betas for all confidence levels. The AORDA Portfolio 2 shows superior hedging characteristics and has the most negative CDaR betas for all confidence levels α. Nevertheless, it does not have the lowest standard beta, which was demonstrated by EH: Short Bias Index.

Similar to CDaR betas, CDaR alphas are used to prioritize the performance of 80 hedge fund indices from the HFRX database and are evaluated by (13), where the corresponding CDaR betas are given in Table 1,

                      (the average long-term annual rate of return of the S&P500 index). Table 2
                      presents annualized average drawdown (AvDD) alpha (α
                     =0), 90%-CDaR alpha, maximum drawdown (MaxDD) alpha (α
                     =1) and standard alpha for 80 HFRX indices and for the AORDA Portfolio 2. The indices are ordered with respect to the AvDD alpha, but they could also be ordered by other columns. The rank of each index with respect to other alphas is indicated in brackets next to the corresponding value of alpha. The orderings by AvDD alpha and AvDD beta are close with few exceptions. For instance, MLP Index, located in the 4th line of Table 2, has the 4th largest AvDD alpha (20.8%) and only 22nd lowest AvDD beta (−0.278).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The necessary optimality conditions for a portfolio problem that either minimizes or constrains the CDaR measure of portfolio rates of return over a given time period have been formulated in the form of CAPM in the single and multiple sample-path settings. The percentage of the worst drawdowns to be accounted for in the CDaR is controlled by the confidence level α
                     ∈[0,1] with α
                     =1 and α
                     =0 corresponding to the maximum and average drawdowns, respectively. The CDaR beta and CDaR alpha can be used to prioritize financial instruments, but in contrast to the standard beta based on standard deviation, they can identify instruments that hedge against market drawdowns, which is a critical advantage when hedging is especially needed. For instance, the maximum drawdown beta of −1 indicates that an instrument generated positive return equal to the largest market drawdown over the market peak-to-valley period. The case study, based on the HFRX database of hedge fund indices, has shown that the CDaR beta can be negative, while the standard beta is positive, which provides an alternative view on hedging capabilities of instruments.
