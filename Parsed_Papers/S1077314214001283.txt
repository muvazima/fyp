                  A relative pose and target model estimation framework using calibrated multicamera clusters is presented. It is able to accurately track up-to-date relative motion, including scale, between the camera cluster and the (free-moving) completely unknown target object or environment using only image measurements from a set of perspective cameras. The cameras within the cluster may be arranged in any configuration, even such that there is no spatial overlap in their fields-of-view. An analysis of the set of degenerate motions for a cluster composed of three cameras is performed. It is shown that including the third camera eliminates many of the previously known ambiguities for two-camera clusters. The estimator performance and the degeneracy analysis conclusions are confirmed in experiment with ground truth data collected from an optical motion capture system for the proposed three-camera cluster against other camera configurations suggested in the literature.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many researchers have studied the use of visual feedback for environment mapping and camera localization, principally within two areas; mobile/industrial robotics, and computer vision. The robotics community refers to the problem as visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and frames it in terms of online tracking of a position and orientation state estimate (pose) with respect to an unknown environment through an image sequence [1]. On the other hand, the Structure From Motion (SFM) problem in computer vision focuses primarily on offline reconstruction of the 3D scene geometry using 2D image measurements over a (sparse) set of discrete camera frames [2].

Recently, the trend has been to move away from using monocular or conventional-stereo cameras to perform localization and structure estimation, to using more sophisticated imaging systems, including camera clusters [3]. A camera cluster is composed of any number of simple perspective cameras mounted rigidly with respect to each other. An example configuration is shown in Fig. 1
                     .

The use of a multicamera cluster for localization and target modeling has several advantages over other camera systems. The individual cameras can be arranged into any configuration, including those with no spatial overlap in the camera fields-of-view (FOV) to make the most effective use of available camera pixels. Even without FOV overlap, non-zero baselines between the individual camera centers allows for full global motion scale recovery. Additionally, the cameras can be configured such that small translation–rotation motion ambiguities [4] in one camera are compensated for by other cameras facing in orthogonal directions. With the large collective FOV and increased sensitivity, localization accuracy is dramatically improved when compared with monocular and stereo configurations. This is possible even when there is no inter-camera feature correspondence throughout the entire motion sequence.

The intuition behind how a calibrated cluster is able to track its relative motion without finding correspondence between point features across cameras is as follows. Each individual camera is able to estimate its own local motion increment up-to-scale in its own frame using its image sequence. Using the known cluster calibration, these local motions are combined to find the unique cluster translation and rotation which includes the proper scale value. Therefore, the world scale is embedded in the camera cluster extrinsic calibration.

This work presents an estimation system capable of tracking the relative position and orientation of a calibrated camera cluster with respect to an unknown target object or environment. Additionally, it is demonstrated through analysis and experimentation that a cluster composed of three or more non-collinear cameras is able to overcome the estimation degeneracies of two-camera systems identified in the literature [5,6]. The nonlinear estimation problem can be solved using a single recursive filter that is initialized using only the first set of image measurements from the cluster cameras. Finally, the tracked target object or environment is free to move independently of the cluster motion since only relative measurements are used for the estimation, thereby solving a superset of the SLAM problem.

An ideal application of this algorithm would be one in which the camera cluster is surrounded by a moving target which is visible in the non-overlapping FOV of more than one of the component cameras at the same point in time. One example would be an aerial robot maneuvering in close proximity to a moving ship during a docking or inspection task. In this case, both the camera cluster and the target are in free motion, and auxiliary sensors such as Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receivers or Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) mounted on the robot cannot be used to estimate the relative motion since they provide a measure of only the cluster motion in an Earth-fixed coordinate frame. Applicability of these multicamera clusters will increase with the continued miniaturization of robotic systems and sensors as it will be more likely that the vehicle will need to operate in or around a moving target.

The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 contains a detailed review of existing techniques using camera clusters for motion and structure estimation; Section 3 presents the proposed multicamera cluster pose estimation framework, including parameterizations and the initialization process; a novel degeneracy analysis for a three-camera cluster is presented in Section 4 to identify motion sets leading to solution scale ambiguity; experimental results demonstrating and evaluating the performance of the proposed method with a variety of cluster configurations are provided in Section 5; finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

The use of calibrated non-overlapping camera clusters for motion and structure estimation has largely been inspired by the work of Fermuller and Aloimonos [4]. In that work, it is demonstrated that a single perspective camera with a limited FOV will have fundamental problems estimating 3D motion due to confusion between some translations and rotations. However, the ambiguities disappear when the FOV is increased to cover the entire viewing sphere. Accordingly, Baker et al. [3] propose the Argus Eye camera cluster composed of six perspective cameras placed in back-to-back pairs on each of the Cartesian axes. Since the cameras have their optical centers displaced from each other, the system allows for full metric reconstruction of the relative pose and target model, including scale, without using traditional stereo point correspondence techniques. The advantages of this configuration were further confirmed by Pless [7] using the Fisher Information matrix for a variety of camera setups.

There are two important requirements for successful scale recovery with any multicamera setup. First, the distance between the camera centers must be sufficiently large compared to the depth of the point features. If the features are too far away for a particular camera baseline length, the scale information is lost in the image measurement noise. This observation was used by Kim et al. [8] to justify their assumption that a camera cluster can be approximated as a spherical camera when the features were far enough away relative to the distance between the camera centers. In that case, their assumption does not allow for the scale to be determined. If scale recovery with non-overlapping FOV is required, the ratio of the cluster baseline length to point feature depth must be kept sufficiently large. As a result, the method in the current work is best suited for applications such as docking, grasping, or close-pursuit. When this ratio is not suitable for scale recovery, a camera cluster estimator with the parameterization presented in Section 3 will recover an accurate up-to-scale solution, but the scale of the solution would remain uncertain.

The second requirement is that the relative motion of the cluster and target object or environment must not fall into the set of critical motions [5], for which the solution becomes degenerate and the global scale is ambiguous. The set of critical motions has previously been identified for a cluster consisting of two cameras [5,6]. The two-camera cluster experiences critical motion whenever the two camera centers move in concentric circles with a common center on the line through the optical centers of the cameras before and after the motion. This includes many common motions such as pure translations (circles of infinite radius), pure rotations, and constant radius turns. These profiles represent a large set of common motions and make scale recovery difficult.

Previous motion estimation algorithms using camera clusters can be categorized using two criteria. The first criterion relates to the point at which the camera images are combined to find the global cluster motion:
                        
                           
                              Decoupled – Individual cameras in the cluster estimate their own local motion increment and global cluster motion is subsequently found by combining these motion estimates.


                              Coupled – All camera image measurements are considered concurrently when generating the cluster global motion estimate.

Methods using the decoupled strategy, combining local motion estimates from individual cameras, suffer from the same issues of reduced accuracy and sensitivity to motion ambiguities as in monocular techniques, primarily stemming from limited FOV. Additionally, the combination step that resolves the global motion and scale does not properly account for camera image measurement noise. Finally, all cameras must each observe a sufficient number of feature points in order to estimate their own local motion. A preferable solution is the coupled strategy which considers all image measurements across all cameras to determine the global motion directly.

The second criterion relates to whether the global cluster motion is accumulated through increments or determined relative to a generated target environment model:
                        
                           
                              Visual odometry (VO) – Considers only a small set of current and previous camera frames to estimate the cluster motion increment, which is then accumulated into the global motion trajectory.


                              Localization – Builds a model of the unknown target object or environment through the image sequence, and the cluster position and orientation is localized with respect to the model.

Because the sensitivity of global solution scale is low due to the baseline-to-feature depth ratio requirement, and the prevalence of critical motions, the scale of each motion increment in the VO methods will accumulate error in the global estimate which will not be corrected through the sequence. For this reason, it is beneficial to maintain a model of the target as in the localization methods. If there is an error in the estimated scale of the solution, it will be reflected in the generated model and can be corrected over time when the relative motion is not critical.

There are several decoupled VO methods in the literature [9,10,5,11], and all suffer from the limitations of both decoupled and VO approaches. Li et al. improve on these by introducing a coupled VO method that uses the General Epipolar Constraint (GEC) [7] to linearly solve for the global motion of a non-overlapping camera cluster [12], similar to the eight-point algorithm [13] for a single camera.

Ragab and Wong [14] present a decoupled localization method in which they mount two back-to-back camera pairs on a robot. The camera cluster has non-overlapping FOV but each camera tracks its own motion using a separate extended Kalman filter (EKF), which are later combined to find global motion. There are also several coupled localization methods. In [15,16], Kaess and Dellaert mount eight perspective cameras to a robot in a ring facing outwards. The system solves the SLAM problem, but requires either odometry, a dynamics model, or a good initial estimate to proceed. Both Sola et al. [17] and Kim et al. [6] present coupled recursive SLAM systems which consider a stereo camera setup as two monocular cameras with some FOV overlap. The methods use an EKF to estimate the structure of the environment, the relative motion, and, for Sola et al., even the orientation parameters of the cluster extrinsic calibration. The systems are similar to the one proposed in Section 3, however, these methods use the overlap in the FOV of the cameras and explicitly match point features across the cameras. This allows them to operate despite the critical motions of the two-camera cluster, but limits the collective FOV, and therefore, the accuracy of the estimation. The effect of the narrow FOV will be demonstrated in Section 5.

In this work, it is shown by analysis that adding a third camera to the system avoids almost all of the two-camera cluster critical motions. This mitigates the requirement for the small FOV overlap from previous systems, which in turn, improves the accuracy of the solution. In the next section, the coupled framework using a single estimator is presented. The system is able to resolve global scale, without FOV overlap, and is simple to implement and initialize for completely unknown target environments or moving objects from the first set of measurements.

The calibrated multicamera cluster estimation in this work considers a set of one or more (preferably, three or more) rigidly-connected perspective cameras as a single vision sensor. This allows the estimation to proceed using a single recursive filter. The formulation used is similar to that found in the work of Sola et al. [17], as well as Kim et al. [6].

An individual perspective camera is modeled as a simple pin-hole imaging device, which maps 3D points onto a 2D plane called the image plane [18]. An example is shown in Fig. 2

The tracked target object or environment, henceforth referred to simply as the target, is assumed to be a rigid body which contains a set of visible point features. A point feature is a visually distinguishable point on the tracked physical target that corresponds to a unique 3D position in a local target coordinate frame and is measurable in a set of camera images through a relative motion sequence. Image measurements of these point features are extracted from the images using image processing techniques, including feature extraction algorithms like the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) [21], or Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) [22].

The locations of the point features are initially unknown to the estimation system, but are constrained to be fixed with respect to each other. This allows for the relative target pose to be fully characterized by six parameters representing the position and orientation of a local target model frame, M, with respect to the camera cluster frame,

The position of each point feature within a keyframe is represented using a refinement of the Inverse Depth Parameterization (IDP) introduced by Civera et al. in [24]. IDP encapsulates the relative position uncertainty arising from bearing-only measurement systems in a single inverse depth parameter instead of distributing it over all parameters used to define a feature location. Civera et al. demonstrate that the uncertainty in the inverse depth parameter is well-approximated by a Gaussian distribution for low-parallax motion. Additionally, the position is more effectively estimated using the EKF since the resulting measurement model has better linearity properties than when the feature parameters are the Cartesian coordinates. Since, the linearizations are valid over a larger region, propagating the Gaussian state estimates through the process and measurement equations results in more Gaussian-like distributions and the filter is able to provide more accurate estimates and converge over a larger set of initial conditions [24].

In typical IDP, the feature point position in the local target model frame is the sum of an initial observation point and an observation ray. In the system presented here, the IDP is modified such that the initial observation point for the point feature is the camera frame origin of the anchor keyframe in which it is first observed, as shown in Fig. 3

                         is the distance along those bearings to the point feature position. By allowing many features to share this common point, the number of parameters is significantly reduced, from six per feature to three per feature plus six per keyframe, and the system is better constrained as a result.

                         is the rotation matrix formed by the MRP.

The second set within the states contains the keyframes associated with the camera cluster and are represented by six parameters for each keyframe, expressing the pose of the camera cluster frame with respect to the target model frame when the keyframe is captured. Accordingly, the keyframes vector is composed of the parameters for all of the keyframes,

When using a recursive filter, such as the EKF, it is necessary to provide a motion model which describes the dynamics of the system states. The relative motion dynamics are approximated by the generic constant velocity process model [1]. This model assumes that the time-derivatives of the six pose parameters are subject to random walk [27], and integrates them into the position states accordingly. At time step t,

                        . An example of this chain of transformations is shown for a simple back-to-back two-camera cluster in Fig. 4

The full system measurement vector 
                           
                              z
                           
                         is made up of all of the individual point feature observations at the current time step. It is modeled as a stacked column vector of measurements of the form (29).

With this state-space representation, it is now a matter of applying the recursive filter to the set of camera images as they are retrieved at each time step to produce an estimate of the full system state.

An advantage of the proposed formulation is the ability to initialize the estimator system and successfully track the relative pose and target model structure through a trajectory from the first set of cluster image measurements with no prior knowledge of the target or motion. At start-up, the initial cluster pose is fixed coincident with the target model frame,

This keyframe pose is also known with perfect certainty and the parameters are not subject to disturbance noise. Technically, this first keyframe pose does not need to be included in the state vector since it has zero uncertainty and is not subject to disturbance noise. However, it is included here for clarity and consistency.

Finally, all of the parameter estimates for the point features observed in each of the first set of camera images are initialized using their image plane measurements,

The estimation is now ready to proceed iteratively or recursively until the algorithm determines, through some set of heuristics on the current state (e.g. normed distance of cluster pose parameters to set of keyframe poses, minimum number of estimated point features are observed, threshold on current pose uncertainty, etc.) that it should add another keyframe to the model. At this time, the estimated state vector is augmented with another set of six keyframe pose parameters extracted from the current relative pose transformation through

For a camera cluster in general motion, the scale of the environment can be determined using the known extrinsic calibration of the cluster cameras. However, there exist a set of critical motions, dependent on the geometry of the camera cluster, for which the solution to the estimation problem is degenerate and the system scale cannot be recovered. In other words, the shape of the motion and target object are found, but not the absolute size.

The critical motions of a cluster consisting of two cameras have been studied by Clipp et al. [5] and Kim et al. [6]. It was demonstrated that the scale cannot be determined when the cluster motion causes the camera centers to move in concentric circles, as shown in Fig. 5
                     . This comprises a large portion of typical robotic or vehicular motion (e.g. a robot arm with revolute joints, a car travelling in a straight line or in a constant-radius turn). During these motions the scale of the environment is unrecoverable.

In this section, it is shown that adding a third camera to the cluster significantly reduces the set of critical motions when compared with the two-camera cluster case. Consider the combined state and parameter estimation for a non-overlapping three-camera cluster observing a set of point features over two keyframes, as shown in Fig. 6
                     . Each camera has its own mutually exclusive set of point features which it observes at both keyframes. That is, if a point feature is observed by camera i at the first keyframe, it is observed by only camera i at the current keyframe and no other cameras. The correspondence of point features is only performed across keyframes within the same camera.

As shown in (30), the system measurements are parameterized as a set of four transformations, followed by a projection. Before the projection, the position of the point feature defined in camera h and keyframe k, transformed into the coordinate frame of the observing camera i and keyframe r is written,

                         is studied to identify the set of critical motions for the three-camera cluster when using an estimator based on this approach.

In this section, the following assumptions will be made regarding the system:
                           
                              A1.
                              The three cameras in the system are rigidly fixed in a configuration such that their centers are unique and not collinear.

Each of the three cameras observe a disjoint set of at least three non-collinear point features at the two keyframes. The point features are not on the camera x–y plane at either keyframe, and are not infinitely far from the camera.

The five up-to-scale motion parameters describing relative orientation and translation direction of the individual cameras within the cluster are determined a priori from the single camera ego-motion problem, for which numerous techniques exist (e.g. [19,28,1,23]).

The purpose of A3 is to simplify the system such that the scale-degenerate motions can be identified in the subsequent analysis. The full set of degeneracies associated with the coupled system state (11) are difficult to determine due to the high dimensionality of the system. However, A3 allows for the identification of those motions which, despite the extra information from the up-to-scale motion estimate, are unable to recover the global scale of the cluster motion and target structure. Therefore, the critical motions identified in this section are a subset of those for the system in Section 3 but are sufficient conditions for scale degeneracy.

Of interest are the conditions when the measurements from the camera cluster allow for estimation of the final degree of freedom, corresponding to the translation magnitude and therefore, global system scale. The cluster translation is written as,

                         are zero when one or more of the above cases are true for each of the point features in the system. When there is no relative rotation, the system is always degenerate. If there is some non-zero rotation, condition (i) can only be satisfied for at most one of the cameras with its center at the cluster frame origin.

When the translation of a camera center is coplanar with the cluster translation and the point feature position in the first keyframe, the corresponding

                         element is zero by condition (ii). This condition is unlikely to occur in a practical system as each camera will observe several point features at any keyframe such that there is a non-empty subset of features that are not coplanar with the translation and baseline change.

Condition (iii) is independent of the locations of the point features and depends solely on the motion of the camera cluster. For all of the elements of

                        In the two-camera cluster case, condition (72) leads to the concentric circle critical motions which cause the camera centers to move in parallel. For the non-collinear three-camera case studied here, the centers move in parallel in a much smaller set of motions. With non-zero rotation, it is only possible for the system to be in a critical motion when the axis of rotation of the keyframe orientation

Therefore, for the system to be degenerate, the rotation axis for the relative keyframe orientation must be completely in the camera center plane, and the resulting motion must cause all three camera centers to move in parallel. This is a much smaller set of critical motions than with the two-camera cluster. It still requires rotational motion to resolve the scale, but any component of the rotational axis that is perpendicular to the camera center plane prevents the system from becoming degenerate. For example, an automobile with a three-camera cluster mounted with the center plane parallel to the road would avoid the critical motions during a turning maneuver since the rotation axis is always perpendicular to the camera center plane.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

The objectives of the experiments presented in this section are as follows: to show that an estimator using the parameterization detailed in this work is able to recover the relative pose of an initially unknown target accurately even without spatial overlap between the FOV of the cluster cameras; to demonstrate the flexibility of the parameterization for handling all varieties of cluster configurations; and to demonstrate the benefits of using the third camera against the two-camera cluster with some FOV overlap as in [6,17]. It will be shown that the third camera allows the non-overlapping three-camera cluster to overcome the critical motion degeneracies of the two-camera cluster that necessitated the intersection of the FOV. By lifting that constraint and using a larger collective FOV, the accuracy of the pose estimates is improved.

A camera cluster was constructed, as shown in Fig. 1, as well as a target object consisting of easily detectable point features. Black dots on a white background are used in order to simplify the feature extraction module, which can be considered the front-end to any relative pose estimation system. Even though the artificial black dot features are more reliably detected than more general image features, their 3D locations are still initially completely unknown to the estimator. The design of the front-end feature extraction algorithm is not the focus of this work, so by eliminating the variability introduced by the feature extraction and correspondence phase, these experiments confirm the performance of the estimator and allow for a more direct comparison of cluster configurations.

An optical motion capture system was used to provide accurate ground truth data with which to evaluate the estimates from the algorithm using the various camera configurations. The NaturalPoint OptiTrack system serves a dual purpose in these tests: to facilitate the mutual extrinsic calibration of the individual cluster cameras; and to measure the camera cluster motion to provide accurate ground truth data for the comparison.

The camera cluster, along with the rest of the experimental apparatus, is shown in Fig. 8
                        . The rig is composed of four internally calibrated NaturalPoint V100:R2 USB cameras, as well as a set of infrared (IR) reflecting markers which are tracked with the OptiTrack system. The positioning system is listed as having sub-millimeter accuracy [29].

To relate the ground truth motion measurements with the estimates from the cluster algorithm, the pose of each cluster camera with respect to the IR markers must be known. This extrinsic calibration was performed for each camera with respect to the IR markers on the rig via an eye-in-hand calibration [30], which also provides the relative poses of each of the cameras in the cluster with respect to each other.

Each camera captures greyscale images of 640

                        480pixels at 22Hz, and the shutters are automatically synchronized not only with each other, but also with the motion capture measurements from the OptiTrack system. The four cameras on the rig are separate from the five used in the actual OptiTrack system.

The cameras within the cluster are arranged to allow for comparisons between common configurations – two forward-facing, one rear-facing, and one looking to the side. The two forward-facing cameras have some overlap in their FOV as in Kim et al. [6] and Sola et al. [17], and have a baseline length of approximately 10cm. In these experiments, three different cluster configurations were used under the same relative motion profile: a divergent stereo cluster with some FOV overlap and inter-camera point correspondence when available; a forward–backward–sideways three-camera cluster with non-overlapping FOV as studied in the analysis in Section 4; and a cluster consisting of all four cameras. The estimates from each camera set were then compared to the ground-truth to determine the performance in terms of pose estimate accuracy.

For the test run, the camera rig was moved by hand around the workspace and the image frames from each camera were collected, along with the motion capture ground truth data for each time step. The target object point features were between 1 and 2m away from the camera cluster, simulating a close maneuvering operation. Although only the camera cluster is moved in these tests, the algorithm is estimating relative motion of the cluster and target environment. Since only camera image measurements are used in the estimation, the rigid target environment is also free to move in the world frame. However, the environment is kept static in these tests so that the comparison to the ground truth cluster motion data is valid. The ground-truth relative motion profile used for these tests is shown in Fig. 9
                        .

For these tests, an iterated EKF (IEKF) [31] was used to estimate the system state at each time step. The estimation algorithm was implemented in Matlab and run sequentially on the image frames collected by the camera cluster using the three configurations specified. Videos of the estimator in operation can be viewed at http://wavelab.uwaterloo.ca/?q=multicamera.

The experiments were not implemented in real-time, but instead serve to show the accuracy gains of including additional cameras in the cluster for solving the local SLAM problem. The computational requirements for this method are on the order of similar recursive filter SLAM algorithms (e.g. [1]) which have been demonstrated to operate in real-time with several hundred point features included in the state vector, but are known to grow approximately cubically with the number of features included in the model. While the relatively small environment and time span used in these experiments are sufficient to demonstrate the improved accuracy offered by the camera cluster configurations, for large-scale exploration and model-building operations, the Kalman-type recursive filters are less appropriate. However, there exist several filter adaptations and nonlinear optimization Bundle Adjustment methods to which this formulation can be readily applied [32–36].

The estimation algorithm was run using the three-camera cluster to estimate the relative pose and target model parameters. The absolute values of the estimation errors for the six pose parameters are shown in Fig. 10
                        .

It is evident that despite the non-overlapping FOV, the reduction in the set of critical motions by using the three-camera cluster allows the estimator to readily find the scale of the motion and environment. The resulting position estimates are accurate to less than one percent of the ground-truth distance from the initial position, once the global scale converges. The scale metric, shown in Fig. 11
                        , is calculated as the ratio of the norms of estimated to actual position, and expressed as a percentage.

Moreover, the wide collective FOV provides improved localization constraints resulting in improved overall accuracy of the estimation. These results confirm the conclusions in Section 4 that this framework is able to accurately localize the cluster and model the target object, even in the absence of FOV overlap or inter-camera correspondence by adding the third camera to the cluster.

To see how the three-camera results compare to other common camera configurations, two more tests were run using the same relative motion profile: divergent stereo cameras with FOV overlap; and all four cameras together. The framework presented in this work is able to easily accommodate each of these configurations.

When the divergent stereo configuration is used, the stereo correspondence is solved in a passive manner by matching the image measurements to the existing point features in the target model instead of explicitly matching points between the two camera images and triangulating to find the depth. This alleviates the requirement that the motion of the two-camera cluster be non-critical, since the system scale is resolved by the implicit triangulation of the depth by the estimator using the corresponding point features seen in both cameras at the same time step. However, as discussed previously, this configuration limits the collective FOV of the system and results in poor localization estimates, similar to monocular and binocular camera systems [4].

The resulting magnitude of estimated position errors for the different camera configurations are shown in Fig. 12
                        . The three plots show that the large collective FOV on the three-camera cluster (3-cluster) and the four-camera cluster (4-cluster) improve the accuracy of the estimates well beyond the results of the divergent-stereo configuration (stereo), which has a narrow FOV. Additionally, the 4-cluster is able to converge to the proper global scale faster than the 3-cluster because of the immediate feature correspondence between the front-facing cameras. The 3-cluster must wait for sufficient motion in order to have the global scale converge to the proper value. However, once this occurs, the two wide-FOV cluster configurations show similar performance. Table 1
                         summarizes the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the translation magnitudes for the three cluster configurations.

These results confirm that the three-camera cluster outperforms the divergent stereo case as predicted in the critical motion analysis. The large FOV of the three-camera cluster lends itself to stability in the estimates as more features are visible at any point in the relative motion, and the decreased set of critical motions allows the scale metric to be readily determined without the need for feature correspondence between cameras.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A framework for calibrated multicamera clusters is presented which accurately estimates both relative motion and model structure of the cluster and an unknown rigid target object or environment. An estimator based on this parameterization is able to maintain an online estimate of the relative pose when both the camera cluster and the target are in free motion. The framework is also easily extendable when other measurements, such as GPS, IMUs, or robot motion dynamics are available and the target is stationary in the inertial frame.

Any configuration of perspective cameras may be used, including arrangements with spatially non-overlapping FOV, and the estimator is able to resolve the global motion and model scale as soon as the information is available in the image measurements, assuming the relative motion is not strictly critical or degenerate, and the ratio of camera baseline distance to point feature depth is sufficiently large. A novel analysis of the degenerate configurations was performed to identify the set of critical motions present when using a camera cluster consisting of three cameras arranged with non-overlapping FOV. The set of critical motions, compared with that of the two-camera cluster is significantly reduced with the addition of the third camera, enabling scale-recovery in more generic relative motion profiles.

Finally, experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the estimates using a variety of camera cluster configurations, against a set of high-precision motion tracking system measurements. The degeneracy analysis conclusions are confirmed for the three-camera clusters with the large collective FOV, showing reliable stability and accuracy in the estimates, including the correct scale in general motion profiles. It is shown that because the critical motion set is reduced, it is not necessary to maintain overlap in the FOV, and the non-overlapping three-camera cluster provides more accurate motion estimates compared to the divergent stereo configuration, and is a better choice for high-precision robotic applications.
