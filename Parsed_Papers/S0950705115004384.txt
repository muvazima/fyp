                  In general, pattern classification and regression tasks do not take into consideration the variation in the importance of the training samples. For twin support vector regression (TSVR), this implies that all the training samples play the same role on the bound functions. However, the number of close neighboring samples near to each training sample has an effect on the bound functions. In this paper, we formulate a regularized version of the KNN-based weighted twin support vector regression (KNNWTSVR) called RKNNWTSVR which is both efficient and effective. By introducing the regularization term and replacing 2-norm of slack variables instead of 1-norm, our RKNNWTSVR only needs to solve a simple system of linear equations with low computational cost, and at the same time, it improves the generalization performance. Particularly, we compare four implementations of RKNNWTSVR with existing approaches. Experimental results on several synthetic and benchmark datasets indicate that, comparing to SVR, WSVR, TSVR and KNNWTSVR, our proposed RKNNWTSVR has better generalization ability and requires less computational time.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Based on the Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimensional theory and statistical learning theory [11,44], the support vector machine (SVM) is an extremely powerful kernel-based machine learning tool for pattern classification and regression problems. SVM has been successfully applied to a wide variety of applications [8,16,28,29,31]. To reduce the computational complexity of SVM, various algorithms have been proposed [5,9,34,35,40]. Specifically, weighted support vector regression (WSVR) [17] has been proposed recently by combining the weights to the slack variables in the objective function. This procedure directly shrinks the coefficient of each observation in the estimated functions, and thus it is widely used for minimizing the influence of outliers.

Unlike the standard SVM, which uses a single hyperplane, some recently proposed approaches, such as generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM) [27] and twin support vector machine (TWSVM) [20], use two hyperplanes. TWSVM seeks two non-parallel proximal hyperplanes such that each hyperplane is closest to one of the classes and as far as possible from the other class. The main difference between TWSVM and SVM is that TWSVM solves two smaller size quadratic programming problems (QPPs), whereas SVM solves one large QPP. Experimental results show the effectiveness of TWSVM over SVM and GEPSVM [20]. Inspired by the study of TWSVM, Peng [32] proposed an efficient regressor called twin support vector regression (TSVR), determined by a pair of ϵ-insensitive down- and up- bounds functions by solving two related SVM-type problems. This strategy solves two smaller size QPPs in TSVR instead of a single large QPP that makes learning faster over SVR. To reduce the computational complexity of TSVR, various algorithms have been proposed [2,3,7,10,38,43,45,46,48].

TSVR assumes that all samples are equally weighted. This implies that whether they are important or not, they play the same role on the bound functions. However, different samples should have different effects on the bound functions. Inspired by this observation, Xu and Wang [46] proposed a novel weighted twin support vector regression (WTSVR), where different penalty coefficients are given to the samples that do not satisfy constraints depending on their positions. A point x is important if it owns a great number of nearest neighbors, whereas it is not important if it is an outlier. Motivated by this observation, Xu and Wang [45] proposed a novel K-nearest neighbor weighted twin support vector regression (KNNWTSVR) [45] to make full use of sample knowledge. Specifically, higher weights are given to the samples with more nearest neighbors. On the other hand, lesser weights are given to the samples with a smaller number of nearest neighbors. Successive overrelaxation (SOR) technique is applied to further enhance the computational speed.

The main advantage of SVR is the implementation of the structural risk minimization principle. However, only empirical risk is considered in the primal problems of TSVR, WTSVR and KNNWTSVR. In addition, we note that the dual problems of TSVR, WTSVR and KNNWTSVR require the inverse of positive semi-definite matrices and thus may not be well-conditioned in some situations. To overcome this difficulty, a small regularization term is added, so that the matrix becomes positive-definite. Recently, Shao et al. [39] proposed ϵ-twin support vector regression (ϵ-TSVR) based on TSVR. It also constructs a pair of nonparallel ϵ-insensitive down- and up-bound functions for the unknown regressor. But the difference is that the structural risk minimization principle is implemented by adding the regularization term into the primal problems of TSVR. Again, SOR technique is applied to further enhance the computational speed. In fact, empirical results show that ϵ-TSVR is not only faster but also shows better generalization.

In this paper, we propose reformulating the primal problems of KNNWTSVR by adding regularization terms in the objective functions. By doing this, our new formulation, called RKNNWTSVR, is not only singularity free but also is theoretically supported by the statistical learning theory [37,39,42]. In particular, the 1-norm of the vector of slack variable is replaced with 2-norm to make the objective functions strongly convex. These straightforward, but important changes, lead to a considerably simpler positive definite dual problems (see Eqs. (32) and (34)) with nonnegativity constraints only. Although the changes as indicated above are nonstandard, they have been used effectively in previous work [3,23,24,26,36,41,42]. In theory, the new formulation leads to a robust solution but loses the sparsity characteristic. However, the new formulation does not seem to have a detrimental effect, as can be seen in the experimental results of Section 4. By introducing the regularization term and replacing 1-norm of slack variables with 2-norm, our RKNNWTSVR only needs to solve simple systems of linear equations with low computational cost. At the same time, it improves the generalization performance.

Motivated by [3,14,26], four algorithms are designed to solve the proposed RKNNWTSVR. First, a simple iterative algorithm is presented and its global convergence is established. Second, Newton’s method for an implicit Lagrangian formulation for RKNNWTSVR is presented. However, the objective functions contain non-smooth plus functions. Hence, based on Lee et al. [22] and Peng [33], two methods, using smooth function in place of the plus function followed by the Newton–Armijo algorithm, are proposed. Empirical results on several artificial and benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed formulation compared to SVR, WSVR, TSVR, and KNNWTSVR using multiple performance measures.

In this work, all vectors are taken as column vectors. The inner product of two vectors x, y in the n-dimensional real space Rn
                     , will be denoted by: xty, where xt
                      is the transpose of x. Whenever x is orthogonal to y, we write x⊥y. For

Inspired by the work of TWSVM [20] for classification problems, Peng [32] proposed an efficient twin support vector regression (TSVR) for regression problems. TSVR generates two non-parallel functions corresponding to the ε1-insensitive down- and ε2-insensitive up-bound regressors by solving a pair of QPPs of smaller size instead of solving a single large one as in the classical SVR with the advantage that it is fast and shows better generalization performance.

The linear TSVR algorithm finds the down- and up-bound estimation functions, defined by: for any x ∈ Rn

One observes from the pair of QPPs (6) and (7), each QPP of TSVR determines one of down- or up-bound function by using only one group of constraints compared with the standard SVR. Therefore, TSVR solves two smaller size QPPs rather than solving a single large one as in standard SVR. This implies that TSVR is approximately four times faster than SVR.

For a detailed study on the TSVR formulation, its method of solution and advantages, the interested reader is referred to [32].

Next, the concept of K-nearest neighbor [25,47] and K-nearest neighbor-based weighted TSVR [45] are briefly described.

In TSVR, all samples are equally weighted. This implies that no matter whether they are important or not, they play the same role on the bound functions. It is well-known that different samples have different effects on the bound functions. A point x is more important if it owns a great number of close neighbors. Motivated by this observation, a novel K-nearest neighbor-based weighted twin support vector regression (KNNWTSVR) was recently proposed [45].

                            is introduced to exhibit the importance of a point. A larger value di
                            denotes the i-th sample possesses more neighbors, which implies that the i-th sample is important. Following this concept, a novel KNNWTSVR algorithm is presented in the next sub-section.

The linear KNNWTSVR formulation leads to determining the regressors (5) as the solutions of the following pair of QPPs [45]:

Once the vectors z
                           1 and z
                           2 are computed for (17) and (18), the down- and up-bound functions can be obtained. The end regressor is obtained using (8), the mean of these two functions.

The above approach can be easily extended to nonlinear regressors using the kernel technique. The nonlinear KNNWTSVR seeks the down- and up- bounds of the form (9) which are determined by solving the following pair of QPPs [45]:

Working on similar steps as in the linear case, one obtains the pair of dual QPPs for the nonlinear KNNWTSVR. Specifically, the pair of dual QPPs is derived to be exactly the same as (15) and (16) satisfying (17) and (18) in which α, β ∈ Rm
                            are Lagrange multipliers whereas the augmented matrix G becomes:

Motivated by [26,45], we propose a simpler and reasonable variant of KNNWTSVR called regularized KNN-based weighted twin support vector regression, RKNNWTSVR for short.

Our RKNNWTSVR finds two ϵ-insensitive down- and up-bound estimation functions, defined by:

Note that the non-negativity restrictions on slack variables are dropped in this formulation since they are satisfied automatically at optimality.

For the sake of conciseness, we only consider the dual problem in (24). The Lagrangian function corresponding to the QPP (24) is

Here, we first discuss the differences between primal problems of TSVR, KNNWTSVR, and our RKNNWTSVR.

                                 Unlike TSVR and KNNWTSVR, our RKNNWTSVR implements structural risk minimization principle by introducing extra regularization terms in each objective function so that the problem becomes well-posed. It can not only help to alleviate overfitting issue and improve the generalization performance as in conventional SVR but also introduce invertibility in the dual formulation.

The square of the 2-norm of the vector of slack variables is used in RKNNWTSVR instead of the 1-norm. Hence, the objective functions are strongly convex.

Two parameters c
                                    3 and c
                                    4 introduced in our RKNNWTSVR are the weights between the regularization term and the empirical risk, so that they can be chosen to improve the RKNNWTSVR performance.

The solution of the two modified unconstrained minimization problems (33) and (35) reduces to solving just two systems of linear equations as opposed to solving two quadratic programming problems in TSVR, ϵ-TSVR and KNNWTSVR, which makes RKNNWTSVR extremely simple and efficient.

No external optimizer is necessary for solving the RKNNWTSVR formulation.

We can easily extend the above approach to the nonlinear regressors using the kernel trick. The input data are mapped into a high dimensional feature space by some nonlinear kernel functions. In the feature space, a linear regression function is implemented which corresponds to a nonlinear regression function in the input space.

Assume that the down- and up-bound nonlinear functions are expressed as

There are many ways to solve problems of the form (48). First, we present an iterative algorithm for the solution of the dual QPP (48).

Note that the matrix Q appearing in the dual objective function (48) is positive-definite. Further, there is no upper bound on the dual variable u and no equality constraints. We only have non-negative constraint on u. The information leads us to our simple iterative RKNNWTSVR algorithm (see Algorithm 1
                           ) which requires the inverse of the positive-definite matrix Q at the beginning of the algorithm that does not need any optimization toolbox.

Similar to Lagrangian support vector machine (LSVM) [26], we apply the following simple iterative scheme for solving the problem (48) in Algorithm 1:

                              Remark 2
                              Since Q is symmetric and positive-definite, the dual objective function of the minimization problems (48) is strongly convex and thus we will have a unique solution.

The implicit Lagrangian formulation [14,26] replaces the non-negativity constrained minimization problems (42) and (43) by the following equivalent pair of unconstrained minimization of the implicit Lagrangians:

The proof of the above theorem follows from Theorem 4.2 [14].

Since the objective functions of UMPs (52) and (53) are not twice differentiable, two popular smoothing approaches are used to make the objective functions twice differentiable. Specifically, we replaced the plus function

To solve the UMPs (63) and (64) using Newton–Armijo algorithm, the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix of Lk
                           (., .) should be known. Since the modified UMPs (63) and (64) are smooth, one obtains the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix of Lk

In order to evaluate the efficiency and speed of the proposed RKNNWTSVR, solved by gradient based methods of Section 3.3.1–3.3.3, we investigate the results on several synthetic and publicly available benchmark datasets which are commonly used for machine learning algorithm performance evaluation. In the experiments, we focus on comparison of our Proposed-I, II, III and IV with the conventional SVR, which was solved by LIBSVM [5], WSVR [17], TSVR [32] and KNNWTSVR [45]. All the experiments are carried out in MATLAB R2008b environment on a PC running on Windows 7 OS with 3.30 GHz Intel(R) Core(TM) processor having 4.00 GB of RAM. In order to solve SVR, WSVR and TSVR, the optimization toolbox is used whereas SOR technique is used to solve KNNWTSVR. The radial basis function (RBF) kernel of the form

Note that in most cases, small SSE/SST means good agreement between estimations and real-values, and to obtain smaller SSE/SST usually accompanies an increase of SSR/SST. However, the extremely small value of SSE/SST is in fact not good. It could mean over-fitting of the regressor.

The performances of eight algorithms depend greatly on the choices made regarding the kernel functions and their parameter values. Although there exists many parameter selection methods for SVMs, the most popular method to determine the parameters of SVMs is still the grid search [19]. The optimal parameter values were determined by applying 10-fold cross validation on the training set. For brevity’s sake, we set

In order to analyze the performance of the aforementioned algorithms, seven synthetic datasets were generated using functions whose definitions are given in Table 1. For each function, 200 examples for training and 1000 examples for testing were randomly generated. For robustness comparison, the observed values of the training samples were polluted by adding three different kinds of noise: (i) Gaussian noise with mean zero and standard deviation 0.05; (ii) uniformly distributed noise over the interval

                        The optimal values of the parameters, training time and the accuracy obtained using SVR, WSVR, TSVR, KNNWTSVR and our Proposed-I, II, III and IV are summarized in Table 2
                        a–c. The approximation functions obtained by SVR, TSVR, KNNWTSVR and our Proposed-I, II, III and IV for three kind of noises are illustrated in Fig. 1a–c respectively along with the exact function.

To further investigate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, another six synthetic datasets were generated. One observes from Table 2a–c that our Proposed-I, II, III and IV have shown better generalization performance in comparison to KNNWTSVR, TSVR, WSVR and SVR. Further, we also compare the training time for these eight algorithms, the results in Table 2a–c indicate that our Proposed-I, II, III and IV need less training time in comparison to TSVR, WSVR and SVR but comparable to KNNWTSVR. In short, our Proposed-I, II, III and IV outperform TSVR, WSVR and the conventional SVR on approximating these seven functions with three different type of noises. The empirical results clearly show the overall superiority of the new formulation.

For further assessment, we use statistical test to analyze and compare the algorithm performances over multiple datasets, which has been extensively discussed in [13]. Since Friedman test with the corresponding post hoc tests is pointed out to be a simple, safe, and robust non-parametric test, we employ it to compare the performance of the eight algorithms. The average ranks of all the eight algorithms on RMSE, MAE, SSE/SST, SSR/SST, SMAPE, MASE and Time for Gaussian kernel are computed and listed in Table 4
                           
                           . The average ranks of RMSE for the eight algorithms are given in Table 5
                           .

We employ the Friedman test to check whether the average ranks are significantly different from the mean rank under the null hypothesis, which indicates that all the algorithms behave similarly and so their average ranks should be equal, the Friedman statistic:

                            is larger than the critical value, so we reject the null hypothesis. For further pairwise comparison, we use the Nemenyi test. At

                            Since the difference between SVR and our Proposed-I is 3.1904, which is larger than the critical difference 2.1015, we conclude that the generalization ability of Proposed-I is superior to SVR. Furthermore, we observe that the performances of our Proposed-II, Proposed-III and Proposed-IV are better than SVR. Next, we see that the difference between TSVR and either Proposed-I, II, III or IV is slightly smaller than the critical difference. We conclude that the posthoc test is not powerful enough to detect any significant difference between the algorithms. Similar conclusion is obtained when compare the proposed algorithms with KNNWTSVR.

                        The performances of the standard SVR, TSVR, KNNWTSVR, Proposed-I, II, III and IV on the test and training sets are shown in Fig. 2
                        a and b respectively.

To further compare our proposed algorithms, some financial time series datasets IBM, Intel, Redhat, SNP-500, CitiGroup and Microsoft of stock index are considered. In these datasets, five previous values are used to predict the current value. For numerical experiments, we selected 755 closing prices starting from 01-01-2006 to 31-12-2008 and 750 samples. For each financial time series, the first 200 samples are used for training and the other 550 for testing. The number of training and test samples chosen, the number of attributes, the optimal parameter values of all the datasets were determined using 10-fold cross-validation. The numerical results obtained by our Proposed-I, II, III and IV, KNNWTSVR, TSVR, WSVR and SVR were summarized in Table 3
                        .

The solution of our proposed algorithms reduces to solving just two systems of linear equations as opposed to solving QPPs in SVR, WSVR, TSVR and KNNWTSVR that suggests an improvement in training time. The experimental results presented in Table 3 confirm this observation with SVR, WSVR and TSVR showing longer training time. We note that training time of KNNWTSVR is very close to our Proposed-I, II, III and IV because SOR technique is used in KNNWTSVR to speed-up the training process. Furthermore, one observes from Table 3 that in comparison to KNNWTSVR, TSVR, WSVR and SVR, our Proposed-I, II, III and IV show better generalization performance in most of the datasets considered. In summary, our Proposed-I, II, III and IV outperform TSVR, WSVR and SVR in terms of accuracy and training time. On the other hand, the training time is very close to KNNWTSVR.

We observe that the optimal parameter values and numerical results on any of the benchmark dataset considered the optimal parameter values and performance of all the proposed algorithms remain stable during repeated trials. Moreover, the average ranks of Proposed-I and II on RMSE index are least in comparison with the rest of the algorithms which indicate their superiority in terms of accuracy.

Similar to synthetic datasets, we use the Friedman test to make further comparisons of the eight algorithms. The average ranks of all algorithms on RMSE, MAE, SSE/SST, SSR/SST, SMAPE, MASE and Time for Gaussian kernel were computed and listed in Tables 6

                         Since the difference between SVR, WSVR and our Proposed-I, II, III and IV is larger than the CD, the generalization ability of our Proposed-I, II, III and IV is superior to SVR and WSVR. Further, we see that the difference between TSVR and our Proposed-I, II, III and IV is slightly lower than the CD. We conclude that the posthoc test is not powerful enough to detect any significant difference between the algorithms. We have similar conclusions for KNNWTSVR.

                           K and RMSE. One observes from Fig. 3b that the parameter K has a great influence on the generalization performance of our RKNNWTSVR. In general, the value of the parameter K should not be too small or too large. A very small K easily removes some useful information whereas very large K introduces noise points. As a result, the prediction accuracy is affected. Therefore, we need to find a suitable parameter value that suppresses the outlier influence while not sacrificing the generalization performance.

In this paper, we present an improved version of KNNWTSVR. We reformulate the primal problems of KNNWTSVR by adding regularization terms in the objective functions to utilize the structural risk minimization principle and to remove singularity in the solution. The 1-norm of the vector of slack variable is replaced with 2-norm to make the objective functions strongly convex. By doing this, our RKNNWTSVR only needs to solve simple systems of linear equations with low computational cost, and at the same time improves the generalization performance. Empirical comparisons on benchmark datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. It should be pointed out that there are several parameters in our RKNNWTSVR, so it is interesting to address the parameter selection in future study. The selection of an appropriate parameter K is very important for performance improvement.
