                  How the blood in veins of dragonfly wing affects its vibration characteristics is investigated. Based on the experimental results of the wing׳s morphology and microstructures, including the veins, the membranes and the pterostigma, accurate three-dimensional finite element models of the dragonfly forewing are developed. Considering the blood in veins, the total mass, mass distribution and the moments of inertia of the wing are studied. The natural frequencies/modal shapes are analyzed when the veins are filled with and without blood, respectively. The based natural frequency of the model with blood (189Hz) is much closer to the experimental result. Relative to bending modal shapes, the torsional ones are affected more significantly by the blood. The results in this article reveal the multi-functions of the blood in dragonfly wings and have important implications for the bionic design of flapping-wing micro air vehicles.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Dragonflies fly in a highly maneuverable manner with their four flapping wings. They are capable of forward flight, backward flight, hovering, reversing direction instantaneously and accelerating rapidly. During flight, the beating wings accelerate the surrounding air to produce sufficient lift and propulsion [1,2]. Many previous researches focused on the aerodynamic performance of the flapping wings. The high-lift generation [3–7], flight efficiency [8–11] and stability [12,13] of the wings were comprehensively investigated. Both the motion of a wing and its three-dimensional shape contribute to the aerodynamics in flight. The insect wings are mainly passive structures and detailed studies of the structural features are necessary in determining the dynamic responses in the interaction with air. In addition, the understanding of aerodynamics of insect wings in turn facilitates the design of flapping-wing micro air vehicles.

Accounting for only 1–2% of the total body mass, the highly corrugated wings possess a high load-bearing capacity and structure stabilizing function. The pleats vary both along the spanwise direction and chordwise direction, increasing the flexural rigidity throughout the wing [14–18]. Combes and Daniel [19,20] studied the relationship between the venation pattern and the wing flexibility through finite element method (FEM) by calculating the displacement along the wing in response to a point force. Kesel et al. [21] developed several finite element models to study the expenditure of material in constructing the dragonfly wing. The effects of sandwich structure of veins on mechanical properties of dragonfly wing were studied by Wang et al. [22]. Rajabi et al. [23] investigated the microstructural and morphological aspects of dragonfly wings and determined the natural frequencies and mode shapes by FEM.

In almost all the numerical researches, the veins of dragonfly wing were considered as empty tubular structures with nothing inside. In our opinion, however, it is unreasonable, because the blood is not included in these researches. The biologist Arnold [24] introduced the blood circulation in some insect wings systematically and indicated that the veins of dragonfly wings are generally pathways for the blood, the tracheae as well as the nerves. Several distinct flow patterns were distinguished, involving longitudinal veins, cross-veins, and ambient veins. Based on this, the pattern of blood flowing in the right forewing of a C.servilia Drury is depicted in 
                     Fig. 1. He suggested that there were no major differences among the species or between the fore and hind wings of individuals.

In previous research, Zhao et al. [25,26] took a closer look at the ripple-like surface of the dragonfly veins through Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM). They have estimated the mass and the moments of inertia of the anterior vein and found that both of them are increased by about 30% because of the blood inside. The relationship between blood flow rate and the stability of the vein was studied by a rotational elastic tube conveying fluid [27]. Besides, Chen et al. [28] investigated the material property of the leading edge vein of the dragonfly wing, and found that the loss of water contents increased the stiffness by approximately 20 times. As the blood may affect both the mass and the stiffness of dragonfly wings, it is predictable that the blood will certainly influence the dynamic behaviors of the wings.

In the present study, we develop more reasonable and realistic 3D model of a dragonfly forewing based on the results observed in experiment. The FEM is applied to simulate the wing models and the blood within the wing is considered. The properties such as mass, mass distribution and moments of inertia are calculated and the natural frequencies/modal shapes are analyzed. To our knowledge, the blood in veins may be the first time to be considered systematically in the analysis of a complete dragonfly wing.

The sample used is the right forewing of a C.servilia Drury collected in the suburbs of Shanghai. As shown in 
                        Fig. 2a and b, both the forewing and hindwing are composed of the membrane and veins. The brown mark of the pterostigma is located on the leading edge near the tip. The span length and the maximum chord width of the forewing are directly measured as 26.4mm and 7mm, respectively. The zigzag cross sections are observed for the profiles of the corrugation when the sample is cut into chordwise pieces. Corrugation is pronounced both near the leading edge and the base of the wing. As shown in Fig. 2c, the corrugated section located near the pterostigma is shallow and the leading edge vein has a notable rounded profile. The ESEM is used to investigate the microstructures of the membrane and vein. To avoid any change of the microstructures, the sample is taken off from the living body in a short time. First, the sample is embedded in epoxy and cured at room temperature, after fixed by 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% Osmium tetroxide. Then, it is immersed in liquid nitrogen for 1~2min to allow the occurrence of brittle fracture. Finally, the sections are coated with gold about 6 nm thick and observed under ESEM.

There are mainly two types of veins, the longitudinal veins and the cross veins. The longitudinal veins extending from the base to the tip act as girders to stiffen the wing. The cross veins connect the longitudinal ones to keep the structure stability. The thin and transparent membrane is divided into small cells by veins. All of them form a three-dimensional structure of the wing. The veins at different locations are basically tubular structures with wide-ranging sizes (Fig. 2d). The cross-sections are characterized by symmetric annular shapes. The pterostigma is like a box with irregular cross sections. It is connected with the veins in topology and can accept blood from the surrounding veins [24]. The dimensions of both the veins and membranes decrease from the base/leading edge to the tip/trailing edge.

The extremely thin and flexible wing membrane is mainly composed of chitin, which is conducive for membrane to take a variety of deformations during flight. The reticulate veins made of long chain crystal polymers act as the support structure of the wing. Both the veins and membrane are idealized as isotropic material with Young׳s modulus of 2.8GPa and 1.5GPa respectively, and the Poisson ratio is 0.25 [21,29]. They are supposed not to be influenced by blood filled in the veins in the present study. The density of the wing is taken as 1.2mg·mm−3 consulting the results measured by Wainwright et al. [30]. The density of blood in the veins is 1.002mg·mm−3, referring to that of spider [31]. In addition, the effect of the pterostigma is considered in our models, which is found to help alleviating the wing flutter and making the wing beat more efficiently working as an inertial regulator in wing pitching by Norberg [32]. The dense pterostigma has a greater mass than an equally large wing piece in adjacent wing regions. A relatively higher value of 4.5mg·mm–3 is given for its density.

The architecture as well as the material properties determines how the wing will deform in response to applied forces. A highly realistic and integrated three-dimensional model is created in this part. Firstly, high-quality images of a dragonfly forewing are taken by the high resolution scanner (HP Scanjet G3010). The geometry of the wing is obtained from AutoCAD software and the FE model is created in ABAQUS software.

We use beam element B31 to simulate the veins with annular cross sections as shown in 
                        Fig. 3a and b. The sizes of the veins are divided into three different categories considering the variable scales of the wing veins. The thickness of the wing membrane is only about 0.002–0.005mm. The thin shell element S4R is employed to simulate it in our model. The cross section of the pterostigma is simplified as an irregular quadrilateral with two perpendicular diagonals whose respective lengths are 0.3 mm and 0.11mm, also shown in Fig. 3c and d. The average thickness of the wall is 0.02mm. Similarly, we use four-node quadrilateral shell element to simulate it. The 3D corrugated model of the right forewing is meshed distinctly according to the different structure features described above (
                        Fig. 4).

The flow of blood in the veins may induce complicated additional forces, which are all ignored temporally and will be considered in the succeeding studies. We adopt the method of equivalent mass to characterize the effects of blood here.

                        . Consequently, a higher density of the wing increases the ratio of inertial force to aerodynamic force, which is important to the discussion about the role of inertial force on the wing deformation during insect flight [32,33].

In short, two models are created in our article. The veins are empty in model I and filled with blood in model II. Both the geometrical and physical parameters remain the same in the two models. The deformation of the wing is described in Cartesian coordinates (O-XYZ) and the wing base is clamped.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS@&#

The blood in veins changes the mass of the wing as well as other physical properties. The total mass, center of mass and moments of inertia calculated from the two models are given in 
                        Table 2. Compared with model I, both the total mass and moments of inertia about the coordinate axes of model II are increased by as high as 50%. This strongly suggests that the blood has an important influence on the inertia of the wing. As the large veins are close to the leading edge of the wing, the blood filled in veins makes the mass center move ahead slightly both in chordwise direction and spanwise direction, which is essential to the flutter control of the wing in aeroelasticity. A wing like the dragonfly’ having its mass axis behind its torsion axis is very susceptible to flutter [32]. But the disaster doesn’t happen to the dragonflies during flight. The flutter is the self-excited coupled flapping and feathering vibrations which is usually induced by the combination of the aerodynamic force and inertial force. The inertial force acts at the mass center and the elastic force equilibrating it acts at the torsion axis. As the mass center moves ahead to the torsion axis, the unfavorable inertial moment causing torsional vibration is suppressed and so is the coupling effect. Consequently, the favorable distribution of the blood within the wing moves the mass center ahead and suppresses the flutters, having the same effect with the pterostigma studied by Norberg [32].


                        
                        Table 3 gives the first four order frequencies of the two models. As the corrugations of the wing have effectively enhanced the rigidity of the structure, the frequencies are much more reasonable and larger than those of planar models. The wing-beat frequency (27Hz) observed by Norberg [34] is only about 14% of the base frequency (189Hz). That means the resonance is not happening and the passive deformation is not utilized to save energy by dragonflies in flight. In addition, the small ratio illustrates that wing׳s inertia hardly increases the deformation compared to static analysis with the wing׳s inertia ignored [35].

All the four frequencies of model II decrease obviously compared with those of model I when considering the blood in veins. Taking the fundamental natural frequency as an example, it decreases by 17.35% from 229Hz to 189Hz, getting much closer to the experimental result of 174Hz [36]. The difference between them may be due to the damping of the air when the experiment was not performed in vacuum.

Showing how structure responses to natural frequency input, the modal shapes are of great value in the prediction of dynamic response of the wing under different kinds of loads in flight. Higher modes have smaller effects on the deformation of the wing. Thus, the first four order modal shapes dominant in characterizing the dynamic performances of the wing are extracted and shown in 
                        Fig. 5. In contours of the modal shapes, the color indicates the magnitude of deformation as marked in the legends.

The deformation of the trailing edge is comparatively larger than the leading edge in every mode. The first order modal shape is mainly a bending one and the displacement is perpendicular to the plane of the wing. The second one is mainly a torsional deformation mode while the third is a torsion-bending coupled one, in which torsion is the dominate deformation. The torsion axis lies close to the leading edge along the spanwise direction, which is coincident with the result obtained in static measurements [32]. In the fourth modal shape, bending deformation plays the major role while there is a torsion motion near the tip of the wing. There is little difference in the bending modal shapes of the two models. As for the torsional modal shapes in the second order, the effects are relatively obvious. In model II with blood, the torsional deformation increases, especially in the wing tip of the second mode. The torsional stiffness is much smaller than the flexible stiffness because of the corrugations in dragonfly wing [18]. Obvious twisting deformation during flapping cycles were observed and measured in dragonflies as well as other insects [37–40]. Recent work have shown that the torsional deformations play important roles in determining the aerodynamic forces produced during hovering or forward flight [41–45]. In these studies, the wings twist to maintain effective angles of attack to improve the lift and increase the projected area normal to the flight trajectory to enhance the thrust. Besides, the time-varying twist is also proven to maintain the attached flow and stabilize the leading-edge vortices, which also contributes to the high-lift aerodynamics. The high aspect ratio of the dragonfly wing enhances the torsional effect. Thus, to obtain precise torsional modal shapes in determining the torsional deformation in flight is very essential.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this article, the morphology and microstructures of the dragonfly wing are examined by the ESEM, and the blood circulation in the veins is introduced. To illustrate how the blood works on the wing dynamic performances, three-dimensional finite element models are developed and analyzed. The multi-scaled diameters of veins and membrane are considered in the study, and the pterostigma located near the wing tip is also introduced.

Blood in the veins is common in many insects, both in the forewing and the hindwing. It has increased the total mass as well as the moments of inertia to a large extent. In addition, the various sizes of the veins cause the uneven distribution of the blood, which moves the mass center ahead and the unfavorable inertial pitching moment causing flutter is suppressed. Affected by the blood, the natural frequencies decrease significantly and the fundamental frequency is in better agreement with the experimental results. In addition, the torsional modal shapes are prone to the blood within the wing relative to the bending ones. It is very important to predict the dynamic behaviors as the long and corrugated wing is flexible to torsion in flight. In addition to its physiological function, the blood within the dragonfly wing is found to influence the vibration characteristics in this article. Based on this, more factors could be taken into account in the design of flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FMAVs) if the flow rate and distribution of the fluids could be regulated artificially.
