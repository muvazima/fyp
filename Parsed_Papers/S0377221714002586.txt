                  This paper proposes a new nonlinear interval programming method that can be used to handle uncertain optimization problems when there are dependencies among the interval variables. The uncertain domain is modeled using a multidimensional parallelepiped interval model. The model depicts single-variable uncertainty using a marginal interval and depicts the degree of dependencies among the interval variables using correlation angles and correlation coefficients. Based on the order relation of interval and the possibility degree of interval, the uncertain optimization problem is converted to a deterministic two-layer nesting optimization problem. The affine coordinate is then introduced to convert the uncertain domain of a multidimensional parallelepiped interval model to a standard interval uncertain domain. A highly efficient iterative algorithm is formulated to generate an efficient solution for the multi-layer nesting optimization problem after the conversion. Three computational examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In traditional mathematical programming, all of the parameters involved in the problem are given deterministic values. However, in many practical optimization problems, some parameters or coefficients behave with some degree of uncertainty. To date, stochastic programming (Charnes & Cooper, 1959; Kall, 1982; Gao, 2005; Doltsinis & Kang, 2006; Du & Chen, 2004) has been widely used to address the above uncertain optimization problems, in which all the uncertain parameters are quantified through the probability model, and hence, precise probability distributions are required for these parameters. However, in practical applications, sufficient experimental samples regarding the uncertainty are often unavailable or very expensive to collect, and hence, constructing precise probability distributions for the parameters will often be difficult.

In the past two decades, a new type of uncertain optimization method, namely, interval programming, has been developed, which can overcome the above deficiency of stochastic programming to a certain extent. In interval programming, only variation bounds of the parameters are required rather than their precise probability distributions, and thus, many complex engineering problems lacking sufficient experimental samples can be conveniently treated. Some studies have already been conducted and reported in this field. A linear programming problem with interval coefficients in the objective function was investigated (Tanaka, Okuda, & Asai, 1973; Rommelfanger, Hanuscheck, & Wolf, 1989). Using an order relation of the intervals, a linear interval programming problem was converted to a deterministic problem (Chanas & Kuchta, 1996; Chanas & Kuchta, 1996). A linear interval programming method was proposed for problems with intervals in both the objective function and the constraints (Tong, 1994). Based on the concept of an “acceptability index”, an interval programming method was suggested to address the inequality constraints using intervals (Sengupta, Pal, & Chakraborty, 2001). Based on the assumption that the interval number follows a uniform distribution between its two bounds, a possibility degree was constructed to address the multi-criteria decision problems (Zhang, Fan, & Pan, 1999). A three-step method (ThSM) was developed to solve the interval linear programming without including infeasible solutions (Huang & Cao, 2011).

In the above-mentioned literature, only linear programming problems with interval coefficients were investigated. Considering that most practical engineering optimization problems are nonlinear and even implicit, in recent years, nonlinear interval programming has attracted increasing attention. The interval uncertainty existing in the nonlinear objective function has been considered, and the uncertain optimization has been converted into a deterministic multi-objective optimization problem (Ma, 2002). The nonlinear interval programming problem has also been changed to a minimax problem, which was subsequently solved using a hybrid algorithm (Cheng, Dai, & Sun, 2004). An important issue regarding the global optimality of the inner-layer interval optimization was discussed, and some interesting phenomena were revealed (Guo, Bai, Zhang, & Gao, 2009). The Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality condition on interval-valued nonlinear programming was investigated (Wu, 2007; Wu, 2009). A nonlinear interval programming model was developed and applied to the planning of a municipal solid waste management system (Wu, Huang, Liu, & Li, 2006). An interval programming model was proposed for a general nonlinear optimization problem with interval parameters in both the objective function and the constraints (Jiang, Han, & Liu, 2007), and some efficient algorithms were further developed for this model (Jiang, Han, & Liu, 2008; Jiang, Han, Guan, & Li, 2007; Jiang, Han, & Li, 2012).

In the current studies on linear and nonlinear interval programming, each uncertain parameter is treated as an isolated interval, and hence, the whole uncertain domain forms a “multi-dimensional box”. Thus, the above analysis is actually based on an assumption that all of the interval variables involved are mutually independent. Nevertheless, in practice, it is very important for an analyst to be able to model dependencies because complex dependencies routinely appear among real-world parameters in risk assessments, and these dependencies can have profound impacts on the numerical results of risk calculations (Ferson, Hajagos, Berleant, Zhang, & Tucker, 2004). Complex dependencies are certainly not rare, and they are perhaps as common as nonlinearity in physical systems (Ferson et al., 2004). Therefore, it seems necessary to develop an interval programming model that can address problems with dependent interval variables.

This paper aims to propose a new nonlinear interval programming method based on a multidimensional parallelepiped (MP) interval model, in which the independent and dependent uncertainties can be simultaneously treated very conveniently, and hence, the applicability of interval programming can be significantly improved. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces the MP interval model; Section 3 presents a nonlinear interval programming model to transform the uncertain optimization to a deterministic optimization; Section 4 formulates an efficient algorithm to solve the obtained deterministic optimization problem; Section 5 analyzes three numerical examples; and the conclusions are summarized in Section 6.

In our recent work (Jiang, Zhang, & Han, submitted for publication), we have proposed a more general nonprobabilistic interval model, i.e., the MP interval model. It can consider the independent and dependent variables simultaneously and represent the uncertainty for all the interval variables under a unified framework. We only need to know the variation intervals for each parameter and the dependencies between any two parameters to construct the uncertain domain Ω which geometrically is a multidimensional parallelepiped. Using the two-dimensional problem illustrated in Fig. 1
                     (a) as an example, the MP interval model would degenerate into a parallelogram. For this model, one side of the quadrilateral is set parallel to the axis of abscissas.

For a general q-dimensional problem, the uncertain domain is a multi-dimensional parallelepiped. In Fig. 1(b), a three-dimensional MP interval model is illustrated, in which one surface of the parallelepiped is set parallel to the X–Y coordinate plane. The marginal intervals for different variables are

From the above analysis, we know that when the correlation coefficients between all pairs of variables are all zero, the MP interval model degenerates to a traditional interval model, i.e., the interval model is a special case of the MP interval. For the above MP interval model, the marginal intervals and correlation coefficients can all be easily obtained using experiment samples (Jiang et al., submitted for publication).

Based on the MP interval model, the general form of a nonlinear interval programming problem can be described as:

Although we can conveniently model the complex “multi-source uncertainty” associated with dependent and independent parameters simultaneously using the MP interval model, the domain of the multi-dimensional parallelepiped cannot be depicted easily using some simple functions (i.e., the boundaries of the traditional interval model), which causes difficulty for the above interval optimization. To solve this problem, we first introduce the affine coordinates (Frank, 1967) to transform Eq. (4) to a traditional interval optimization problem. Subsequently, the derived interval optimization problem is further converted to a deterministic optimization problem to facilitate the solution.

First, we perform the affine coordinate transformation on the variable U’s uncertain domain Ω. In the affine coordinate system, the angles between the axes are not equal to 90°; instead, they are equal to the correlation angles between the interval variables. Its origin overlaps with the center of the multi-dimensional parallelepiped, as shown in Fig. 3
                        . Based on the affine coordinate theory (Frank, 1967), we can derive the following mapping relationship between a point in the original parameter space U

                        where F and G represent the objective function and the constraints in the affine space, respectively, and P represents the interval vector in the affine space.

Through the above formulation, we can derive a regular interval optimization problem through the affine transformation, i.e., the interval variables P become independent of each other. And as the uncertain domain has become a multidimensional box, all existing nonlinear interval optimization methods can thus be conveniently introduced to solve this problem. Next, we adopt a transformation model to further convert Eq. (9) to a deterministic optimization problem.

The order relation of interval can be used to qualitatively compare interval numbers, and it is often used to deal with uncertain objective function in interval programming. Based on the suggested order relation of interval (Ishibuchi & Tanaka, 1990), the interval objective function in Eq. (9) can be converted to a multi-objective optimization problem:

The possibility degree of interval can be used to quantitatively depict the degree of one interval being larger or smaller than another. In our previous work (Jiang et al., 2012), we proposed a reliability-based possibility degree of interval (RPDI), which can precisely compare overlapping and completely separated intervals. Based on the RPDI model, the interval constraints in Eq. (9) can be converted to the following deterministic constraints:

Obviously, Eq. (13) is a typical two-layer nesting optimization problem. The outer layer is used to optimize the design variables, while the inner layer is used for the boundary calculations of the objective function and constraints. In real engineering applications, the optimization problems are usually based on some complex numerical simulation models, such as the finite element analysis (FEA) and the computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which needs a great amount of computational time even for a single evaluation. The nesting optimization of these simulation models generally can result in extremely low efficiency, and thus, it is very difficult to solve more complex engineering problems. Next, therefore, we will construct an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the above nesting optimization problem.

This algorithm solves the nonlinear interval programming problem through a series of iterations. For the sth iteration, an approximate optimization problem of Eq. (9) can be constructed based on the first-order Taylor expansion:

To study the impacts of the parameter correlations on the optimization results, we consider four types of correlation conditions. For the first three conditions, only one pair of parameters is correlated, and for the fourth condition, all parameters are correlated to each other. Different correlation coefficients are analyzed for every condition. To use the method introduced in this paper, the multi-objective weighting factor is set as β
                        =0.5, and the possibility degree levels for the two interval constraints are set as λ
                        1
                        =
                        λ
                        2
                        =0.9. The computational results are shown in Tables 1–4
                        
                        
                        
                        , where N represents the number of calculations for the objective function f in the optimization process. The optimization results are found to be very sensitive to the correlations among the interval parameters because different correlation coefficients result in different interval optimization results. Under all conditions, the possibilities for the two constraints obtained are both 0.9, satisfying the given constraint possibility levels. Fig. 4
                         gives the variation curves for the objective function optimization results as the correlation coefficient changes. We can observe that the optimization results follow a strip distribution that is composed of upper and lower boundaries. In addition, different parameter correlations have different degrees of impact on the objective function: ρ
                        12 has the greatest impact on the objective function interval, followed by ρ
                        13; ρ
                        23 has the smallest impact. In this example, as the correlation coefficients increase, the interval radius for the objective function decreases, i.e., the result is more robust, but the midpoints for the objective function are essentially unchanged. For the fourth condition, because the correlations among all parameters have been considered simultaneously, the variation of the objective function interval is the most significant, indicating that the increase in the interval variables can result in larger changes in the optimization results. In addition, for the fourth case, we also use the conventional nesting optimization method to solve Eq. (13), in which the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is both adopted for the inner layer optimization to compute the bounds of the objective function and constraints and the outer layer optimization to optimize the design variables. Its computational cost is also given in Table 4, in which N
                        1 represents the number of calculations of the objective function. Since nearly the same results as our method have been obtained, they are then not given in the table. It can be found that the iterative algorithm proposed in this paper has much higher efficiency then the conventional nesting optimization method since it needs much less functional evaluations then the latter.

For the optimization process, the FEA model can be constructed to calculate the displacements at the nodes, and the whole structure has 25 elements using the truss element. To study the impacts on the optimization results exerted by the parameter correlations, we again consider four correlation conditions. For the first three conditions, only one pair of parameters is correlated. For the fourth condition, all of the parameters have correlations. Different correlation coefficients are analyzed for each condition. For the analysis, the multi-objective factor β
                        =0.5, and the constraint possibility levels for the six constraints are all set to 0.9. Fig. 6
                         gives the variation curves for the objective function optimization results as the correlation coefficient changes under the four conditions, and Table 5
                         gives the optimization results for the fourth condition. Because the objective function expression does not contain the interval variables, its optimization result is a deterministic value. From the figure, we can find that in this problem the influencing trends on the objective function change of the correlations among the different interval variables are basically the same, i.e., as the correlation coefficients increase, the objective function shows an overall decreasing trend. In addition, compared to example 1, the impact of the parameter correlations on the optimization results is not significant, as shown in Table 5. As the correlation coefficients among the interval variables change, the structure’s minimum volume V does not vary substantially. In addition, although this example has eight optimization and interval variables, only 220–320 FEA evaluations are needed to achieve convergence to the optimal results. This result also shows the high efficiency of the present method.

At present, there are higher demands for vehicle safety both domestically and abroad. Therefore, the vehicle safety design has become an important research field. The effect of side impacts on vehicles is among the main factors that need to be considered for vehicle safety design. The analysis mainly considers the process for the vehicle side door after receiving corresponding impacts, generating local deformation and absorbing impact energy. This study considers a vehicle side impact problem illustrated in Fig. 7
                        . For a side impact problem, the side-door, door-impact-beam and B-pillar play a key role in ensuring the safety of the passenger. The thicknesses of the inner and outer door panels should be optimized to minimize the total mass m, leading to a lightweight design. The passenger’s safety is ensured through restricting the intrusion velocity at the measurement point on the side structure. This example uses the lower end of the B-pillar as the measurement point. As illustrated in Fig. 8
                        , the intrusion velocity at the lower end of the B-pillar should be controlled less than V

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Based on the MP interval model, this paper proposed a new nonlinear interval programming method that can be used to handle uncertain optimization problems when there are correlations among the interval variables, effectively expanding the application scope of traditional interval optimization. Using correlation angles and coefficients, the degrees of correlation among the interval variables can be effectively measured, leading to the construction of a more reasonable uncertain domain. Using a conversion model, the interval optimization problem can be converted to a deterministic nested optimization problem, and a high-efficiency iterative algorithm is formulated to solve it. For the first two numerical examples, the analysis results considering the different parameter correlation conditions showed that, for some problems, the correlations among the interval variables can have substantial impacts on the optimization results. Thus, simply processing them as independent variables might lead to larger analysis errors. In addition, the method proposed in this paper has high computational efficiency, since only a small number of functional calculations are needed to converge to a stable solution. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated using a practical engineering problem regarding vehicle crashworthiness analysis to illustrate the engineering practicality of the method.
