                  The classical model-based methods had often proven to be unable to provide acceptable solutions to modern fault diagnosis systems. Therefore, model-free or soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) had become more attractive in industrial applications of fault diagnosis. In this paper, three SC schemes are explored to solve the problem of detecting unprecedented changes and finding the failed state components. First, individual fuzzy systems, ANN and GA are implemented on a fault diagnosis scheme. Then, hybrids of these techniques are applied to enhance the fault diagnosis precision. This approach allows gaining critical information about fault presence or its absence in the shortest possible time. The proposed scheme was simulated and evaluated extensively on a benchmark laboratory scale coupled-two-tank system. The results are encouraging, showing especially, that hybrid GA+ANFIS (GANFIS), outperformed significantly the other techniques.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Process faults, if undetected, have a serious impact on process economy, product quality, safety, productivity, and pollution level. In order to detect, diagnose and correct these abnormal process behaviors, efficient and advanced automated diagnostic systems are of great importance to modern industries. The main objective of Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) is to provide early warnings to operators, so that appropriate actions can be taken to prevent the breakdown of the system after the occurrence of faults. Complete reliance on human operators to monitor the systems conditions is often difficult. For instance, in chemical processes several kinds of failures may compromise safety and productivity. In fact, the occurrence of faults may affect the efficiency of the process, for instance, lower product quality or, in the worst scenarios, could lead to fatal accidents (temperature run-away) with injuries to personnel, environmental pollution, and equipment damage. Major failures to be considered in chemical processes are: actuator failures (electric-power failures, pump failures, valves failures), process failures (abrupt variations of some process parameters, side reactions due to impurities in the raw materials) and sensor failures. To tackle these difficulties, FDI techniques were developed.

Model-based approach is popular for developing FDI techniques [1,2]. It mainly consists of two stages [3]. The first one is to generate residuals by computing the difference between the measured output and the estimated output obtained from the model of the system. Any departure from zero indicates a fault has occurred [4]. However, these methods are developed mainly for linear systems assuming that a precise mathematical model of the system is available. This assumption, however, may be difficult to satisfy in practice, especially as engineering systems in general are nonlinear and are becoming more complex [5,6].

To overcome these limitations, soft computing has emerged as a new paradigm for modeling and computing that parallels human abilities in learning and reasoning on problems involving strong complexity and uncertainty. In contrast with hard computing methods that only deal with precision, certainty, and rigor, it is effective in acquiring imprecise or sub-optimal, but economical and competitive solutions to real-world problems. As we know, qualitative information from practicing operators may play an important role in accurate and robust diagnosis of motor faults at early stages. Therefore, the introduction of soft computing to this area can provide us with the unique features of adaptation, involving embedded linguistic knowledge over conventional schemes [7–9]. Nevertheless, soft computing techniques had shown significant limitations as well. These include inherent specific limitation of each technique when applied apart. For instance, fuzzy logic has big capacity of uncertainty and vagueness handling, but it is very limited with respect to learning ability. Conversely artificial neural networks constitute an important model-free approach to learn complex systems behavior but again are very limited in tracking dynamic uncertainties that are present for many interesting systems and problems. Hybrid approaches are then introduced and thought to remedy at least partially to these limitations by integrating the capabilities of both in one system [10–14].


                     The contribution of this paper is twofold; First it provides with a thorough review on the application of soft-computing techniques, e.g., artificial neural networks, fuzzy-logic and genetic algorithms to FDI (Fault Detection and Isolation) with an extensive list of references. Then, with several experimental validation and results the effectiveness of these techniques is shown in fault detection and parameter estimation using a two-tank fluid control problem. It is also shown that the hybrid GA+ANFIS or (GANFIS) outperforms other techniques.
                  

The structure of the paper is the following: Section 2 describes comprehensively the work done in fault diagnosis using expert systems, fuzzy logic and neural networks. Section 3 introduces the proposed scheme of soft computing application for the fault diagnosis problem. The proposed scheme for fault diagnosis with soft computing is presented in Section 4, which discusses the application of soft computing techniques including fuzzy logic, neural network, genetic algorithm, ANFIS and GANFIS on an two-tank FDI system. Section 5 gives the evaluation of the proposed scheme on a physical fluid level system and finally some conclusions are given in Section 6.

Soft computing techniques had been recently used to develop models for FDI problems [10–12]. These models not only can represent a wide class of nonlinear systems with arbitrary accuracy [13,14], they can also be trained from data. For these reasons, they have been used as models to generate residuals for fault detection [15]. However, it is very difficult to isolate faults, as these networks are black boxes in nature. Furthermore, it is also desirable that fault diagnostic system should be able to incorporate the experience of the operators [16]. Fuzzy reasoning allows symbolic generalization of numerical data by fuzzy rules with the direct integration of the experience of the operators in the decision making process of FDI in order to achieve more reliable fault diagnosis [17]. An up-to-date presentation of motor fault detection and diagnosis methods was recently published in [18,19].

The model-based methods are based on a priori knowledge and can be broadly classified as qualitative or quantitative. A sequential integration approach (Fig. 1
                     ) for fault diagnosis is proposed in this paper. The evaluation of both the Proposed Model-Free and model-based approaches has been done on a benchmark laboratory-scale process control system. The key idea of model-based methods is the generation of signals, termed residuals. These are usually generated by using mathematical methods (based on state observers, parameter estimation or parity equations). The models correspond to the monitored system [1,2]. Residuals are signals representing inconsistencies between the model and the actual system being monitored, but the deviation between the model and the plant is influenced not only by the presence of faults but also modeling uncertainly. One approach to overcome these difficulties is to proceed using soft computing techniques. This section is being subdivided into four sub sections reporting state of the art literature of fault diagnosis using expert systems, fuzzy logic, neural network and genetic algorithms.

An expert system is generally a very specialized system that solves problems in a narrow domain of expertise. Chow [18] Balas [19], Niida [20], Visinsky, Cavallaro, and Walker [21], introduced various expert system frameworks and applications forfault detection and fault tolerance. Structuring the knowledge-base through hierarchical classification and knowledge-based diagnostic systems can be found in Visinsky et al. [21], and Venkatasubramanian [22].

A rule-based expert system for fault diagnosis in a cracker unit is described in [23]. More work on expert systems in chemical process fault diagnosis can be found in [24,25]. A number of other researchers have also worked on the application of expert systems to diagnostic problems. Basila et al. [26] developed a supervisory expert system that uses object-based knowledge representation to represent heuristic and model-based knowledge. Zhang and Roberts [27] presented a methodology for formulating diagnostic rules from the knowledge of system structures and component functions. Becraft and Lee [28] proposed an integrated framework comprising of a neural network and an expert system. Tarifa and Scenna [29] proposed a hybrid system that uses signed directed graphs (SDG) and fuzzy logic. El-Gamal and Abdulghafour [30] presented a fault isolation in analog circuits using a fuzzy inference system. Wo et al. [31] presented an expert fault diagnostic system that uses rules with certainty factors. Leung and Romagnoli [32] presented a probabilistic model-based expert system for fault diagnosis. An expert system for fault diagnosis in batch processes was discussed in Scenna [33].

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are parallel data-processing tools capable of learning functional dependencies of the data. The artificial neural networks that were used for fault diagnosis can be classified along two dimensions: (i) the architecture of the network linked with activation functions such as sigmoidal and radial basis; and (ii) the learning strategy such as supervised and unsupervised learning. The most popular supervised learning strategy in neural networks has been the back-propagation algorithm. A number of papers address the problem of fault diagnosis using back-propagation neural networks, in chemical engineering, Watanabe et al. [34], Venkatasubramanian and Chan [35].

A hierarchical neural network architecture for the detection of multiple simultaneous faults was proposed by Watanabe et al. [34]. A detailed and thorough analysis of neural network identification schemes for fault diagnosis in steady-state processes was presented by K. Patan, T. Parisini [35], with a real application to the problem of sugar evaporation process. J. Korbicz, studied the fault detection using analytical and soft computing methods [36]. Koivo [37] introduced artificial neural networks in fault diagnosis and control. Recently, Altinisik and Yildirim [38] implemented a data mining control approach to faulttolerant for the three-tank system. A neural networks based inference had been implemented on an oscillation-based analogdiagnosis in Stošović et al. [39]. In [40], Xiang et al. developed a hybrid neural network with an immune algorithm for fault diagnosis problem. Nevertheless, most of the work on improvement of performance of standard back-propagation neural networks for fault diagnosis is based on the idea of explicit feature presentation of the neural networks as proposed in [41], Farell and Roat [42], Honggui et al. [43], and Smail et al. [44]. Chow Tipsuwan and Hung
                        [45] suggested the use of neural networks for motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Modifications of the selection of basis functions have also been suggested to the standard back-propagation network. For example, Kavuri and Venkatasubramanian [46,47] generalized radial units to Gaussian units and proposed methods to solve the hidden node problem. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been intensively studies during the last two decades and successfully applied to dynamic system modeling and fault diagnosis [48–57].

The application of fuzzy logic to model-based fault diagnosis approaches has gained increasing attention in both fundamental research and applications. Fuzzy logic can improve the decision-making, and in turn provide reliable and sufficient FDI, suitable for real industrial applications. A fuzzy feed-forward neural network (FNN) is applied to extract rules from an existing data base. Frank et al. [5,6] use fuzzy logic for residual evaluation. This can be an important way of taking into account modeling uncertainty at decision-making rather than during residual generator design. By applying a fuzzy rule-based approach, the fault decision process can be made robust to the uncertainties so that false and missed alarm rates can be minimized. Considering supervisory control 
                        [5,6] with tasks such as system management, process monitoring, identification, fault detection, diagnosis and adaptive capability reduces the control system to lower level models for developing simpler structures for observers and controllers using TS fuzzy models [7,8,14,29].

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are a special type of evolutionary algorithms that simulate biological processes to solve search and optimization problems. GAs have been implemented for a wide variety of problems, both real-world fault diagnosis and fault tolerant, including NP-complete problems [49]. The bulk of the GA literature is concerned with practical applications. A substantial literature on hybrids of GA with neural networks and fuzzy systems with various applications was also published recently. For a sample, the reader is invited to consult [58–63].

In this paper an implementation of soft computing techniques and their hybrid versions on fault diagnosis problems for improved accuracy and reliability is presented. In the proposed fault diagnosis scheme, the tasks (Fig. 1) are executed in an increasing precision tolerance. The proposed scheme has been evaluated on a laboratory scaled based two-tank system [56,57]. It is a widely used prototype applied in wastewater treatment plants, petro-chemical plants and oil/gas systems.

A fault is an undesirable factor in any process control industry. It affects the efficiency of system operation and reduces economic benefits to the industry. The early detection and diagnosis of faults in mission critical systems is highly crucial for preventing equipment failure, loss of productivity and profits, assets management and reduction of shutdowns and the errors.
                     

In this paper, model-free and model-based approaches are integrated to solve fault diagnosis problem (flowchart of Fig. 2
                        ). In this flowchart, the process data was a collection made at 50-ms sampling time. The objective of the benchmarked dual-tank system is to reach a reference height of 200ml in the second tank. During this process, several faults were introduced such as leakage faults, sensor faults and actuator faults. Leakage faults were introduced through the pipe clogs of the system, Firstly, the data collected from the plant had been normalized which comprised the pre-processing of the data [55]. Then, the optimal cluster had been tested through ANFIS with the subtractive clustering technique. Finally, the genetic optimization of the subtractive clustering radius had been performed, thus the performance had been validated by checking the root-mean square error and the performance targets.

The physical system under evaluation is formed of two tanks connected by a pipe. The leakage is simulated in the tank by opening the drain valve. A DC motor-driven pump supplies the fluid to the first tank and a PI controller is used to control the fluid level in the second tank by maintaining it at a specified target, as shown in Fig. 3
                        . A step input is applied to the DC motor- pump system to fill the first tank. The opening of the drainage valve introduces a leakage in the tank. Various types of leakage faults are introduced and the liquid height in the second tank,

                        , are both measured.

LABVIEW package is employed to collect these data. Various types of leakages were introduced by opening the drainage valve and the liquid height profiles in the second tank were subsequently analyzed. Three variables being measured in this process are hydraulic height, hydraulic flow and the control output. In all, there are four internal variables and two input variables in the system. So the candidate sensor set comprises up to six sensors

                         shows the two tank system interfaced with the Labview through a DAQ (Digital to Analog Acquisition) and the amplifier for the magnified voltage, as well as the Labview setup of the apparatus including the circuit window and block diagrams. The sampling signals process is performed through a data acquisition DAQ unit that measure real world physical conditions and converting the resulting samples into digital numeric values that can be adjusted by a computer. A data acquisition system (abbreviated as DAQ) typically converts analog waveforms into digital values for processing.

The leakage diagnosis is performed in the order of decreasing importance [7]. It starts by checking limits then follows with parameter identification using variants of Kalman filter schemes. The parameter identification provides a complete diagnostic picture. From the system of Eqs. (8) and (9), one deducts that the derivative of the height 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    h
                                 
                                 
                                    l
                                 
                              
                           
                         varies with the leakage parameter α. This a priori knowledge is employed to detect the onset of any leakage.

As part of the model-free approach, a fuzzy logic scheme was also used to detect leakage. The fuzzy rules are derived by comparing the actual flow and height measurements to their fault-free steady-state counterparts.


                        Figs. 5 and 6
                        
                         show respectively height profile of fault-free/actuator-fault and sensor-fault from top (no leakage) to bottom (large leakage) and height profile of a sensor-fault data. These fault-free measurements are generated by the steady.

The state model of the liquid flow system is formed by a bank of steady-state gains

The profiles of the flow, height and coherence spectra are given in Fig. 7
                         for leakages of different magnitudes. The fluid level system has five sections corresponding to the following five degrees; no-leakage, small, medium, large and very large leakage, Fig. 7(a) shows Height/Flow profile for PI controller (Height in meters vs. Time in s), whereas Fig. 7(b) shows the coherence special density of actuator faults.

The input/output data of a flow controller of a real process was collected at a sample rate of 1s. This system involves the process output y(t), the controller output u(t) and the input reference signal r(t), respectively. A total of 5000 samples were collected for this process. The flow was measured using differential pressure measurement across an orifice plate with flange tapings. A PI feedback controller was used with a controller gain of 0.15, which was measured by percent of full range of process output measurement over the full scale percentage of the controller output which was 100%. The integral constant Ti was 0.5min per repeat. The data had been filtered at the transmitter device stage using a second-order filter with damping constant of 0.4 to filter out any high frequency noise. The data pretreatment process for this project was designed to remove outliers from the measurements.


                        Fig. 8
                         shows a graph, displaying from top to bottom the data preprocessing of the proposed scheme.

This is done as follows:
                           
                              •
                              Finding the mean and standard deviation of the data.

Finding the outliers which are defined as data excursions of 3 times the standard deviation.

Replace these excursions by the mean that was calculated. Data interpolation can be used instead.

Finally, remove the mean of the data in order to normalize it and have it ready for identification.

Henceforth, the task is executed with increased precision. The data collected from the plant has been initialized and the parameters are being optimized. These comprise of data pre-processing and applying the Kalman filter to obtain the feasible solution as shown in Fig. 9

To have an effective fault diagnosis of highly non-linear systems, hybrid soft computing techniques have been introduced here by including the fuzzy-logic, neural Network, Genetic Algorithm Based-FDD. The proposed scheme had been evaluated on a bench-marked laboratory scale two tank apparatus.

Neural networks provide excellent approximation tools for dealing with nonlinear problems. The analysis of the ANN is a difficult task and it requires an expert opinion with a trial and error scenario by putting different types of training sets and functions and finding the final outcome of the best possible hidden layers and activation layers as per according to the problem at hand. The two main ANN structure were tested:

The MLP with TRANLM training flowchart had been shown to be slow, but with less memory requirements. The performance of the MLP can be tested with any differentiable activation function such as MSE or MSEREG functions. This makes ANNs nonlinear modeling a great flexible tool. Protective relaying based on ANNs is not affected by a change in the system operating conditions. Neural networks also have high computation rates, substantial input error tolerance, and adaptive capability. The input error tolerance and adaptive capability features allow neural networks to be applied effectively to the modeling and identification of complex nonlinear dynamic processes and fault diagnosis.

The transfer functions used for multi-layer networks are tansig and tan-sigmoid and traincgp for conjugate gradient propagation algorithm. The performance validation for back propagation using feed-forward neural network had led to the best validation performance as given in Fig. 10
                           .

Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks constitute a special class of feed-forward neural networks. RBF structure is basically composed of an input layer, a single hidden layer with a radial activation function and an output layer. These networks use nonlinear activation functions at the hidden layers (typically Gaussian functions), and linear transformations between the hidden and the output layers. The connection weights between the input layer and the neuron units of the hidden layer for an RBFN are all set to one.

An RBF was implemented through newrb Matlab function with a mean squared error goal 0.7823, and a spread of the radial basis function 0.571 and 42 neurons added for the radial basis. It is noted that mean square error and goal spread are highly sensitive parameters for a good radial basis function design. Fig. 11
                            shows RBF performance for different gradient and spread parameters.

An analysis of Fuzzy Logic-Based Fault Diagnosis is conducted by considering the dynamics and behavior of the physical system. As mentioned earlier, various types of leakage faults were introduced by opening the drainage valve. The liquid height profiles in the second tank were subsequently analyzed. The rules of the input had been defined as per by expert analysis. The type of membership function used is the Gaussian symmetric “bell curve” shape that quickly falls off toward zero (commonly called gbelf) as it was matching the dynamics of the scenario. On the Universe of Discourse, the height profile and flow profile, being the input of the system were defined by considering the variation of the steady state values of the profile.

The profiles are being categorized as per their variation in the height as well as the steady state values. These membership functions were formed by considering variations of the fuzzified (linguistic) variable within the range of its definition. The initial generation of these function was made using prior knowledge generated though the experiment and through the application of Kalman filter. Figs. 12 and 13
                        
                         show different scenarios and plots defined for flow and height profile input using tri-gbel-s with membership function on the universe of discourse. Fig. 14

Based on the conditions mentioned above, a fuzzy logic system is built using Matlab for both Sugeno and Mamdani-based functions. The analysis of the hybrid neuro-fuzzy based fault diagnosis by subtractive clustering is also discussed. Fig. 15
                         shows an implementable scheme of the hybrid neuro-fuzzy based-subtractive clustering.

The subtractive clustering proceeds to define a cluster center in the density of surrounding data points. All the data points within the radius of this point are then removed, in order to determine the next data cluster and its center. This process is repeated until all the data is within the radius of a cluster center. The procedure subclust of Matlab finds the optimal data point to define a cluster center based on the density of surrounding data points.

Simulation results are reported here. The final trained ANFIS scheme results are shown in Fig. 16
                     . Then, we follow up with the optimized subtractive clustering with a GA forming the Hybrid Genetic Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (GANFIS). GANFIS method is made up of six layers. This scheme had been successfully implemented into two other contexts [61–63]. In this paper the genetic ANFIS scheme had been setup and optimized according to FDI condition and equipments. The first layer is the input layer, characterizing the crisp inputs. The second layer performs the fuzzification of the crisp inputs into linguistic variables, through Gaussian transfer functions. The third is the ruler layer, which applies the t-norm to produce the firing strengths of each rule. This is followed by a normalization layer, at which each node calculates the ratio of a rule’s firing strength to the sum of all rules firing strengths. The fifth layer performs the inversion. The last layer does the aggregation and defuzzification, where an output is obtained as the summation of all incoming signals.

As one can see, a slight change in the radius of subtractive clustering yields noticeable changes in the results. So, the genetic optimization of the parameters is used in order to get a close-to-optimal value of the clustering radius that will lead to a better tracking of faults. Fig. 17
                      shows Various Fault Level Prediction through the four process phases in which the performance of the genetic optimization scheme was assessed. The original graph is drawn in red showing step sizes that indicate different levels of faults. The green graph shows the prediction with the subtractive clustering technique followed by the blue graph showing the genetically optimized sub-clustering radius. With regards to the techniques applied in this work, the running of the genetic neuro-fuzzy system took around 210min CPU Time to achieve the shown results of GANFIS. However, the main advantage of this approach is that once the neuro-fuzzy model is optimized, a fault diagnosis and isolation system capturing the plant dynamic behavior may be obtained without the need to re-do all calculations as would be necessary with conventional model based FDI, and with good, though sub-optimal performance.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper has shown the great potential of soft computing in dealing with difficult fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) problems. In spite of the fact that a large spectrum of analytical non-linear techniques for FDI can be found in the literature, as reported in the first part of the paper, they usually suffer from the lack of an appropriate mathematical description of the system being considered. Another difficulty is the fact that the robustness problem of classical solutions may impair the efficiency and quality of fault diagnosis, e.g., when the direction of faults is similar to that of an unknown input. To settle such a challenging problem, it has been shown that it is possible to employ fuzzy logic, neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. In particular, the hybrid version GANFIS was more sensitive to fault detection and outperformed the classical techniques by reacting quicker to shifts in the process. However, an important limitation of these techniques is the computational complexity. This is a major issue in the application of analytical model-based or soft computing technique to the FDD problem. Such a complexity will increase the time of detection and diagnosis, making it then not suitable for same applications. Nonetheless, the hybrid GANFIS technique applied in this work is time demanding. But, the main advantage of this approach is that the GANFIS is an offline built system and that once the neuro-fuzzy model is optimized, a fault diagnosis and isolation system capturing the dynamic behavior of the plant may be obtained without the need to re-do all calculations as would be necessary with conventional model based FDI, with good, though sub-optimal performance.
