                  Texture is a prominent feature of image and very useful in feature extraction for image retrieval application. Statistical and structural patterns have been proposed for image retrieval and browsing. In the proposed work, a new texture feature descriptor is developed. The proposed method uses local intensity of pixels based on three directions in the neighborhood and named as the local tri-directional pattern (LTriDP). Also, one magnitude pattern is merged for better feature extraction. The proposed method is tested on three databases, in which first two, Brodatz texture image database and MIT VisTex database are texture image databases and third one is the AT&T face database. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proven by comparing it with existing algorithms for image retrieval application.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many techniques for image retrieval have been developed in the past few years due to extreme increment in digital images. Large image database and retrieval of similar images became a direct and real world problem. Many kinds of features exist in the image, and texture is one of them. Texture is a powerful feature of an image that can be recognized in a form of small repeated patterns. There are many types of texture, e.g., artificial texture, original texture, rough texture, silky texture, etc. Texture is mostly contained in images of rocks, leaves, grass, woods, walls, etc. Even in natural images different types of texture exist. Many local features have been proposed by researchers in past few years. Local features extract the information regarding to local objects in the image or local intensity of pixels. Local patterns consider the neighboring pixels to extract the local information in the image. Most of the local patterns proposed by researchers, were uniform for all neighboring pixels. A very few patterns utilized the pixel information based on the direction. This work is mainly concentrated on a direction based local pattern which can provide better features with respect to uniform local patterns. Extensive surveys of content based image retrieval are presented in past few years [1,2].

Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was proposed for image classification by Haralick [3]. This matrix extracts features, based on co-occurrence of pixel pairs. GLCM was used in rock texture retrieval in [4]. Zhang et al. proposed a method for texture features that computes edge images using the Prewitt edge detector and extracts co-occurrence matrix for those edge images instead of original images [5]. Feature extraction has been performed on the co-occurrence matrix using statistical features. Transformation domain was also utilized for feature extraction by researchers. Wavelet packets were used for the feature extraction and applied for image classification in [6]. Gabor filter was proposed for image retrieval and browsing [7], and texture classification [8]. Rotation invariant feature vector has been proposed using Gabor filters for content based image retrieval [9]. To overcome computational complexity of Gabor wavelet, Rivaz and Kinsbury proposed a new feature vector based on complex wavelet transform and applied it to texture image retrieval [10]. A modified curvelet transform has been proposed and used for image retrieval [11]. Two novel features ‘composite sub-band gradient vector’ and ‘the energy distribution pattern string’, have been proposed for efficient and accurate texture image retrieval system [12]. These features were extracted from wavelet sub-band images.

A robust texture feature called the local binary pattern (LBP) [13] was proposed by Ojala, and it uses the local intensity of each pixel for feature vector extraction. Further, uniform and non-uniform patterns were discriminated based on appearance. Also, patterns were converted into rotation invariant [14]. LBP uses the difference of center pixel and boundary pixel with a threshold for binary pattern. Instead of a single threshold value, an interval was used and local ternary pattern (LTP) was obtained, which further converted into two binary patterns [15]. The local binary pattern was considered as first order derivative, and second and more order derivative patterns were proposed and called local derivative pattern (LDP) [16]. The LDP was proposed for face image recognition. LBP variance (LBPV) is proposed for texture classification [17]. Pyramid transformation of local binary pattern has been proposed using Gaussian and wavelet based low pass filters and called pyramid local binary pattern (PLBP) [18]. Again a pyramid based algorithm was proposed using LBP and LBPV with Guassian low pass filter and used for smoke detection in videos [19]. Murala et al. proposed local ternary co-occurrence pattern based on local ternary pattern and local derivative pattern [20]. After binary and ternary, local tetra patterns (LTrP) were obtained using horizontal and vertical directional pixels [21]. Further, local tetra pattern was divided into binary patterns for feature vector histogram. In LBP, all neighboring pixels were considered as same for every center pixel, and the pattern map was created according to the difference of neighboring pixels with the center pixel. In center symmetric local binary patterns (CSLBPs), a pattern has been created using only interest region pixels instead of all neighborhood pixels [22]. Papakostas et al. have been proposed a moment based local binary pattern image classification [23]. Feature extraction in transformation domain using Gabor filters and Local binary pattern has been performed in [24], and proposed method is applied in synthetic and multi textured images for segmentation. Binary patterns based on directional features, have been proposed in the directional local extrema patterns [25]. Yuan proposed a rotation and scale invariant local pattern based on high order directional derivatives [26]. The local edge pattern based on the Sobel edge image, has been proposed in [27]. The Sobel edge image was created first, then LEPSEG was computed for image segmentation and LEPINV was obtained for image retrieval. Local extrema patterns were proposed for object tracking [28]. Extended local extrema patterns with multi-resolution property were proposed in [29] for image retrieval. Murala et al. proposed the local maximum edge binary pattern (LMEBP) [30]. The LMEBPs considered the maximum edge from the local difference and extracted the information based on eight neighborhood pixels. This method was combined with Gabor transform and experimented on image retrieval and object tracking. Block division and primitive block based methods have been proposed using local binary pattern and applied to image retrieval system [31]. In this method, images were divided into blocks, and then comparison was conducted on blocks. Local mesh patterns (LMeP) have been proposed for medical image retrieval that create the pattern according to surrounding pixels for a particular center pixel [32]. Also, Gabor wavelet has been used for multi-scale analysis. Further, the local mesh patterns were improved in [33], where the first order derivative also included in the local mesh pattern and called local mesh peak valley edge pattern (LMePVEP).

Local binary pattern creates local pattern based on center and surrounding pixels. It measures the relationship and forms a pattern. In the proposed method, center and neighboring pixel relationship is considered in an instructive way that directional information can be utilized of image. Mutual relationship of neighboring pixels in three most significant directions are examined in the proposed work. A magnitude pattern is also considered using same three direction pixels, and both patterns histogram are combined for feature vector. The proposed method is tested on two texture and one face image database for performance. Presented work is organized as follows: Section 1 presents introduction of the problem and it includes motivation and related work. Section 2 explains local patterns and the proposed method. The framework of the proposed method, algorithm and similarity measure are demonstrated in Section 3. Experimental results are obtained in Section 4. Finally, the whole work is concluded in Section 5.

Based on performance and speed, LBP operator is used in image classification [14], facial expression recognition [34], medical imaging [35], object tracking [36], etc. The LBP operator for p neighborhood and r radius is defined as below:

Local tri-directional pattern is an extension of LBP. Instead of uniform relationship with all neighboring pixels, LTriDP consider the relationship based on different directions. Each center pixel have some neighboring pixels in a particular radius. Closest neighbor consists of 8 pixels all around the center pixel. Further, there are 16 pixels in next radius and so on. Closest neighboring pixels are less in number and gives more related information as they are nearest to center pixel. Hence, we consider 8-neighborhood pixels for pattern creation. Each neighborhood pixel at one time is considered and compared it with center pixel and also with two most adjacent neighborhood pixels. These two neighborhood pixels are either vertical or horizontal pixels as they are closest to the considered neighboring pixel. The pattern formation is demonstrated in Fig. 2
                         and explained mathematically as follows.

                         After getting pattern map, the histogram is calculated for both binary patterns using eqn. (2).

The tri-direction pattern is extracting most of the local information, but it has been shown that the magnitude pattern is also helpful in creation of more informative feature vector [37,21]. We have also employed a magnitude pattern based on center pixel, neighborhood pixel and two most adjacent pixels. Magnitude pattern is created as follows:

                         is 101. Now, according to eqn. (6) the pattern value for

                         is 1. In the same way, for next windows (d)–(j) pattern values are obtained for other neighboring pixels. Finally, the local tri-directional pattern for center pixel is obtained by merging all neighborhood pixel pattern values. For magnitude pattern, magnitude of center pixel and neighborhood pixel is obtained and compared. In presented example, ‘6’ is center pixel and 
                           
                              
                                 I

                         is ‘8’. In window (c), magnitude of the center pixel ‘6’ is 5.8 and magnitude of ‘8’ is 7.1 with respect to ‘1’ and ‘9’. Since, the magnitude of center pixel is less than neighborhood pixel, we assign ‘0’ pattern value here. Consequently, magnitude pattern is calculated for next neighborhood pixels and shown in (d)–(j) windows, and magnitude patterns of all neighborhood pixels are merged into one pattern, and that is magnitude pattern for center pixel.

Local patterns use local intensity of pixels for grabbing the information and create the pattern according to the information. Local binary patterns compare the neighborhood pixel and center pixel and assign a pattern to the center pixel. In the proposed work, additional relationships among local pixels have been observed. Along with relationship of center-neighborhood pixels, mutual relationship of adjacent neighboring pixels are obtained, and local information based on three direction pixels are examined. This method gives more information compare to LBP and other local patterns, as it calculates center-neighboring pixel information alongwith mutual neighboring pixel information. Nearest neighbors gives most of the information. Hence, the pattern is calculated using most adjacent neighboring pixels for each pattern value. Also, a magnitude pattern is introduced which provides information regarding intensity weight for each pixel. Both LTriDP and magnitude pattern, give different information and concatenation provides better feature descriptor.

Similarity measure is also a major module of the content based image retrieval system. It computes the distance between feature vectors, i.e., dissimilarity between images using a distance metric. In the proposed work, d1 distance measure has been used as it has proved its excellence for similarity match in local patterns in [21,25,38,39].

The proposed method is tested on two texture database and one face image database for validation. The capability of the presented method for image retrieval is shown on the basis of precision, recall [40] and average normalized modified retrieval rank (ANMRR) [41]. These are performance evaluation parameters, which evaluate the ability of the method. In the process of retrieving images, for a given query, many images are retrieved. In those images some are relevant to query image and some are non-relevant results which do not match to query image. Images which are of user interest, are called relevant images, and total images retrieved for a query, are called retrieved images. Precision computes retrieval performance in ratio of relevant images and retrieved images. Precision and recall can be computed as:

                      is number of query images. ANMRR value lies between 0 and 1, and ANMRR value more close to 0 indicates that more ground-truth results found in retrieval. Further explanation about ANMRR can be found in [41].

Every image of the database is treated as a query image, and for each image, precision, recall and NMRR are calculated. For every category, precision and recall are obtained using eqn. (21)–(24) and for all images ANMRR is calculated using eqn. (30). The presented method is compared with some previous methods as shown in Table 1
                     .

The proposed method is a combination of both LTriDP and 
                        
                           
                              LTriDP
                           
                           
                              mag
                           
                        
                      abbreviated as PM in the following sections and figures.

In the first experiment, MIT VixTex database [44] of gray scale images is used. It contains total 40 texture images. Each image is of size 
                           512
                           ×
                           512
                        . For retrieval experiment, each image is divided into 16 sub images of size 
                           128
                           ×
                           128
                        . Consequently, total 40 categories are obtained and each category holds 16 images. Sample images from the database are shown in Fig. 4
                        .

Precision and recall for the presented method and other methods are calculated and demonstrated through graphs. In Fig. 5
                        , plots of precision and recall are shown. Fig. 5(a) presents variation in precision with number of images retrieved and Fig. 5(b) shows graph between recall and number of images retrieved. Both the graphs clearly show that the presented method is better than others in terms of precision and recall. Average retrieval rate of proposed method has been increased from CS_LBP, LEPINV, LEPSEG, LBP, Nanni et al., LDGP, PVEP, LMEBP and DLEP by 19.13%, 22.91%, 10.43%, 7.72%, 8.47%, 10.90%, 12.05%, 0.97%, 10.13%. ANMRR for every method is calculated and presented in Table 3. ANMRR for proposed method is more close to zero as compared to other methods. It clearly indicates that most ground-truth results have been achieved using the proposed method.

In addition, we have shown the comparison of the proposed methods mutually. In Fig. 6
                        , comparison of LTriDP and 
                           
                              
                                 LTriDP
                              
                              
                                 mag
                              
                           
                         has been shown in terms of precision and recall with number of images retrieved. It is clearly visible, that the LTriDP is more precise than 
                           
                              
                                 LTriDP
                              
                              
                                 mag
                              
                           
                        .

In the second experiment, Brodatz textures [45] have been used for testing. The Brodatz database contains 112 texture images, each of 
                           640
                           ×
                           640
                         size. Every image is divided into sub images of size 
                           128
                           ×
                           128
                        . Total 25 sub images obtained from each original image. Hence, 
                           112
                           ×
                           25
                         images are there in this database with 112 categories and each category has 25 images.

The results of the proposed algorithm in the form of precision and recall are presented in graphs. In this system, initially 25 images are retrieved for each query, and then they are increasing by an increment of 5, and up to 70 images are retrieved. Plots of precision and recall with number of retrieved images are shown in Fig. 7
                        . The proposed method is more satisfying than other methods and it is clearly visible in the graphs. In terms of average retrieval rate the proposed method improved from CS_LBP, LEPINV, LEPSEG, LBP, Nanni et al., LDGP, PVEP, LMEBP and DLEP by 39.66%, 34.52%, 18.05%, 9.12%, 14.34%, 19.06%, 11.79%, 2.99% and 7.09%. Moreover, result of ANMRR are shown in Table 3, and it implies that more relevant images are retrieved using the proposed method as compared to other methods. Fig. 8
                         shows the plots between LTriDP and 
                           
                              
                                 LTriDP
                              
                              
                                 mag
                              
                           
                        . On the basis of precision and recall, LTriDP is more effective than 
                           
                              
                                 LTriDP
                              
                              
                                 mag
                              
                           
                        . Although, LTriDP is also good in performance, 
                           
                              
                                 LTriDP
                              
                              
                                 mag
                              
                           
                         is enhancing the image information as shown in Fig. 7.

In the third experiment, a face database has been taken for face image retrieval purpose. The AT&T database of faces [46] contains 400 images of 40 subjects. Each subject is having 10 images with different facial expressions (open/closed eyes, smiling/not smiling) and facial details (glasses/no glasses). These images were taken at different times and in varying lighting conditions for some subjects. Size of each image in this database is 
                           92
                           ×
                           112
                        . One image from each subject is presented in Fig. 9
                        .

Results of database 3 have been presented in Figs. 10 and 11
                        
                        . In image retrieval system, 
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,
                           .
                           .
                           ,
                           10
                         images have been retrieved, and precision and recall have been calculated for every time and shown in Fig. 10. The performance measures in experimental results clearly depict that the proposed method outperforms others. The average retrieval rate of the proposed method has been improved from CS_LBP, LEPINV, LEPSEG, LBP, Nanni et al., LDGP, PVEP, LMEBP and DLEP by 24.24%, 106.91%, 48.40%, 30.79%, 4.69%, 20.97%, 39.49%, 18.80%, 7.30%. Average normalized modified retrieval rank for this database is shown in Table 3. For the proposed method it is more close to zero as compared to other methods, hence the proposed method is more promising than others in terms of accurate retrieval. Further, in Fig. 11, comparison LTriDP and 
                           
                              
                                 LTriDP
                              
                              
                                 mag
                              
                           
                         is shown.

Demonstration of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 12
                        . Similar face images have been retrieved for five query images. In Fig. 12, first image in each row is query image and next three images are retrieved images from the proposed method.

Feature vector length of each method is shown in Table 4. Feature vector length of the proposed method is comparatively very less from PVEP, LMEBP and DLEP, and performance is better. Feature vector length of proposed method is more than CS_LBP, LEPINV, LEPSEG, Nanni et al. method, LDGP and LBP, but performance is considerably better as shown in different database results.


                        Table 2
                        
                        
                         explains the average retrieval rate (ARR) of two texture databases and one face image database for all compared methods with the proposed method. Final ARR results clearly verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms others.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A novel method, named as Local tri-directional pattern, has been proposed in this paper and abbreviated as LTriDP. Each pixel in the neighborhood has been compared with the most adjacent pixels and center pixel for local information extraction. In most of the previous local patterns, only center pixel is considered for pattern formation, but in the proposed method information related to each pixel of neighborhood is extracted, therefore, this method is giving more enhanced features. The magnitude pattern is also incorporated, that is again based on the same pixels used in LTriDP. The proposed method is compared with CS_LBP, LEPINV, LEPSEG, Nanni et al. method [35], LDGP, PVEP, LBP, LMEBP and DLEP with reference to precision and recall. All methods are tested on MIT VisTex texture database, Brodatz texture database and AT&T face image database. Precision and recall show that the proposed system more proficient and appropriate than others in terms of accuracy. Also, the feature vector length of the proposed algorithm is more acceptable than PVEP, LMEBP and DLEP.
