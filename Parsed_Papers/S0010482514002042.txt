@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Skin cancers are found either in the epidermis or in the dermis, and are categorized into melanoma and non-melanoma. Among all types, the melanoma metastasizes rapidly, causes the majority of the deaths and targets soft tissues like lung and liver [1]. This is mainly due to the fact that the epithelial malignant cells can easily metastasize to secondary sites from that of the primary sites, since the skin has access to both nearby lymphatic systems as well as blood vessels. Additionally, the malignant cells are composed of growth promoting chemical substances that stimulate the formation of nearby blood vessels to enhance the supply of nutrition and oxygen. Thus, it is of prime concern for most physicians to identify the early traces of melanoma using the available medical procedures and to initiate the proper treatment as early as possible.

The standard procedure for early detection of melanoma is the naked-eye examination of morphological features using various subsurface feature extraction devices, such as handheld dermoscopes. In order to determine its cause and condition, surgical excisions as well as pathological studies are considered as the foremost medical protocol. From the standpoint of early detection of skin cancers, currently many new non-invasive imaging modalities are explored all over the world [2–6]. These modalities have their own advantages/disadvantages, and some of them are limited to special care centers/research facilities.

Apart from the advanced techniques [2–6], the past few years have witnessed the growing role of thermography for sub-surface cancer detection [5–10]. Initial investigations reported considerable number of studies [7–10] indicating the effectiveness of thermography for detection of early breast malignancies. In the recent past, a number of investigations have been focused on the thermal evaluation of the skin cancer [5,6,11–13] as well as the breast cancer [10] using various modeling efforts. It has been found from the literature [5,6,11–13] that, the quantification and automation of the early diagnosis process of skin cancer using various thermographic methods are yet to mature. Thus, there is a necessity for further research to develop a better diagnostic method and to assess its capability for early detection.

The two significant signs that are often referred in the thermal images for cancer detection are (a) change in the surface temperature due to increase in the metabolic reaction and capillary blood perfusion [5] and (b) effect of convection heat transfer on the surface temperature due to blood flow near the lesion. Initially, Lawson [8] suggested that the local temperature of cancer affected tissue is few degrees higher compared to the surrounding normal tissues which can be marked as hot spots assisted by asymmetrical vascular pattern. Later, Lawson and Chughati [14] revealed that, the nearby blood vessels and vessels leaving the malignant sites increase the tissue temperature by few degrees due to the arterial and venous convection. The key factor that cannot be overlooked from these studies is the influence of subsurface blood flow on the resulting surface temperature of the skin during the thermal evaluation. An important aspect of vascular flow is that, vessels can either serve as a heat source or sink depending upon the nearby tissue temperature and environmental conditions. Few studies involving various thermal applications [15,16] have reported the localized heat exchange process between tissues and vessels due to blood flow in single and counter-current vessel pairs. The change in the local temperature at subsurface region due to blood flow often leads to the variation in the skin surface temperature. This is evident from the reported thermographic study on vascular diseases [17]. Clearly, the above studies indicate that, the blood flow plays a major role in the alteration of skin surface thermal response, which further changes the evaluation criteria during the disease diagnosis at an early stage.

The localized warmer region due to an increase in the metabolism and blood perfusion are frequently considered in the earlier studies [5,6,11–13] to detect the melanoma. However, the studies that model the blood flow to determine the thermal response of diseased condition [18,19] and subsurface skin melanoma during thermographic evaluation are scarce. The effect of blood flow on the thermal response of the skin surface has been investigated by Liu and colleagues for (a) the detection of tumor located in the vicinity of large blood vessels [18], and (b) the detection of atherosclerosis plaques found in the carotid artery [19] using thermography. The study pertains to the surface temperature nonuniformity during tumor detection using thermography [18] discusses that, the larger vessels have a significant effect on the surface temperature and may lead to false negative or false positive diagnosis. The present study also discusses a similar event as that of [18] with the focus being on the detection of early melanoma, and to individuate its different development stages within a specific model of vascularized skin using thermography. The present work further discusses the effect of blood rheological parameters on the flow characteristics and the effect of increasing malignant volume on the surface temperature. The previous modeling efforts [5,6,11–13] for the detection of skin melanoma have been carried out by considering the Pennes bioheat equation [20] only. It is well-known from the reported studies [21,22] that, the Pennes bioheat equation can accurately model the essence of energy exchange due to blood perfusion. However, the equation fails to evaluate the thermal effect of blood flow associated with relatively larger diameter vessels. Hence, this work utilizes the Pennes bioheat equation for modeling the perfused tissue domain, and the coupled momentum and energy conservation equations for modeling the blood flow. Further, it is worth noting that, out of all the environmental and physical factors the skin blood flow has a major contribution to the heat loss from the body core and can be closely related to the skin temperature and heat loss [23]. Thus, neglecting the blood flow in the model may lead to significant deviation in the resulting thermal images as compared to the clinical thermal images.

In this work, the dynamic thermal imaging (DTI) of skin has been carried out with the aid of external thermo-stimulation [5,24]. During DTI, in general, the skin surface (or the patient) is first kept in a stabilized ambient condition for 15–20min [24], so that the skin temperature reaches a steady state value. The obtained thermal map of the skin surface serves as a reference thermal pattern for further evaluation. Next, the skin surface and certain portions of subsurface region are cooled below the reference steady state value using a contact type thermo-stimulation procedure [24] for a short-period. After a certain period of cold stimulus, the contact type stimulation is removed from the skin surface and the skin is allowed to recover to the reference steady state value under the same stabilized ambient condition. During this thermal recovery period, the spatial and temporal variations of temperature values on the skin surface are measured remotely using a thermal camera at different times indicating differential changes in the thermal patterns between the cancerous region and surrounding healthy region. The temperature differences at different instants are mainly due to the thermogenic capacity, metabolism and blood perfusion of the skin lesion against that of the surrounding healthy tissues [24].

Further, it is a well-known fact that skin behaves as a black surface and has an emissivity close to unity within the spectral range of 2.5–15μm [25]. Within the mentioned spectral range, there exists a favorable wavelength range (8–10μm) for thermal evaluation of skin since, IR radiation from the skin surface exhibits a maximum peak within this wavelength range [26]. Earlier study has also indicated that IR radiation exhibits nearly 100% transmittance through the atmosphere within the spectral range of 8–10μm [27]. In view of the above facts, it is evident that measuring the skin IR radiation within the spectral range of 8–10μm is advantageous.

The detection of melanoma at an early stage using DTI technique is always a formidable challenge due to negligible metabolism and blood perfusion. Further, the early stage remains unresolved in the thermogram since, the thermogenic capacity of regional blood vessels overpowers the lesion response. Therefore, the present work compares the growth of melanoma volume with the thermal response of vascularized skin and evaluates the performance of the DTI technique for early melanoma diagnosis. Further, the objective of this study is to carry out a comprehensive analysis to set an evaluation criterion for the early detection of melanoma. The study involves the development of viable computational method for the outcome prediction of disease during DTI.

Human skin consists of four layers, viz., epidermis, dermis, fat and muscle. In each layer of the skin, except epidermis, the flow of blood takes place in the counter-current artery–vein pair arrangement as can be seen from 
                        Fig. 1(a). The velocity within the artery is in the positive x-direction and the velocity within the vein is in the negative x-direction. The geometry of the tissue as well as vessels, thermo-physical properties of tissue as well as lesion, and the blood flow parameters have been modeled based on the reported data [12,28,29] and have been tabulated in 
                        Table 1. In the present numerical study, the skin has been first subjected to a 60s cold stimulus. After 60s of cooling, the surface has been exposed to the environment and heat exchange takes place due to convection, radiation and evaporation. Upon the removal of undercooled condition, the skin gradually recovers from the cold condition. The thermal response of skin surface has been mapped during this recovery time to individuate the subsurface cancer. The cold stimulus of 60s has been employed on the skin surface to reproduce the work done by Çetingül and Herman [5] and to achieve an initial validation of the present model.

The growth of malignant tumors is mainly due to consecutive mitotic division from a single neoplastic cell (typically of the diameter 10μ) [30]. It starts as a single focus and lead to a volume of malignant cells after a certain period of time, represented by the doubling time. The doubling time is the mathematical representation of number of mitotic divisions to reach a certain volume of tumor. Thus, with the help of simple mathematical relation one may determine the stage of malignant tumor based on the knowledge of volume it has acquired. Therefore, in most cancer staging approaches the stage of a malignant tumor is determined based on the change in the effective diameter and the penetration depth of the tumor volume. Thus, the melanoma stages have been modeled in this study by incorporating the growth of tumor volume (viz., lateral spread of the tumor, D and depth of penetration, h
                        p) within the skin [1]. Based on the anatomical invasion of T1 melanoma (less than or nearly equal to 1mm of thickness and no ulceration) in the skin, the three subcategories of melanoma, viz., Clark level II, III and IV have been considered. The melanoma at its early stage before Clark levels is abbreviated as ES I. Fig. 1(b) depicts the visual representation of different stages of cutaneous melanoma.

                        , of different melanoma stages considered for computations have been detailed in 
                        Table 2. 
                        Table 3 depicts various intermediate stages of melanoma, which have been modeled by changing the tumor volume from that of the single cell volume of 10 μ diameter sphere equivalent to the volume of the cylindrical lesion (L1). It is worth-noting here that, during the early stages, there exists inter-mitotic resting phase/lag phase between each mitotic division due to limited supply of nutrients and neglogible capillary blood perfusion [30–32]. As a result, the blood perfusion and metabolic heat generation of melanoma at early stages (viz., ES I, L1–L8) are assumed to be zero (refer 
                        Tables 2 and 3). The mitotic division switches to log phase due to rich supply of nutrients followed by the recruitment of large number of vessels. The switch has been assumed to be taking place between L8 and L9. It has also been assumed that, the nutrient supply and metabolism remain nearly constant for stages L9 to L19 during the log phase (refer 
                        Tables 2 and 3), since the growth of malignant volume takes place at a faster rate compared to the further recruitment of vessels. The penetration of melanoma into a portion of the papillary dermis, complete papillary dermis, and a portion of the reticular dermis have been labeled as Clark levels II, III and IV, respectively [1].

The numerical study has been carried out by dividing the computational domain into two sub-domains, viz., vascular sub-domain (Ω
                        
                           v
                        ) and perfused tissue sub-domain (Ω
                           t
                        ). In order to determine the temperature distribution of skin during DTI, the perfused tissue sub-domain has been modeled using Pennes bioheat equation [20] and the vascular sub-domain has been modeled using coupled momentum and energy conservation equations.

                        0 is the uniform velocity at the vessel entrance, r is the radius of the vessel, y and z are the coordinates. On the other hand, at the vessel exit the constant pressure boundary condition has been considered, since this condition is the most suitable choice for blood flow simulation [34]. For a healthy person the pressure of blood within the vessels varies in the range of 70–80/110–120mmHg [34]. Thus, the study considered the pressure of blood at the vessel exit to be 90mmHg [34]. The study also evaluates the effect of fluctuating velocity and pressure boundary condition at the vessel entrance and exit, respectively, on the blood flow parameters. For the illustration purpose, the perturbations in velocity and pressure have been modeled for three cardiac cycles. The rheological properties of the flow have been estimated by considering the non-Newtonian model of blood using Carreau relation [29]

Thermal response of the skin during thermal recovery from undercooled condition has been modeled by imposing different boundary conditions. The boundary condition at the datum of the skin (at z=0) (Fig. 1(a)) has been considered to be at a constant core body temperature (

The temperature distribution within the skin and the thermal maps have been obtained by solving the Pennes bioheat model (Eq. (1)) and the coupled conservation equations due to blood flow (Eqs. (2) and (3)) using a commercially available finite element based software package.

                                 Step I: Initially, the steady-state temperature distributions in the human skin layers have been computed by imposing combined heat flux (Eq. (8)) at the surface of the skin. The steady-state solution has been obtained by simultaneously solving Eqs. (1)–(3).


                                 Step II: A transient analysis of coupled Eqs. (1)–(3) has been done by applying a constant temperature cold stress (Eq. (7)) on the skin surface for 60s. The steady-state solution obtained during step I has been provided as the initial guess for the transient analysis.


                                 Step III: Eqs. (1)–(3) have been simultaneously solved along with the combined heat flux boundary condition for t>60s. The solution obtained for t=60s has been provided as the initial guess to determine the thermal response of the skin during the thermal recovery (i.e., t>60s). The transient analysis has been performed till the skin reaches steady-state. The thermal recovery from undercooled conditions takes almost 20–30min.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In many of the earlier studies, blood was assumed as a Newtonian fluid within a certain range of shear rate [37]. In principle, the instantaneous blood shear rate may vary from zero to high shear rate for different size of vessels and there is a possibility of transition region during which blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid [29,37]. Thus, the present work considers the non-Newtonian Carreau model to demonstrate the blood flow phenomenon. This model offers a fair match of the results with the experimental data [29] and can capture both Newtonian (high shear rate) and non-Newtonian (low shear rate) behavior. Further, the study of blood rheological parameters is also important, since these parameters regulate various physiological situations, such as perfusion of blood in tissues and flow of blood in the vessels. The effect of blood flow conditions (viz., fluctuating and constant) on blood rheological parameters (viscosity, shear rate and shear stress) and velocity in a relatively small size vessels embedded in peripheral tissues have been shown in 
                        Fig. 2 for three cardiac cycles. The work has been carried out by assuming that, the peripheral vessels found in the skin are smaller in size and are far from the main vessels connected to the heart. Thus, the fluctuation in pressure/velocity due to each cardiac cycle is quiet low [38] as can be seen from Fig. 2(a). This is mainly due to the fact that: (a) within the small size vessels the pressure fluctuations smooth out, and (b) when measured away from the heart the systolic and diastolic pressures damp out, causing relatively less/negligible pressure fluctuation [38]. Further, the model assumes that, the blood flow through the returning veins are always at a steady speed and without pulsation because the pressure surges have been damped out by the distance traveled within the arteries [38].

It has been observed from Fig. 2(b) that, the Carreau model correctly illustrates the shear-thinning phenomenon due to the change in shear rate. The blood is less viscous at a high shear rate and the apparent viscosity of the blood tends to the Newtonian apparent viscosity. Whereas, at low shear rate the apparent viscosity of the non-Newtonian blood increases from that of the Newtonian blood. The trend is completely opposite for the associated shear stress values within the same vessel. A similar feature was observed by Johnston et al. [29] on the large vessels. In this work, the shear rate has been found to vary from 10s−1 to 400s−1. The variation of average wall shear stress (WSS) with vessel length of the artery located in the papillary dermis has been presented in Fig. 2(c). The average value represents the mean of all the time intervals, i.e., three cardiac cycles. The WSS quantifies the resistance offered by the vessel walls, which is an important parameter in many vascular diseases [29]. It can be seen from Fig. 2(c) that, the magnitude of WSS is comparatively large in case of Carreau model. This is mainly due to the fact that, the viscosity and shear rate offered by the non-Newtonian blood flow are also large in magnitude. It can be further observed from Fig. 2(b) that, the blood viscosity and shear stress exhibit negligible change due to fluctuating conditions compared to that of the steady conditions. However, a minuscule increase in WSS can be noticed in Fig. 2(c) for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian flows when the flow is fluctuating. It can be seen from Fig. 2(d) that, the non-Newtonian blood velocity at the exit is always lower than the Newtonian blood velocity for both fluctuating and constant flow conditions. This is evident, since the resistance offered in case of blood being non-Newtonian is relatively high as compared to the Newtonian blood. Further, it can be seen from Fig. 2(e) that, the velocity profiles at different axial locations of the vessel for the case of fluctuating flow have been found to be same for the assumptions of blood being Newtonian and non-Newtonian. A similar phenomenon for the case of constant blood flow can be observed from 
                        Fig. 3(a). Hence, it is evident from the above discussion that, the effect of blood fluctuation has negligible influence on the flow parameters in peripheral arteries as compared to that of the constant flow condition. Therefore, only the constant flow condition has been considered in the subsequent study.

The blood velocity profiles for constant flow conditions have been shown in Fig. 3(a)–(d) for Newtonian (symbol marker) and non-Newtonian (line marker) assumptions at three different axial locations (viz., vessel entrance, vessel mid-plane and vessel exit) of artery–vein pairs located in each layer. The combined three dimensional pressure plots for the above configuration at the same instant have been shown in Fig. 3(e). The velocity profiles and pressure plots in Fig. 3 exhibit nearly constant values at all instants due to constant flow condition. It should be noted from Fig. 3 that, the entrance velocity of the artery and the exit velocity of vein and the vice-versa are same with the flow direction being opposite. Further, the magnitude of the pressure at the vessel entrance is higher as compared to the vessel exit and the blood velocity at the vessel exit is more as compared to that of the inlet velocity. The above observations are in good agreement with [34] on the flow of blood due to the consideration of constant pressure vessel exit condition. The velocity of the blood due to non-Newtonian assumption is less compared to the Newtonian assumption with the changes being small, as can be seen from Fig. 3(a)–(d). Since, the resistance offered in case of blood being non-Newtonian is relatively high as compared to the Newtonian one (refer 
                        Fig. 2(b)–(c)). Further, the pressure within the vessels will be higher for the case of blood being non-Newtonian (refer 
                        Fig. 3(e)).

The local temperature distribution due to blood flow in the vicinity of different melanoma stages have been shown in 
                        Fig. 4(a)–(b) for vessels in papillary dermis and Fig. 4(c)–(d) for vessels in reticular dermis at a particular instant, say at 100s. It can be observed from Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(c) that, the mixing cup temperature (MCT) of the artery and the vein located in each skin layer exhibits a small difference in the magnitude, and displays a sudden increase in the magnitude at the midsection of the vessels due to nearby lesion except for ES I. At the same time, it can be observed from Fig. 4(b) and (d) that, there is an increase in the lateral temperature (T
                        
                           y
                        ) of the healthy tissue and melanomas located between the vessel pairs. The thermal event of vascular flow and lesion shown in Fig. 4 are attributed due to the relatively large value of thermal properties (k and c) of blood and lesion than that of the normal tissues (Table 1). Further, the blood properties are nearly similar to that of the lesion properties (Table 1). As a result, the early melanoma volume within the vascularized skin exhibits no change in the temperature value from that of the healthy skin (Fig. 4).

It is worth-noting here that, (a) the heat exchange between the vessels and the tumor plays an important role in the temperature distribution at subsurface location (Fig. 4), and (b) the subsurface blood flow causes a significant alteration of the skin surface temperature (
                        Fig. 5). Fig. 5(a) and (b) presents the transient surface temperature profile (T
                        
                           surf
                        ) of skin melanoma (single pixel value at the center) with and without vessels, respectively. The associated changes in the difference between the surface temperature distributions (STDs) of skin with melanoma and the healthy skin without melanoma for different recovery times, viz., 100s and 1600s are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), respectively. It can be observed from the inserts provided in Fig. 5(a) and (b) that: (a) the subsurface blood flow causes the skin surface temperature to rise as compared to the skin without vessels, and (b) the surface temperature increases with the growth phases of melanoma, except for the early stage (ES I). Due to the subsurface blood flow, the enlarged portion of ΔT
                        
                           surf
                         in Fig. 5(c) and (d) exhibits a clear reduction in the magnitude as compared to that of the skin without vessels. The reduction in ΔT
                        
                           surf
                         is mainly due to an overall increase in the surface temperature of the healthy skin. Further, the difference between STDs are found to be more at the beginning of recovery time (Fig. 5(c)) and slowly reaches a constant value at the end of recovery time (Fig. 5(d)). In view of the above results, the study demonstrates that, the subsurface blood flow reduces the performance of DTI of skin cancer, and can cause an unresolvable pattern in case of early melanoma volume. It is evident from Fig. 5 that, the detection of early stage (ES I) in the raw thermogram will be a challenging task due to low resolution as can be seen from 
                        Fig. 6. The resolution may further reduce due to subsurface blood flow (
                        Fig. 7). In principle, the detection of subsurface melanoma within the vascularized skin depends on the volume of the lesion as well as blood, i.e., if the blood volume is greater than the lesion volume no contrast will appear due to melanoma as in case of ES I, and vice-versa.

The raw thermal images obtained during the thermal recovery phase have been analyzed in 
                        Figs. 6–8(a) to correlate the different development stages of subsurface melanoma, and (b) to evaluate the influence of blood flow on the performance of DTI. It can be clearly seen from Figs. 6 and 7 that, the subsurface blood flow alters the surface raw thermal maps (Fig. 7) as compared to that without the subsurface blood flow (Fig. 6). During the recovery period, the thermograms for different development stages of melanoma without the vascular structure are distinguishable with clear boundaries at all instants (Fig. 6(a)–(d)) except for ES I. However, the vascular structure (Fig. 7(a)–(c)) leads to an increase in the skin surface temperature. As a result, the boundaries of melanoma stages from raw thermograms are difficult to discern at all instants. In view of this, it may be concluded that the increase in the temperature at the surface due to subsurface blood flow overpowers the thermal response of early melanoma (ES I) and can affect the performance of DTI. Further, Fig. 6 illustrates the appearance of the ES I at the end of the recovery period (i.e., at t=1600s) unlike that from Fig. 7. This is mainly due to the reduction in the thermal contrast of other lesions for large recovery time (say t=1600s) as compared to the initial time (say t=10s and 50s) causing the responses of ES I to be resolvable. The same can be verified from Fig. 6(d). A systematic approach to determine the associated changes in the thermal contrast at the skin surface due to the change in the volume of various melanoma stages has been presented in Fig. 8. The results presented in Fig. 8 correspond to the variation in the melanoma volume listed in Table 3. Fig. 8(a) illustrates the difference in the surface temperature (ΔT
                        
                           surf
                        ) between cancerous and adjacent healthy region as well as between cancerous and regional vessels due to an increase in the lesion volume. The temperature difference between the cancerous and the vascular region exhibits insignificant change for the early development phases of melanoma. Therefore, the study demonstrates that, the performance of DTI is indeed reduced by the regional vessels due to comparatively low thermogenic capacity of lesion volume during the early stage (ES I) though, the difference between cancerous and sound region is relatively high. However, it can be seen from Fig. 8(b) that, the early melanoma can be resolved from raw thermogram within a small window (stages L7, L8 and L9) between ES I and CL II due to an increase in the lesion volume compared to the blood volume. The study further suggests that, the thermal evaluation of early melanoma is possible with (a) proper assessment of the thermograms once the shady appearance of suspected region is identified, and (b) analyzing the relative change in the thermal patterns at the skin surface associated with intermediate growth phases at different times.

The performance of DTI due to change in the lateral positions of small (ES I) and large volume (CL III) melanoma from the vessels has been assessed from

                        ) (Fig. 9(b) and (c)). Two important phenomena can be observed from Fig. 9(b) and (c): (a) the large value of ΔT

                           b
                        ), (b) the effect of blood vessels overpowers the thermal response of low volume ES I even at a distance of 3.3mm from the vessels, which can be realized from the negative value of ΔT
                        
                           surf
                         (=T

                           b
                        ). This is mainly due to the fact that, the thermogenic capacity of blood volume is relatively large compared to ES I. As a result, ΔT
                        
                           surf

                        ) has been found to be negative or negligibly small at all lateral positions (Fig. 9(b)). Whereas, the thermogenic capacity of CL III is comparatively higher than the blood volume resulting in the positive value of ΔT
                        
                           surf

                        ) as can be seen from Fig. 9(c). In both the cases, melanoma at the vessel center displays a higher value of ΔT
                        
                           surf

                        ) compared to the other lateral locations. The main reason being the counter-current blood flow causes an increase in the regional temperature at the center. Owing to the same reason, the difference ΔT

                        ) due to regional vessels have been found to be negligibly small at the center. Hence, it is evident from the study that, the performance of DTI during early melanoma diagnosis reduces due to the disturbing nature of the blood vessels.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

This work proposes the novel application of dynamic thermography for early detection and staging of skin melanoma during the thermal recovery of skin from the undercooled condition. The study predicts the thermal evaluation criterion of early melanoma within the vascularized skin with the aid of coupled bioheat and non-Newtonian blood flow models. The variation of rheological parameters due to shear-thinning nature of blood along with the possible implication of these parameters on physical phenomenon has been discussed. The surface temperature distributions due to different development stages of melanoma display a distinguishable thermal pattern, which appears as identifiable temperature contours in the raw thermograms. The raw thermograms will be helpful to individuate the different development stages of melanoma based on the relative thermal contrast of the suspicious warmer region. It has been noticed that, the local events in the subsurface region due to counter-current blood vessels situated near the melanoma alters the thermal contrast of the melanoma at the skin surface. The study further emphasizes that, the flow of blood leads to an increase in the temperature at the surface. As a result, the early development stages of melanoma remain unresolved in the raw thermogram, which in turn influences the thermal evaluation criteria during disease diagnosis. A detailed analysis of various intermediate melanoma stages within the vascularized skin predicts the possibility of early diagnosis. It is further believed that, the integrated model presented in this work will serve as a reference tool to optimize the operational conditions of the DTI technique before its practical implementation.
