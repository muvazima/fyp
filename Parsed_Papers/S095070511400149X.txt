                  We study the problem of clustering uncertain objects whose locations are uncertain and described by probability density functions (pdf). We analyze existing pruning algorithms and experimentally show that there exists a new bottleneck in the performance due to the overhead of pruning candidate clusters for assignment of each uncertain object in each iteration. In this article, we will show that by considering squared Euclidean distance, UK-means (without pruning techniques) is reduced to K-means and performs much faster than pruning algorithms, however, with some discrepancies in the clustering results due to using different distance functions. Thus, we propose Approximate UK-means to heuristically identify objects of boundary cases and re-assign them to better clusters. Three models for the representation of cluster representative (certain model, uncertain model and heuristic model) are proposed to calculate expected squared Euclidean distance between objects and cluster representatives in this paper. Our experimental results show that on average the execution time of Approximate UK-means is only 25% more than K-means and our approach reduces the discrepancies of K-means’ clustering results by up to 70%.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

While there has been a large amount of research on mining and queries on relational databases [1], the focus has been on databases that store data in exact values. In many real-life applications, however, the raw data (for example, in the case of sensor data) are not precise or accurate when they were collected or produced. The clustering of such “uncertain” data can be illustrated by the following simple realistic example. Considering sensors on wild animals that update their locations periodically, the sample locations of an animal over a period generate a (discrete) probability distribution function (PDF) describing the possible locations of the animal. Clustering results on those animals may reveal the possible groups and interactions between them. In our work, we consider the problem of clustering objects with multidimensional uncertainty where an object is represented by an uncertain region over which a discrete probability distribution function (PDF) or a probability density function (pdf) is defined. Formally, there is a set of n objects

                      is bounded by a finite region, but it does not mean that the number of samples is finite). This assumption is convincing because in practice the probability density of an object is high only within a very small region of concentration.

The goal of UK-means is to group n objects into K clusters so that the sum of expected Euclidean distances (EED) [2] between the uncertain objects and their cluster centers is minimized. Thus,

                      is minimized where ED is Euclidean distance function based on a metric d (i.e. Euclidean distance in UK-means and pruning algorithms, squared Euclidean distance in our approach).

In UK-means, the calculation of expected Euclidean distance is time consuming. Pruning UK-means [3,4] improves the efficiency of UK-means by pruning candidate clusters. However, existing algorithms are still undesirably slow due to the overhead of pruning candidate clusters for each object in each iteration. In this paper, UK-means is improved by using squared Euclidean distance and heuristically reduce the discrepancy generated by using different distance functions. Three models for the representation of cluster representative (certain model, uncertain model and heuristic model) are also proposed to calculate expected squared Euclidean distance between objects and cluster representatives. Heuristic model is a combination of certain model and uncertain model for clustering uncertain objects heuristically.

Our contributions of this work include:
                        
                           (i) After applying the analytic solution [5,6] to reduce UK-means to K-means, we experimentally show that K-means performs much faster than existing pruning algorithms proposed in [3,4] with some discrepancies in the clustering results due to using different distance functions.

(ii) We propose Approximate UK-means to heuristically identify objects of boundary cases and re-assign them to better clusters. Our experimental results show that on average the execution time of Approximate UK-means is only 25% more than K-means (while pruning algorithms are 300% more) and our approach reduces the discrepancies of K-means’ clustering results up to 70% with assuming the results of pruning algorithms [3,4] to be the ground truth.

(iii) Different from previous work in [7], we propose three models for the representation of cluster representative (certain model, uncertain model and heuristic model) to calculate expected squared Euclidean distance between objects and cluster representatives. From the experiments, Approximate UK-means based on the uncertain model can additionally reduce the discrepancy of the certain cluster representative model up to 77% with only a little execution time increased.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes related work on uncertain objects. In Section 3, we introduce expected squared Euclidean distance by using three different models of cluster representative. Section 4 proposes a heuristic Approximate UK-means to identify objects of boundary cases and re-assign them to better clusters. Section 5 demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of Approximate UK-means by extensive experiments. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

There has been significant research interest in uncertain database [8,9]. Data uncertainty are classified into two types. One is existential uncertainty, which is caused by the fact that we are not sure the object or data tuple exists or not [10–13]; The other is value uncertainty caused by not knowing the value precisely. In this paper, we focus on the second case (value uncertainty). The relationship uncertainty is first proposed by Jiang et al. in [14] recently. The task of summarizing the relationship uncertainty [14] between objects is learning the order of the values on a dimension of the domain. For example, a traveler gives a higher score to a hotel whose location is close to the central, and a lower score to a hotel that is far from the central, which likely means that the user prefers the hotel near the central. Learning the order of values can infer more knowledge of domain.

UK-means [2] is a generalization of traditional K-means to handle uncertain objects whose locations are represented by pdfs. In K-means, object o is assigned to cluster c such that the Euclidean distance between o and c’s representative is the smallest among all clusters. The only difference between UK-means and K-means is distance calculation method between an object and a cluster representative. Expected Euclidean distance is calculated in UK-means while K-means uses Euclidean distance. For arbitrary pdfs, the bottleneck of UK-means is the calculation of expected distance, which is computationally expensive. Thus, pruning techniques are proposed to remove the candidate clusters from consideration, which are certainly not closest to the object, reducing a large amount of expected distance calculations.

The basic idea of pruning techniques is using simple distance calculation to identify cluster representatives that cannot be the closest one to a given uncertain object. Hence, the expected distance calculations between those cluster representatives and the object can be skipped.

VDBi [4] is another pruning method using VORONOI diagrams [15] to consider the spatial relationships among cluster representatives. VDBi [4] is more efficient than MinMax-BB by using VORONOI-cell pruning and bisector pruning. VDBi pruning includes VORONOI-cell pruning and bisector pruning. For VORONOI-cell pruning, given K cluster representatives, the VORONOI diagrams divide the space

                         that cannot be pruned by MinMax-BB [4]. The overhead of VDBi includes the time of VORONOI diagrams construction, VORONOI-cell pruning and bisector pruning. The pruning methods can be more efficient with the use of cluster-shift technique [3,4]. Because it is likely that the cluster representatives shift by small distance in the next iteration, the tighter bound can be made to prune candidate clusters more efficiently. Cluster-shift (SHIFT) technique can be applied to MinMax-BB and VDBi pruning techniques. The additional overhead of SHIFT technique includes the time of cluster representative shift calculation between two consecutive iterations. Although the pruning techniques have reduced most of expected distance calculations, it is still expensive to use these pruning techniques for each object in each iteration. Thus, the pruning process becomes a new bottleneck.

Recently, there have been studies on density-based clustering on uncertain data. FDBSCAN [16] and FOPTICS [17] are based on DBSCAN [18] and OPTICS [19] respectively to handle density-based clustering on uncertain objects. In DBSCAN, clusters are formed based on the concepts of core objects and reachability. In FDBSCAN, the concepts of core objects and reachability are re-defined by integrating the information of fuzzy distance functions to handle uncertain objects. An object o is a core object if the probability that the number of other objects that are close to o exceeds a certain probability threshold. Whether o is “reachable” from another object q depends on both the probability of o being close to q and the probability that q is a core object. FOPTICS uses a similar approach with probabilities to modify OPTICS to handle uncertain data.

There are also studies on other data mining tasks on uncertain data, such as classification, outlier detection, frequent pattern mining, and domain orders learning.

In [20], support vector machine is used to classify uncertain data. In uncertain SVM, the uncertain object is assumed as a simple bounded geometric model. Support vector machine creates margins by using uncertain objects which overlap the boundary. In [21], uRule is proposed based on Rule-based algorithm to classify uncertain information. The difference between Rule-based and uRule is that the instances are partly covered by the rule in uRule. The key idea of uRule is that the algorithm computes which proportion of the instances is covered by a rule based on the uncertain attribute interval and probabilistic function. In [22,23], the decision tree classifier is extended to handle uncertain data by using averaging or distribution-based approach. Naive Bayes is extended to classify uncertain data in [24].

Outlier detection on uncertain objects is discussed in [25–28]. Possible world semantics [29–33] are the basis of outlier definition. Matsumoto and Hung [28] propose a new implementation for outlier detection by using parallelized cross-platform OpenCL framework on uncertain data. Different from previous work, Jiang and Pei [25] consider outlier instances on uncertain data while others only focus on outlier objects. The problem of frequent pattern mining on uncertain data are proposed in the literature [34–39].

Efficiency is important in real time applications. The bottlenecks of uncertain object clustering are expected distance calculation and pruning of candidate clusters. However, by considering squared Euclidean distance (instead of Euclidean distance in UK-means), UK-means can be reduced to K-means (so, no pruning of clusters is necessary) [40], which is much faster with some discrepancies in the clustering results shown in the experimental section. Three models of cluster representatives will be discussed in Section 3.3.

A certain object is represented as a point in a multidimensional space. The multidimensional space is produced by the domains of all attributes. The imperfect data quality caused by uncertain nature or system limitation during data collection phase leads to uncertain attribute values of an object, then a set of points are used to represent an uncertain object. Each point represents a possible location of the uncertain object. The distribution of the probabilities of possible locations is represented by a PDF (probability distribution function). Alternatively, an uncertain object can also be represented as a (finite or infinite) region, which covers the possible locations of the object (especially the number of possible locations is not finite). The region of the uncertain domain of object

                           The domain of uncertain object is continuous, but the samples are sampled from the domain which may be discrete. The probability of the sample is related to the pdf of the uncertain object within the domain. For example, if we divide the domain into a number of intervals, and a sample is randomly sampled from one of them. The probability of the sample is the integration of the pdf within the interval. The pdf of the object is continuous, so pdf is used in this paper for consistency.

The distance function D can be Euclidean distance, squared Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance, etc. The following section presents the analytical solutions of expected distance calculation between uncertain objects. In the case of clustering uncertain objects, both the objects and cluster representatives are uncertain objects like

An uncertain object can also be represented as a set of points, each of which is a possible location of object

                        [3,5,4]. In real applications, there are many practical ways to specify the pdf. Gaussian distribution and uniform distribution are usually used to specify the pdf of uncertain objects [3,4]. As Fig. 1

                        , and the metric ED is Euclidean distance in [3,4,2], squared Euclidean distance in [5] and our method. By using expected squared Euclidean distance, [40] shows that UK-means can be reduced to K-means. In the following, another derivation by applying the analytic solution in [5] will be introduced. We will first define the mean vector and the trace of covariance matrix of an uncertain object given its samples as follows.

The uncertain model of cluster representative costs more time than the certain model because of the calculation of

Heuristic model considers the cluster representative as a certain object at first, and then heuristically considers the uncertainty of cluster representatives. In this model, the Means’ expected squared Euclidean distance is calculated by Eq. (9) using the certain model (K-means). When the algorithm using the certain model converges, the uncertain cluster representative model is used to re-cluster the objects based on the clustering results obtained by the certain model.

In this section, we will introduce our “Approximate UK-means” which heuristically identifies objects of the boundary cases and reassigns them to better clusters in order to reduce the discrepancies of clustering results.

In Section 3.2, UK-means is reduced to K-means by using squared Euclidean distance while UK-means originally uses Euclidean distance. It is not surprising that the clustering results of K-means will deviate from those of UK-means. The order of cluster representatives sorted by their expected distances to a given object may be different from that sorted by expected squared distances. Fig. 2
                      gives an example of discrepancy between these two distance functions. An uncertain object is assumed to have two samples in two grid cells and the probabilities of these two samples are

Therefore, a heuristic approach called Approximate UK-means is proposed. The basic idea of the heuristic approach is picking out objects near the boundary between two clusters and re-assigning them in the first iteration of Approximate UK-means.

The above is only done in the first iteration of Approximate UK-means because we observed that the assignment of objects in the first iteration is the most important, which will greatly affect later iterations due to the shift of cluster representatives. Algorithm 2 shows Approximate UK-means using the certain cluster representative model.

                     Algorithm 4 shows Approximate UK-means using the heuristic cluster representative model. In Algorithm 4, the initial cluster representatives are the same as those of Algorithm 3. The clustering process is a combination of certain model and uncertain model. The cluster representatives are assumed to be certain at first. Thus, we calculate the MSED between uncertain object

                      becomes larger. Thus, more objects are considered as boundary cases because more objects will satisfy the inequality and will be checked again. In fact, the experimental results in Section 5 show that this heuristic approach can significantly reduce the discrepancies of clustering results by up to 70% compared with K-means. The tradeoff is only 25% more execution time, which is still at least 10 times faster than existing pruning algorithms [3,4,2].

Discrepancy is used to measure the difference of clustering results between two clustering algorithms based on purity. Purity is the maximum probability that a cluster in algorithm A contains objects of the same cluster from algorithm B.

In this section, we evaluate Approximate UK-means experimentally by comparing it with K-means and pruning UK-means (MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT) [3,4]. The execution time and clustering results are compared in the experiments. All algorithms were written in Java and were run on a Linux machine with an Intel 
                        
                           2.5
                        
                     
                     GHz Pentium (R) Dual-Core processor and 8GB of main memory.

For ease of comparison with previous work like [4,3,22] which used synthetic data sets only, 125 random data sets are generated for the experiments. In each data set, a set of n uncertain objects represented by MBRs with size

                         grid cells. Each grid cell corresponds to a sample. Each sample is associated with a randomly generated probability value. All probabilities in an MBR are normalized to have their sum equal to 1. In each data set, a set of K cluster representatives was randomly initialized and was repeatedly used in all experiments on the same data set for more fair comparisons. This is to eliminate variations in the results due to the uses of different sets of initial cluster representatives. The baseline values of parameters used for the experiments on random data sets are summarized in Table 1
                        . For example, the baseline data sets,

                        , which means that each cluster contains at least hundreds of objects. Each object is bounded by a maximum bounded region (MBR) with size

                        . It is obvious that there are many clusters overlapped to each other, and the objects from the same clusters or different clusters are also overlapped to each other.

In these experiments, the sample number T was varied from 100 to 900. The other parameters were kept at baseline values. Fig. 4
                           (a) shows the execution time of the six algorithms on random data sets. However, all three Approximate UK-means run almost as fast as K-means and their execution time grows much slower than MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT. The significant improvement in the performance of Approximate UK-means is due to two reasons: (i) the distance calculations are done much faster (Fig. 4(b)) and (ii) the overhead is much reduced as no pruning is necessary (Fig. 4(c)). Fig. 4(b) also shows that the time of (expected) distance calculation in Approximate UK-means (all three models) does not change a lot with T because PESED calculation does not depend on sample number T, and the time of expected distance calculation in the first clustering iteration of Approximate UK-means is only a minor cost.

In these experiments, the cluster number K was varied from 10 to 100. The other parameters were kept at baseline values. When K increases, there will be more overlapping objects and clusters. Fig. 5
                            shows the execution time of the six algorithms on random data sets. Fig. 5(a) shows that the total execution time of all six algorithms grows as K increases. However, Approximate UK-means almost spends the same time as K-means and its execution time grows much slower than MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT. In Fig. 5(b), (expected) distance calculation of K-means is more efficient than five other algorithms. (Expected) distance calculation of Approximate UK-means (all three models) is faster than MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT if K is smaller than 100. The overhead time of Approximate UK-means is not related to K while the overhead time of MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT grows linearly with K (Fig. 5(c)). MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT has to prune more cluster candidates when K becomes larger.

                           (a) shows the execution time of the six algorithms with varying S on random data sets. Fig. 6(a) shows that the total execution time of MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT increases as 
                              
                                 S

                            increases while K-means and Approximate UK-means (all three models) do not increase as

                            increases. However, Approximate UK-means runs almost as fast as K-means and its execution time grows much slower than MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT. The significant improvement in the performance of all Approximate UK-means is due to two reasons: (i) the distance calculations are done much faster (Fig. 6(b)) and (ii) the overhead is much reduced as no pruning is necessary (Fig. 6(c)). From Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b), the total execution time of all the three Approximate UK-means models is similar, and the (expected) distance calculation time of all the three Approximate UK-means models is also similar.

In these experiments, the object number n was varied from 5000 to 60,000. The other parameters were kept at their baseline values. When n grows, more objects generated in the space. More objects and clusters will be overlapped. Fig. 7
                           (a) shows that the total execution time of all the six algorithms increases as n increases. However, all Approximate UK-means runs almost as fast as K-means and its execution time grows much slower than MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT which is similar to other cases. In Fig. 7(a), the execution time of the three Approximate UK-means models is similar. In Fig. 7(b), the (expected) distance calculation time of Approximate UK-means using the uncertain model (UnC. model) and Approximate UK-means using the heuristic model (H. model) is longer than that of Approximate UK-means using the certain model.

In these experiments, the dimension number D was varied from 2 to 6 on random data sets. The other parameters were kept at baseline values. Fig. 8
                           (a) shows that the total execution time of the six algorithms increases as D increases on random data sets. All the three Approximate UK-means models run almost as fast as K-means and its execution time grows much slower than MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT. The significant improvement in the performance of Approximate UK-means is due to two reasons: (i) the distance calculations are done much faster (Fig. 8(b)) and (ii) the overhead is much reduced as no pruning is necessary (Fig. 8(c)).

Not only will different distance metrics generate different results [41], different distance functions based on Euclidean distance metric will also have different results. This section compares the clustering results of Approximate UK-means using three different models with those of pruning algorithms (MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT) by discrepancy. It is emphasized that there is no “true” or “correct” clustering result because even the K-means running on traditional certain objects may give different clustering results by using different distance metrics or different seeds. In fact, the discrepancy between the results of UK-means and K-means is due to different distance functions used. It does not mean that the clustering result by K-means is wrong. Therefore, here we would like to only point out the changes that K-means may bring to UK-means (given the same seeds) and also how much Approximate UK-means may reduce these changes.

For each comparison, we ran Approximate UK-means using three different models of cluster representative with different

In the figures, the reduction in discrepancy of Approximate UK-means with respect to K-means is up to 70%. The settings of the 5 lines are on the baseline values except the parameter specified in the figures. From Figs. 9(b), 10(b) and 11(b), when

                           Table 2
                            shows the reduction in discrepancy of clustering results of Approximate UK-means using the uncertain model with respect to Approximate UK-means using the certain model on some random data sets, in which the discrepancy was reduced most by the uncertain model. The uncertain model of cluster representative can reduce the discrepancy caused by uncertainty of cluster representatives. From Table 2, we can see that the uncertain model can reduce the discrepancy with respect to the certain model up to 21.9% on random data sets.

To make the clustering results more reasonable, 125 data sets with Gaussian distribution are also generated. The n uncertain objects in a data set were equally grouped into K clusters. In each cluster, the centers of

                         uncertain objects were generated from a Gaussian distribution, whose mean and standard deviation are equal to the cluster center and 
                           
                              σ
                           
                         respectively. The cluster center was randomly generated and was restricted to have a minimum distance mindis with other cluster centers. The baseline values of parameters used for the experiments on Gaussian data sets are summarized in Table 3
                        . In each parameter set, a set of five experiments was run on five different randomly generated data sets. Each experiment was repeated on the six algorithms. The average value of five runs on each algorithm was taken and reported. The cases of Gaussian data sets are similar to those of random data sets. The objects from the same cluster or the objects from different clusters will be overlapped to each other. When the parameters (i.e.

In these experiments, the sample number T was varied from 100 to 900. The other parameters were kept at baseline values. The execution time comparison of the six algorithms on Gaussian data sets with varying T is shown in Fig. 12
                           . The execution time of K-means and Approximate UK-means does not increase as T increases (Fig. 12(a)), because the time of expected distance calculation Fig. 12(b) and overhead time (Fig. 12(c)) of Approximate UK-means do not change with varying T.

In these experiments, the cluster number K was varied from 10 to 100. The other parameters were kept at baseline values. The execution time of Approximate UK-means and K-means is faster than MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT (Fig. 13
                           (a)), for the reason that the expected distance calculation and the overhead time of Approximate UK-means and K-means are much faster than those of MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT Fig. 13(b) and Fig. 13(c).

                           (b and c)). So, the total execution time of Approximate UK-means is much faster than that of MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT (Fig. 14(a)).

In these experiments, the object number n was varied from 5000 to 60,000. The other parameters were kept at their baseline values. Similar to other cases, the total execution time of Approximate UK-means and K-means is much faster than that of MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT (Fig. 15

Fig. 16(b) and Fig. 16(c) show that the time of distance calculation and the overhead time of Approximate UK-means and K-means are much faster than those of MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT.

From Figs. 4(a), 5(a), 6(a), 7(a), 8(a), 12(a), 13(a), 14(a), 15(a) and 16(a), the execution time of all the Approximate UK-means and K-means increases much slower than MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT, and the total execution time of all the three Approximate UK-means models is close to K-means. From Figs. 4(b), 5(b), 6(b), 7(b), 8(b), and Figs. 12(b), 13(b), 14(b), 15(b) and 16(b), we can see that (i) the time of (expected) distance calculation of Approximate UK-means using the uncertain model (UnC. model) and Approximate UK-means using the heuristic model (H. model) is a little longer than that of the certain model and (ii) the time of (expected) distance calculation of the three Approximate UK-means models and K-means is much faster than that of MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT. From Figs. 4(c), 5(c), 6(c), 7(c), 8(c), and Figs. 12(c), 13(c), 14(c), 15(c) and 16(c), the overhead time used for pruning in MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT occupies a large portion of total execution time, which is the new bottleneck of pruning UK-means, and the overhead time of all Approximate UK-means with different

Additionally, the uncertain model can reduce the discrepancy with respect to the certain model up to 77.0% on Gaussian data sets shown in Table 4

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The main aim of this work is pointing out that the clustering results of the heuristic approach can reduce the discrepancy of K-means when the clustering results of UK-means are supposed to be the ground truth. The experimental results show that the heuristic approach can reduce the discrepancy caused by using different distance metrics by identifying boundary cases and re-assigning them.

Boundary cases are considered as the objects that may be assigned to different clusters by different algorithms. If there are many boundary cases in the data sets, the algorithm will perform better. In our work, the boundary case is related to the distance between samples and cluster representatives. The ability of founding boundary cases is related to the value of 
                           
                              β
                           
                        . The harder problem is supposed to be with more overlapped clusters, then more objects are likely to be considered as boundary cases. Then the heuristic approach will help and may perform better than K-means method.

In many real application cases, it is hard to say which distance metric is better. In this paper, we just try to introduce and demonstrate that the heuristic approach can reduce the discrepancy of K-means with respect to pruning UK-means. Thus, the clustering results of pruning UK-means should be supposed to be the ground truth. The difference between the algorithms is using different distance functions. UK-means uses expected Euclidean distance while K-means uses expected squared Euclidean distance. If the algorithms use the same distance function, they will become the same algorithm. Thus, the algorithms cannot use the same distance function.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we studied the problem of clustering objects whose locations are presented by probability density functions (pdf). Existing pruning techniques have improved the efficiency of UK-means by reducing the number of expected distance calculations. However, these techniques introduce new overhead and become the performance bottleneck. UK-means can be reduced to K-means by using expected squared Euclidean distance instead of expected Euclidean distance to overcome the bottleneck of existing pruning techniques (MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT).

Our experiments show that K-means by using squared Euclidean distance is much faster than UK-means (even with pruning techniques, i.e. MinMax-SHIFT and VDBi-SHIFT). The significant improvement in the speed is due to (i) the distance calculations are done much faster, (ii) the overhead is much reduced as no pruning is necessary, and (iii) it only needs to load samples in the beginning while pruning algorithms need to load them for every expected distance calculation. K-means generates clustering results with discrepancies from the original clustering results of UK-means, which can be reduced by our proposed approach (Approximate UK-means). In addition, the uncertainty of cluster representative is considered in our work. To our knowledge, this is the first time to introduce the uncertain model of cluster representative. The uncertain model used in Approximate UK-means can reduce the discrepancy caused by large difference between the uncertainty of cluster representatives. The best reduction of discrepancy of the uncertain model with respect to the certain model is 21.9% and 77.0% on random data sets and Gaussian data sets respectively.
