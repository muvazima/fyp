                  In this article, we describe a novel polyphonic analysis that employs a hybrid of Tone-Model (TM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques. This hybrid approach exploits the strengths of model-based and heuristic-search approaches. The correlations between each monophonic Tone-Model and the polyphonic input are used to predict relevant pitches such that the aggregations of the pitches’ Tone-Models are able to describe the harmonic contents of the polyphonic input. These aggregations are then refined using PSO. PSO heuristically searches for a local optimal aggregation in which some Tone-Models suggested earlier may be excluded from the final best aggregation. We present and discuss the design of our approach. The experimental results from the proposed hybrid approach are compared and contrasted with the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) technique. A performance comparison between synthesized guitar sound and acoustic guitar sound is discussed. The experimental results confirm the potential of TM–PSO in polyphonic transcription task.
