                  The uncertainty children experience when searching for information influences their information seeking behavior by stimulating curiosity or hindering their search efforts. This study explored the interactions and the usability of various search interfaces, and the enjoyment or uncertainty experienced by children when using them. Structural Equation Modeling was used to determine whether children feel uncertainty or a sense of control when using virtual game-like interfaces to search for information associated with entertainment or as a means to satisfy an assigned learning task. We then analyzed the weight relationships among three latent variables (information needs, interface media, and affective state) using statistical (path) analysis. Our results indicate that children prefer using a retrieval interface with situated affordance to satisfy entertainment-related information needs, as opposed to searching for information to solve specific problems. Furthermore, their perceptions of text and graphic icons determined the degree to which they experienced a sense of uncertainty or control. When searching for entertainment-related information, they were better able to deal with uncertainty and sought greater control in their search interface, compared to when they were searching for information related to assigned tasks. According to their information needs, children may regard a game-like interface as a toy or a tool for learning. The results of this study can serve as reference for the future development of information search interfaces aimed at arousing the interest of children. The use of virtual game-like interfaces to guide the IS behavior of children warrants further study.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Natural curiosity and the need to satisfy emotional desires have been shown to motivate children to search for information (Bilal, 2005; Cooper, 2002; Martens, 2012; Shenton & Dixon, 2004; Walter, 1994). For example, Druin (2005, p. 30) explained that children often seek books using keywords such as “happy” or “scary” to match their affective states. Children require information seeking (IS) skills as well as a suitable interface to help them find the information they need (Gossen & Nürnberger, 2013; Hourcade, 2007; Hutchinson et al., 2005; Large & Beheshti, 2005; Liu, Ito, Toyokuni, Sato, & Nakashima, 2012; Nesset & Large, 2004). Researchers in human–computer interaction (HCI) have investigated children’s interaction with virtual representations in order to make learning easier and more pleasurable (Allison, Wills, Bowman, Wineman, & Hodges, 1997; Faiola, Newlon, Pfaff, & Smyslova, 2013; Lee, Wong, & Fung, 2010; Scaife & Rogers, 2001). Researchers in IS behavior and computing research are well aware of the role played by affective play in interaction with information systems (Bilal, 2005; Julien, McKechnie, & Hart, 2005; Kuhlthau, 2004; Lopatovska & Arapakis, 2011; Nahl, 2004; Van Schaik & Ling, 2012; Wilson, 1999; Zhang, 2008). Concepts such as the virtual world (VW) have recently been introduced to the design of interfaces aimed at helping children seeking information (Wu, Tang, & Tsai, 2014; Beheshti, 2012; Dubroy, 2010). Understanding how playing and learning needs affect children’s choices when interacting with VW retrieval interfaces, as well as their cognitive states, could help researchers in the development of child-oriented game-like interfaces for the retrieval of information.

Researchers in children–computer interaction have designed software for young children to support learning through playing (McKenney & Voogt, 2010; Mumtaz, 2001). Read (2005) classified software for children into three genres: enabling software such as word processors and internet browsers, entertainment software that includes game and media products, and educational software that is either linked to a curriculum or designed for assessing special skills. Though most educational software for young children includes games that assess special skills, such software also stimulates older children who are more interested in entertainment value than education (MacFarlane, Sparrowhawk, & Heald, 2002, p. 4). Thus, a critical problem is how to make software “fun” and thus stimulate learning interest in children. Many related studies have explored fun and the problem of usability, virtual worlds, and IS behavioral issues.


                        Sim, MacFarlane, and Read (2006, p. 235) empirically studied fun, usability, and learning in educational software and found that “(for the tested software), learning was not correlated with fun or usability”, but “observed fun and observed usability were correlated (with each other).” Though Sim et al. (2006) demonstrated that children appeared to have less fun when their interactions with educational software had more usability problems, it is not clear whether usability of children digital libraries would have any effect on their levels of enjoyment.


                        Bilal (2002a) collaborated with children as design partners in developing prototype interfaces of Web search engines. All of the children’s prototype drawings had educational and entertainment information, indicating that children desired to apply the engines to seek information for schoolwork as well as play game. Thus, children may treat a retrieval interface as a toy in searching for information as a form of entertainment or take an interface as a learning tool for problem solving. The way in which children have fun while searching for information and issues they may encounter with usability are topics worthy of further research.

Virtual worlds (VW), defined as three-dimensional interactive environments where users may participate through their avatars, were initially developed to serve gaming communities (Messinger et al., 2009; Sutanto, Phang, Tan, & Lu, 2011). Ryan and Deci (2000) explained that the intrinsic motives of those intending to use the designed VW system are to create a pleasurable experience and provide self-fulfilling value. Gradually, VWs have started to shift to an instrumental role by enabling their users to perform rather utilitarian tasks, such as buying financial services, participate in courses, and co-creation of innovations (Hinrichs, Hill, & Patterson, 2010; Huang, Rauch, & Liaw, 2010; Kohler, Fueller, Stieger, & Matzler, 2011; Mennecke et al., 2008; Shelton, 2010).


                        Bilal (2005, p. 204) stated that “in the children’s eye the visual design of a successful portal is one with a fun name.” To introduce visualized interfaces, including virtual environments to help children searching information, Druin et al. (2001, p. 403) designed SearchKids including the search options of a virtual zoo that children recognize images of animals to access media, a world area for children browsing the animal database by geographical criteria and a search area that provides functions to ‘‘visually specify and manipulate queries.’’ Beheshti (2012) designed a digital library and a virtual interface for children using the metaphor of a physical library with reading rooms, bookcases, and books. Search results are displayed as red dots on the floor plan of a library.

Young children differ from adults in their literacy abilities, in particular in their understanding of metadata and classification schemes (Martens, 2012, p. 165) and motor skills (Hourcade, 2007). Virtual world interfaces offer users situated contexts to their learning, which is in accordance with Gibson’ Affordance Theory (Goel, Johnson, Junglas, & Ives, 2013; Lee et al., 2010). They can also increase learner motivation and positively impact on the cognitive load associated with the processing of information (Huang, 2011).

Most virtual interfaces use icons to represent operations (i.e., searching). Information visualization theory purports that an icon can be characterized by aspects of the data associated with the object to indicate its meaning (Shneiderman, 2003). Koshman (2006, p. 206) analyzed iconic representations and metaphors of icon layout in visualization systems used for information retrieval, and suggested that such systems provide users “more visual and temporal control over the information displayed.” Leide, Large, Beheshti, and Brooks (2003, p. 937) developed a visual navigation classification scheme for domain novices (i.e. children). When novices search for information, they have specific directions but they do not have a specific search target. During the search, he/she will change his/her point of view based on what he/she has found, thereby establishing a specific knowledge map and modifying his/her search target and range. These novices have no special training or beliefs regarding search strategies. Therefore, children adopted the most intuitive searching methodology. A visual interface based on navigation experience is used to help users build mind maps. Comparing the mind knowledge map with the information they receive while searching for information produces uncertainty in the mind of the user regarding the means to navigate the visual space of the domain knowledge map (see Fig. 1
                        ). However, these uncertainties have not yet been explored.

IS has been shown to influence learning. Marchionini (1995) suggested that learning and information-seeking are closely related and partially overlapping processes, both of which alter the individual state of knowledge. Kuhlthau (2004) considered learning as a process of construction that engages all aspects of an individual’s experience. She stated that negative affect, such as uncertainty, could stimulate users to be less willing to remain interacting with an information system (Kuhlthau, 1993). However, Bilal (2005, p. 203) stated that children are positive about their experiences with the web mainly because of the challenge, motivation, and increases in self-confidence. Ozcelik, Cagiltay, and Ozcelik (2013) revealed that uncertainty enhances learning.


                        Tenopir, Wang, Zhang, Simmons, and Pollard (2008) suggested that search strategies and tasks induce negative feelings, whereas the use of a digital library when using effective navigation systems can produce positive feelings are associations. Furthermore, smaller collections of information can produce negative feelings and uncertainty about using the system. Chowdhury, Gibb, and Landoni (2011) evaluated uncertainty in information seeking and retrieval (IS&R) in academic environments, and found that the relationship between uncertainty and the formulation of search processes is non-linear and complex and increasing the number of information channels significantly increases the uncertainty associated with the search process. Chowdhury et al. (2011, p. 173) suggested that researchers identify positive/desirable uncertainty in contrast to negative/undesirable uncertainty and their impacts on the IS&R process.”


                        Bilal and Kirby (2002) observed different IS behaviors and user experiences among adults and children. Adults employed advanced search syntax, but children did not. Adults applied a linear or systematic browsing style whereas children had a “loopy” style, in which they repeated the same actions repeatedly until they achieved their goal. Adults were more efficient in their navigations, and using fewer hyperlinks and backtracks than did children. Adults did not deviate from the designated targets whereas most children did. Adults could quickly recover from breakdowns in keyword searches, whereas children could not. Thus, Bilal and Kirby (2002) showed that children experience greater uncertainty than adults in their IS processes.


                        Shenton and Dixon (2004) claimed that children differ from adults in controlling IS behavior: they tend to expend minimum effort to find sufficient information, they apply the same method repeatedly, they select a search strategy at the point of need, and they apply untaught, expedient IS methods. Children’s IS behavior involves self-exploration of an uncertain environment in a semi-structured manner (Cooper, 2002). Most development of digital libraries for children seek to simplify interfaces; however, children like to have fun and be stimulated (by positive uncertainty) in a game-like virtual environment.

The reviewed studies illustrate aspects of the IS behavior of children and their affective states; however, there remains a lack of understanding related to the design of usable and fun/enjoyable interfaces when applying the concept of VW to a digital library. For children, it may be decomposed into two new dimensions, one is information need included of playing (diversionary) and learning (solving problem), and the other is affective state included of uncertainty and sense of control (ease of use) – usability. Whereas the VW retrieval interfaces that are characterized with different visual attractiveness function (channel) as connected factors between the information need and the affective state. The aim of this study was to fill the information gap regarding children’s need for information and their affective states. We also suggest a model that may be used to investigate what VW retrieval interfaces children prefer (choose) when searching for information for entertainment or problem-solving, the mixed affective states of uncertainty, and ease of use that they require. An understanding of how children use the VW interface as a toy and tool at the same time could facilitate the development of fun educational software.

Although this study focuses on the relationships between Affective State, VW Retrieval Interface, and Information Need for children seeking to retrieve information, the observed variables for each latent variable must be further defined through literature review.

As this study examines the relationship between Information Need and Interface Media, the studies of interface usability and the intention underlying the information-seeking behavior of children must be reviewed. Carroll (2004) suggested that the concept of usability should be extended to include fun. Massey, Weeks, and Druin (2005) also used fun to measure children’s responses to literature in a digital library. Gurland and Glowacky (2011), who discussed theories of motivation for children, noted that children were most interested in the rewards strategy. O’Brien and Toms (2008) discussed user engagement, established a conceptual framework for defining user engagement with technology, and made “emerging” one definition of engagement. In addition, Amichai-Hamburger, Kaynar, and Fine (2007) asserted that individuals with a low need for cognition (attention) prefer interactive sites over linear sites with deeper hyperlink levels. Case (2012) noted that an individual who senses a problematic situation and lacks the internal knowledge that is required to find paths to his or her goals is likely to seek information. Thus, “informative” and “useful” are two important factors for children solving problems. Thus, the observed variables for the latent variable of Entertainment Information Need (EN) are fun (Funy), motivation (Moti), engagement (Enag), and attention (Aten), whereas those of Problem-Solving Information Need (PS) are informative (Ifmv) and useful (Usfl).

People frequently recognize a picture with a single glance and understand text and sound based on recognizing each component individually across a time sequence. Tzeng (2004) examined users’ responses to apologies for a computer game failure expressed through text and designed icons. Apologetic (sad) icons communicated more effectively than pure text. In addition, Bilal and Bachir (2007) underlined the importance of ‘representations’ and ‘meaning’ in information searches undertaken by non-native English-speaking children when using the International Children’s Digital Library (ICDL). Thus, the carrying of concept and expression of meaning are important functions of an icon in a graphic interface. Hu, Ma, and Chau (1999) suggested that “size” and “distance” may provide numerous effective and essential visual cues in communication of concepts from systems to users. While demonstrating that information visualizations support knowledge acquisition, Keller, Gerjets, Scheiter, and Garsoffky (2006) indicated that 2D information visualizations support knowledge acquisition processes better than 3D information visualizations. Hourcade (2002, p. 5) claimed that sizing visual targets appropriately would improve usability for children. Text in images carries a lot of useful and important information, such as in advertisements and road signs, and text recognition is widely used in content-based image indexing and the retrieval of video sequences (Yan, Li, & Gao, 2011). However, children often have difficulty recognizing text-forms in a complex background, e.g. a VW. Mandarin Chinese is encoded in a morphological format. When readers move their eyes across the text, visual acuity, visual crowding (Hautala, Hyona, & Aro, 2011), text layout (Li, Liu, & Rayner, 2011), and font size (Shu, Zhou, Yan, & Kliegl, 2011) may lead to saccade-targeting contingent on word segmentation processes. Font size and scene cues thus significantly influence interface functions.

Taiwanese children in their first year of primary school must learn the Chinese phonetic alphabet, and the written phonetic alphabet then helps these children recognize the meanings of words. Brück, Kreifelts, and Wildgruber (2011) analyzed how humans extract information from voice tone. When children trigger an icon that initiates an audio narration, they are using a multimedia channel to receive information, which also helps them obtain information. Thus, the observed variables for the latent variable of a VW retrieval interface with text-sound (TS) are font size (Fnsz), text with the phonetic alphabet (Tpnb), phonetic alphabet (Pnab), and associated voice (Asvc), and those of a VW retrieval interface with graphic icon (GI) are scene cue (Sncu), concept carried (Cpcy), and graphic expression (Grep).

Interface Media and Affective State are causally related, explaining why the observed variables of Affective State are based on investigations of the comments and feelings of children regarding their interface use.

Many existing instruments have been developed to measure anxiety and uncertainty, such as the Scale for Intolerance of Uncertainty (Berenbaum, Bredemeier, & Thompson, 2008; Birrell, Meares, Wilkinson, & Freeston, 2011; Buhr & Dugas, 2002; Carleton, Norton, & Admundson, 2007; Helsen, Van den Bussche, Vlaeyen & Goubert,2013; Sexton & Dugas, 2009). Most previous research has focused on goodness of fit in either therapeutic psychology or the study of personality. This study focused on children in a state of uncertainty of unknowing when using a VW retrieval interface. We adopted some of the items from the Scale for Intolerance of Uncertainty, including partial concepts as frustrate, unforeseen, organize everything in advance in for the development of a scale specific to the context of this study.

Several studies have assessed systems that communicate effect using emotionally expressive computer agents. Brave, Nass, and Hutchinson (2005) examined how emotionally expressive computer agents affect user perceptions of a computer game. Participants perceived empathetic agents with “perceived caring” – “trustworthiness” (non-confused) and “felt support” – “likeability” (not difficult). Westerman, Collins, and Cribbin (2005) identified information strategies in which participants adopt an “exhaustive” approach when seeking two-dimensional (2D) node arrangements and a “focused” approach when seeking three-dimensional (3D) arrangements. Kules and Shneiderman (2008) quantitatively analyzed searcher comments regarding eight criteria that participants typically adopt when using categorized overviews: “wonderful/terrible, easy to use/difficult to use, stimulating/dull, satisfying/frustrating, manageable/overwhelming, simple/complex, fast enough/too slow, and organized/disorganized.” Thus, the observed variables for the latent variable Anxiety and Uncertainty (AU) are difficult (Dift), confused (Cfus), and exhaustive (Ehtv), whereas those for Ease of Use (EU) are manageable (Mngb), satisfying (Stfy), stimulating (Stml), simple (Smpl), and focused (Focs).


                           Table 1
                            lists the observed variables and measured question statements for each latent variable.

Researchers have presented different models of children’s information needs in a general form (Shenton & Dixon, 2005; Walter, 1994). Based on an information-need study of the online behaviors of 641 Taiwanese primary school students in grades 5 and 6, Lu (2010) noted that the children studied typically sought information as a diversion (40.8%), solve problems (30.8%), and escape daily pressures (20%). However, Betül Yilmaz and Orhan (2010) examined the motivations for Internet usage by high school students and found that superficial learners use the Internet more than deep learners but do so for non-educational aims. Scarpi (2012) noted that information-searching customers may act on momentary urges, be driven by fun and curiosity, or be goal-oriented, task-focused utilitarians. Thus, whereas this is an explanatory framework for children exhibiting different information-seeking behaviors (for example, learning and playing), children experiencing the emotional aspect of information need, such as for entertainment and problem solving, must be addressed to improve the information-seeking model of children. Thus we propose the following hypothesis:
                              H1
                              The Entertainment information need serves as a stronger preference motivator for children to start using/searching in VW retrieval interface of DL than does the Problem-Solving information need.

Many researchers have studied the skills required when children seek information on the Internet (Dresang, 1999; Enochsson, 2005; Hultgren & Limberg, 2003; Large, Beheshti, & Breuleux, 1998). Hutchinson et al. (2005) identified the limitations of the information-seeking skills of young children, noting that they occasionally could not spell, type, read, navigate, compose queries, and/or select small objects.

The fact that children aged 6–7years old like to read picture books, whereas children aged 11–12years old like to read books where text alone tells the story demonstrates that child reading ability changes with growth. As the literacy skills of children typically improve gradually up to adolescence, children of varying ages adopt different strategies for information retrieval.


                           Paivio (2006) discussed dual-coding theory, which relates that visual and verbal information are processed differently and along distinct channels in the human mind. As the concepts from human perception theory were introduced in information retrieval works related to the visualization system user research (Koshman, 2006; Morse, Lewis, & Olsen, 2002; Yu, 2012), the iconic representations and layout on visual displays thus become critical to users to interpret and choose correct icons (information database) in different visual and textual forms to fulfill their information needs. Sadler-Smith (2011) stated that the correlation between the intuitive style and the visual style was statistically significant to learning and education from a dual-processing perspective. Hourcade (2007, p. 294) children in this stage are improving their visual capabilities and lack literacy skills; therefore, they prefer to conduct visual-based searches. Based on this evidence/literature, our H2 states:
                              H2
                              Children use a VW retrieval interface with icons more intuitively than a VW retrieval interface with text and sound symbols.

Previous research revealed differences in IS behavior between users of text-sound interfaces and those using graphical icons. Morse et al. (2002) tested visual information retrieval methodologies by comparing textual, icon, graphical, and “spring” displays and found that user performance with the textual interface was superior to the other interfaces (p. 35); however, the graphical methods (icon, graphs, “spring”) were preferred by adult when the complexity of the task increased. While children have limited literacy skills, we can assume that children prefer visual interface to avoid difficulties in unknown text and searching related information. Thus, H3 was formulated.
                              H3
                              Children who use a VW retrieval interface with text-sound face more difficulty than those who use a VW retrieval interface with graphic icon.


                           Martens (2012) addressed the development of interfaces for digital resources for children, ranging from icons to metadata and hierarchical approaches. The contexts of individual children, such as wildly differing affective states, and meaningful metadata for one child may be incomprehensible to another. Bilal (2001), Bilal (2002b) suggested that emotions can profoundly influence the overall effectiveness with which children use a Web search engine on research tasks (learning) and on fully self-generated search tasks (playing). Researchers have characterized student mental models of Web searches (Zhang, 2008) and developed affective systems able to recognize and appropriately respond to human emotions (Lopatovska & Arapakis, 2011), which ultimately improve the interface and make HCI experiences increasingly effective and pleasurable.


                           Barendregt, Bekker, Bouwhuis, and Baauw (2006) conducted an experiment in which children encountered different types of problems during their first use and after they have practiced with a game. Usability problems caused by a lack of knowledge (anxiousness and uncertainty) were more often identified during first use (not ease of use). Fun problems related to a too-high challenge level (anxiousness and uncertainty) may disappear after some practice (ease of use). Thus, the anxiousness and uncertainty factor is negatively correlated with the ease of use factor, as it relates to child affective states. Based on these studies, we presented the relationships among anxiousness, uncertainty and ease of use through the formulation of the following hypothesis:
                              H4
                              Anxiousness and Uncertainty are negatively correlated with the Ease of Use as it relates to child affective states.

While investigating the subjective variables involved in an information search process, Gwizdka and Lopatovska (2009) determined that a good mood before and during a search correlates with a subsequent good mood but also with poor search outcomes and reduced satisfaction. Thus, feeling some ‘pain’ during a search helps ensure ‘gain’ in the form of quality outcomes. We suggest that children seek information to solve their problem (studying) and wish to reduce the uncertainty that impedes their search for information. While seeking information for the sake of entertainment enhances ones’ ability to endure uncertainty. Thus we propose the following hypothesis:
                              H5
                              Children engaged in problem-solving searches experience less uncertainty and anxiety than those engaged in searches purely as a diversion.


                           Blom and Monk (2003) suggested that users personalize their computers for emotional reasons, including sense of control, ownership, fun, and simple boredom. Yannakakisa and Hallam (2008) explored the Playware game and a control task and indicated two different classes of children: those that prefer constant energetic play with low mental/emotional load and those that report deriving fun from dynamic play that involves high mental/emotional load independent of physical effort. Thus, when seeking information as a diversion, the children hope for significant ease of use (less physical effort) over their affective state. In addition, when seeking information to solve a problem, the children can experience a sense of diminished control. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis:
                              H6
                              Children value ease of use more highly when engaged in a search purely as a diversion, compared to when they are seeking to solve a problem.

Affective technology, affective computing, and emotional design are growing fields in computer science, human–computer interaction, and cognitive science. This study focused on building a model to explore children’s cognition of uncertainty and sense of control while searching for information using a VW retrieval interface. Thus, a well-designed VW retrieval interface may act as a toy or a tool.

A group of 227 many children aged 7–10 were selected for this study. The sample selection was in accordance with the methods outlined by Piaget (1995), who explained that children demonstrate behavior and reactions corresponding to their stage of growth stages. Children in the concrete operation stage (7–11-year olds) may understand hierarchies and reverse actions which enable them to use a greater variety of technologies and software than children in the pre-operational stage. Cooper (2002) found that young children prefer visual information to textual information. Children in the range of 7–11years quickly improve their visual capabilities and employ various search strategies. Nonetheless, their IS behaviors in a VW interface have not previously been investigated.

These 227 primary school students (7–11-year olds) in 9 classes, 117 boys and 110 girls, who were under teacher supervision, were divided at random into three groups for operating different VW retrieval interfaces, and the VW retrieval interfaces were set in three types, one type with text-sound (non-graphic) icons, one type with graphic (non-text-sound) icons, and one type with text-sound-graphic icons. Table 2
                         lists the grade and group of the participating children.

The National Library of Public Information (NLPI) also established a Chinese digital library for children in Taiwan. The text-listed interface for this digital library for children has been transformed into a visual interface, as shown in Fig. 3
                        , providing a virtual world that contains different icons associated with different databases.

The VW retrieval interface is designed according to the way-finding concept and map-structure hierarchy. When children search information in the main frame designed, they move the courser (the little red spaceman) right or left in the map to choose the icon which represents a different category and then click to enter next frame. Child may surf through different icons that represent sub-frames and linked databases. When they reach the final target, a small frame of the chosen database will expand pout to describe the database content in detail.


                        Thatcher (2008) found that different types of tasks (research-defined and real-life searching) influence users in their choice of search strategy. Borlund and Dreier (2014) empirically tested the characteristics of three type of information need by Ingwersen: verificative information need (well-defined and stable), conscious topical information need (well-defined and more variable nature), and muddled topical information need (poorly defined and high cognitive uncertainty). The IS behavior of an attentive reader may shift from querying-filtering to navigation-dynamic interaction and browsing-trial-&-error behavior, according to the nature of the tasks they are performing and the information they seek. Bilal (2000) also stated that children performed better in fact-based searches than in research assignments. Crow (2011) claimed that children employ search strategies according to the nature of the information they require.

Children in the pre-operational stage (2–7year olds) tend to concentrate on only one characteristic of an object at a time, while 7–11year olds expand their IS behavior to encompass many of the aspects of their everyday lives. Thus, we set two IS tasks: (1) find the Taiwan Historical Dictionary and (2) find the Green Sour Bear Picture Books database.

Fact-based assignments, such as searching for the meaning of a word in a dictionary, provide a focus for the child. Broader research assignments, such as general purpose browsing tasks, involve additional cognitive tasks (Cooper, 2002). Thus, this study had the students perform each type of task in order to elicit different searching strategies and affective states when using the VW retrieval interfaces.

The questionnaire draft was developed according to the theoretical constructs. Two university experts in Childhood Education and Human–Computer Interaction reviewed the interface, tasks, and the questionnaire draft. We also ran a pilot test, asking the participants to read the task assignment and the questionnaire draft to ensure both were easy to understand.

The search exercises and questionnaires were administered in the reading room of a school library, which allowed the children to fill out the questionnaires by themselves. Before children began searching, the required tasks were printed on paper for children to read, and a research assistant explained the process to the children individually. Each student had 90s for each task, with 10s in between to reset the work station.

Following the examination, each student was given ten minutes to complete the questionnaire (as shown on Table 1), and an assistant was available to answer any questions. The questionnaire results were analyzed using SEM to reveal the experiences the children had when using the interface.

@&#RESULTS@&#

To assess the relationships among variables, such as uncertainty and fun, statistical analysis was applied. MacFarlane, Sim, and Horton (2005) suggested using experimental methods to measure the fun and usability of educational software for children. Markopoulos and Bekker (2003) discussed methods for evaluating interactive products for children. Lane, Anderson, Ponce, and Natesan (2012) applied confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to measure library service quality over time. Moreover, Derbaix and Pecheux (1999) applied CFA to measure the mood construct for children aged 8–12years old. Thus, this study applies LISREL 8.72 – Structural Equation Modeling, which combines factor analysis and statistical path analysis, to elucidate the relationships between observed and latent variables (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1996). The factor analysis method combines several factors into a single meaningful factor by determining the commonality in several datasets, and path analysis elucidates the relationships among several factors. Most abstract cognition factors considered here are hypothetical constructs and so are difficult to measure directly. Applying SEM involves using questionnaire data to measure the effect of an observed variable, such as the experiences of children in using an interface. A latent variable can be evaluated by combining the effects of multiple observed variables. Moreover, the relationship between two latent variables is determined by combining the effects of their corresponding observed variables. Several latent variables and the paths that link them form an SEM model. The weightings of routes indicate the strength of the causal relationships (Mulaik & James, 1995).

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted using the principal components model with the oblique rotation technique (Direct Oblimin). All indices were adequate according to standards of sampling adequacy (KMO MSA 0.900, Bartlett’s test of sphericity 2376.4, p
                        <0.001). The resulting 6 factors explained 64.91% of the variance in the data. Unidimensionality of the measures was confirmed by the fact that most of the items contributed to the loading of their underlying factors (>0.70; see Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010). This provided preliminary evidence for convergent validity and discriminant validity.

Individual observed variables were assessed by examining the loadings on the latent constructs. The standardized factor loading of latent constructs was 0.49–0.82. The t-value of the factor loading reached 0.001, which is significant. These statistics show that the convergent validity and the identification of measurement model are accepted (Kellowway, 1998, p. 107). The results are listed in Table 3
                           .

The squared multiple correlation (SMC) indicates the amount of variance in the scale items explained by the common factors. Higher squared multiple correlations reflect measurement variables of greater reliability, compared to the corresponding latent constructs. The SMCs for the scale items are summarized in Table 3. Overall the adequacy of the measurement model was supported. For example, variable Aten explains 63% of the variation in the latent construct – Entertainment Information Need (EN). Ehtv explains 59% of the variation in the latent construct – Anxiousness and Uncertainty affective state (AU).

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to estimate the structural model (LISREL 8.72). Apart from the chi-square statistic (χ
                        2
                        =288.06, p
                        <0.001), all fit indices indicated a good fit with the data (GFI: 0.89; NFI: 0.95; TLI: 0.97; CFI: 0.98; IFI: 0.98; SRMR: 0.050, RMSEA: 0.054). We estimated the path coefficients (β) and R-squared value of the structural model. Table 4
                         shows the overall results.

Overall, the research model had acceptable predictive power for endogenous constructs exceeding the required value of 0.1 for R-squared statistic measure (TS: 0.91; GI; 0.80; AU: 0.16; EU: 0.98). Chin (1998) claimed that values of approximately 0.67 are above-average, those around 0.33 are average, and those of 0.19 and lower are weak. Thus, the amount of explained variance is high. The results in Table 4 indicate that, except for GI→AU (−0.16, t
                        =−0.58), all other hypothesized path effects are confirmed and their respective t-values are statistically significant at the 0.05 level.

Path weights can be analyzed to determine the influences among latent variables (Fig. 5
                         and Table 4).

Comparing the path-weights between Information Need and Interface Media reveals that the IS behavior values of children with Entertainment Information Need (γ

                        =.29∗∗) for both the text-sound icons and the graphic icons in the VW retrieval interface. Thus, H1 is accepted.

Comparing the path-weights between Interface Media and Affective State reveals that the retrieval interface with text-sound (β
                        31
                        =.57∗, β
                        41
                        =.63∗∗) influenced the affective state more significantly did the retrieval interface with graphic icon (β
                        32
                        =−.16n.s., β
                        42
                        =.44∗). While the VW retrieval interface with text-sound positively influences (β
                        31
                        =.57∗) Anxiety and Uncertainty, the relationship between the VW retrieval interface with graphic icons and Anxiety and Uncertainty (β
                        32
                        =−.16n.s.). The β value is negative and its t-value is not significant; therefore, we cannot verify the relationship between the two factors. Thus, H2 is rejected.

Although the VW retrieval interface with text-sound influences (β
                        41
                        =.63∗∗) Ease of Use, so too does the VW retrieval interface with graphic icon (β
                        42
                        =.44∗). Thus, H3 is rejected.

The latent variable Anxiety and Uncertainty negatively influences (β
                        43
                        =−.16∗) Ease of Use. Thus, for the children, the factors related to uncertainty negatively correlated with those related to ease of use and usability, and this indicating the increase in uncertainty leads to diminished sense of ease of use. Thus, H4 is accepted.

The total weight of the paths between the latent variable Entertainment Information Need to Anxiety and Uncertainty (.29∗∗∗) exceeds that of the paths between Problem-Solving Information Need to Anxiety and Uncertainty (.14∗). Thus, H5 is accepted.

The total weight of the paths between the latent variable Entertainment Information Need and Ease of Use (.73∗∗∗) exceeds that between Problem-Solving Information Need and Ease of Use (.34∗∗∗). Thus, H6 is accepted.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

H1 is accepted. This result strengthens the findings of Lu (2010) that children prefer to seek information as a diversion (40.8%) and solve problems (30.8%), although children mainly treated the VW retrieval interface as a toy and sought fun. When seeking information via different VW retrieval interfaces, children slightly preferred the VW retrieval interface with text-sound to the VW retrieval interface with graphic icon. However, the VW retrieval interface with graphic icon still benefits children who do not recognize many characters when they are seeking information.

H2 is rejected. Thus, the text-sound retrieval interface lead to high risk of both pain-anxiety under uncertainty and gain-ease of use, as partially explained by Gwizdka and Lopatovska (2009). The children used the VW retrieval interface with text-sound with hesitation, as partially explained by Sadler-Smith (2011).

H3 is rejected. The children considered the VW retrieval interface with text-sound easier to manipulate. Because all Grade 1 students in Taiwanese primary schools learn the phonetic Chinese alphabet, which helps them to correctly pronounce Chinese characters they do not recognize, these children can use a phonetic alphabet to guess the meaning of a subject-icon in the retrieval interface with text-sound in a simple task to achieve a good performance. Given that the text interface is accurate, and it is easy to determine the meaning of a textual icon, children thought the text interface was easier to use.

H4 is accepted. Children’s uncertainty feelings would influence their ease of using a digital library system in a negative way. The uncertainty of the children undermined their self-confidence and thus their experience with regard to ease of use.

H5 is accepted. When the children sought information to solve their problem (studying), they wished to reduce uncertainty, which impeded their search for information. When seeking information as a diversion (playing), they could endure slightly more uncertainty.

H6 is accepted. When seeking information to change their mood, the children hope for significant control over their affective state. In addition, when seeking information to solve a problem, the children can experience a sense of diminished control.

Thus, children with different Information Needs underlying their information-seeking behaviors have different tolerances for the un-controlled state that they can endure. Sim et al. (2006) explained that learning was not correlated with fun or usability, but fun and usability were correlated with each other. However, when seeking entertainment information (i.e., fun), the participating children emphasized Ease of Use (i.e., usability), but when seeking problem-solving information (i.e., learning), the children did not emphasize Ease of Use (usability) quite as heavily.

Furthermore, Tenopir et al. (2008) indicated that positive feelings are frequently mixed with thoughts regarding results and effective navigation. In addition, negative feelings are often mixed with thoughts related to the system, search strategy, task at hand, limited collections of the digital database, and uncertainty regarding searching the system. While Verhagen et al. (2012) address four VW-specific characteristics and established the qualitative frame for a model of affective searching, the current path analysis clearly quantitatively identified the mixed thinking of children about how the information needs related to fun and effective navigation are related and how the information needs related to learning and the feasibility of reducing uncertainty in an IR system search are related.

In the design of digital resources for children, it is important to create software that is fun to use. Sim et al. (2006) claimed that an interface that is fun to use is also easier to use; however, this does not necessarily promote learning. Ozcelok et al. (2013) claimed that, among college students, uncertainty in a game-like learning tool can stimulate learning. Chowdhury et al. (2011) described how uncertainty in IS behavior in an academic environment can have a positive impact whereas the effects of difficulty in using a search interface are always negative. Positive uncertainty can arouse feelings of curiosity and a sense of fun in children, which motivates them to explore and learn. This study examined the relationships among fun, learning, uncertainty, and interface usability to provide a reference for the development of software capable of stimulating learning. We examined the causality between learning and enjoyment in order to better understand the IS behavior of children having fun as well as the media channels and VW search interfaces that they prefer, and whether the feelings of uncertainty and sense of control generated by these activities vary according to their learning and searching behavior.

In the eyes of children, search interfaces can be toys as well as tools. The principles of information visualization can be used to design digital library interfaces as a virtual space, which is more fun to use. A game-like interface differs considerably from conventional text-based interfaces. Our results show that when children have information needs induced by emotions (rather than information needs for solving problems), children prefer using this kind of virtual search interface.

Clearly, children select an interface that satisfies their information needs. Designing an interface that is both easy and enjoyable to use reduces cognitive load and makes the entire process more enjoyable. If children have different information needs, then different affordances are required to assist in their IS behavior. We should focus on the important factors influencing the search behavior of children as well as their sense of uncertainty, control, flow (Van Schaik & Ling, 2012), and aesthetics (Sánchez-Franco, Peral-Peral, & Villarejo-Ramos, 2014).

Digital libraries accommodate a variety of media and use different types of media channels and interfaces for searching. The personal traits of users determine their capabilities and requirements with regard to interface usage. VW interfaces integrate information visualization principles with icons and mental maps to incorporate human perceptions of space, assist in information searches, and merge multiple information channels. These measures can increase the effectiveness of searches; however, they also promote uncertainty.

This study focused on children in the concrete development stage. At this point in their development, their motor skills and perceptions of text and icon (information accessibility) and thematic categories (information diagnosticity) are different from those of adults. We sought to reveal the uncertainty and sense of control experienced by children searching for information using either text or graphic icons.


                           Bilal and Kirby (2002) observed that the IS behavior of children displays loops with an emphasis on concrete and intuitive manipulation. Although children are better able to understand abstract concepts in the concrete development stage than can children in pre-concrete development stage, they cannot fully recognize abstract thinking as metadata, hierarchies, or hyperlinks to help them in their search for information. Thus uncertainty and interface usability play an important role in their searching. This could be used to measure how helpful the information search interface is for the users.

According to dual-coding theory, the preferences of children with regard to graphical and textual interfaces may reflect their preferences in information accessibility and information diagnosticity.

A graphical interface is concrete. The influence of the VW interface with graphic icon on anxiety and uncertainty (GI→AU=−.16n.s.) was negative and did not reach significance. We speculate that although children can easily and intuitively understand the meaning of graphic icons, they still feel a degree of uncertainty and confusion regarding the deeper connotations represented by the icons.

Textual media are form of an abstract meaning and not concrete and children in concrete stage make learning text more difficult. If a child cannot read, he/she will not be able to understand the text, will have difficulty in using it, and will feel a great deal of uncertainty. As Morse et al. (2002, p. 35) observed, adults do not necessarily prefer textual interfaces but they believe that these devices are more effective in locating information according to the specifics of the search criteria. If children can accurately grasp the meaning of text, they will experience a high degree of information diagnosticity, which will make them feel that the interface is easy to use. According to dual-coding theory with multiple channels, each channel assumes a different function. When various channels (i.e. text, phonetic alphabet and voice) are used together to assist in searching, children demand a balance between accurate textual channels and accessible graphical channels to reduce their cognitive load. As for environmental context and surfer recognition, further research is required regarding the concept of space, the means of merging textual and graphical channels, the information and cognitive loads that they place on children, and the accessibility and diagnosticity of information provided by the media channels.

This study investigated the influence of information need on the affective states of users via various information channels. As a media channel, VW interfaces are suitable when the information that the user is searching for is concrete and constantly changing. Users experience various forms of uncertainty according to the way that the new knowledge affects or alters their existing knowledge maps.

From the results of this study, we infer the following: When children play or when they do not have well-defined learning objectives, their IS behavior is closely connected to their desire to have fun. Under these circumstances, the primary type of IS behavior that they display is self-generated or based on muddle information needs (MIN) (Borlund & Dreier, 2014, p. 495–496). They also have high tolerance for uncertainty and demand interfaces that are easy to use. In learning, the opposite is true. Learning tasks are specific; therefore, the information that they search for is fact-oriented, or VIN and CIN (Borlund & Dreier, 2014, p. 495–496). Children often show orientations towards work procedures and attach less importance to ease of use. Instead, they want information to be useful and informative. In addition, the demand for accuracy gives them a lower tolerance for uncertainty.


                           Betül Yilmaz and Orhan (2010) investigated the motives of senior high school students in using the internet. They found that superficial learners use the internet more than deep learners but do so for non-educational aims. This indicates that the information needs of adults while at play are numerous but superficial. The theory of message framing indicates that humans use greater effort to process information that they care about (central pathways-diagnostics) than they do for information they do not care about (peripheral pathways-accessibility). It is possible that children do the same. Without concrete tasks (during play), they focus more on information accessibility with regard to MIN, exhibit greater tolerance for uncertainty, demand greater usability, and require greater information accessibility.

While learning, children focus primarily on searching for facts and more fundamental CIN information associated with their studies. Under these circumstances, children focus more on problem solving, demand high information diagnosticity, and thus have lower tolerance for uncertainty and less demand for usability.

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

This study investigated the correlation between fun and uncertainty among children seeking information via a virtual reality interface. This study only considers one aspect of complex IS behaviors and therefore has several limitations that should be addressed in future research. Based on the theoretical deductions above, this study presents the following research issues:
                           
                              1.
                              The relationships among the latent variables set in the research model involve the influence of information needs on uncertainty via VW interfaces. Information needs exert an indirect effect on uncertainty, and thus, the affected uncertainty includes that influenced by information needs and that influenced by the VW interface. The proportions of these two types of uncertainty cannot be determined. We suggest that future researchers develop a model to measure the direct influence of information needs on uncertainty and compare the results with those of this study.

The influence of interactions between fun and uncertainty on IS behavior is an extremely complex issue. In this study, we incorporated fun as a latent variable of information needs and examined the resulting uncertainty and usability. However, we were unable to verify the reverse feedback influence of uncertainty stimulating learning motives (or information needs) (Ozcelok et al., 2013) due to the limitations of the non-recursive SEM in this study. This will require future studies for verification and comparison.

This study showed that all of the participants enjoyed using the Chinese visualized interface; however larger samples are required in order to provide a valuable reference for the development of a game-format interface for the retrieval of information in which children have an interest. Regarding reading tasks used to stimulate self-generating information needs or MIN, this study employed experiments in which children were asked to perform artificial search tasks. Therefore the children did not seek information for personal needs/interests and the possible effects of this need to be taken into consideration. Further research task design for children preform self-generated searching in a VW retrieval interface is need.


                        Martens (2012, p. 167) suggested examining the context in which children operate, including their physical locations and affective states, to develop interfaces for digital resources. The contexts in which children operate, including language, cultural limitations in the use of different languages, visual and spatial cognition abilities, and their integrated abilities to search information nodes in a VW retrieval interface thus merit further examination.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This study on IS was performed within a Taiwanese system using Taiwanese participants. The customized VW retrieval interface of the NLPI digital library helped children to overcome obstacles to their information-seeking behavior. The provision of a “fun” interface could change the way children view the VW information-seeking, causing them to see it not merely as a tiring tool but also as a toy for learning and play capable of helping them to enjoy the search for information. This important topic could help in the development of a VW retrieval interface suitable for children to use when searching for information.

Statistical confirmatory analysis was applied to clarify the relationships among the latent variables (Information Need, Interface Media, and Affective State).
                        
                           (1)
                           Children prefer using VW retrieval interfaces in the search for information as a form of entertainment, rather than when solving problems.

In this study, the text–sound interface proved easier to use but increased the sense of uncertainty when used by children.

Children searching for information as a form of entertainment were more willing to endure uncertainty and demanded more control than those searching for information with the aim of solving a problem.

The children VW information-seeking model presents an alternative route that offers a new method of rechecking the information-seeking model and allows the researcher an opportunity to explore fun roles through which children can play with and learn from software. Furthermore, the relationships between the interface usability and bounded system and children affected modes in information studies may be explored by careful examination. This is the first study to identify the characteristics of an enjoyable, effective interface designed specifically to meet the needs of children searching for information.
