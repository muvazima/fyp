                  We extend Q-UEL, our universal exchange language for interoperability and inference in healthcare and biomedicine, to the more traditional fields of public health surveys. These are the type associated with screening, epidemiological and cross-sectional studies, and cohort studies in some cases similar to clinical trials. There is the challenge that there is some degree of split between frequentist notions of probability as (a) classical measures based only on the idea of counting and proportion and on classical biostatistics as used in the above conservative disciplines, and (b) more subjectivist notions of uncertainty, belief, reliability, or confidence often used in automated inference and decision support systems. Samples in the above kind of public health survey are typically small compared with our earlier “Big Data” mining efforts. An issue addressed here is how much impact on decisions should sparse data have. We describe a new Q-UEL compatible toolkit including a data analytics application DiracMiner that also delivers more standard biostatistical results, DiracBuilder that uses its output to build Hyperbolic Dirac Nets (HDN) for decision support, and HDNcoherer that ensures that probabilities are mutually consistent. Use is exemplified by participating in a real word health-screening project, and also by deployment in a industrial platform called the BioIngine, a cognitive computing platform for health management.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

We previously proposed Q-UEL, a web-based universal exchange and inference language for healthcare and biomedicine [1,2]. Here is it extended to the more traditional domain of public health analysis including general population health sampling, healthcare quality surveys, and screenings. The techniques used can include or extend to cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, and other similar investigations including, to some extent, clinical trials. Q-UEL’s capabilities are already quite broad. Unhampered by any obligations due to existing clinical implementations (but see Section 1.12) and other legacy matters, and free of rigorous and laborious systems of voting for change that characterize the major medical standards efforts [2], we have been able to go back to a “green field”, exploring fundamental unifying principles and to build Q-UEL extremely rapidly. Q-UEL communication artifacts are XML-like tags that mostly represent probabilistic statements as captured clinical data and medical knowledge, derived by mining both structured data records and natural language text [1]. Different Q-UEL tags are concerned with both content and management of data representation including electronic health records and their interoperability and inter-conversion, security and disaggregation [2], knowledge extraction and representation, machine learning [1,3], and hypothesis generation, automated reasoning and decision support [3,4]. The Q-UEL system might reasonably be described as a multivariate architecture for cognitive computing in medicine. Its most basic inference systems are like the Bayes Net (BN) [5], except that Q-UEL’s counterparts are general graphs (Section 1.6). The most advanced resemble IBM’s Watson 
                        [6], except that Q-UEL intrinsically uses probabilistic semantics 
                        [1,4] and seeks to distribute the required computing power parallelized across a larger number of more standard processes on the Internet rather than on a limited number of very high performance machines, taking advantage of Cloud Computing, grid architecture and in-memory processing. This all seems far removed from traditional biostatistics, epidemiology, and evidence based medicine. But despite the stark contrast between the familiar and conservative nature of public health analysis and many modern efforts in medical inference (Section 1.13), interoperability will expose each one to the other, raising deeper issues such about how to treat sparse data, how to include well founded prior knowledge as if it were virtual data, how to reconcile many different notions about probabilities, and how best to do inference from them. To address these matters, a number of software applications with several novel algorithms were developed, using Q-UEL tags with features suited to public health analysis.

Q-UEL is based on the Dirac Notation and associated algebra [7]. The notation was introduced into later editions of Dirac’s book to facilitate understanding and use of quantum mechanics (QM) [8] and it has been a standard notation in physics and theoretical chemistry since the 1940s. QM is a system for representing observations and measurements, and drawing probabilistic inference from them. The Q in Q-UEL refers to QM, but a simple mathematical transformation of QM [9,10] gives classical everyday behavior. Q-UEL inherits the machinery of QM by replacing the more familiar imaginary number 
                           i
                         (such that 
                           ii
                        =−1), responsible for QM as wave mechanics, by the hyperbolic imaginary number h
                         (such that 
                           hh
                        =+1). It was rediscovered in various guises by Dirac. Hence our inference net in general is called the Hyperbolic Dirac Net (HDN) [3]. The “UEL” in Q relates to the “PCAST 2010” call for a Universal Exchange Language (UEL) for healthcare [11]. The usual qualification “web based” is because Dirac notation by coincidence looks a little like XML and has a bracket structure (it is also called the braket notation), and it also represents a semantic system that even maps to natural language [4]. It thus seemed to us the natural choice of XML extension required to render the Semantic Web (SW) [12–14] probabilistic [15], and for using it as input for Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) [16]. Q-UEL’s older information-theoretic origins lie in bioinformatics [18,19] and clinical “Big Data” data mining [20–22], thus ensuring Q-UEL’s applicability to those disciplines [3]. They bring to Q-UEL the use of “inference probabilities” based on expected information 
                        [18] now seen as based on the partially summated Riemann Zeta Function 
                        [20,21] that incorporate sparse data and prior subjective opinion into the inference process. It is of importance in this paper.

Q-UEL may seem exotic, but the whole field of ES, CDSS, and recently probabilistic reasoning on the web, has been characterized by a tradition of innovation and controversy [1] set by the pioneering MYCIN effort [17]. It seems inevitable that there will be a boundary of tension in healthcare information technology, between classical notions of probability and those seemingly better to suited to inference, if not resolved before full interoperability is achieved. The traditional small sample population studies addressed in this paper conveniently and quickly raise issues of sparse data and inference from it that relate to, and allow us to address, the above concern. Although Q-UEL has benefited so far by not being implemented in healthcare data management, the need to address the issue of sparse data in greater detail became pressing because Q-UEL has been deployed in the construction, management, and analysis of patient records in effectively “real time” in an ongoing cardiovascular risk screening and study of a Caribbean population (Section 1.12). The sample size is typical of the kind of studies mentioned in Section 1.1. However, sparse data is also always ultimately encountered in high dimensional (multifactor) data mining, because there are always many probabilities based on large combinations of factors that are seen very few times, if at all [20–22]. Consequently, studies will be performed to demonstrate scalability. Sparse data is important because a great deal of evidence that is individually weak can combine to overthrow a decision made without it. Neglect can be an accumulative error.

Though the work described in the present paper is most closely related to the basic BN concept, our general strategy of observe, evaluate, interpret, and decide used to build and evaluate a final net looks very like Watson’s advertized “cognitive principles” of observe, interpret, evaluate and decide. Our use of “evaluate” is different, meaning evaluate Q-UEL’s “inference probabilities”, but these do appropriately represent weights of evidence from data, sparse as well as ample, and subjective prior opinion. Watson’s evaluation involves running hundreds of language analysis algorithms simultaneously and selecting the one most probably giving the right answer [6]. At last inspection, its main use of probability resides there. From Watson as it competed on the TV quiz show “Jeopardy!” [1,6] one might expect similar qualitative answers in a medical setting, e.g. “pulmonary circulation disorder” as a most plausible fit to a long description as the question, based on association. Q-UEL has some such capabilities [1], but in the present paper, the questions are such as “Will my female patient age 50–59 taking diabetes medication and having a body mass index of 30–39 have very high cholesterol if the systolic BP is 130–139mmHg and HDL is 50–59mg/dL and non-HDL is 120–129mg/dL?”. This forms a preliminary inference net as the query, which may be refined and to which probabilities must be assigned. The real answers of interest here are not qualitative statements, but the final probabilities. The protocols involved map to what data miners often seem to see as two main options in mining, although we see them as the two ends of a continuum. Method (A) may be recognized as unsupervised (or unrestricted) data mining and post-filtering, and is the method mainly used here. In this approach we (1) mine data (“observe”), (2) compute a very large number of the more significant probabilities and render them as tags (“evaluate”), (3) use a proposed inference net as a query to search amongst the probabilities represented by those tags, but only looking for those relevant to complete the net and assign probabilities to it, assessing what is available, and seeing what can be substituted (“interpret”), and (4) compute the overall probability of the final inference net in order to make a decision (“decide”). Unsupervised data mining is preferred because it generates many tags for an SW-like approach, and may uncover new unexpected relationships [22] that could be included in the net. Method (B) uses supervised (or restricted) data mining and pre-filtering. Data mining considers only what appears in the net. The down-stream user interested in inference always accesses the raw database, while in (A) he or she may never see it. The advantage of (B) is that mining is far less computationally demanding both in terms of processing and memory. It is a persuasive option when using extensive patient records [22]. Indeed it is used with such larger data below. However, even there it is only applied in a limited way rather than as very specific questions, to avoid what is irrelevant at least for the purposes being demonstrated.

Common notions about probability or uncertainty used or potentially used by medical information technology developers can differ in many ways, as illustrated by most of the work cited above [1–10,15–28] supplemented by some key works and reviews [23–28]. Most of these share some detectable connection with the subjectivist approach of Bayes as it was first described in 1763 [29], if only because the usual interpretation of Bayes’ view is more tolerant of what the user means by probability compared with the frequentist approach of so-called “classical statistics” (CS) based solely on frequency of occurrences [30]. Shmueli [28] argues that the major division is not really about whether it is Bayesian, CS, or otherwise, but whether it is applied in an predictive or explanatory mode. In medicine, however, the main division appears to be simply between subjectivist and “classical” frequentist approaches. Recall that “classical” in “classical statistics” is a misnomer. It is a specific system of hypothesis testing, estimation and the design of experiments and sample surveys, well known to be largely due to Fisher in the first half of the twentieth century, but also influenced by Neyman [30]. However, “classical probability” in the present paper, and as the values represented on Q-UEL tags [1] will usually mean a simple idea of genuinely great antiquity, the notion of proportion or fraction, as in a census. That does not necessarily include the CS notion of probability as proportion that would be obtained as a sample becomes infinitely or indefinitely large [30], but most people would accept that if we have a reasonably large sample from a much larger population, then the above kind of probability statement, “probability of being male”, is applicable to the larger population. Nonetheless, this is a jump from a description to a prediction, and raises issues that we think of as involved in inference.

Each probability of any kind can also be manipulated for inference in a variety of ways, according to philosophy (which is a matter of concern [1]). The BN [5] is probably the most popular method, perhaps because it does seem to be based on traditional, conservative, principles of probability. However, the BN is traditionally (and, strictly speaking, by definition) confined to a probability network that is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In general, reversibility, cyclic paths and feedback abound in the real world, and we need probabilistic knowledge networks that are general graphs, or even more diffuse fields of influence, not DAGs. In our response as the Hyperbolic Dirac Net (HDN) [3], “Dirac” relates to use of Paul A.M. Dirac’s view of quantum mechanics (QM) [7,8]. QM is not only a standard system for representing probabilistic observation and inference from it in physics, but also it manages and even promotes concepts like reversibility and cycles. The significance of “hyperbolic” is that it relates to a particular type of imaginary number rediscovered by Dirac. Dirac notation entities, Q-UEL tags, and the analogous building blocks of an HDN all have complex probabilities better described as probability amplitudes. This means that they have the form x+jy where x and y are real numbers and j is an imaginary number, though they can also be vectors or matrices with such forms as elements. Q-UEL is seen as a Lorentz rotation i
                        →
                           h
                         of QM as wave mechanics [9,10]. Recall that the imaginary number involved is now no longer the familiar 
                           i
                         such that 
                           ii
                        =−1, but the hyperbolic imaginary number, called 
                           h
                         in Q-UEL, such that 
                           hh
                        =+1. This renders the HDN to behave classically [9,10]. A basic HDN is an 
                           h
                        -complex BN. Both BN and basic HDN may use predictive odds (PO) in which conditional probabilities (or the HDN’s comparable 
                           h
                        -complex notions) are replaced by ratios of these.

An 
                           h
                        -complex probability amplitude does not limit the user to a particular kind of probability. It can equivalently be expressed and manipulated as a probability dual, say {P
                        1, P
                        2} of two more familiar real-valued probabilities P
                        1 and P
                        2. Here {P
                        1, P
                        2}=
                           
                              
                                 1
                                 2
                              
                           
                        [P
                        1+P
                        2]+
                           
                              
                                 1
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                        
                           h
                        [P
                        1−P
                        2]. Classical behavior and simple use are indicated by the addition and logical exclusive OR case {P
                        1, P
                        2}+{P
                        3, P
                        4}={P
                        1+P
                        3, P
                        2+P
                        4} and multiplication and logical independent AND case {P
                        1, P
                        2} {P
                        3, P
                        4}={P
                        1
                        P
                        3, P
                        2
                        P
                        4}, (not true in the 
                           i
                        -complex case [9,10]). Any probabilities will do in a dual {P
                        1, P
                        2}, providing that they satisfy certain basic requirements about their relationship. To be useful together, P
                        1 and P
                        2 should be symbolically adjoint (see Section 2.1). Bayes’ Rule [29], is, ironically, not apparent in a BN, but up front in an HDN. It is an example of a general condition {P
                        1, P
                        2} {P
                        3, P
                        4}={P
                        5, P
                        5}=P
                        5, if P
                        1
                        P
                        3=P
                        2
                        P
                        4=P
                        5, requiring the dual to see it directly.

By “treatment of sparse data” we mean the treatment of data in general, but in a way that is still appropriate for inference when data is sparse. Any method taking sparse data into account is likely to run into the same problem, including classical probabilities themselves in an inference context. Traditionally the concept of maximum likelihood, is often used, so that 2 out of just 3 observations still means a most likely probability of 2/3, but it is not always in accord with averages over many such cases or our expectation in the mathematical sense, and recall that the most probable value is not necessarily the average or expected value. CS does not even trouble itself about that choice. It traditionally defers a prediction or decision if data is sparse, not always a viable option in a clinical setting. It means that the probability P jumps to 1 to satisfy information I=−ln(P) as zero. Q-UEL does not object to this P=1 idea, but its preferred approach gives no such sudden jump, being based on a theory of expected information 
                        [18,19] using incompletely summated Riemann zeta functions ζ 
                        [20,21] that compute expected information in sparse data [18] and give a smooth transition to zero information when as data decreases. Q-UEL’s theory of probabilistic semantics follows Popper [23], who argued that most statements are at best weak assertions to be tested, and that probability 1 is the initial probability that we seek to reduce by seeking for refuting evidence. Probability 0 implies infinite information and is to be avoided, and low values create difficulties in using Bayes’ Rule [3]. The original theory [18] also allows that as data becomes sparse, the exponentials of zeta functions approach probability-like quantities implied by prior knowledge, and approach in a continuous way, but they approach 1 if there is also no prior knowledge. 1 is the default values for probabilities in Q-UEL tags reflecting irrelevance, ignorance, or a statement so obviously absurd that it tells nothing [4]. These are all good reasons for “approaching 1” rather than say 0.5 or 0, but it can affect overall the consistency between probabilities described as coherence 
                        [3]. How it sometimes does or does not matter can be explained as follows.

The above coherence problem needs to be tempered, however, by context. We previously took a harsh view of BN users in that coherence as Bayes’ Rule and marginal summation was often neglected [3], but in regard to the importance of marginal summation we were not talking about odds, an ancient idea with a long history in inference as prediction. They are today seen as probability ratios. Odds are less sensitive to consistency demands and emphasize the relative, not absolute magnitude of probabilities involved. That is especially so for predictive odds (PO). Q-UEL’s preferred “inference probabilities” are rooted in PO, along with the origin of the zeta function approach, in the early studies [18] that led the first of the widely used GOR methods [19] in bioinformatics. In several respects these were the predecessor of the BN [3], and so it needs to be understood why the BN does not (or perhaps should not), like PO. Here is the traditional example of a PO, with important further equivalences.

The last line shows the extent to which we must still be vigilant of Bayes’ Rule [3]. The importance of marginal summation, however, weakens to being at most indirect. In contrast to other possible odds (likelihood ratios) it is completely independent of P(smoking), except indirectly by this simple example of marginal summation [3]:

Difficulties in satisfying marginal summation will clearly arise if the zeta approach sets probabilities close to 1: in absence of any data or prior knowledge, the above example would give 1+1=P(smoking)=2, clearly requiring renormalization, except when, as above, we are solely interested in the PO where P(smoking) has no impact. The early bioinformatics methods [18,19] relied on that idea, and similarly BNs and HDNs can also easily and safely be replaced by analogous PO networks (the dual would be {PO1, PO2}), with the following caveat. There will usually be cancellation to multiplier 1 by division of many corresponding and indeed identical terms, identical because they do not mention what is being predicted (lung cancer in the above case), another reason why Q-UEL uses probability default 1. It is correct because they are irrelevant, the canceling terms do not contribute to the fuller balance of evidence about, in this case, lung cancer. Showing and calculating the two original larger BNs or HDNs separately, prior to cancelation, gives important insight into medically relevant aspects, but since the cancellations can greatly simplify matters, one may still ask why we do not see PO used there more often. The reason why most BNs do not use POs is that they would often not just get smaller but embarrassingly vanish to a single PO term like the lung cancer example above, as if the original net, as literally a net, was a “waste of time”. HDNs have the same issue, except that Q-UEL emphasizes the use of multifactor data mining and favors tags with many factors that represent small HDNs in themselves, as discussed in this report. They do not have independency assumptions that cause the above cancellations. The real reason for marginal summation is that there are many occasions when we do want to consider absolute values, e.g. to study distributions, or show that assigned values make sense with medical knowledge while still able to satisfy coherence [3]. Hence we need to describe how to enforce marginal summation when one has a set of inconsistent probability assignments of any kind.

To assist in public health studies, we describe the use of a Q-UEL tag and application package composed primarily of (a) a new data mining and analytics application, DiracMiner and related health record management tools, (b) a suite of new HDN constructions tools such as DiracBuilder that can draw inference from data obtained, by querying for and combining tags, and (c) HDNcoherer that enforces marginal summation when and where needed. Until recently they have represented a research toolkit but they have recently been integrated into a BioIngine environment being developed to interact with standard medical record systems [2]. DiracMiner faces the biggest challenge, a combinatorial explosion and consequent computational processing and memory burden familiar to data miners, irrespective of the number of records examined (unless an extremely small number). This applies to tags called K-method tags that represent associations between say N demographic and clinical factors. The burden can go at least as 2
                           N
                        −1, which even alone can be astronomical (2100≈1030 ). On top of that there is the need to consider the number of possible distinct data values allowed for each clinical or demographic factor, and computation can go as n
                        
                           N
                         with n⪢2. At least about 1028 possible probabilities could be calculated even in the small cardiovascular study addressed here. DiracMiner differs from other mining use zeta functions [18–22], by “probability pruning on the fly” rather than by making a time consuming preliminary pass. This considers not only lack of data but what one would expect on a chance basis anyway. Tags can optionally be generated in much fewer numbers by specific queries representing “denominators”, e.g. focusing on diabetic female Asians over 40 (although the default is “do all”).

For standard practice when Q-UEL or any comparable system is used for reporting, classical probabilities will need to be stated alongside those we consider as more suitable for inference. Words such as “classical” or “strength” or “zeta” or “Pfzeta” and “Pbzeta” appear in certain special attributes on the tags called tag value attributes (see Section 1.1), to qualify what type of measure is being presented. For example we might see Pfwd≔(Pfzeta≔0.9212, classical≔0.8235≔14/17), which gives two options for the P
                        1 in {P
                        1, P
                        2}. A Pbwd attribute will similarly give two options for P
                        2. As part of an attribute of the new tags called K-method tags we for example strength (nats)≔4.5433… Nats are natural units (compare bits or binary units) reflecting that it relates to the natural log, or more precisely use of the z function introduced here, which relates to the natural logarithm. The strength is the departure from what one would get on a random basis, and may be negative. We will only see tags with strengths that lie within a pre-specified range of zero, say −1 to +1 nats, because those that are predicted to be less will be pruned out of the K-method tag generation process. Information measurement is an important aspect of the pruning algorithm.

Results presented here are preliminary and serve only to exemplify computational aspects. Medical findings will be presented elsewhere, but in brief there is medical interest in the following. Caymanians have enjoyed reasonable longevity compared with the US, which is probably due to a relatively healthy diet including an extensive marine diet, but there has over recent years been increased availability of “fast food”. The Cayman Heart Fund (CHF) [31] developed “Heart Fairs” for helping and sampling primarily born Caymanians and longer term residents (tourists are not prohibited but represent a negligible part of the sample). These fairs bring together volunteer patients, clinical laboratory equipment, and volunteer medical experts along with entertainments, games, snacks, free health aids, jogging accessories, and health related toys from various health companies, and public lectures, demonstrations and exhibits related to health and medicine. Interviews suggested that this attracts a diversity of volunteer subjects that helps reduces bias, though female Caymanians still dominate the sample at 73%. Patient information passed through formats on data sheets (to consent to data use, a participant had to proactively return the data sheet) and spreadsheets, and 2114 de-identified sheets were proactively returned to consent analysis. Patient data is also stored in a simple kind of Q-UEL “cardiovascular health sampling” record, which is a single XML-like tag. Section 4.2.1 shows an example that lists all the factors monitored and recorded.

There has been recent activity in the area of data representation [32–34], and in linking data mining to inference [35–38], all of which gave us some ideas. We need to mine to provide data that keeps up with latest perspectives in evidence based medicine [39], as well as clinical informatics [40] and biomedical research informatics [41] in general. The simple Framingham Heart Risk Score (FHRS) [42] exemplifies formulae that are simple predictive inference systems, and the FHRS is so widely recognized that special accommodation was made for it in the current setup. Full CDSS is probably the area with the most controversial recent history. In 1994 lack of success and acceptance were noted [43,44]. The rapid development from 1999 up to about 2002 has been well reviewed [45–49]. The 2006 Berlin–Sorani–Sim [50] classification and comparison of CDSS still holds true. Literature searches specifically for inference using

                         has gone under at least 20 names and guises, and hyperbolic can relate to many relevant things that are not 
                           h
                        -complex. We have ourselves used the common term split complex 
                        [10], A study described as using a bicomplex zeta function is of interest to us by including the 
                           h
                        -complex zeta function [51]. Probably closest to our efforts is that several groups continue to explore 
                           h
                        -complex neural networks (e.g. Refs. [52–56]), considered part of AI and increasingly popular in the environmental sciences [57]. One might think that workers would commonly appeal to QM, but it is only from around 2000 that Khrennikov highlighted an extensively hyperbolic complex QM [58–60], and he quickly noted the possible implications for mental function [61]. An objection that a purely or extensively 
                           h
                        -complex system of some kind of reasoning has little to do with real QM [62] would limit such efforts to simply “borrowing tools”, but that depends on the definition of scope of QM. Dirac himself felt that theoretical physics was applicable to all those branches of human thought where numbers are involved [63]. More recently 
                           h
                         has begun to make an appearance to be used in applications as diverse as on-line dating recommender systems [64], so it is possible that the field of automated 
                           h
                        -complex reasoning will look very different in the near future.

The new Q-UEL tags considered in the current study correspond algebraically to Dirac’s bra-operator-ket 
                        [7]. It maps to the SW’s semantic triple 
                        [13,14] that we can capture as a Q-UEL tag:

Each expression is most commonly a logical expression with potentially many arguments that are XML-like attributes such as male or ‘type 2 diabetic’ or glucose(mg/dL)≔100, or ‘systolic blood pressure (mmHg)≔140–149, with logical operators in front of and between them, usually and (the default) or, or not. The most basic format (other than recognized nominal categorical cases like “male” that can stand alone) is metadata≔value. An attribute in Q-UEL can use Q-UEL’s Attribute Metadata Language (AML), so that an attribute is often analogous to a noun or verb phrase, e.g.

Most often in theoretical discussion, as in probabilities P(A|B) or Dirac brakets 〈A|B〉, we use A, B, C, etc. to stand abstractly for attributes in the XML sense. In probability theory A, B, C, etc. represent things, states, events, observations, measurements, qualities etc. In this paper we mean medical factors, including demographic factors such as age and clinical factors such as systolic blood pressure value or history of diabetes. They can also stand for expressions containing many factors, so note that by e.g. P(A|B) we would usually mean that it also applies to, say, P(A, B | C, D, E). In text, P(A, B, C, ...) with ellipsis ‘…’ means all combinatorial possibilities, P(A), P(B), P(A, C), P(B, D, H) etc. The attributes are separated from each by operators, usually logical [1–4] and the default, if not shown, is and. As is common, the comma ‘,’ is used for and in theoretical discussion, though in tags it means that the order may be important. The conditional bar ‘|’ is seen as logical if. As in standard probability texts, we will depart from the A, B, C, etc. notation when it is far less suitable than an alternative, in a specific kind of discussion. It will be explained when needed. On the web, the dual probability value must be carried up front in special tag value attributes. Pfwd (probabilistic value forward) is usually the degree of truth of a tag as a statement when the tag is read as it is, like a simple subject–verb–object sentence Pbwd (probabilistic value backward) is the degree of truth for the statement when subject (bra) and object (ket) expressions are switched. Pfwd and Pbwd are placed in the bra part and in the ket part respectively. In a tag we might see e.g. Pfwd≔0.8 and Pbwd≔0.6. The assoc attribute (association constant K) is normally part of the relationship expression. Tag value attributes are needed to convey the values on the web, and in DiracMiner each can display several kinds of probabilities, e.g. Pfwd≔(classical≔0.9452, Pfzeta≔0.9880).

Important symmetries and at least symbolic manipulations of vectors and matrices are required to use the tags described with Q-UEL in general [1,4]. Note in particular that if
                        ⁎=is=has are conditional or categorical relationships and ultimately Hermitian 
                           h
                        -complex relational projector matrices R that satisfy RR=R. The asterisk ⁎ represents conjugation, changing the sign of the imaginary part. However, the following equivalences will suffice for most readers of the present paper.

Sometimes we write {Pfwd, Pbwd} when they are not necessarily conditional probabilities like P(A|B) and P(B|A). We can say that P(“Obesity causes type 2 diabetes”) and P(“type 2 diabetes causes obesity”) are eigensolutions when 
                           h
                         is substituted by its eigenvalues +1 and −1 respectively, as described by Dirac [8] for his corresponding quantity σ 
                        [8].

The following tags types all conform to Eq. (1), and though some may not appear quantitative, they have, by Q-UEL rules, the value {1,1}=1 by default.

This is a simple patient summary record re-rendered in Q-UEL. Each demographic and clinical factor being captured in an attribute analogous to an XML attribute, expressed Event/Entity-Attribute-Value style, and compatible with JSON [2]. For privacy and security purposes, such records are readily disaggregated (encrypted and reversibly shredded) [2]. The tag as an algebraic entity has default value 1 because in the present study we see ourselves as ignorant of the uncertainty associated with the observations and measurements [2] Contrast the patient analysis tag (Section 2.3.4).

This large tag provides a fairly rich but item-by-item statistical summary of all the above patient records in a Q-UEL format that a classical biostatistician can, with very little orientation, directly understand. It is sometimes said to express a “public health cross-section report format”. By default, there is one attribute for each metadata, i.e. for each column of input data, or for each attribute in a Q-UEL patient record. However, like all other tags generated here, it is subject to a focusing query if applied. In this case the value {1,1}=1 is not assumed, although at present low values associated with the Pfwd and Pbwd attributes are to do with experimental studies of the multidimensional joint probability distribution, to be reported elsewhere, and are calculated as due to independent distributions for the purpose of the present report.

These are the main “workhorses” of the present approach to data mining and inference. Notably, they describe associations between data in many combinations that relates to the K-method of HDN construction [3]. These are the tags that make most demands on memory, by far. The term K-method relates to the assoc (association constant) attribute value K(A; B)=P(A, B)/P(A) P(B), but the actual value of the tag as an algebraic entity is {P(A|B), P(B|A)} with Pfwd giving P(A|B) and Pbwd giving P(B|A). Note that P(A)=P(A|B)/K(A; B) and P(B)=P(B|A)/K(A; B). From all of these other probabilities and medical metric involving A and/or B can be constructed [1]. K-method tags are also particularly rich in other useful extra information including raw counts.

In practice for patient data we should allow {P
                           1, P
                           2}<{1, 1}. As in any science, there are potential errors in observation, and clinical values for a patient are always subject to inescapable experimental uncertainty seen as dispersion (confidence interval CI, standard deviation SD, etc.). Unfortunately, details of this kind are still not widely available in EHRs [2]. One purpose of patient analysis tags is simply to enable our research in this area. Values of attributes on a patient analysis tag look rather like they were available, but the confidence interval etc. applies to the population sampled and it is really a K-method tag limited to the demographic and clinical factors of one requested patient. The CI, SD etc. are, taken from the population sample being analyzed. It is a very fast way of providing informative content regarding a specific patient. If we consider two factors described for a patient, say attributes A and B, the associations and other probabilistic measures relating them are reported on a tag. Other tags of this type will report on attributes C and D, and A, B, and C, and so on. A probability will be much lower if a patient is not normal in terms of that population sample of which he or she is a member, raising an alert. The patient need not be real, but an artificial record created as a query. The queries may be on gender or age group, or African–American, or diabetes and so forth, which is the way of reporting how observations and measurements depend on these denominators.

The algebraic values of these tags are as for K-method tags, which they resemble. V-method tags are more obviously vector elements and more like answers to queries or filters applied at the input stage. The theoretical interest is deeper here, but is to do with many of these tags collectively. A V-method tag can be seen as a vector element 〈A|Ψ

Note that we can always get 〈Ψ
                           
                              i
                           |A〉 as 〈A|Ψ
                           
                              i
                           〉⁎, i.e. as the complex conjugate of 〈A|Ψ
                           
                              i
                           〉, and so |A〉=〈A|⁎. It represents a much better estimate of interdependence than is done by assuming random association between A and B. For that to work well, however, Ψ has to be something that A and B are strongly dependent upon. In physics Ψ is a universal wave function Ψ, though when actually used it is some (notoriously rather vague) local subsystem reference state. In a V-method tag it is simply Ψ
                           
                              gender, age-group
                           , so e.g. we see the tag 〈׳Taking diabetes medication׳|female and age≔80–89〉, albeit with a few added features for web use.

These are classical scalar self-probabilities or scalar joint probabilities (JPs). They are provided separately and they are clearly not really Q-UEL “tags” even though suich tag types exist (e.g.〈male and Caucasian P=0.48〉) but JPs in a more traditional probability format in order to be easy to use in traditional BN construction, although they would normally be first converted to conditional probabilities by divisions. The JPs are always written to a separate file jmethod.text. Starting from a JP ensures that probabilities satisfy Bayes Rule, and also JPs facilitate marginal summation, both being important aspects a the required property of consistency as follows.

The enforced marginal summation approach used to “repair” inconsistency between probabilities, or simply fill gaps in an implied contingency table of probabilities, is discussed in Section 2.12. Importantly, this can be used to make zeta probabilities self-consistent. Use here of A, B, C etc. quickly becomes cumbersome when focusing on dimensions, distributions, and summations. We use e.g. P(X
                        
                           i
                        , X
                        
                           j
                        , X
                        
                           k
                        ) and now say that enforced marginal summation implicitly maximizes entropy due to the constraint of other probabilities that are less than 1, by maximizing the entropy −Σ
                        
                           j
                        
                        P(X
                        
                           i
                        , X
                        
                           j
                        , X
                        
                           k
                        ) ln
                        P(X
                        
                           i
                        , X
                        
                           j
                        , X
                        
                           k
                        ). Actually, the format P(X≔x)=n[X≔x)]/Σ
                        
                           y
                        
                        n[X≔y] would be even less ambiguous in practical context, where X is metadata like blood pressure and x is a specific value like 140 and y implies summation over all such values of X present except X≔unknown. Forms like P[⁎][B][~C][D] and P[0][1][2][1] used internally are used below in discussion of algorithms. [⁎] or [0] means sum over all elements in the particular dimension so that it can be neglected. The ‘~’ translates as “not”, and so [~C] or [2] means sum over all the elements in the third dimension except C.

The attribute factor ‘?’ commonly appears on tags, representing an unknown, a state of which we are ignorant, a wild card, everything, an act of preparation or measurement as in QM, and so on, for which we might usually think of P(?)=1 as reasonable. It is important in normalization and forming conditional probabilities. 〈A|?〉 and 〈B|?〉 are the 
                           h
                        -complex counterparts of the self or prior probability such as P(A) in a BN. For example, three tags can be arranged to represent a multiplicative expression (the multiplication is commutative), which is also a simple basic type of HDN.

It computes as the product {1, P(A)} {P(A|B), P(B,A} {P(B), 1} to have the purely real value {P(A,B), P(A, B)}=P(A, B). Note though that if, for example, P(B) were incorrect in value, we would have {P(A,B), P(A, B)′} where P(A,B)≠P(A, B)′, and hence a real part as average

As discussed in the next Section 1.9, h (common in this kind of work and not to be confused with 
                           h
                         or Planck’s constant) relates to n in ζ(s=1, n), so that h(1, 2) means n[x=1, y] in n[ ] notation using x and y, with the caveat of the “–1” adjustment in h( )–1. That issue is deferred until the next section. It is of little consequence when data is not too sparse. We can also write

                        which therefore represents predictive odds. Importantly, we can reversibly re-express the same information-theoretic based predictions, as can be made with the above zeta functions, in exponential terms. We can use that to express a probability-like form by replacing the I( ) by their expectations E[I( )|D] and using forms that at least start from the concept P=e

                        which yield Eqs. (7)–(9) using x=1 and 2, and note that the ζ(s=1, N) cancel. We can thus speak of P(A), P(A, B), P(A|B, C) and so on as our “zeta probabilities”, if we derived them in the above way. It was mentioned in Section 1.9 that what is often of interest is an estimate of a PO as a ratio of two networks.. Then simplifying cancelations can occur, but instead we might want to work first with the original nets independently, to gain insight, as follows.

We can always chose normalizing partition functions Z, and coherence can be satisfied in terms of Bayes’ Rule, but note that with the above zeta approach we will still have P→1 as N→0, given any n[ ]≤N, i.e. as data becomes increasingly sparse. As it happens, the ability to add other numbers to the number of observations, or other modifications that still use the zeta function, would allow P→0 or P→0.5, as N→0, if that was wanted. However P→1 is consistent what the zeta approach wants. In that case, marginal summation may not then be fully satisfied.

The relevance of the so-called Dirichlet choice of “−1” (Eq. (6)) will obviously impact the use of very sparse data. The above integration (Eq. (6)) was novel but Pr[P(x, y)|D] was not. Hence its earlier use [18] followed cautious mathematicians who used

It is an example of a β-distribution. Here k is a readily determined constant of proportionality, actually, the reciprocal of the β function B(α,β) with α=h(1,y) and β=h(1,y). It is these h that correspond to parameters n in ζ(s, n), now seeing n as a composite of real and virtual frequencies. The P(x|y) constitute a set of independent random variables, and each, in the traditional view, the β distribution:

That is, we should use ζ(s=1, f+g–1). Here, f relates to the frequency of events or states etc. actually observed (i.e. the counts), and an optional g relates our adjustable degree of belief as a kind of virtual frequency.

                           It is popular amongst workers using Bayesian statistics, which are based on Bayes Rule. The rationalization for the Dirichlet distribution is that is it the natural conjugate prior of the categorical distribution for K≥2 categories and multinomial distribution, and its probability density function returns the belief that the probabilities of rival events are χ

                              –1 times. “Conjugate prior” means that if the prior distribution of the multinomial parameters is Dirichlet then the posterior distribution is also a Dirichlet distribution, said to make the posterior distribution easy to compute and to see how much our beliefs have changed on seeing the data. However, the author does not see either of these as compelling compared with alternatives, and importantly the “–1” even seems problematic, as discussed above.
                         Intuitively, from an information theoretic perspective, we simply want ζ(s, …)=0 for f+g=0. If f=g=0 then kP
                        −1(1−P)−1 etc. as a density cannot be integrated (i.e. it is “improper”), which means little more than that use of “−1” breaks down in the limit. ζ(s, −1) makes no sense. We now have to wonder how to treat 0 observations and distinguish it from 1 observation. The first time that we see something is important: when we jump from n=0 to 1, it is “existentially qualified”, i.e. we know it exists. The jump between n=1 and 2 seems unreasonable. Absolute prior “−1” is not intuitive.

For n→∞, we have ζ(s=1, n)−γ→ ln(n), where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant 0.57721…. Here e
                        −γ
                        =0.561… so its effect on probability is not negligible. Ιt is well known that γ in γ=ζ(s=1, n)–ln(n) is not really a constant but quickly convergences to near 0.57721…. as n increases. The effect of γ usually at least approximately cancels out because of subtractions, or even disappears totally by definition of expected information. However, DiracMiner pools all zeta functions as normalizing factors into a kind of log partition function, for convenience in descriptions of the calculation in the output tags, and this leaves several γ’s un-cancelled. For all cases, including the above use, the following redefinition of ζ(s=1, n) provides a simple estimate, one that behaves in the way we would like near n=0 and 1.

Note that z(1)≈1 bit (binary unit) while ζ(s=1, 1)=1 nat (natural unit). There are other approaches to expected information and entropy but average over states, not probability values. All provide much more complicated recipes. A z-based approach combined with J-method normalization decribed below will be an appropriate basis because it is easy to show that, to a very good approximation,

This worked exactly for ζ( ), and z(n) may simply be thought of as replacing ζ(s, n) although with the following caveat. Because of some controversy in the field regarding matters addressed in Sections 2.6–2.8, DiracMiner allows the argument of the z function to take the linear form μ[Α]n[A]+…+ν[A]). Here μ[ ] is a rescaling term equivalent to raising Q-UEL probabilities to the μ[ ]th power (if ν[A] is relatively small), and 〈A|B〉→〈A|B〉

                        μ[ ] is set at a large same value and the ν[A,B]) are set relative small, then ln(n) will be approached more quickly, and issues related to the Dirichlet “−1” choice disappears. Selecting a large μ[ ] and ν[ ]=0 converts zeta probabilities to classical probabilities.

Probabilistic values that are associated with the relational operator R, e.g. if≔assoc≔1.9, are usually real valued. Note the following useful equivalences.

It is this strength or weight Str( ) that determines whether tags (usually just K-method tags) are generated or not, depending on whether or not the strength falls within a range α…0…β around zero, typically −1 … +1 nats, i.e. α=−1, β=+1. The strength in natural logarithm units or “nats” appears along with other useful information in relations expressions in K-method tags.

If the above were used with the range set sufficiently broad (α⪢0, β⪢0), tags would show close agreement between classical and zeta probabilities, but we are the neglecting sparse data which could combine to have strong effect. First note that marginal summation means that 1=Σ

                        and so on. In consequence of Eqs. (23)–(25), one is not really saying that ultimately every probability that expresses ignorance should be 1, but that in the limit of ignorance about the data is expressed by the simple maximum entropy distribution, 1=Σ

It is robust to badly assigned probabilities when a small perturbation ±ΔP or “temperature” is applied to probabilities to help ensure local stability of the convergence point reached. The procedure adjusts all the P(X
                        
                           i

                           i

                           i

                           i

                           k
                        ) by an equal factor so that they satisfy each P(X

                        ), then dealing with satisfying the P(X
                        
                           i
                        ), and then in satisfying normalization to 1, and then back again as in cycle 1. There are some variations in detail to this algorithm most of which can be set by adjustable parameters and the consequences followed using a notation described in Section 2.5. Using 10 dimensions, Σ

                           j
                        ) is represented by P[A][⁎][⁎][⁎][⁎][⁎][⁎][⁎][⁎][⁎]. Internally, e.g. P[⁎][B][C][⁎][E][~F][⁎][⁎][⁎][⁎] would be encoded as P[0][1][1][0][1][2][0][0] [0][0] (Section 2.5). As a test, we can start very far from satisfying marginal summation. The final massaged joint probabilities can be readily converted to any required BN or HDN by the following sufficient set of operations in operational probability notation thought easier for those familiar with BNs, though a BN user would not use Pif and Pif⁎.

                        Fig.1 describes the primary information flow and command control features of the BioIngine setup as it was predominantly used in the present study, and as described in more detail in the following Sections 3.2–3.6.

The primary task of the overall configuration is use raw data plus an HDN query file HDNquery.txt to generate a polished network with answers on the HDN answer file HDNanswer.txt. To achieve this, DiracMiner converts the raw data to usable tags, and then DiracBuilder queries for those needed to convert the HDN query file to the HDN answer file. Essentially, the initial HDN query file contains the HDN that the user would like to have, and DiracBuilder helps get the best similar dual net by looking at what Q-UEL tags and joint probabilities are available. J-method probabilities are usually written to a separate file jmethod.txt. Otherwise, one may have all tags on a tag soup file, or dispose each tag type to a separate file kmethod.txt, vmethod.txt etc. As shown in Fig. 1, the present setup has two main channels from DiracMiner to DiracBuilder that reflect the focuses in the present study though they can with care be mixed. The upper channel is for building basic HDNs in the “usual” (especially K-method) way [3] using K-method tags. The lower channel is particularly for using J-method joint probabilities when one requires to use sparse data and/or subjective assignments, and pruning by tag strength is not done or is weak. This J-channel is indicated for those used to working with BNs and whenever we wish to force marginal summation by HDNcoherer (Section 2.12).

Instructions for generating patient records and various analyses in Q-UEL with better standardized data formats resides largely in a subroutine Convert in DiracMiner as a Perl script. Its setting of control variables can be overridden by a setup file setup.txt as a simple Perl script that can be edited (e.g. via a graphical user interface), and that can in turn can be overridden by a Qcommand control tag in Q-UEL in control tag format. The order of dominance in overriding values that DiracMiner uses is therefore Qcommand control tag>setup file>convert subroutine>DiracMiner global variables. Two examples of Q-UEL control tag format for the Q-command tag used below are:-

The “user manual” details of control over tag production must be omitted for brevity, but basically any part of the above control tag can be replaced, including -CHF-SURVEY- in the tag name, to produce tags with required appearance. Attribute columns≔0—8 means that these are denominators of general importance and specifically that they will appear before the relationship re-expression in vertical bars. The command tag as a whole will include all the attributes that the have≔if≔attribute requests, the default being all.

The setup file setup.txt looks much as the following though it is a small snapshot from what is typically a circa 70 line file. It is a Perl script but the meaning should be evident, since the main function is simply to assign values to controlling variables.

DiracMiner will make a reasonable attempt to interpret any input CSV file or simple Q-UEL records but any CSV file should ideally be in a canonical form, meaning that the three following kinds of data can be automatically detected. Categorical-Nominal is such as Asian, e.g. for metadata such as Ethnicity. Any value will be considered categorical if it contains other than numeric features. This data will be analyzed to present the percentage of population appearing in each group. Quantitative means separate or mixed integer or decimal values such as 142 or 3.5, e.g. for metadata ‘systolic blood pressure (mmHg)’ or Age(years), positive or negative. The default is that this data will be analyzed to present the mean value followed by±to indicate the distribution around the mean (assuming a normal distribution). Distributions are also given for male and female age and age group (0–9 years, 10–19 years, 20–29 years, and so on), and for the years the sample was taken (e.g. 2010, 2011, 2012 and so on). Binary values mean dichotomous data such as gender, smoking expressed with values 0 and 1. The values are presented in output as percentages, the default output being without dispersions or confidence values, but their distribution by gender and age group is given as for quantitative values. In principle, all these features relating to types and appearance of metadata and values can be changed by the end user in several ways (Section 3.2). The string ADJUSTABLE_CLASS in metadata in input is the only significant feature of DiracMiner that exerts control via the input CSV file, and which can normally be automatically edited. For example, we might see ADJUSTABLE_ CLASS≔Age(years) which is the important example of such use in the present paper. With no other action, the number 23 would for example be seen as C23, meaning “Class 23”.

Biostatistical analysis as appears on the patient summary tag is essentially standard. In the case of K-method reporting, associations between every specific real value such as 6.23 would generate an enormous number of tags. The default is that integers are taken, but if the result is positive and exceeds 9, numbers converted to ranges in steps of ten, that is 10, 11, 19 are converted to 10–19, 23 and 27 to 20–29, and so on. This is all appropriate for the common types of US clinical value, and it can be modified by the end user. The above applies also to V-method tags, which always contain three factors, two being gender and age group. The number of factors on a K-method tag is 1 or more, and 1–4 in practice in the present study. Progress including pruning is recorded by {!comment!} statements written to the quellog.txt log file. They have five severity levels: comments, notifications, cautions, warnings and errors. An unfixable error or too many warnings will halt execution with a notification to quellog.txt.

As with our previous papers, we present the tags as results, rather than method. This is partly because a reported Q-UEL project usually includes designing new tags, but importantly here, most tags represent important examples of statistical results from the study. However, design did not take much effort in the J-method case as the following snapshot shows. It is traditional probability format except that P3 simply means there are 3 factors and so on. This is to speed querying of a large jmethod.txt file.
                           
                              P1(׳Total cholesterol(mg/dl)׳≔׳100-109׳) = 0.0233

P3(׳Height(inches)׳≔׳60-69׳ and male and age≔׳70-79׳) = 0.0184

P3(not ׳Family history of diabetes׳ and ׳Height(inches)׳≔׳60-69׳ and ׳Glucose(mg/dl)׳≔׳70-79׳) = 0.0521

P3(not ׳Smoking׳ and ׳Height(inches)׳≔׳70-79׳ and not ׳History of diabetes׳) = 0.0755

P3(not ׳History of BP׳ and ׳Group׳≔׳GC׳ and ׳Diastolic BP(mmHg)׳≔׳70-79׳) = 0.2126

P3(׳Framingham Risk(%)׳≔׳1׳ and ׳Batch Processing Group׳≔׳G3׳ and not ׳History of BP׳) = 0.2264

P3(not ׳Smoking׳ and ׳Weight(pounds)׳≔׳160-169׳ and ׳Glucose(mg/dl)׳≔׳90-99׳) = 0.0221

P3(׳History of high cholesterol׳ and age≔׳50-59׳ and ׳Fasting before bloodwork׳) = 0.0759

P3(not ׳Taking cholesterol medication׳ and ׳Group׳≔׳GC׳ and ׳ADJUSTABLE_CLASS׳≔age≔׳C41׳) = 0.0210

P2(׳Fat(%)׳≔׳50-59׳ and female) = 0.0440

The joint probabilities are converted to operational probability notation based on Eq. (26). It is an optional control notation. It is insightful to tackle a traditional BN toy problem [65] using it. The source text states: “Suppose that there are two events which could cause grass to be wet: either the sprinkler is on or it׳s raining. Also, suppose that the rain has a direct effect on the use of the sprinkler (namely that when it rains, the sprinkler is usually not turned on)… The joint probability function is: P(G, S, R)=P(G|S, R)P(S|R) P(R)”. The example illustrates features common to homeostasis of biomedical importance, but is of interest here because, unusual in many real world applications of BNs, the above expansion is exact, not an estimate of P(G, S, R).

                        Since the focus in this example is on generating a coherent joint probability, Pif and Pif⁎ are not included in this case, and we obtain {0.00198, 0.00198}=0.00198. We could use them to dualize the above to give conditional probabilities [10]. Being an exact estimate, it allows us to demonstrate that the total stress after enforced marginal summation (departure from initial specified probabilities) is very small, summing to 0.0005755. More typically, though, a set of input probabilities can be massaged fairly drastically. Using the notation initial -> final, the following transitions occurred after a set of “bad initial assignments”.

Overall normalization now correctly adds up to 1.000000, and a full set of all possible joint probabilities up to P(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J) similarly show correct marginal summation within six decimal places of precision.

Q-UEL tags are supposed to designed to be intuitive. For brevity only brief comment is given in each case. Admittedly, reading Section 2 is important. The tags of different kinds can optionally be written to separate output files as indicated on the title of each Section below, or follow the current Q-UEL tradition of being mixed up on a so called tag soup file tagsoup.txt, By this we can test our recovery techniques for difficult cases of recovery from the web, including deliberate disaggregation [2].

During analysis, data for patients is transferred into Q-UEL format as a simple EHR. These are far from the most elaborate forms (compare ref. [12]) and so in contrast they are called simple patient record tags. Many tags like this will be generated, one from each row of an input spreadsheet.

These tags are generated primarily for the K-method of HDN construction [16]. In the present study, this is done by DiracBuilder. All the Pfwd or Pbwd attributes are directly usable, and by considering only Pfwd, we could also build a BN. A sufficiently complex tag, with many factors, may be sufficient as the HDN or BN.As a simple example, we may ask a question about the relationship between not having a history of high cholesterol and a BMI of 30–39 and an HDL of 50–59, which is really a dual question. What is the probability of not having high cholesterol given a BMI of 30–39 and an HDL of 50–59? What is the probability of a BMI of 30–39 and an HDL of 50–59 given no history of high cholesterol? We would find

DiracMiner can go up to more factors (albeit just 4 in the present study implantation). This makes rather clear the true nature of any inference net of the BN and basic HDN kind, because now we can put together several tags to ask much more complicated questions involving many more factors than appear in any single one of the output tags.

This involves a somewhat unusual concept but it has several applications. It is essentially a simplified K-method tag as above, but instead of DiracMiner generating many tags for all combinations of all values. It looks only at the values for a specified patient (patient 100 in this case, as specified on the control tag). See Section 2.3, and note there that the patient added and selected may not actually be real, but takes on the force of a query, allowing us to ask “what if” questions.

These also should be self-evident, but note their deeper theoretical importance in Section 2.2. Note also prior=20, which means that virtual frequency of 20 has been added to all observed frequencies in this example.

Low probabilities are common for diagnoses, procedures, and therapies because any one patient does not have many of them, although note that insight can be obtained when that is not so: bleeding peptide ulcer below is more common in elderly (at least female) patients.

A cut-off of five million associative array elements is the usual setting for the safe bound of “circuit breaker”, because on a typical laptop DiracMiner will then be using roughly half the machine dynamic memory while running in the background. This is the parameter seen as $maxElementsAssociation=5000000 on the set-up file. Four computers were used, an HP Compaq 6200 Pro 64bit OS with i7-2600 8×3.40GHz processors and 4GB RAM (memory) (H), a DELL Vostro 320 with E5300 2×2.6GHz and 2GB RAM (D), and a E430 Thinkpad 64bit OS with i3-2350M 2×2.30GHz and 6GB RAM (T), and a MacBookPro11,2 with a 1×2.2GHz 4 core Intel i7 (cache L2=256MB, L3=6MB) and 16GB RAM (M). Execution time might vary even on one machine because tests are usually conducted in a realistic everyday scenario with DiracMiner running in the background, and with for example Microsoft Word, file searching, and browsers being active at the same time. For typical runs envisaged for public health analysis, generating up to up to 2 and 3 factor K-method tags, the execution is effectively instantaneous. For the CHF data and up to 2 factor tags, it takes 0.4–4s to generate all the kind of tags and fastest speeds being achieved on the T machine. Generating K-method tags with up to 3 factors is also quite fast, usually less than about 15s. Some specific examples may be given of more demanding runs, including scaling to “Big Data” below. Recall that the control tag is varied most frequently and a typical routine example run, here generating K-tags with up to 4 factors, is determined by

<Q-UEL-CHF-SURVEY-REQUEST patients≔׳input file׳≔CHF_Oct_2014.csv ׳select patient׳≔100 columns≔0-8 | have≔if≔׳DO (Male|Age(years)|diabetes|cholesterol|HDL|BP|BMI|Framingham)׳ | Q-UEL-QUERYTAG-CHF-SURVEY-REQUEST>

In the above we request to generate all tags but limit the analysis to certain metadata, such as diabetes, of interest. As always, attribute columns≔0–8 does not represent the total number of columns used and number of attributes on the tag, but merely sets the the number of attributes that appear before the relationship expression in the tag. A patient is selected for the patient analysis tags, and is number 100. The other settings, those on the setup file, are as shown as the setup file listing in Section 3.1, remembering that they are overridden by the above control tag. The above run typically takes about 40s on the M machine, ranging 30–45s over a number of recent models. Slightly more challenging, the following is an unrestricted “do all” run, but still using one patient number 100 again to generate patient analysis tags, with the K-method tags again carrying a maximum of 4 factors.

<Q-UEL-CHF-SURVEY-REQUEST patients≔׳input file׳≔CHF_Oct_2014.csv ׳select patient׳≔100 columns≔0-8 | have≔if≔׳do all׳ | Q-UEL-QUERYTAG-CHF-SURVEY-REQUEST>

This job takes about 100s on the M machine, giving e.g. the following. The M machine performed well here, because a variety of other computers including the four specified above gave 1–20min with DiracMiner running as a background task. Usually, on requesting a maximum of 4 factors, we obtain about 40,920 metadata combinations and approximately a million specifically 4-factor K-method tags. The T machine scaled well on the 667,000 patient Virginia data, taking 10min, when selecting gender, age (year of birth) all possible diagnoses Dx, procedures Px and prescriptions Rx gave 87 distinct metadata and requesting up to factor 3. This gave 105,995 metadata combinations, while for 4 factor tags there were 2,225,895 metadata combinations. For runs of 1,2,3,and 4 factors there are over 30 million 4-factor tags, but again DiracMiner eliminated all but the tags with the greater strength to keep memory in safe bounds. Generally speaking, for 1–3 factors these runs were some 50 times faster than similar older runs recorded for FANO [21,22], though at 4 factors they were approaching comparable speeds, and in special studies of 6–11 factors using diracMiner it was evident that FANO had been variously some 7–70 times faster.

For the Virginia data [22] using up to the 4 factor K-method tag case without restriction to metadata (recall, the types of demographic and clinical factor), so using all 200 metadata in that particular set-up, the K-method part of the computation aborted on the T and M machines. On the latter it halted at record 30,000, with 418,111 associative array elements assigned. On the T machine, DiracMiner it halted at 420,000 records when a jump to 5,011,427 associative array elements occurred. However, by setting instead −1.3+…+1.3, halting did not occur and one obtains many 4-factor tags in from several minutes up to an hour or more depending on machine, number of processors actively used, and the detailed purging schedule selected. Note that absolute strength tends to decrease as the number of factors is increased, and there is a very sharp drop, a roughly sigmoidal transition, in the vicinity of −1.5+…+1.5. If we use −2.0 to +2.0, we typically lose all except 1-factor tags. Note that an optimal choice need not be a symmetrical range around zero, but something like −1.4+…+1.6. Work is proceeding on automating the selection of range by feedback. Very large files of some 7 million records were emulated and could take up to two hours to analyze. Because of the automatic management by DiracMiner, experimental runs of up to 6 factors in K-method tags took roughly the same time, but the pruning process that pruned out the weaker tags, i.e. those the higher number of factors with inevitably less supporting data, meant that very few 5 and 6 factor K-method tags were produced.

Some worked examples given first will help understand the general preliminary findings given after. The following represents an empirical extension to the Framingham Risk Score by bringing in more features. There is a significant difference from typical BN use as perceived by the typical user: note below the division /〈׳HEART ATTACK׳ |?〉=0.0860,1 to remove information I(׳HEART ATTACK׳) so that it is not used twice.

                        In this first example, the required tags were found and no modification was required to the initial net. It could of course be argued that the initial choice was in knowledge of what was not available, which was easy to tell in this small focus study with few factors. It is insightful to repeat the above, changing only the age range. For example, this gives 3.64%, 7.09%, and 16.21% for age groups 50–59, 60–69, and 70–79 respectively, consistent with commonly given numbers such as 6% in the 40–59 age group and 10–20% in the 60–79 age group. Note a predictive odds (PO) format is readily constructed that leads to cancelations, and is simpler due to cancellations, though the probability values for the “not” cases have to be computed from information on K-method tags.

                        The PO is about the same as the PO for heart attack based on age range alone, 4.25%. The above medical focus is essentially BN-like, which is certainly permissible. However, while we might just ask one question, with an HDN we always get a “two for one” result, which can often be interpreted as two BNs. For example,

WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY OF not having a history of high cholesterol,


                        for a female patient age 50–59 taking diabetes medication
                     


                        and having a BMI of 30–39 and HDL 50–59,

GIVEN THAT the systolic BP is 130–139 and Non-HDL is 120–129?

also implies the question with the lower case parts of the first and fourth lines switched. The above is easily translated into Dirac brakets, manually or automatically, as shown below. To get the probabilities for those brakets, the DiracBuilder module looks for tags outputted from DiracMiner that carry the required information. Here it finds four relevant tags. One corresponds to the complex conjugate of the implied corresponding query tag, e.g. we looked for 〈A, B|C〉 and found 〈C|B, A〉, but we merely imagine switching the Pfwd and Pbwd that it presents. Stripping these five tags of miscellaneous web management detail, we would obtain the HDN as<׳History of high cholesterol׳≔׳0׳ |׳BMI׳≔׳30–39׳ and ׳HDL(mg/dl)׳≔׳50–59׳>=70.87, 6.65 <׳BMI׳≔׳30–39׳ | ׳Systolic BP(mmHg)׳≔׳130–139׳>=46.44, 28.51 <׳HDL(mg/dl)׳≔׳50–59׳ | ׳Taking diabetes medication׳≔׳1׳>=25.11, 14.92 <׳Taking diabetes medication׳≔׳1׳ | ׳Male׳≔׳0׳ and ׳Age(years)׳≔׳50–59׳>=11.69, 22.91 <׳Male׳≔׳0׳ and ׳Age(years)׳≔׳50–59׳ | ׳Non-HDL(mg/dl)׳≔׳120–129׳>=20.81, 8.09

We multiply the probabilities in each direction, 70.87×46.44 etc. to the left, and 6.65×28.51 etc. to the right. The answers are 0.2010%, 0.0052% respectively, i.e. the dual {0.2010%, 0.0052%}.

Predicting chronic diseases is very important. When using data of the present kind, however, the problem is not that prediction is too difficult, but that it seems too easy. Predictions of disease are helped by medical records that contain family history, symptoms, lab results, comorbidities, notes on medication, and so forth [3]. They are, after all, supposed to be there as strong “clues” to help the medical professionals. Even the famous Framingham Risk Score is dominated by a single factor, age [42]. It will take a considerable period of time to explore the effects of all variation in protocol as the following preliminary work shows, and we will report in future on this and developments found suitable to implement to facilitate testing. It is a “toy” study to predict high blood pressure (BP), i.e. hypertension. It is “toy” because BP is easy to measure, although predictions do have useful aspects of referring to the future, in principle testable by looking at the patient at later dates. We here used the “jackknife” method, meaning that one or more current items (independent variables) are removed from 31 distinct types of data (31 after omitting batch processing group and ADJUSTABLE_CLASS≔Age) for each patient, and predicted from the rest. In the case of these kinds of data, however, prediction requires removal not only of “history of high BP” but also of the BP measurements themselves, and indication of whether BP medication is being taken or not, otherwise, without removal, one gets 95%, a seemingly persuasive result considering that errors can be made in tests, recorded interviews, and in data entries. After removing the above strong clues of BP measurement and medication, the K-method predicted that patients will be above (or equal to) or below 130mmHg with 91% accuracy, at least up to age 75. It could be argued that predicting “history of high BP” is particularly easy because it implies that it is, by time of record, well established and perhaps more severe. If one predicts high BP as defined by BP measurement, choosing what defines “high” above boundary of 130mmHg looks fair as the midpoint of what is typically considered pre-high BP, and it again gives predictions of 91%. However both cases are still being helped by biases and cues that need correction. 39% subjects had high BP, of which 32% of males did, and 42% of females, females comprising 72% of the sample. That is easily adjusted, but the boundary of 130mmHg less obviously and particularly helps, because in this study systolic BP increases from about 100 to 140mmHg occur from ages about 8 to 65, when it plateaus and later dips, and standard deviation (SD) in systolic BP is about 8mmHg for variations in measurement on same patient in the same visit. Other boundary choices gave a poorer picture.

When age is removed, accuracy drops from 91% to 80%. Body mass index (BMI) remains as a strong determining factor supported by the levels of blood lipids and glucose. Surprisingly in view of initial results showing that females were much more at risk, attempts to predict obesity and associated clinical values on the basis of gender did not do better than random. The distributions are important but consistent with the above poor result, males had an average BMI of 27.6kg/m2 associated with an average systolic/diastolic of 130/81, and females had an average BMI of 29.4kg/m2 associated with an average systolic/diastolic of 130/82. These are worryingly high (18.5–24.9kg/m2 is often considered normal range) but it is not a significant gender difference. Examining the distribution itself, age 30–59 females are roughly ten times more likely to have a 1–2kg/m2 higher BMI, and across the age groups it is statistically significant. However, with SDs of 8mmHg for measurements and 18mmHg across the population, 1–2mmHg would not normally be considered a significant difference in “clinical effect” and may well not show up in typical analyses and predictions. Prediction of high BP from genomic features taken with gender, and age group, and the effects of marketed medication, would seem to provide less toy-like examples. In lieu of genomic data, ethnicity as judged by the subject was, as usual, used. Our work here is particularly preliminary, and results largely medical rather than bio-computational matters that must receive closer examination using data from recent and imminent Heart Fairs, and be reported elsewhere. However, it may already be concluded that with this kind of data, alerts and looking for what unusual rather than attempting to predict something (say, good or bad outcome), is often more important.

                           Briefly, the following may illustrate this. Below BMI 30, BP/BMI ratio for overall sample is approx. same as or less than expected for lean Africans and Jamaicans. The distinction between being African-Caribbean AC and not AC gave better predictions than whether the subject was Caymanian or not, even Caymanian for several generations. There was predicted 30% increased risk of BMI 41–50 for AC versus non-AC subjects, and to be circa 3 times the risk of Systolic BP 151–190 for AC versus non-AC subjects. Gender was a poor predictor of these rates of blood pressure increase per BMI increase, even though men increased some 10% more than women. In AC subjects not taking blood pressure medication, systolic blood pressure increased 20mmHg with a 10 unit increase in BMI, and diastolic by 12 in the present sample, though the SDs are about 10 and 6mmHg respectively, but it increases half that rate in non-AC subjects also not on medication. What was perhaps particularly surprising was that while the rates are approximately halved when considering the group receiving blood pressure medication, there is some slight evidence that above BMI 40, the non-AC group, but not significantly the AC group, loses the beneficial effect of the medication.
                        
                     

The user can currently propose inference nets and refine them with the help of the system, based on what is available, and on viable replacements. It would seem that some basic expertise in probability, statistics and inference is required. Indeed, there now seems to be a major task ahead, the complete automation of generating the best choice of inference network from the very beginning. However, providing we stipulate what demographic and clinical factors A, B, C, etc. we want involved, this widely perceived difficulty is an illusion. We will focus on use of K-method tags to show this. The problem seems a combinatorial one, but there is a strategy of “including everything relevant” that is trivial to implement, manually or automatically, and where there are choices, one can pick the one with the highest strength. Suppose we wish to estimate P(A, B, C). In an HDN, we can use all choices at once as a product of alternatives, K(A; B)K(B; C)K(A; C)P(A) P(B)P(C) subject to rules described to avoid counting contributions twice [3], or simply dividing by the joint probabilities all those that do. This still leaves the question as to which of all the variations, of K and of J methods, is the best. All methods will agree (actual or implied probabilities within 1%) when, for a fair comparison, like-with-like is compared, when output is expressed the same way, when they are computed from the same data, and when there is adequate data. At present, our favored choices are that one may either use enforced marginal summation characteristic of the J-method, and/or consider predictive odds by including brakets and division by brakets on the HDNquery.txt file, as appropriate. Recall that marginal summation is indicated when we want to study distributions (say, blood pressure with age), or show that assigned values make sense with medical knowledge while still able to satisfy coherence. The development of the BioIngine environment is to facilitate all the above, automating whenever possible, and providing the test environment for development of still smarter automatic methods.

Most obviously, our methods including our particular use of the zeta functions contribute to the domain called machine learning [65]. There are overlaps with issues in QM to do with mind, statistics, and the zeta function [66–68], though there we do more borrowing than contributing. Q-UEL is all about combining information from sources that are diverse in character and reliability, so the fields of meta-analysis and Systematic Review [69] are relevant. Strongest of all the recently emerging influences on Q-UEL is the 10-Year roadmap to achieve an interoperable health IT infrastructure put forward by the (US) Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) [70]. In return, Q-UEL could contribute. Our “pitch” here is about “paving the way to a value-based approach in healthcare management, while striving to enable massive transformation of the Healthcare system from service-based to value-based payment and outcomes”. Be that as it may, constantly monitoring the health of a population by the kind of means described here will be an important aspect of keeping such efforts on track. We can be sure that the best ways to extend analysis to medical reasoning under uncertainty will continue to be debated. In the interim, it is still useful that if a machine comes up with a seemingly improbable pronouncement, it will at least cause a human physician or public health worker to pause and think twice. Recall that a major cause of death in the US, and doubtless most other nations, is due to medical errors [71].

Ideas and results are shared freely by the consortium of collaborators in the spirit of promoting Q-UEL, or something like it, as a standard or second language for interoperability in healthcare and biomedicine. With that intent, no patents have been filed for potential or actual inventions in this paper or the proceeding related papers on Q-UEL, Hyperbolic Dirac Nets, or the related POPPER language. There are potential commercial benefits in the sale or provision of specialized and customized configurations based on Q-UEL and the toolkit of related applications.
