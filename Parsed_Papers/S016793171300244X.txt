Oxidised silicon still remains at the core of a wide variety of microelectronic devices ranging from charge-trapping memory cells to high power transistors. As a result, further understanding of charge trapping in thin SiO2 layers at the atomic level represents the focal point of both experimental and theoretical research aimed at the development of physically sound models with considerable predictive capability.

In this contribution we demonstrate that Si–H bonds in bulk a-SiO2 and at the Si/SiO2 interface can indeed be responsible for the creation of paramagnetic

The ReaxFF force-field [9] was used to generate 20 models of amorphous silica, each containing 216 atoms, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations within the LAMMPS code [10]. The force-field was parametrised to reproduce the properties of various SiO2 polymorphs, Si polymorphs,

                      clusters and water molecules [11]. It allows the calculation of Si and O atoms in a range of oxidation states by exploiting the electronegativity equalisation principle [12]. To generate the amorphous structures, MD simulations were run starting from the 3×3×3 cell of 
                        
                           β
                        
                     -cristobalite under periodic boundary conditions.

Each system was given random velocities from a Gaussian distribution and equilibrated at 300K and 1atm. pressure using a Berendsen thermostat and barostat [13]. The temperature was then linearly ramped up to 5000K and a hydrogen molecule was added to the silica melt. In order to ensure that Si–H bonds are present in the final structure, the distance in a pair of Si and H atoms was fixed 1.46Å apart. The system was maintained at 5000K for 40ps and then brought down to 0K at a rate of 8K/ps. The resulting structures contained separate Si–H and Si–O–H bonds, as can be seen in Fig. 1
                     . These structures were then characterised by calculating the distributions of bond lengths and angles, densities, and total structure factors [14].

The electronic structures of these models were then calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and non-local density functional HSE [15], implemented in the CP2K code [16]. The CP2K code uses a mixed Gaussian/plane-wave basis set. The double-
                        
                           ζ
                        
                      Gaussian basis set [17] was employed for all atoms in conjunction with the GTH pseudopotential [18]. The SiO2 band-gap in these models is 
                        
                           ≈
                        
                     8.9eV. The calculations of hyperfine interactions employed all electron basis sets with contraction schemes 6-311G** for silicon and oxygen [19,20]. All geometry optimisations were performed to achieve forces on atoms less than 37 pN.

We also constructed several models of interfaces between crystalline Si (001) and a-SiO2, making the a-SiO2 layer using a similar technique. The starting structure contained 25 layers of Si and 13 layers of 
                        
                           β
                        
                     -cristobalite, strained to the lateral cell vectors of the Si substrate. Overall the Si substrate is

                     3nm thick as is the SiO2 layer. This system was modelled under 3D periodic boundary conditions and effectively contained two Si/SiO2 interfaces. Briefly, the interface structure generation included melting the SiO2 layer at the temperature of 5000K and equilibrating for 20ps. The temperature of the SiO2 layer was then brought down to 0K at a rate of 100K/ps. The Si layer and the Si/SiO2 interfaces were then heated up to 1000K and then brought down to 0K at a rate of 20K/ps. The resulting structures contained defects at the interface, which were passivated with H atoms, and one 3-coordinated Si in the SiO2 layer. The model has a distribution of Si–O bond lengths around 1.64Å and Si–Si bond lengths around 2.3Å. The O–Si–O angles are centred around 110

                     . The calculated band gaps and band offsets (shown in Table 1
                     ) are in good agreement with experiment.

We found that the H atom prefers to be located in the middle of a Si–O ring structure and does not bind to Si or O atoms. The average dissociation energy obtained from the 20 a-SiO2 models is 4.2eV, which indicates that the Si–H bond is very stable and would require high temperature for thermally activated dissociation to occur.

                     In the neutral system the Si–H states are located close to the top of the SiO2 valence band.

                      centre. The proton binds to the nearest oxygen that is not bonded to the Si atom from which the proton dissociated, as can be seen in Fig. 2
                     . The Si–H states of the two models in which the Si–H bond dissociated spontaneously are the highest in the a-SiO2 band gap above the top of the SiO2 valence band. These are also the ones that have the smallest H…O distance with the O atom which binds the proton. In the remaining 18 models there is a barrier to remove a proton, but the final dissociated state is always lower in energy than the Si–H state just after the hole trapping. The calculations using a nudged elastic band method [22] show that the barrier to proton removal increases as the H…O distance increases and in our 20 models does not exceed 0.5eV when the proton has to cross the largest distance of 3.2Å.

In all cases the proton binds to an oxygen atom, forming a hydronium-like configuration shown in Fig. 2 and leaving behind a 3-coordinated Si atom with an electron localised on this Si atom. Moving the proton to one of the O atoms belonging to the same tetrahedron as the 3-coordinated Si is also energetically favourable, but requires overcoming a higher barrier of 0.6eV, as opposed to the 0.5eV maximum required to cross a ring. The average relaxation energy, from our 20 systems, for a proton dissociating and binding to an oxygen atom across the ring is 0.66eV. We note that an electron trapping by an

                     3Å away leads to restoration of the Si–H bond.

Although the majority of the hyperfine splitting comes from the interaction of the unpaired electron with the nucleus of the Si atom on which it is localised (see Fig. 2), the hyperfine interaction with the proton is also possible if the Si…H distance is small enough. We find that if the Si…H distance is 2.3Å or less this hyperfine splitting is about 1.6mT.

It has been suggested by Pasquarello et al. that proton diffusion occurs predominantly via a ring-crossing mechanism [23]. This involves the proton hopping from one oxygen to another across an Si–O ring. Barriers for this hopping range from almost zero to

                      centre at the Si/SiO2 interface without a proton present in the system, as described in Section 2. We calculated the positions of the defect levels of the centre as a function of its distance from the Si substrate. The defect was positioned at different distances from the Si substrate (shown in Fig. 3
                     ), ranging from 2.6Å to 17.7Å. The positions of the defect’s occupied and unoccupied levels with respect to the Si valence band and Si conduction band shown in Table 2
                      indicate that the location of the defect at the interface has a considerable effect on its electronic structure. This effect stems both from the difference in local environment at each defect location, and from the constraints imposed by the interface on the defect-induced distortion of the amorphous silica structure.

We modelled electron injection by adding an extra electron at the bottom of the Si conduction band. In the interface system this electron can exchange between the defect and the Si substrate.

However, if the proton is further than 3Å away from the 3-coordinated Si, the electron transferred from Si is localised on the 3-coordinated silicon, making it negatively charged:

                      centres can behave as electron traps in Si/SiO2 systems. The Si–H dissociation is facilitated by hole injection and the barrier to Si–H dissociation is at most 0.5eV in our models.

                      centre is in good agreement with the experimental values. An interesting aspect of this model is the 1.6mT signal associated with the proton. Experimentally there is a weak satellite signal of 1.3mT associated with the

                      centre controversially attributed either to a 29Si atom [24] or hydrogen atoms [25]. Our calculations suggest that this satellite signal may be related to hydrogen present in the system after Si–H dissociation. Experimentally the 1.3mT signal has been seen to disappear at temperatures greater than 100°C while the

                      signal is increasing [26]. In this model the proton can diffuse away after overcoming some barrier, presumably leading to a disappearance of the 1.6mT signal, even while neutral

                      centre can be facilitated under certain conditions. Charge transfer between an oxide defect and the Si substrate has long been considered a cause for the bias temperature instability (BTI) [27]. In this model, an electron transfer from the Si substrate into the

                      centre has been considered a potential candidate for BTI. Using DFT under zero bias and with a valence band offset of 4.2eV we could not model directly the Si–H bond dissociation resulting from a hole injection. Future work will investigate how the application of the electric field facilitates the Si–H dissociation by hole trapping and rates of electron exchange between the neutral
