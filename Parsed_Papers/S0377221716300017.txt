                  Robust Portfolio Modeling (RPM) supports multi-attribute project portfolio selection with uncertain project scores and decision maker preferences. By determining non-dominated portfolios for all possible realizations of uncertain parameters, decision recommendations produced by RPM may prove too conservative for real-life decision problems. We develop a methodology to reduce the set of possible realizations by limiting the number of project scores that may simultaneously deviate from their most likely value. By adjusting this limit, decision makers can choose desired levels of conservatism. Our approach also allows to capture dependencies among project scores as well as uncertainty in portfolio constraints.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Socio-economic decision problems often involve decision makers facing alternative courses of action, which if chosen consume resources and have multi-dimensional consequences. Research in the area of “Portfolio Decision Analysis” strives to bring greater rationality and transparency to such resource allocation decisions (Kleinmuntz, 2007; Salo, Keisler, & Morton, 2011). Particularly, linear-additive portfolio selection models have frequently found high impact applications (Ewing, Tarantino, & Parnell, 2006; Grushka-Cockayne, Reyck, & Degraeve, 2008). Due to the strategic nature of typical portfolio decisions (Lourenço, Morton, & Bana e Costa, 2012; Salo et al., 2011), consequences, selection constraints, and decision maker preferences are subject to significant uncertainty. In uncertain environments any optimal portfolio determined for some point estimate parameter values might prove unsatisfactory for other possible realizations of uncertain parameter values.

Robust Portfolio Modeling (RPM) (Liesiö, Mild, & Salo, 2007; 2008) is a Portfolio Decision Analysis approach designed for decision environments in the context of project portfolio selection where project consequences given as scores in multiple attributes and decision maker preferences are subject to considerable uncertainty. RPM identifies non-dominated portfolios, i.e., portfolios (i) which are feasible in the sense that they satisfy relevant budgetary and other constraints and (ii) for which no other feasible portfolio yields greater value for all possible realizations of the uncertain project scores and attribute weights. Decision makers are provided with a set of non-dominated portfolios to choose from and receive decisional guidance on which projects’ uncertainty has the greatest impact on the decision problem. RPM has found practical applications in a variety of contexts ranging from the development of research agendas (Könnölä, Brummer, & Salo, 2007) to infrastructure asset management (Mild, Liesiö, & Salo, 2015).

By requiring dominance for all possible realizations of uncertain parameters, decision recommendations provided by RPM are by design explicitly conservative. Thus with extremely uncertain parameters, dominance relations fail to rule out a significant share of feasible portfolios, the number of which may grow exponentially with the number of project proposals. In such a situation detailed information on the decision makers’ preferences concerning the trade-offs among the attributes can be elicited using standard preference programming approaches (Salo & Punkka, 2005). However, if the projects’ score intervals are wide enough such information may not substantially reduce the number of non-dominated portfolios. Since the standard RPM framework offers no support for adjusting the level of conservatism of the dominance relations the only viable approach to more conclusive decision recommendations is to obtain more accurate information on these scores. Yet, in applications such information might not be available or it may be impossible to acquire with the available resources and time before a decision has to be made.

In this paper we combine RPM with the robust optimization concept by Bertsimas and Sim (2004) to allow adjustments to the level of conservatism used by the pairwise dominance relations. Specifically, we assume a limit for the number of project scores that can deviate from their most likely value when determining dominance relations between portfolios. By adjusting this deviation limit, decision makers are able to choose a desired level of conservatism. When no limits are imposed, our approach coincides with standard RPM, while strict limits cause our approach to omit deviations and compare portfolios based on their most likely scores.

As a result of this combination, this study offers several contributions to the existing methods for multi-attribute project portfolio selection under uncertainty. First, the paper extends the standard dominance relation of RPM to a model where score uncertainty is captured by a set of feasible score matrices that is not a Cartesian product of unidimensional intervals. Second, the paper develops approaches for establishing dominance between two portfolios as well as an exact algorithm based on dynamic programming for identifying non-dominated portfolios under this more general score uncertainty model. Third, the paper shows how these sets of feasible scores can be used to capture uncertain interdependencies among projects. Finally, the paper offers approaches to consider adjustable robustness not only with regards to project and portfolio scores but also with regards to constraint satisfaction.

After presenting the theoretical background in the following section, we introduce the proposed decision making framework in Section 3. Section 4 describes how RPM with adjustable robustness can be applied to support project portfolio selection and how decision makers can determine desired levels of robustness. Section 5 applies the developed framework to supply chain management in the semiconductor industry. Section 6 extends the framework and practical application to account for interdependencies among project scores and for modeling uncertain coefficients in portfolio feasibility constraints.

Robust modeling approaches aid decision makers in accounting for ambiguity and stochastic uncertainty of parameters to decision problems when detailed information on the nature of uncertainty, e.g., probability distributions, is not readily available (Bertsimas, Brown, & Caramanis, 2011). Both theoretical and practical contributions to the field are covered by the surveys of Bertsimas et al. (2011); Roy (2010), and Gabrel, Murat, and Thiele (2014). Bertsimas et al. (2011) particularly emphasize the issue of conservatism when dealing with robust modeling techniques. Kouvelis and Yu (1997) seek to find solutions that minimize the worst case performance within a set of all possible realizations of uncertain parameters. Such a realization where “everything is assumed to go wrong” is bound to be very unlikely in practice.

The robust modeling approach by Bertsimas and Sim (2003); 2004) explicitly addresses the problem of conservatism. The authors model uncertainty in linear and integer programming problems by allowing uncertain coefficients of constraints or the objective function to realize within an interval, symmetrically extending around the most likely value of the coefficient. By limiting the number of coefficients that may deviate from their most likely value, the authors allow decision makers to choose their desired level of robustness. Bertsimas and Sim (2004) investigate the trade-off between the probability of constraint violations and the most likely objective function value, termed the price of robustness. The authors furthermore consider “correlated” constraint coefficients, whose deviation from their most likely values is determined by the linear combination of a common set of factors subject to uncertainty. Perfectly correlated constraint coefficients depend on one common factor only, while uncorrelated coefficients are each determined by independent factors. In this modeling approach parameter Γ controls the number of factors permitted to take on their worst-case value rather than the constraint coefficients themselves.

Several studies apply the robust modeling technique by Bertsimas and Sim (2003, 2004) to portfolio selection problems. Kachani and Langella (2005) develop integer programming models for multi-period capital rationing and budgeting problems that are robust with regards to uncertain net present values of projects. Robustness with regards to objective function and constraint coefficients is considered. Düzgün and Thiele (2010) propose an integer programming model for the selection of research projects. Uncertain project cash-flows are allowed to fall into one of several value intervals. The number of parameters that may fall into each interval is chosen by the decision makers. The authors propose a robust heuristic procedure where projects are selected in order of decreasing cash-flows or cash-flow to cost ratios. Düzgün and Thiele (2012) compare the robust optimization approach to a stochastic programming model. Gregory, Darby-Dowman, and Mitra (2011) review robust optimization methods in financial portfolio selection and evaluate linear programming models for the robust selection of financial assets. The authors discuss model formulations that support uncorrelated as well as correlated uncertain returns. Different ways of deriving uncertainty sets from real life data, portfolio diversity, and tradeoffs between robustness and portfolio performance are evaluated using data on equity returns from the London stock exchange. Hassanzadeh, Nemati, and Sun (2014) consider project portfolio selection under multiple objectives and subject to constraints. Feasible portfolios Pareto optimal with regards to all objectives are generated by solving an augmented weighted Tchebycheff program (Steuer, 1986). The authors propose a robust mixed integer programming model that protects against uncertainty in objective function coefficients, i.e., project scores, as well as coefficients of selection constraints. The authors do not assume a priori information on decision maker preferences with regards to objectives but implicitly elicit these in an interactive procedure. A set of candidate portfolios is generated by solving the mixed integer programming model several times while randomly weighting different objective functions. Based on the decision makers’ selection from this set a new set of candidates is generated with random weights being more focused based on the decision makers’ choice. The procedure ends when decision makers are content with their portfolio choice or a fixed number of iterations have been performed.


                     Liesiö et al. (2007) develop Robust Portfolio Modeling to address project portfolio selection under uncertainty. Portfolio values are given by a linear-additive model (Golabi, Kirkwood, & Sicherman, 1981; Liesiö & Punkka, 2014) where projects are evaluated in terms of multiple attributes. Preference Programming techniques (Salo & Hämäläinen, 1995) account for uncertain project scores, bounded by value intervals, as well as uncertain attribute weights, bounded by decision makers’ preference statements. Parameters of selection constraints, e.g., budgetary restrictions or logical selection constraints, are assumed to be known with certainty. It is unlikely that there exists a portfolio that provides the highest overall value for all considered score realizations and attribute weights. RPM provides decision makers with a set of non-dominated portfolios, which each are not strictly inferior for all possible realizations to any other portfolio. The authors develop a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the set of non-dominated portfolios and propose an iterative process to reduce this set by acquiring additional preference and score information. They employ a metric termed core index to determine projects whose score information impacts dominances between portfolios. Liesiö, Mild, and Salo (2008) extend RPM to account for project interdependencies and uncertainty with regards to selection constraints. They consider interval-valued coefficients of a constraint that limits aggregate portfolio cost to a (variable) budget. Budgetary restrictions are required to hold for all possible cost realizations. The authors ensure portfolio cost-efficiency by including project cost as a weighted score attribute.

In this paper we relax the strictly conservative robustness paradigm of Liesiö et al. (2007); 2008) by employing the adjustable robustness model by Bertsimas and Sim (2003, 2004). Decision makers control the level of conservatism with regards to uncertain project scores and coefficients of selection constraints by choosing a suitable parameter Γ. While the related project portfolio selection approach by Hassanzadeh et al. (2014) implicitly elicits decision makers’ preferences through an interactive procedure, our approach, based on Robust Portfolio Modeling, separates preference elicitation from portfolio selection. Uncertain preference information, which may be elicited by different methods from preference programming (Salo & Hämäläinen, 1995), is taken into account when determining the complete set of non-dominated portfolios. The interactive RPM procedure furthermore provides decision makers with guidance in refining uncertain project scores.

Constraints typically considered in portfolio selection problems are budgetary restrictions, which limit the execution of costly projects, or logical constraints, which impose restrictions on the combined execution of multiple projects (Ghasemzadeh, Archer, & Iyogun, 1999; Stummer & Heidenberger, 2003). The set of project portfolios feasible in terms of all considered constraints is given by

Our model uses the Preference Programming approach to capture incomplete information on the importance of attributes (Danielson, Ekenberg, Idefeldt, & Larsson, 2007; Salo & Hämäläinen, 1992; Salo & Punkka, 2005; Sarabando & Dias, 2010; Weber, 1987). Preference statements are modeled as a set of feasible weights

Following the approach of budgeted robustness by Bertsimas and Sim (2003, 2004), we base portfolio decision making on a subset of the polytope

The degree by which scores may deviate from their most likely values is limited by parameter Γ. For 
                           
                              Γ

                         is considered, while 
                           
                              Γ
                              =

                         indicates that no deviation of scores from their most likely values is taken into account. Under the aspect of communicating the robustness concept to decision makers using statements as “up to Γ scores may deviate from their most likely value”, it makes sense to restrict Γ to integer values.


                        
                           
                              S

                              Γ
                           
                         constitutes a convex set. When considering integer Γ the extreme points of this set, essential to portfolio dominance in both the basic RPM setting and the adjustable approach proposed in this study, correspond to integer yji
                         values. However, extensions presented later will lead to score uncertainty sets whose extreme points do not necessarily correspond to integer valued yji
                        .

When considering uncertain preferences and scores, the overall value V(v, w, z) of a portfolio is uncertain as well. It is typically not possible to determine one portfolio z optimal for all combinations of w and v. However, it is often possible to use dominance relationships between portfolios to rule out strictly inferior solutions.

                        Theorem 3.1 shows that determining whether z dominates z′ or not can be established by solving a continuous knapsack problem (solvable in linear time, see e.g., Martello & Toth, 1990) in each extreme point of the convex hull of Sw
                        , denoted ext(conv(Sw
                        )). Standard methods for eliciting incomplete preference information lead to convex Sw

If a project is included in both portfolios z and z′, it has an equal contribution to the overall value of both portfolios for any realization of scores. Therefore, it is not relevant for establishing dominance. All proofs are included in the appendix.

The introduced notion of dominance has all analytical properties to establish theoretically sound preference orders between project portfolios as stated by the following lemma.

                           Lemma 3.1
                           ≻ is (i) asymmetric, (ii) irreflexive, and (iii) transitive.
                           

As Γ increases the dominance relations are established more conservatively. For 
                           
                              Γ
                              =
                              m
                              n
                           
                         dominance exists only if a portfolio has a higher overall value for any scores in their intervals. This case coincides with the standard RPM case. At the other extreme, 
                           
                              Γ
                              =
                              0
                           
                         implies that dominance exists whenever a portfolio has a higher overall value for most likely scores than another portfolio for all feasible weights.

                         for any desired robustness level Γ by Theorem 3.2. Another possible approach is to employ the dominance check of Theorem 3.1 within the dynamic programming algorithm (for details see Appendix A). Since dominance relations are less conservative, the computation can be faster, but use of this approach requires that decision makers have fixed their desired (maximum) deviation limit Γ a priori. If on the other hand the decision makers wish to choose a deviation limit Γ ∈ [0, mn] ex post or examine how the set of non-dominated portfolios depends on the value of parameter Γ, the former approach is preferable. Independent of the level of robustness considered, the dynamic programming algorithm of Liesiö et al. (2008) has exponential runtime in the worst case.

The developed framework serves as a basis for an interactive procedure that aids decision makers in choosing a project portfolio. Based on initial specifications of uncertain attribute weights and project scores

Projects with a core index of zero, included in none of the non-dominated portfolios, as well as projects with a core index of one, included in all non-dominated portfolios, do not aid in reducing the set of non-dominated portfolios. When reducing the information set of scores for any project j with core index

                      additional dominance relations may arise causing portfolios to fall out of the set of non-dominated portfolios. The following lemma formalizes this result.

By Theorem 3.2 the set of non-dominated portfolios can also be reduced by lowering deviation limit Γ causing dominance relations to be determined less conservatively. A tradeoff arises between precise coverage of the information set and the size of the set of non-dominated portfolios. In order to aid decision makers in interpreting the robustness parameter Γ, we provide information on the fraction of the information set

Despite its theoretical appeal, the uniform distribution may not always be the best distribution class to capture uncertain deviation of project scores. In general one would expect that the probability distribution is concentrated close to the most likely score (
                        
                           
                              η
                              
                                 j
                                 i
                              
                           
                           =
                           0
                        
                     ) and that small deviations are more likely than larger ones. Possibly the simplest distribution to have this property is the triangular distribution with a zero mean and support 
                        
                           [
                           −
                           1
                           ,
                           1
                           ]
                        
                     . Indeed, the triangular distribution has been employed to capture uncertainty about project completion times in the well established project evaluation and review technique (PERT, see, e.g., Hahn, 2008).

Yet, both the the uniform and triangular distribution are inflexible in the sense that specifying the support and the expectation lead to an exact specification of the whole distribution which does not leave any parameters free to adjust for instance the magnitude of the deviations. A normal distribution with a zero mean would be supported by arguments related to the law of large numbers. For instance, the estimate of a project’s financial performance can be considered to be effected by several independently distributed random errors which would give rise to an approximately normally distributed financial value. However, the 
                        
                           [
                           −
                           1
                           ,
                           1
                           ]
                        
                      domain of each ηji
                      requires the use of truncated normal distribution, i.e., a normal distribution scaled so that the entire probability mass lies on the interval 
                        
                           [
                           −
                           1
                           ,
                           1
                           ]
                        
                      (Mo, Xie, & Levitin, 2015). The Beta distribution, on the other hand, has a built-in finite support and specifying the expectation still leaves one parameter free to adjust the deviation. Beta distributions too have been applied in multi-attribute decision making (Hinloopen, Nijkamp, & Rietveld, 2004).

Choosing the appropriate probability distributions for ηji
                      is not a trivial task and the appropriate distribution can depend on the specific application or even the types of attributes used within the application. As a general guideline one could propose the truncated normal distribution whose use can be based on arguments that build on the law of large numbers as discussed above. However, some applications of Portfolio Decision Analysis deal with supporting repeated project selection in which large parts of the model remain intact over several decision points although the project candidates change (Mild et al., 2015). In such an application inspection of historical data on project scores can give some insight into appropriate distributional assumptions. In case distribution assumptions cannot be based on historical data it is possible to to harness techniques for assessing subjective probability distributions (Clemen, 1996) although such an approach could be quite time-consuming. Yet, it is important to highlight that the goal of specifying any distributions is to give the decision maker additional insights to the interpretation of the robustness parameter Γ. This goal can perhaps be better achieved by presenting multiple values of 
                        
                           P
                           (
                           
                              v
                              ˜
                           
                           ∈
                           
                              S
                              v
                              Γ
                           
                           )
                        
                      implied by different distributional assumptions, rather than requiring the decision maker to invest extensive effort in assessing a single distribution.

We illustrate the developed framework with an example based on a real life project portfolio selection problem at an international semiconductor manufacturer, where initiatives are chosen to improve supply chain performance (Kolisch, Brunner, & Fliedner, 2012). While the project and portfolio value model as well as the decision making constraints are derived from practice, the specific project scores and constraints have been adapted to illustrate the concept of RPM with adjustable robustness.

Therefore, attributes are aggregated using monetization rates, which capture decision makers’ incomplete preferences regarding immediate or future cash-flows. These rates are modeled by the set of feasible weights

Portfolio value is additive across projects up to synergies, which account for beneficial effects resulting from the joint execution of related projects (Santhanam & Kyparisis, 1996). When choosing both projects P9 and P27, their overall value increases by 20 percent as synergy S1. When choosing projects P20 and P27, synergy S2 amounts to 30 percent. For projects P11 and P31, synergy S3 is 25 percent. Synergies are modeled through additional, artificial projects S1, S2, and S3, whose values amount to the proposed synergetic effects. Logical constraints ensure that these artificial projects can be selected only if the projects producing the synergy effect are also selected (Liesiö et al., 2008). Furthermore, there are 13 projects whose selection requires that some other specific projects have been included in the portfolio (cf. last column in Table 1), which results in 13 additional logical constraints. Finally, the aggregate cost of executed projects may not exceed a given budget level of 50 monetary units (

                         for Γ ≥ 21.

Portfolios non-dominated for Γ ≥ 21 are composed of 34–55 projects (41 on average). Pairs of portfolios differ by between 2 and 23 projects (7 on average). When comparing portfolios in terms of dominance, deviations of up to Γ project scores whose most likely realization is larger than zero are taken into account. If Γ is increased beyond the number of project scores with most likely realizations greater than zero, dominance relationships between portfolios no longer change. Therefore, the set of non-dominated portfolios obtains its maximum size for roughly two thirds of the value range of Γ.

Decision makers will likely find the set of 562 non-dominated portfolios for the highest level of robustness too large to derive decisional guidance for final portfolio selection. They will seek to reduce the set of non-dominated portfolios either by providing revised project scores

                        . High sensitivity of probability values to the assumed probability distribution shows that decision makers wishing to employ probability bounds must make a cautious design choice. The Markov bound is shown to give a rough indication of the probabilities and should therefore be primarily considered when the closed formulation for uniform distributions is not applicable and Monte Carlo simulation is not an option due to computational limitations.

We present two extensions of the basic decision making framework to accommodate two aspects common to practical decision making environments, interdependencies of uncertain project scores, and uncertainty with regards to constraint coefficients.

The decision making framework developed in Section 3 assumes that the project score deviations are independent in the sense that each deviation can take any values within the range 
                           
                              [
                              −
                              1
                              ,
                              1
                              ]
                           
                         as long as the total deviation does not exceed Γ . However, often in applications project proposals within the same organization share technological or organizational properties that cause their scores to manifest jointly within their specified value ranges (Gregory et al., 2011; Hall, 2012; Loch & Kavadias, 2002). Furthermore, decision makers may wish to ensure balanced distribution of conservatism across the attributes by limiting the number of scores allowed to deviate in each attribute thus effectively violating the assumption of independent score deviations.

These interdependencies can be modeled in the developed framework by enforcing additional linear constraints on the uncertainty set for project scores. For instance, an exogenous source of uncertainty that causes the scores of all projects to deviate jointly with regards to attribute i can be captured by introducing linear constraints

                         for all j, j′ ∈ {1,…, m}. In turn, scores in different attributes for project j can be modeled to deviate jointly by introducing the constrains

Not only decision maker preferences and project scores may be subject to uncertainty but also decision making constraints. Previous project portfolio selection approaches have considered uncertainty with regards to project cost (Gutjahr & Froeschl, 2013; Liesiö et al., 2008), available budget (Li, 2009), and the achievement of aspiration levels for overall portfolio value with regards to different attributes (Hall, Long, Qi, & Sim, 2009).

Uncertain coefficients in constraints, which determine the set of feasible portfolios ZF
                        , are modeled in line with Bertsimas and Sim (2003, 2004). Constraint coefficients are given by a matrix

                         remain valid as presented in Fig. 5 with a maximum size of 409. For higher levels of constraint robustness, the maximum size of the set of non-dominated portfolios changes in a non-monotonous fashion with increasing constraint robustness. For Γ ≥ 32 the set of non-dominated portfolios remains unchanged with a maximum size of 27.

In this paper we have developed new methods for modeling uncertainty in multi-attribute project portfolio selection problems. Specifically, the developed methods allow the decision makers to control the level of conservatism employed in determining dominance relations among portfolios. Judgments can be based on most likely scores only or they can be made in line with Liesiö et al. (2007, 2008), where scores can assume any value within their intervals. We also showed how these methods can be used to model interdependencies among the possible realizations of projects’ scores and capture uncertainties in coefficients of portfolio feasibility constraints. The developed methods can be used for interactive decision support. Decision makers can reduce the set of non-dominated portfolios by reducing potential score deviations through more precise preference statements about the importance of different attributes and by adjusting the level of conservatism.

Our work suggests ample opportunities for future research. For instance, Poss (2013, 2014) argues that the parameter measuring the level of conservatism should actually depend on the solution whose robustness is analyzed to ensure the same fixed probability of constraint feasibility or reaching aspiration levels for all solutions. The dominance concept proposed in this paper could be extended to facilitate solution dependent conservatism when comparing project portfolios with varying numbers of unique projects. Secondly, project core indexes aid decision makers in revising uncertain project scores by identifying borderline projects, for which more precise score information can reduce the number of non-dominated portfolios. However, additional research is needed to develop methods for identifying those scores that are likely to have the greatest impact on the set of non-dominated portfolios. Finally, the developed models should be extensively evaluated in terms of their application in practical decision making settings in areas such as project portfolio selection (Heidenberger & Stummer, 1999), new product development (Loch & Kavadias, 2002), and supplier selection (Ho, Xu, & Dey, 2010). Successful repeated application of these models would benefit from implementing them as user friendly decision support software that can be used together with decision makers.

                     where es
                      is a unit vector with the element s equal to one and the rest of the elements equal to zero. At each iteration stage 
                        
                           s
                           =
                           0

                           .
                           ,
                           m
                           ,
                        
                      portfolios in set Zs
                      only contain projects from the set {1,…, s}. Furthermore, at the final stage the set Zm
                      is equal to the set of all possible portfolios z ∈ {0, 1}
                        m
                     .

To avoid enumerating all possible portfolios, we deploy three techniques that at each iteration identify and discard portfolios that cannot become non-dominated if projects from the set 
                        
                           {
                           s
                           +
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           m
                           }
                        
                      are added to them. Discarding portfolio z from the set Zs
                      implies that any portfolio that is obtained by adding some projects from the set 
                        
                           {
                           s
                           +
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           m
                           }
                        
                      to portfolio z is not included in any of the pursuant sets 
                        
                           
                              Z
                              
                                 s
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                           
                           ,
                           ⋯
                           ,
                           
                              Z
                              m
                           
                        
                     .

The first of these techniques is based on the fact that a non-dominated portfolio must be feasible; Hence, an infeasible portfolio in Zs
                      which cannot become feasible by including some projects from the set 
                        
                           {
                           s
                           +
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           m
                           }
                        
                      can be discarded. A sufficient condition for discarding z ∈ Zs
                      is that the inequality

The second technique is based on pairwise comparison of portfolios in Zs
                      to identify if a portfolio is dominated by another portfolio that also has more slack in the feasibility constraints. Such as portfolio can then be safely discarded as stated by the following lemma.

The final technique requires that some feasible portfolios with a high value are available before the start of the iteration scheme (A.1). These reference portfolios then serve as a benchmark for how much added value including projects from the set 
                        
                           {
                           s

                      must produce for the resulting portfolio to be non-dominated. This condition is formalized in the following lemma.

In principle, it is possible to solve the exact optimum of the mixed integer linear programming problem in Lemma Appendix A.2 instead of relying on an upper bound for the optimum. Although the exact solution would allow to discard more portfolios at each iteration stage, an upper bound can be obtained with significantly less computational effort by solving either the linear programming relaxation or Lagrangian dual of the mixed integer linear programming problem (Bertsimas & Tsitsiklis, 1997).

                           In a harmless abuse of notation, we use the quantifier ∃ to compactly indicate that relationships preceding the symbol are true for some members of the set following the quantifier. Transitivity, z ≻ z′ ∧ z′ ≻ z′′ ⇒ z ≻ z′′, can be shown by considering Theorem 3.1 for z ≻
