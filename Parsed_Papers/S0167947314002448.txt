                  A Gini-based statistical test for a unit root is suggested. This test is based on the well-known Dickey–Fuller test, where the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is replaced by the semi-parametric Gini regression in modeling the AR process. A residual-based bootstrap is used to find critical values. The Gini methodology is a rank-based methodology that takes into account both the variate values and the ranks. Therefore, it provides robust estimators that are rank-based, while avoiding loss of information. Furthermore, the Gini methodology relies on first-order moment assumptions, which validates its use for a wide range of distributions. Simulation results validate the Gini-based test and indicate its superiority in some design settings in comparison to other available procedures. The Gini-based test opens the door for further developments such as a Gini-based cointegration test.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In most of the literature dealing with time series analysis, underlying dependencies of the time series are modeled based on variance and covariance as measures of variability and association, respectively. This research develops a unit root test that is based on the Gini Mean Difference (hereafter GMD) as an alternative index of variability. The GMD index shares many properties of the variance, but the former can be more appropriate for distributions that depart from normality or symmetry. This measure is less sensitive to extreme observations than the variance because it takes into account both the values of the random variable and its ranks. In addition, the GMD is defined solely under first-order moment assumptions. To clarify the notations, we distinguish between population parameters and estimators by using upper-case letters in the population version and lower-case letters in the sample version.

We refer to a first-order univariate autoregression, denoted by AR(1), which satisfies

The main objective of the DF test is to determine whether

                         is the least squares estimator.

Extensive attempts to improve this test and to find alternative or superior tests followed. Leybourne (1995) suggested using the maximum of DF 
                           t
                        -statistics based on applying the OLS regressions twice, looking both forward and backward at the series. The critical values for the test are obtained in a manner similar to that performed in the original DF test discussed above using Monte-Carlo simulation. Elliott et al. (1996) and Ng and Perron (2001) suggested a class of unit root tests that are based on generalized least squares detrending of the series and then applying the DF test on the detrended data.

An important development in unit root tests includes the use of resampling methods for calculating critical values; see, for example, a survey of such methods in Palm et al. (2008). A first residual-based bootstrap version of the DF test was proposed by Ferretti and Romo (1996). Later, Moreno and Romo (2000) used a bootstrap procedure based on the LAD estimator, and more recently, Moreno and Romo (2012) suggested a family of unit root bootstrap tests for the infinite variance case.

Another important development appears in Muller and Elliott (2003), who revealed that the initial condition 
                           
                              (

                              )
                           
                         has a non-negligible influence on the finite sample performances of unit root tests. In general, it is difficult to rule out, a priori, the existence of small or large values of

                        . Elliott and Müller (2006) suggest statistics whose power is less sensitive to the size of

                        . Harvey and Leybourne (2005) and Harvey et al. (2009) recommend a union of test rejection decision rules to improve the performances of the statistical procedure.


                        Hallin et al. (2011) propose a class of distribution-free rank-based tests for the null hypothesis of a unit root that takes into account several initial values for the series. They use three test statistics that are based on a choice of a reference density function, which need not be the unknown actual density of the innovations. The first test statistic is based on the Gaussian reference density and is defined as

                        . These three test statistics are denoted here as HAW-vdW, HAW-Laplace and HAW-Wilcoxon, respectively. Asymptotic results and simulated quantiles for these statistics for several sample sizes are given in Hallin et al. (2011). The results for finite samples indicate that for a broad range of non-zero initial values and for a variety of heavy-tailed innovation densities, the suggested rank-based tests outperform a variety of unit root tests.

Rank-based tests, which intrinsically involve some loss of information of the real values, are expected to perform well under heavy-tailed distributions. In this paper, we propose a Gini-based unit root test that relies on both the real values and the ranks, while avoiding loss of information.

The GMD is an alternative index of variability that is used in this research instead of the variance. The most prevalent presentation of the GMD index is the expected absolute difference between two independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) variables

The GMD index shares many properties of the variance, but the former can be more informative for distributions that depart from normality or symmetry. Both measures are based on weighted averages of the distances between each pair of i.i.d. variables. The fundamental difference is the method used to measure the distance. The GMD distance function is referred to as the “city block” distance, which allows one to move only in the vertical and horizontal directions. The variance distance function is Euclidean, which allows one to move in any desired direction.

As mentioned, the GMD takes into account both the values of the random variable and its ranks, and hence, it is less sensitive to extreme observations than the variance. In addition, because Gini requires only first-order moment assumptions (Stuart and Ord, 1987), the GMD-based method is valid for a wide range of distributions and might be more appropriate for heavy-tailed distributions than variance-based methods. For the properties of the Gini covariance, see Schechtman and Yitzhaki (1987, 1999); Serfling and Xiao (2007); Yitzhaki (2003); Yitzhaki and Schechtman (2013).

In this research we use the semi-parametric Gini regression method for AR(1) modeling. The semi-parametric Gini regression is a GMD-based regression method that relies on substituting the variance-based expressions in the OLS regression by the equivalent GMD terms (Olkin and Yitzhaki, 1992). Because it is based on imitation of the OLS formulas, this method enables the replication of some of its concepts. This type of Gini regression coefficient can be referred to as “covariance-based” because it is based on the properties of the covariance. It is semi-parametric because it does not require a specification of the functional form of the model. The regression coefficient can be expressed as a weighted average of slopes defined between each pair of adjacent observations of the explanatory variable (Yitzhaki, 1996).

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section  2 presents a Gini-based framework for modeling AR(1). Section  3 develops the Gini-based unit root test. Section  4 presents the finite sample performances of the suggested test and a detailed comparison to various existing unit root tests. Section  5 presents and discusses the conclusions.

In this research we apply the semi-parametric Gini regression for AR(1) modeling. Using this method leads to two possible (Gini) regression coefficients, looking forward and backward at the series (to be defined below). In this case, beyond the applicability of the procedure under merely the first moment of the process, it offers additional information by comparing the resulting two coefficients. As such, it enables us to examine whether looking forward and backward at the series provides similar results.

Generally, in the existing methodology two AR(1) regression coefficients are available, looking backward and forward at the series (Box and Jenkins, 1976). Using OLS, they are

A comparison between them is informative in the context of examining whether looking forward and backward at the series gives similar results or whether time is reversible. This issue is treated thoroughly in Shelef and Schechtman (2011) and in Shelef (2013). It is possible to develop a test statistic for a unit root that combines the information from both the backward and forward Gini regression coefficients. Intuitively, as such a combined test is based on the additional measure

                      is the Gini regression coefficient when looking forward in time, and therefore, it is less informative in the context of estimating the coefficient of the AR(1) model, which is generated backwards.

A weak/covariance stationary process is defined as a process in which the mean, variance and autocovariances are unaffected by a change of the time origin. Using the Gini covariance, this definition can be extended to define a process in which the mean, GMD and Gini autocovariances are time-independent (are unaffected by a change of the time origin).

In this section, we propose the Gini-based unit root test. The test is similar to the residual-based bootstrap test proposed by Ferretti and Romo (1996), but we replace the OLS regression with the Gini regression when estimating the AR(1) coefficient. The critical values for the test are found specifically for each user’s sample using a bootstrap procedure. The bootstrap relies on resampling the unrestricted residuals, that is, without imposing the null hypothesis (following the results in  Paparoditis and Politis, 2005). As mentioned, the initial condition can substantially influence the power properties of unit root tests in practice. Consequently, we examine the sensitivity to initial values, following Elliott and Müller (2006) and other recent papers (see, for example, Harvey et al., 2009; Hallin et al., 2011), taking into account several initial values. The suggested Gini methodology is a rank-based estimation that takes into account both the variate values and the ranks. Therefore, it combines the robustness of rank-based estimation with the sensitivity to the variate values, avoiding the loss of information that occurs in purely rank-based tests.

                        ), which resembles the test statistic suggested by Leybourne (1995). However, these alternative test statistics achieve relatively inferior finite sample performances for most design settings. Therefore, they are not presented here (although results are available in  Shelef, 2013).

The bootstrap procedure for finding the critical values for the Gini-based test statistic specified above follows Li and Maddala’s (1996) guidelines for bootstrapping unit root tests and is similar to the procedure described in Ferretti and Romo (1996). The procedure addresses whether the sample comes from a stationary process based on critical values that were calculated specifically for the sample (without knowing in advance whether the sample comes from a stationary process and without assuming a specific distribution of innovations). In the first step, we use the original sample of

To examine the empirical power of the Gini-based test statistic, we use the bootstrap-based method as suggested in Section  4.1 for examining the empirical levels. The bootstrap resampling procedure is used because it is designed to reflect the null hypothesis, even though we do not know in advance whether the data at hand originate from a hypothesis that is close to or far from the null hypothesis. In other words, by using this procedure we estimate the distribution of the test statistic under 
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                        , even when the original sample was drawn from a population that fails to satisfy 
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                        . In our case, the bootstrapped series follow the unit root AR(1) model (Eq. (16)). Therefore, the critical values obtained by the bootstrap resampling procedure mimic as much as possible the true critical values under 
                           
                              
                                 H

                        . In this approach, when the data set comes from

                        , the proportion of rejections serves as an approximation of the power of the suggested bootstrap procedure (as defined in  Davidson and MacKinnon, 2006). As such, we are able to estimate the rejection probabilities of the suggested test statistic under

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper develops a Gini-based unit root test that relies on the semi-parametric Gini regression to estimate the coefficient of the AR(1) model and on the residuals bootstrap to find critical values for the test. The performances of the Gini-based stationarity test are examined for Normal, Laplace, Skew-normal and Cauchy distributions, which represent a variety of symmetric and asymmetric distributions, both with and without heavy tails.

When comparing the Gini-based test to other existing tests, the Gini-based test statistic does not have an advantage when 
                        
                           
                              Y

                      (compared to  Ng and Perron, 2001) or when the innovations are drawn from the Cauchy distribution (compared to  Hallin et al., 2011). For 
                        
                           
                              Y

                     , however, the Gini regression coefficient has much larger power in most design settings. A possible explanation is that the Gini-based autoregression method takes into account both the ranks and the real values of the observations, whereas rank-based methods omit the real values. Thus, the tests suggested by Hallin et al. (2011), which take into account only the ranks, have larger power for the very heavy-tailed Cauchy distribution. On the other hand, the Gini-based test statistic, which takes into account not only the ranks, has larger power for distributions that are less heavy-tailed, including Normal and Laplace (symmetric) and Skew-normal (asymmetric) distributions.

Future research should broaden the Gini-based framework to test for cointegration of nonstationary time series based on the Gini regression coefficients and on the bootstrap to find critical values.
