                  Objective
                  Coronary stenting is one of the most commonly used approaches to open coronary arteries blocked due to atherosclerosis. However, stent struts can induce stent thrombosis due to altered hemodynamics and endothelial dysfunction, and the microscopic process is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the microscale processes during the initiation of stent thrombosis.
               
               
                  Methods
                  We utilized a discrete element computational model to simulate the transport, collision, adhesion, and activation of thousands of individual platelets and red blood cells in thrombus formation around struts and dysfunctional endothelium.
               
               
                  Results
                  As strut height increased, the area of endothelium activated by low shear stress increased, which increased the number of platelets in mural thrombi. These thrombi were generally outside regions of recirculation for shorter struts. For the tallest strut, wall shear stress was sufficiently low to activate the entire endothelium. With the entire endothelium activated by injury or denudation, the number of platelets in mural thrombi was largest for the shortest strut. The type of platelet activation (by high shear stress or contact with activated endothelium) did not greatly affect results.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  During the initiation of stent thrombosis, platelets do not necessarily enter recirculation regions or deposit on endothelium near struts, as suggested by previous computational fluid dynamics simulations. Rather, platelets are more likely to deposit on activated endothelium outside recirculation regions and deposit directly on struts. Our study elucidated the effects of different mechanical factors on the roles of platelets and endothelium in stent thrombosis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Coronary stenting is one of the most commonly used approaches to open coronary arteries blocked due to atherosclerosis, but stent failure continues to occur in 10–20% of patients, though significant progress has been made over the last decade [1–3]. Stent thrombosis is a leading cause of stent failure, which can be fatal [4]. It is important to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of stent thrombosis.

Stent thrombosis can occur both acutely after stenting and later after over a year. Acute thrombosis has been attributed to platelet activation, endothelium injury, and inadequate antiplatelet therapy [5–7], while late thrombosis has been attributed to platelet activation, inhibited re-endothelialization, and endothelial expression of prothrombotic factors [5,8,9]. In either case, altered hemodynamics caused by stent struts, which protrude into the vessel lumen, plays an important role. Low wall shear stress on the proximal and distal sides of struts promotes endothelial expression of prothrombotic factors and inhibits endothelial cell proliferation, hindering re-endothelialization [8]. High wall shear stress along the tops of struts may activate platelets and cause red blood cells (RBCs) to release adenosine diphosphate, which can also activate platelets [8,10]. The size of struts directly affects blood flow and wall shear stress and thus affects thrombosis. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that thicker struts were more thrombogenic than thinner struts, likely due to larger flow disturbances with thicker struts [11]. On the other hand, stent-induced mechanical injury of the endothelium is widely accepted as another mechanism that leads to stent thrombosis [6,7]. Inhibited re-endothelialization, due to penetration of struts into the necrotic core of atherosclerotic plaque [9] or due to anti-proliferative drugs imparted by drug-eluting stents that aim to prevent in-stent restenosis (re-narrowing of the vessel), has also been linked to stent thrombosis [5]. It is important to determine how hemodynamic changes and endothelium dysfunction and denudation affect the microscopic process of thrombosis.

Platelets are the main cellular components of arterial thrombi. Platelets become activated under thrombogenic conditions in order to adhere to the endothelial wall and aggregate with each other. Adhesion and aggregation occur through glycoproteins that are embedded in the platelet surface membrane, various proteins in plasma, and networks of fibrin [12]. High shear stresses, along with chemical agonists, induce platelet activation [12]. Activated platelets activate additional platelets by releasing and catalyzing platelet agonists [12]. Platelet activation, platelet–endothelium adhesion, and platelet–platelet aggregation under prothrombotic environments induced by stents are key events in thrombus formation. Therefore, it is important to delineate the microscopic process of these interactions in order to understand the mechanism of stent thrombosis.

To better understand the microscopic mechanism, a few studies have used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations (which did not include platelets) to determine the flow field and shear stress around struts to infer the activation and deposition of platelets in thrombus formation. Duraiswamy et al. [13] tested the deposition of previously-activated platelets onto two-dimensional (2D) configurations of struts using in vitro experiments and compared results with CFD simulations without platelets. They found that in vitro platelet deposition was higher in regions in which CFD flow was directed toward the wall, and lower where CFD flow was directed away from the wall [13]. In a purely CFD study, Jimenez and Davies [10] demonstrated that struts produced high shear stress on top of the strut and low shear stress along the wall adjacent to the strut, as well as produced recirculation regions. Thrombosis was predicted to occur on the endothelium in the recirculation regions on either side of the strut [10]. However, it is necessary to directly (rather than inferentially) determine how strut-induced changes in flow and shear stress affect the activation, adhesion, and aggregation of platelets. In addition, the contributions of vessel injury and inhibited re-endothelialization caused by struts need to be incorporated into computational models of stent thrombosis. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to determine the microscale processes and platelet-level mechanisms by which stents initiate thrombosis.

@&#METHODS@&#

The transport, collision, activation, adhesion, and aggregation processes of thousands of individual platelets and RBCs were numerically simulated near stent struts in coronary arteries by a mesoscale, discrete element method for adhesive blood cells. In this section, the computational simulation conditions are described first, followed by descriptions of the employed activation models for platelets and the endothelium. Details of the discrete element method have been previously published [14–16], and a brief description is provided in the Appendix.

Segments of stented coronary arteries with six struts were modeled as 2D channels (
                           Fig. 1, 
                           Table 1). Strut heights were varied for different simulations as 50, 100, or 200µm, referred to as short, intermediate, and tall, respectively. Strut heights of commercially available stents generally range from 50 to 140µm [2,10,11,17,18], with most heights being closer to the intermediate height (100µm) in the current simulations. Table 1 gives conditions of simulations, which were performed for Newtonian, incompressible, steady, fully developed, 2D flow in the x–y plane. A second-order finite-volume method [19] with the PISO algorithm [20] was used to solve the Navier–Stokes equations of fluid flow in the absence of blood cells. The implication of this one-way coupling is discussed later in this section.

A mesh sensitivity study was performed with the strut height that had the greatest effect on the flow, which was the maximum height utilized (200µm). Three structured meshes of different resolutions were tested (coarse, medium, and fine), as listed in 
                           Table 2. The meshes were constructed manually with a higher concentration of nodes near struts and endothelial walls. Profiles of fluid velocity components at four different locations were compared between meshes (
                           Fig. 2a). For both the coarse and medium meshes compared with the next finer mesh, the maximum error occurred for the y-component of velocity at 0.2mm above the downstream edge of the first strut (y=0.4mm) (Fig. 2b). The maximum errors were 2.1% and 3.6% for the coarse and medium meshes, respectively. Thus, the medium mesh was used for all simulations of stented coronary arteries.

Thrombus formation near the first strut closest to the inlet was examined. For computational efficiency, a local computational domain near the first strut (Fig. 1b) was used for the simulation of platelet and RBC interactions. Some clinical observations have shown thrombosis in the proximal segment of the stent [21,22]. We chose the first strut for this reason and also because the first strut disturbed the flow more than each of the other five struts (for the tall and intermediate heights), having a longer downstream recirculation length. Platelets and RBCs were modeled as 3D spheres for computational efficiency, similar to previous computational studies of thrombus formation that utilized spheres or circles [23–25]. This approximation was expected to have a small effect on the relative results between different strut sizes. Although unactivated platelets are discoid, activated platelets are spheroidal [26]. Hence, the approximation of spherical platelets was justified because this work focused on thrombus formation with activated platelets. Even though RBCs are deformable with non-spherical shapes under flow, RBCs in the current work were still expected to collide with platelets to force them toward the wall and strut surface. Centroids of 3D spherical cells remained the x–y plane in the 2D flow because forces on cells in the z-direction (spanwise direction) were zero, and the only non-zero torques on cells were in the z-direction. The volume of each cell was set to the physiological value in humans (see Table 1).

Cells entered the artery at the inlet with an initial velocity equal to the local fluid velocity at the location of the cell centroid. Platelets were initially unactivated upon entering the artery. Activated platelets could aggregate with each other and adhere to struts and activated endothelium, and RBCs could aggregate with each other without requiring activation. A platelet and an RBC could not aggregate with each other, and RBCs could not adhere to struts or the endothelium. Initial positions of platelet centroids at the inlet were within 15µm of the wall, without platelets touching the wall. Initial positions of RBC centroids were within the region that was greater than 15µm from the wall. These initial positions assumed that platelet and RBC distributions at the inlet were those expected in a straight artery. After the initial location of a cell was set, the cell was subjected to no further restrictions on its location.

For computational efficiency, the fluid flow and cell motion were one-way coupled such that the fluid flow affected cell motion and cell motion did not affect fluid flow. In arteries, whole blood can be considered to be a single-phase, Newtonian fluid with an apparent viscosity that is mainly due to the presence of RBCs [27,28]. The viscosity of plasma is ~1.2cP, while the higher apparent viscosity of whole blood is ~3.5cP. Hence, to account for the macroscale effect of RBCs on the fluid flow, the fluid flow was solved with the apparent viscosity of whole blood using CFD without cells. Due to the low volume fraction of platelets (0.2%), the effects of platelets, aggregates, and thrombi on the fluid flow were neglected. This assumption is reasonable since the focus of this work was the initial formation of thrombus, rather than later possible occlusion by thrombi. To capture fluid effects between nearby cells, a model was incorporated that accounted for increased drag force on a cell due to increased apparent viscosity from cell crowding in the vicinity of the cell [29].

A measure of thrombosis, number of platelet-wall contacts, was defined as the number of platelets in contact with the endothelium at a specific time. Other measures at a specific time were the number of platelets in thrombi and the number of platelets in emboli. An aggregate was defined as a group of two or more platelets in contact with each other. A platelet was considered to be part of a thrombus if the platelet was in contact with the endothelium or strut or if the platelet was part of an aggregate that was in contact with the endothelium or strut. A thrombus in contact with the endothelium was referred to as a mural thrombus. An embolus was defined as an aggregate that was not in contact with the endothelium or strut.

Simulations were run to a final time (t
                           
                              f
                           =1.58s) at which the number of platelets in mural thrombi reached a state of statistical equilibrium for intermediate strut cases with uninjured, non-denuded endothelium. Each simulation was performed as a serial (non-parallel) program on a 3.0GHz node having either four or eight processing cores, with 2GB of RAM per core. Simulations were run simultaneously on these processing cores. CPU times were approximately 30–40 days per simulation.

To validate the computational model, a simulation with five struts was preformed as closely as possible to a previous in vitro study that measured platelet deposition between struts in a 2D configuration using human whole blood in a parallel plate flow chamber (Table 1) [13]. The mesh on which the fluid flow field was solved was similar to the medium mesh utilized for stented coronary artery simulations described earlier. In the previous experiment [13], platelets readily adhered to the stainless steel stent configuration. Hence, our simulations assumed platelets were pre-activated upon entering the flow and could adhere to struts and the stented wall. The previous experiment reported the platelet deposition between the first and second struts combined with that between the third and fourth struts [13]. For computational efficiency, we simulated and measured platelet deposition on the wall between the first and second struts.

Our shear-induced platelet activation model, as developed and applied in [16,30,31], assumed that a platelet became activated if it experienced a shear stress above a critical shear stress (τ
                        
                           crit
                        ). This model was in agreement with in vivo and in vitro observations of shear-induced platelet activation and aggregation that occurred within milliseconds [12,32,33]. Critical shear stress was defined as τ
                        
                           crit
                        
                        =f|τ
                        
                           w
                        ,0| where f is a scaling factor greater than unity, and τ
                        
                           w
                        ,0=2.66Pa (26.6dynecm−2) is the physiological wall shear stress in an unstented coronary artery that corresponds to the simulation conditions. A critical shear rate of 1500s−1 was assumed, which gave τ
                        
                           crit
                        =52.5dynecm−2 and f=1.97. This model ensured that a platelet could not become activated by experiencing physiological shear stress, irrespective of the amount of time the platelet was subjected to physiological shear stress. As well, this model clearly indicated the point at which an individual platelet became activated. These two attributes of our activation model are not necessarily apparent in other existing models that also account for time of exposure to shear stress (e.g., [34–36]).

To account for the presence of chemical agonists released by activated platelets, the model assumed a platelet became activated if it contacted another activated platelet, similar to [25]. In specified simulation cases, a platelet was also assumed to become activated if it contacted activated endothelium (endothelium-induced platelet activation model). Only activated platelets were subjected to adhesion and aggregation, and activation was considered irreversible.

We assumed that activated platelets were subjected to adhesion only with those segments of endothelium that were activated. In some simulation cases, the entire endothelium was assumed to be activated (pre-activated) due to events such as injury during stent implantation or denudation by drug-eluting stents. In other simulation cases, we employed a model of shear-induced endothelium activation in which only specific locations of the endothelium were assumed to be activated due to dysfunction from low wall shear stress. To indicate endothelial dysfunction, Longest and Kleinstreuer [37] proposed a surface reactivity factor (SR) given by SR=τ
                        
                           w,mean
                        /τ
                        
                           local
                        , where τ
                        
                           w,mean
                         is mean wall shear stress of the vessel, and τ
                        
                           local
                         is local time averaged wall shear stress. The authors did not model endothelium dysfunction per se but noted that a constant value of SR greater than unity could be used to approximate platelet adhesion to a surface. Hence, we assumed that the endothelium was dysfunctional and activated at a specific location if the local SR was greater than a critical value of SR
                        
                           crit
                        =2. Thus, with τ
                        
                           w,mean
                        =τ
                        
                           w,0=26.6dynecm−2, segments of endothelium that were subjected to shear stresses less than 13.3dynecm−2 were considered to be activated, while remaining segments were not.

Simulations employed five different combinations of types of activation of platelets and endothelium, called Activation Types as listed in 
                        Table 3. Activation Type A employed shear-induced platelet activation, shear-induced endothelium activation, and endothelium-induced platelet activation. Activation Type A represented expected activation behaviors in the presence of intact (non-denuded, non-injured) endothelium. To determine the effect of type of platelet activation with intact endothelium, Activation Types B and C virtually excluded each type of platelet activation. To determine the effect of endothelial denudation or injury (due to drug-eluting stents or mechanical injury during implantation), Activation Types D and E assumed the entire endothelium was pre-activated.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The concentration of platelets in contact with the wall between the first and second struts was higher closer to the first strut than the second strut at the final time (
                        Fig. 3), in agreement with the previous experimental study [13]. For both our simulation and the reported experiment, platelet deposition on the wall within the recirculation region on the downstream side of the first strut was lower than the deposition within the vicinity of the point of flow reattachment (69% lower for our simulation and 42% lower for the experiment). Additionally, in both our simulation and the experiment, platelet deposition within ~100µm of the first strut was much lower than within the next ~100µm.

For each strut height, regions of fluid recirculation occurred at upstream and downstream sides of each of the six struts, as shown for the first strut in 
                        Fig. 4. Results from this point forward refer to the strut in the local computational domain, which is the first strut. The lengths in the x-direction of the recirculation regions adjacent to the upstream and downstream sides of the strut increased respectively as strut height increased (
                        Fig. 5a). The total size of the regions adjacent to the top of the strut for which shear stress was greater than τ
                        
                           crit
                         for platelet activation (52.5dynecm−2) increased as strut height increased, along with an increase in the sizes of the regions for which shear stress was less than τ
                        
                           w,mean
                        /SR
                        
                           crit
                         for endothelium activation (13.3dynecm−2) (Fig. 4). For the tall strut, the entire endothelium experienced low enough shear stress for endothelium activation (Fig. 5b).

The effect of strut height was examined for Activation Type A (i.e., shear-induced and endothelium-induced platelet activation, and shear-induced endothelium activation). Final cell locations are shown in 
                        Fig. 6. Platelet activation first occurred either due to platelet contact with activated endothelium upstream of the recirculation region adjacent to the upstream side of the strut (upstream recirculation region) or due to exposure to high shear stress at the upstream top of the strut. All platelets became activated before they passed the downstream edge of the strut. Cells did not enter the upstream recirculation region, except for one unactivated platelet with the short strut. RBCs entered the recirculation region at the downstream edge of the computational domain, which was just upstream of the second strut (second strut recirculation region), though platelets entered that region only with the tall strut. As strut height increased, the numbers of platelets and RBCs that entered the recirculation region adjacent to the downstream side of the strut (downstream recirculation region) increased, with no cells entering that region with the short strut.

For most given time points and for the final time, the number of platelets in thrombi on the strut increased as strut height increased (
                        Fig. 7). The time-averaged number of platelets in mural thrombi during the final 50ms of the simulation, as well as the number of platelets in contact with the endothelium at the final time, increased with increasing strut height. The number of platelets in contact with the endothelium per 10-µm length plotted against location at the final time shows that platelet adhesion occurred on activated endothelium generally outside recirculation regions, except with the tall strut for which platelets adhered within the downstream recirculation region (
                        Fig. 8). The short and intermediate struts gave results mainly similar to each other for number of emboli and for total number of platelets in emboli, with equilibrium values around 20 and 300, respectively (
                        Fig. 9). These values were much higher for the tall strut at the final time (around 70 and 1800, respectively), which had not yet reached equilibrium.

Results with different Activation Types (B, C, D, E) were compared to Activation Type A for each strut height to determine the effects of methods of platelet activation and endothelium activation. For cases with endothelium-induced platelet activation (Activation Types A, C, E), only in one case did a cell (one unactivated platelet) enter the upstream recirculation region. Conversely, for each case with platelets subjected only to shear-induced platelet activation (Activation Types B, D), several platelets entered the upstream recirculation region. For the downstream recirculation region, only in one case did three cells enter the region for the short strut, while both platelets and RBCs entered that region for the intermediate and tall struts, regardless of Activation Type. For the second strut recirculation region, RBCs entered for all strut heights and Activation Types, while a few platelet emboli entered only for the tall strut for cases with endothelium-induced platelet activation (Activation Types A, C, E).

The numbers of platelets in both mural and strut thrombi versus time were respectively very similar for cases with shear-induced endothelium activation (Activation Types A, B, C), for a given strut height (see Fig. 7 for Activation Type A). For the other cases with pre-activated endothelium (Activation Type D, E) with the short and intermediate struts, the number of platelets in mural thrombi continued to increase with time to reach final values that were generally much larger than those with the tall strut (not shown). Similarly, the number of platelets in contact with the endothelium at the final time (platelet-wall contacts) decreased with strut height for Activation Types D and E, while the other Activation Types showed similar values with a given strut height, which were significantly smaller for the short strut compared with the other two struts (
                        Fig. 10).

Similar to cases with Activation Type A, cases with the other Activation Types showed that platelet adhesion occurred on activated endothelium mainly outside recirculation regions, except with the tall strut. However, with Activation Types B, C, D, and E with the short and intermediate struts, adhered platelets were found at more locations within recirculation regions than with Activation Type A. Cases in which platelets were not subjected to shear-induced platelet activation (Activation Type C ) were the only cases that produced platelet adhesion in or near the second strut recirculation region, which occurred with each strut height. Results for time courses of number of emboli and total number of platelets in emboli for each strut height for a given Activation Type (B, C, D, E) were similar to those results for Activation Type A (see Fig. 9 for Activation Type A).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The doubling in strut height from the intermediate strut to the tall strut more than doubled the length of the downstream recirculation region and amount of activated endothelium, unlike the much smaller effects of the doubling in height from the short to the intermediate strut. This result was in agreement with previous CFD studies [10,11]. Also in agreement are our results of Activation Type A that each strut height resulted in shear-induced platelet activation along the top of the strut, and the tall strut resulted in platelet deposition on the endothelium within the downstream recirculation region. However, the previous CFD study [10] proposed that with rectangular struts in general, platelets would recirculate and deposit within both the upstream and downstream recirculation regions close to the strut. In contrast, our results with the short and intermediate struts showed no platelet recirculation or deposition within the upstream recirculation regions of both the first and second struts, and no or very little platelet recirculation with no deposition within the downstream recirculation region during initial thrombus formation. For these two strut heights, deposition mainly occurred outside recirculation regions. Also in contrast to predictions of the previous CFD study [10], deposition within the downstream recirculation region with the tall strut mainly occurred along the central section of the recirculation region rather than close to the strut. Our results are in good agreement with the in vivo experiments that demonstrated higher concentrations of platelet deposition outside CFD-predicted recirculation regions [13]. Later the initial thrombus predicted by our results may grow to cover the area around the struts and recirculation regions as observed in in vivo experiments [11].

An increase in strut height yielded a larger number of platelets in thrombi on the strut, likely due to increased strut perimeter, and yielded larger numbers of platelets in mural thrombi and in contact with the endothelium, likely due to increased amount of activated endothelium. The much higher number of emboli and total number of platelets in emboli for the tall strut, compared with the other struts, may be due to the larger profile of the upstream side of the strut on which more platelets accumulated and became activated. Hence, more and larger emboli were shed from the tall strut. As well, these emboli remained in the computational domain due to entering the larger downstream recirculation region of the tall strut.

Comparison of Activation Type A that included both models of platelet activation (i.e., shear-induced and endothelium-induced) to Activation Types B and C that included only one of the platelet activation models, showed that thrombosis variables near the final time for a given strut height (e.g., number of platelets in mural thrombi, number of platelets in emboli, and number of emboli) did not differ greatly. Hence, the types of activation to which platelets were subjected did not have a large effect. For the short and intermediate struts, comparison of Activation Types B and E showed that denuded or injured endothelium caused the numbers of platelets in mural thrombi and in contact with the endothelium to continue to increase with time and to become 2–6 times larger than with endothelium subjected to shear-induced activation. However, endothelium condition (i.e., denuded/injured or shear-activated) had little effect on numbers of emboli and platelets in emboli for a given strut height.

The flow was assumed to be steady with the inlet mean fluid velocity equal to a typical peak diastolic coronary velocity. Previous CFD studies with pulsatile flow demonstrated similar recirculation regions as in our study and found that recirculation regions were largest at peak velocity for a case with recirculation downstream of a single strut [10] and for a case with two recirculation regions between two struts [13]. The length of the recirculation region downstream of the single strut was 20% larger at the peak velocity, compared to the minimum velocity [10]. Because our study utilized a peak velocity, we would expect that our downstream recirculation regions would represent the peak size during a cardiac cycle under pulsatile flow. Additionally, thrombus growth rate within in vitro coronary stenoses have been shown to be similar with either steady or pulsatile flow, though thrombosis was initiated earlier with steady flow [38]. Similarly, we would expect that, compared with pulsatile flow, our simulations would initiate thrombosis earlier and produce similar thrombus growth patterns and locations. Furthermore, we would expect that the endothelial segments subjected to wall shear stress low enough for endothelium activation in our steady flow simulations would be the same segments that would be periodically subjected to this same low shear stress value under pulsatile flow. Thus, the same segments of endothelium would become activated in pulsatile flow, and results would be similar to our steady flow simulations. Although slight differences would exist in results between steady and pulsatile flow, the relative effects of strut height and relative effects of Activation Type were expected to be similar, respectively.

Strut shapes of commercially available stents include rectangular, as in our study, as well as more hydrodynamic or streamlined shapes, such as rounded or trapezoidal [10,18,39]. Although CFD studies have shown that rounded struts, compared with similarly sized rectangular struts, produced smaller or no recirculation regions and lower wall shear stress on top of struts [10], CFD studies still showed recirculation for some rounded struts under physiological conditions [10,39]. Specifically, rectangular and rounded struts with 200-µm length and 100-µm height produced recirculation regions on upstream and downstream sides of each strut in a CFD study under steady flow at the same peak velocity as in our simulation [10]. Compared with a rectangular strut, the cross-sectional area and length of the downstream (upstream) recirculation region with a rounded strut were 66% (86%) and 44% (64%) smaller, respectively [10]. Though rounded struts produced smaller or no recirculation regions, all shapes and sizes of struts tested yielded shear stress on top of struts greater than τ

                        [10]. Hence, we would expect similar numbers of activated platelets with both rectangular and streamlined struts. As well, provided a high enough strut to produce recirculation, the relative effects of strut height and relative effects of Activation Type in our study with rectangular struts would be similar to those with more streamlined struts, though the absolute effects would be diminished. Further studies are needed to validate our speculation.

Death and myocardial infarction associated with coronary stent thrombosis continue to be significant occurrences worldwide for both bare metal and drug eluting stents, despite the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) (i.e., aspirin plus clopidogrel) [4]. Aspirin and clopidogrel each reduce agonist-induced platelet activation and aggregation; hence, neither drug prevents shear-induced platelet activation [40,41]. For example, platelet activation due to high shear stress produced by coronary stenoses was demonstrated in patients who were on DAT [33]. Peak wall shear stresses through these coronary stenoses were estimated to range from 26 to 2815dynecm−2 
                        [33], which covers the range of peak wall shear stresses in our coronary stent simulations for which we observed shear-induced platelet activation (110 to 292dynecm−2). Hence, similarly to coronary stenoses, coronary stents might also produce shear-induced platelet activation in patients on DAT. As seen in our simulations, such platelet activation may lead to stent thrombosis.

A meta-analysis, retrospective study showed a reduction in the risk of stent thrombosis in patients with coronary stents with the use of triple antiplatelet therapy (TAT) (i.e., cilostazol, aspirin, and clopidogrel) compared with DAT [42]; however, other meta-analysis studies determined no change in the risk of stent thrombosis by TAT [43,44]. Because cilostazol is an inhibitor of agonist-induced platelet aggregation [43], as are aspirin and clopidogrel, the occurrence of stent thrombosis in patients on either TAT or DAT gives credence to our results that suggest shear-induced platelet activation due to stents is an important factor in stent thrombosis.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We developed and implemented a discrete element computational model of the dynamics of thousands of individual platelets and RBCs in initial thrombus formation induced by stents in coronary arteries. We defined and incorporated models of activation of platelets by shear stress and by dysfunctional endothelium and models of activation of the endothelium by shear stress and denudation or injury. The computational method exhibited good agreement with a previous in vitro study of platelet deposition between stent struts. Results showed that with shear-induced endothelium activation, the number of platelets in mural thrombi increased as strut height increased. In contrast with pre-activated endothelium, the short strut yielded a higher number platelets in mural thrombi than the other struts. The type of activation to which platelets were subjected (shear-induced, endothelium-induced, or both) did not greatly affect results. As well, the manners in which platelets and the endothelium were activated did not greatly affect the amount of emboli for a given strut height. The smaller the strut height, the less likely platelets were to enter recirculation regions and adhere to the endothelium in recirculation regions.

This study was the first to computationally simulate the dynamics of individual cells in the vicinity of stent struts and to simulate the resultant thrombus formation, to our knowledge. Our work expanded upon previous CFD studies, which did not include cells, to reveal that platelets did not necessarily enter recirculation regions or adhere to the endothelium close to the strut in initial thrombus formation, in contrast to predictions of some CFD studies. Rather, platelets were more likely to deposit on activated endothelium outside recirculation regions and deposit directly on struts. Our study elucidated interactions within the initiation process of stent thrombosis due to struts (such as interactions between strut height and the extent of endothelium activation), and also shed light on the effects of mechanical factors on the roles of platelets and endothelium in stent thrombosis.

The transport, collision, activation, adhesion, and aggregation of thousands of individual platelets and RBCs were simulated in stented coronary arteries by a mesoscale, discrete element method for blood cells. Details of the computational model have been previously published [14–16]. A brief description of the model is given here.

The computational model followed the motion of each spherical cell due to interactions with the fluid, vessel walls, struts, and other cells. The model solved the linear and angular momentum equations of each cell, which included forces and torques due to the fluid (i.e., drag force, added mass force, and fluid rotation torque) and due to collision including adhesion effects (i.e., force due to elastic deformation of a cell from collision, force due to energy dissipation from collision, sliding resistance force, sliding resistance torque, and rolling resistance torque). Forces and torques were determined using equations given in the literature, except for the force due to elastic deformation, which was determined, as described below, based on the theory of [45].

Upon collision, cells were assumed to retain their shapes except within a flattened circular region of contact, in accord with the model of cell–cell contact of [46]. Receptor–ligand bonds that formed within the contact region were modeled as springs following [46]. Under our model assumptions, receptor–ligand binding took a form that was mathematically analogous to van der Waals adhesion with a time-dependent adhesive surface energy density α(t) given by

For simulations in the current work, the time scale for bond formation was much less than the time scale for elastic response of two colliding cells. Thus, number density of bonds was approximated by its equilibrium value

                     dyncm−1 for platelets and −1×10−4
                     dyncm−1 for RBCs. The adhesive surface energy density for platelets yielded an effective spring constant at the equilibrium contact region radius that was on the same order of magnitude as that determined by Filipovic et al. [49] from computational simulations by comparison with experiments. The adhesive surface energy density for RBCs was previously shown to be in good agreement with in vitro aggregation experiments [14].

Because of the analogy with van der Waals adhesion, we used the theory of [45] for adhesive elastic particles to approximate elastic deformation forces acting between two colliding cells, given by
