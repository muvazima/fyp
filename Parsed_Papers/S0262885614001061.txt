@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The object model is one of the indispensable ingredients of many computer vision applications, such as object recognition, object detection and object segmentation. To recognize generic object category rather than just specific object instances, the object model must contain and reflect the largely intra-class variations in visual appearances of different object instances belonging to the same object category.

Many deformable object models have been proposed to capture significant variations in appearance and shape, such as deformable template models [1–5] and part-based models [6–10]. However, any single deformable model is not enough to represent the rich variations [7]. One of the solutions is to partition the generic object category into several specific sub-categories and learn the deformable model for each sub-category, as shown in Fig. 1
                     . Thus, the generic object model is expressed by multiple sub-category models.

The present paper considers the problem of learning such object models from example images by combining the ideas of sub-category partitioning and of part-based modeling. Specifically speaking, given a set of object instances from the same object category, our method will automatically partition them into different sub-categories, locate the meaningful parts in each instance and learn the part-based model for each sub-category. It is very important to study the relationship between the sub-category partitioning and the parts localization in the process of learning object model. For example, when people view cars from various perspectives (e.g. frontal views versus side views), the visually composed parts of cars can be very different; in turn, people can use their visually composed parts to distinguish different viewpoints of car.

To achieve the goal, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical object representation based on the topic model. It is called the Layout-Part Topic Model (LPTM). In the LPTM, parts are formalized as a group of regions that are spatially clustered. The spatial relationships of parts are formalized as a group of layouts that give a description of the geometric topology for the relative positions of parts. Naturally, an object instance will be represented as a probability distribution over a set of parts with certain layouts, and the object instances belonging to the same sub-category will have similar probability distributions over the layouts and parts. In addition, the layout information is also helpful in sub-category partitioning.

To learn the distribution of object model over the layouts and parts from a given set of object instances, our method divides the LPTM into two Spatial Distribution Topic Models (SDTM), namely, the layout-based SDTM and the part-based SDTM. Accordingly, an iterative learning process is proposed based on the two SDTMs, i.e. using the layout-based SDTM to run the sub-category partitioning and using the part-based SDTM to run the parts localization. The sub-category partitioning is to discover several sub-categories from the set of object instances while the parts localization is to locate the possible part regions in each object instance. Each iteration leads to improved consistency between the sub-category partitioning and the parts localization, and the iteration process will stop until the sub-category partitioning no longer changes. Meanwhile, the distribution of the layouts and the parts is also obtained by using the parameter learning method of the topic model in the iterative process. Finally, our object model is composed of multiple sub-category models, and each sub-category model is a parts-based model.

To sum up, the main features of this paper are: (1) to present a novel hierarchical object representation for learning a generic object model; and (2) to provide an iterative learning process to automatically discover the sub-categories and learn their part-based models from a set of object instances with a bounding box. The new method is implemented to illustrate the capability for learning object models and evaluate them on several public and standard databases through the experiment of object detection. The experimental results show that our method proves to be better than existing methods.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is a discussion on the related work. Section 3 introduces the layout-part topic model, and Section 4 describes the learning process in detail. In Section 5, experiments on multiple datasets are conducted by using our method and our method is compared with several others. Conclusions and discussion are presented in Section 6.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

Research on learning object models has always been a hot topic in the field of computer vision. Many representative methods have been realized and many public datasets are provided for training and testing the proposed methods. Part-based methods [6] are a powerful representation because of their flexible expressiveness and intuitive interpretation. In a supervised way, each training image is labeled with part locations, and the learning process for a part-based model becomes relatively easy. Nevertheless, researchers have found out that the supervised annotation process is a serious restriction [7,8], i.e. the definition of the part requires high-level prior knowledge about the object category, and the manual annotation process is ambiguous to humans, prone to error, and time-consuming.

Recently, semi-supervised methods have been investigated for learning part-based models. These methods can automatically discover the possible parts from a set of object instances. A better method is proposed by Felzenszwalb [7], who treated the parts as latent variables during training, and the object models were trained by using a discriminative procedure that required only bounding boxes for the objects in a set of images. Similarly, [8] modeled part labels as hidden nodes based on the conditional random field and developed an EM algorithm to automatically discover the meaningful object parts from class labels alone. By automatically finding effective parts, the part-based modeling methods can achieve better recognition results. Inspired by these methods, our method also uses latent variables as the parts and introduces the layout information to provide consistent spatial constraints, to improve the correctness of the parts localization.

To model the large variation in visual appearances of different object instances from the same object category, unsupervised sub-category discovery is also proposed, which can simultaneously partition a generic category into multiple specific sub-categories and learn their structure models. Wu et al. [11] generated a cluster boosted tree by iteratively splitting nodes to represent possible sub-categories. Yuan et al. [12] solved the problem with standard SVM training, using two kernel functions: one function was used to measure the similarity between the object and the background, and the other function to address the intra-class variation. Todorovic et al. [13] recognized a category by detecting its constituent sub-categories and combined these detection results. Zhu et al. [14] used a recursive compositional model to describe a sub-category, which corresponds to a specific object and viewpoint. Zhang et al. [15] defined a pose-normalized kernel function for sub-category learning that is suitable for kernel-based learning methods. Compared with these studies, our method examines the local parts relationship and the global layouts distribution to discriminate different sub-categories.

Unsupervised object category discovery has also been used to construct object models in recent years. The idea is intuitive that categorizing and modeling should be conducted together without using expensive human annotation. Several methods use a topic model to realize their goal [16–20]. Wang et al. [16] proposed the spatial latent Dirichlet allocation (SLDA), which better encoded spatial structures among visual words essential for solving many vision problems. Mario et al. [17] presented a novel method for the discovery and detection of visual object categories that was based on decompositions by using topic models. Erik et al. [18] developed a hierarchical probabilistic model for objects by coupling topic models with spatial transformations. Diane et al. [19] embedded visual vocabulary creation within the object model construction, making it more suitable for object categorization. Marco et al. [20] used a topic model to represent the shape and appearance of each object and could simultaneously discover the objects in each image without supervision from a collection of images. Similarly, our method extends the original topic model by introducing the layout topic, and we focus on the process of automatically finding the possible sub-categories from a collection of instances belonging to the same object category.

Usually, an object can be described as a set of parts that have a certain spatial arrangement. This paper uses a topic model to formulate the statistical relationships between the object and its parts. The topic model is originally motivated in the context of text analysis and is a generative model for modeling the statistical relationships among documents, topics and words. The topic model is depicted by the directed graphical model as shown in Fig. 2(a).

Using a topic model, each object instance is represented as a set of quantized regions, i.e. d
                     ={r
                     
                        d1, r
                     
                        d2,…,rdn
                     }. The regions are the over-segmentation of object instances and can be obtained by any reasonable existing segmentation algorithm. In our work, over-segmentation is performed within the normalized cut (NCut) [21]. The appearance of each region is represented by its corresponding visual word wdn
                     . Therefore, each object instance is considered to be a visual document composed of a bag of visual words, and each part is considered to be a visual topic composed of different visual words that have a consistent spatial distribution.

To model the spatial distribution for each part, the topic model is extended by increasing the location variable as shown in Fig. 2(b). In the Spatial Distribution Topic Model (SDTM), the location of a region is represented by its image coordinates ldn
                     
                     =(xdn
                     , ydn
                     ). The location distribution of each part is modeled by a Gaussian model with the parameter set (μk
                     , σk
                     ). Using the spatial distribution topic model, we can simultaneously model the distributions of appearances and locations of different parts.

Next, we will develop a novel topic model with the spatial relationships between parts. The proposed topic model is called the Layout-Part Topic Model (LPTM), which is illustrated by a graphical model in Fig. 2(c). In the LPTM, parts are formalized as a group of regions that are spatially clustered and have predictable appearances. Spatial relationships between parts are formalized as a group of layouts that describe a geometric topology for the relative positions of the parts. An object is characterized by a probability distribution over a set of parts with certain layouts.

Compared with the SDTM, the LPTM models not only the spatial distribution of each part, but also the spatial relationships between the parts as well. Based on the consistent geometric relations between the parts, this approach distinguishes between the correct and incorrect spatial distribution of an individual part. Compared with previous part-based representations, such as the constellation model, the LPTM models only the local spatial relationship among a limited number of parts rather than modeling the global spatial relationships among all of the parts. This approach avoids a combinatorial explosion of the hypothesis space.

To form a global part-based representation, a star-like geometry model is adopted to organize the local layouts. For each layout, the distribution of its location relative to the center of object ρm
                      is modeled by a Gaussian model with parameter set N
                     ~(ζm
                     , υm
                     ). Therefore, the location ldn
                      of each region is drawn from a distribution N
                     ~(μk
                     
                     +
                     ρm
                     , σk
                     ), which depends on its part topic zk
                      and the location of the layout topic ρm
                     .

With the LPTM model, the observation value {wdn
                     , ldn
                     } associated with a region rdn
                      in an object instance d can be generated as follows:

                           draw the proportions of layout topic from the Dirichlet distribution, θd
                              
                              ~

                              ~
                              N(ζm
                              , υm
                              );

                               from the multinomial distribution, zdn
                              
                              ~
                              Mult(φm
                              , udn

                              ~
                              Mult(ϕk
                              , zdn
                              );

draw the location ldn
                               from the Gaussian distribution, ldn

                              ).

Assuming that there are C sub-category models in an object category and their parameters Θ={Θ1, Θ2,…, Θ
                        c
                     } are given, the probability that the object instance d belongs to the c-th sub-category is computed as follows:
                        
                           (1)

The distribution in Eq. (2) is intractable for exact inference, and several approximation inference algorithms can be considered, such as Laplace approximation, variational approximation, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

However, it is very difficult to learn the model parameters Θ. Our method is to divide the LPTM into two SDTMs, as shown in Fig. 3
                     . Using the parameter learning method of topic model, the distribution of the layout topic and the part topic for the object model are obtained. Moreover, the sub-category can also be discovered by using an iterative learning process between the two SDTMs without any supervision. More details are introduced in the next section.

Given a set of object instances with a bounding box, we use the LPTM to discover the object sub-categories and learn the corresponding parameters for each sub-category model. To accomplish this, the LPTM is divided into two SDTMs: the layout-based SDTM and the part-based SDTM, and an iterative learning process is performed between the two specific SDTMs until the partitioning of the object instances no longer change. The entire iterative learning process is summarized in Fig. 4
                         and Algorithm 1.

In the layout-based SDTM, an object instance is represented as a set of layout words. The layout words are a formalized representation indicating how to assign the spatial relationships between the limited parts. In theory, the object instances from the same sub-category must have a similar spatial relationship between the parts. We use the property of layout similarity to discover the possible sub-category partitioning. Given the object instances and their part regions, we first obtain the layout codebook, and then use the layout-based SDTM to run the sub-category partitioning on the set of object instances.

In the part-based SDTM, an object instance is represented by a set of appearance words coming from the appearance codebook. Given the object instances from the same sub-category and their over-segmented regions, we use the appearance codebook and the part-based SDTM to run the parts localization in each instance.

In this way, the parts localization exploits intermediate partitioning results at a given stage and guides the next stage of sub-category partitioning. Each iteration leads to an improved consistency between the sub-category partitioning and the parts localization. If the partitioning is no longer changing, the learning process will stop. An initialization sub-category partitioning is required for the iterative learning process. We extract two global features, i.e. the pyramid of Lab color features and the pyramid of HOG features in the object instance. With these feature descriptions, the k-means clustering is performed to split the given set of object instances into several sub-categories.

As mentioned above, we will use the layout-based SDTM to partition the set of object instances into different sub-categories. In the layout-based SDTM, an object instance is represented as a set of layout words. Thus, the first important thing is to construct the layout codebook.

Given an object instance and its part regions, we select three parts that have a shared boundary to form a specific layout. The specific layout is represented as a rectangle with piecewise straight lines, which gives a formalization of spatial relationships between parts, as shown in Fig. 5(a).

In order to form the specific layout, we perform the following two steps: (1) fitting a rectangle bounding box with minimum area to contain the selected three parts; (2) dividing the rectangle bounding box into three subregions by finding the available lines under a heuristic method. In the heuristic method, we use the pixels on the shared boundary as the seed points. Through each seed point, we draw the straight lines that do not cross the parts. These straight lines will intersect each other at the interior of the box and will intersect with the edge of the bounding box. Three types of intersection are selected as the endpoint, i.e. an intersection at the edge of the bounding box, an intersection at the boundaries of the part regions and an intersection at the non-part regions. We link the pairs of endpoints to form the lines and select the available lines under two principles. One principle is the parts integrity principle. This principle is to discourage the lines from crossing any part region. The other principle is the subregion maximization principle. It is to ensure that each subregion not only contains a part but also maximizes the ratio between the area of the subregion and the area of the part in the subregion. Finally, a specific layout is obtained when the lines are determined. More specific layouts are obtained by repeating the process of parts selecting and rectangle division in the object instances.

A numerical descriptor is proposed to encode the geometric properties of specific layout. The descriptor has two components. The first component is the coordinate set of the subregion centers [(x
                           1, y
                           1),…, (xs
                           , ys
                           )]. These coordinates are ordered from left to right and from top to bottom. The second component is the coordinate set of the lines [(x
                           1
                           1, y
                           1
                           1, x
                           1
                           2, y
                           1
                           2),…,(xι
                           
                           1, yι
                           
                           1, xι
                           
                           2, yι
                           
                           2)]. The coordinate of each line is indicated by its endpoint coordinates. Additionally, all of the lines are ordered from left to right and from top to bottom. The dissimilarity between these two specific layouts is defined as follows:

We use the clique-partitioning (CP) method [22] to cluster all of the specific layouts that have been discovered from all of the object instances. For each cluster, a specific layout is selected as the layout word to add into the layout codebook, which has the lowest sum of dissimilarities compared to all others. The entire process is summarized in Algorithm 2.

Given an object instance and its part regions, we find its specific layouts and compute the dissimilarity between the specific layouts and the layout words. Using the most similar layout words to replace all specific layouts, the object instances is represented as a set of layout words, i.e. d

When the layout topic is known, the proportion of the layout topic in each object instance is also obtained. We use the proportion as the descriptor for each object instance, and then run k-means clustering to partition the set of object instances into several sub-categories.

With the sub-category partitioning, we will use the part-based SDTM to locate the possible part regions in each instance. In the part-based SDTM, an object instance is represented by a set of appearance words coming from the appearance codebook. To construct the appearance codebook, the segmentation method of normalized cut [21] is performed on each instance and a set of over-segmented regions is obtained.

We capture different cues from the regions to describe them, and each cue is encoded into a histogram. The cues include the shape, color and texture. We use the gradient histogram of the detector gpb 
                           [24] to provide the contour shape. While the detector gpb is designed to suppress the high frequency gradient information, the edge shape is used to compensate for it by computing the orientation of the local image gradient. In addition, we use the texton histograms to describe the texture cue, and use the L, a and b histograms in the CIELAB color space to represent the color cue. The distances between the histograms of the region cues are characterized by using the χ
                           2 measure. Finally, we use k-means clustering to form a finite appearance codebook W
                           
                              A
                           . The size of the codebook is set at 1000, which appears to be appropriate for our tasks.

                           m
                        . The layout-word-part-topic matrix f is constructed to achieve this goal. The matrix is a T

In this section, the proposed method is used to learn the object model and show the ability of model by performing the task of object detection on several challenging vision datasets. Given a test image that contains an object instance, its over-segmented regions are obtained by using the NCut method, and the observations value W
                     
                        d
                      and L
                     
                        d
                      in all regions are obtained. For object detection, windows of different sizes and scales are sampled, and then the learning model is used to compute the probability that the window belongs to the object category by Eq. (2). The window with the maximum probability is regarded as the final detection result. A detection is considered to be correct if the area of the intersection of the estimated bounding boxes and the ground-truth bounding boxes divided by the area of their union is at least 0.5. To evaluate the object detection, the interpolated average precision (AP) in the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge is used. The whole experimental environment is shown in Table 1
                     .

Two generic categories are selected as the experimental object, i.e. the car category and the person category. Each category contains different object instances imaged under various viewpoints, scales and poses, and the bounding box information is given in their datasets. In addition, the viewpoint information is provided in the dataset of car category, which will be used as the ground-truth label of divided sub-categories. Thus, we can test the ability of sub-category partitioning in our method. In the process of experiment, some key performance and parameters are also analyzed, which include the running time and the size of layout codebook.

Cars have large intra-class variations and the appearance changes dramatically as the viewpoint changes. We learn the car model and run the evaluation experiments on four car datasets, including the car category of the 3D-pose dataset [25], the EPFL multi-view car dataset [26], the car category of the ICARO dataset [27], and the car category of the VOC2007 dataset [28]. The first three datasets are labeled with the bounding box information and the viewpoint information (i.e. front, left, right, rear, front–left, front–right, rear–left, rear–right), while the last has only the bounding box information. So, the number of sub-categories is set at 8 for corresponding to the number of viewpoints. We divide above-mentioned datasets into two sets that have equal size, and then randomly abstract one set from each dataset to mix them into the training set and testing set respectively.

Firstly, the relationship among the running time, the size of training set and the average precision of detection are analyzed. To this end, we change the whole size of training set by gradually increasing the size of each sub-category in experiment. The change of the running time and the change of the average precision are shown in Fig. 6
                        . From the figure we can see that the average precision of detection has been improved obviously with the increase of the training set, but the change of the running time is almost exponential growth. Thus, it is suggested that the balance between the running time and the average precision will should be considered when our method is used in practice. The size of training set will be set in the range of 450–700 to get plausible sub-categorization. It is also found out that the main cost of time is spent in the estimation of the layout topic and the part topic; the average cost in the layout topic is in the range of 700s-1800s (including the time for constructing layout codebook), while the average cost in the part topic is in the range of 400s–900s. In addition, the number of iterations is 4–7 times for convergence.

As the key intermediate step, the layout codebook is very important. In the process of experiment, we set different sizes of layout codebook under multiple cases of part numbers, and then analyze the influence on the learned model by object detection. The influence from the size variation of the layout codebook is shown in Fig. 7
                        . From this it can be concluded that this change is regular in any case, i.e. first from low to high, then from high to low. We relate this change in performance to the following reasons: when the size of the layout codebook is too small, the content of layout word trend to be generalized; on the contrary, when the size of the layout codebook is too large, the content of layout word trend will be smoother. Using such layout words to represent, the ability of distinguishing between object instances is reduced. We suggest that the size of layout codebook is set in the range of 200–300 when our method is used in practice.

When the number of sub-categories is fixed, the number of parts is set at 8, which simultaneously has the best accuracy for the detection and the sub-category partitioning, as shown in Fig. 8
                        . Some examples of the discovering sub-categories and the meaningful parts are shown in Fig. 9
                        .

On the basis of the suggested parameters, we learn the car model from the training set and run the car detection on the testing set. We compare our method with two state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, i.e. the deformable part model (DPM) introduced by Felzenszwalb [7] and the modified deformable part model (mDPM) introduced by Roberto [29]. The two methods construct an object category model as a mixture of m components and each component is composed of the global root filter and the part-based model. Each component corresponds to a specific viewpoint of the car category in the mDPM. We also compare our method with one state-of-the-art supervised method called viewpoint-aware object detection (VAOD), which was introduced by Daniel Glasner [30]. This method constructs the 3D shapes model of the car category by applying SFM reconstruction to a 2D image training set.

A comparison between the methods for car detection is shown in Table 2
                        ; our method obtains much better results compared with the other three methods. Specifically, our method approximates the results of other methods in the 3D-pose dataset and the EPFL dataset, and all of the methods obtain high accuracy for detection in the two datasets. The drastic changes in accuracy are found in the ICARO and VOC2007 dataset. We achieve this improvement in performance for several reasons. First, the representations are different between our method and the other methods. The DPM and the mDPM both organize all of the parts in a global star-like geometry model, when the VAOD is a global 3D-shape model. The global constraints increase the rigid requirements for the decisions on the detected results. However, our model relaxes the limitation by two levels of organization, i.e. the local constraints in the specific parts and the global constraints in the abstract layouts. In addition, each layout includes three parts in such a way that the object representation includes redundant parts information for the decision. The second reason is that our method is generative while the other methods are discriminative. Generative methods require more information compared with discriminative models and can tolerate a significant intra-class variation in the object appearances.

We also evaluate the sub-category partitioning on the first three datasets and show a confusion matrix in Fig. 10
                        . The adjacent views are more easily confused, e.g. frontal-left and frontal views, compared with the opposite views, e.g. left and right. The rear and frontal views appear to have a relatively high confusion rate. This can be explained by the fact that the shape and appearance are similar in the two views. We also compare our method with the mPDM and the VAOD on the sub-category partitioning. The result is shown in Table 3
                        . Compared with the special methods for pose estimation, our method obtains competitive sub-categorization results, and the results tend to be smoother than the other two methods on different datasets.

The person category is also an attractive category because it has a very aggressive pose, spatial variations and appearance variations. In our work, three person datasets are used to learn and test our method. These datasets include the person category of the VOC2007 dataset [28], the UIUC people dataset [31] and the Sport image dataset [32]. The UIUC people dataset and the sport image dataset are both human sports image datasets, including acrobatics, American football, croquet, cycling, hockey, figure skating, soccer, golf and horseback riding. The person category of the VOC2007 dataset includes mainly humans in realistic scenes. There are a total of 3928 images, and each image in the three datasets has an annotation file that gives a bounding box for each human object. We randomly choose 2000 images to construct the training set; the rest of the images are used as the testing set. In our experiment, the training set is further divided into two subsets: one subset is used to determinate the number of sub-categories and the number of parts and the other subset is used to learn the person model by using the determinate parameters. Through experiment, the number of sub-categories is set at 6, and the number of parts is set at 10 for each sub-category.

We make a comparison between our method and three other state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, i.e. the deformable parts model (DPM) [7], the part-based CRF model (PCM) [8] and the hierarchical poselet model (HPM) [32]. The comparison is shown in Table 4
                        . In the UIUC dataset and the sports dataset, most people appear at the centers of the images and account for most of the image area; thus, the accuracy of the detection is higher, even if there is a substantial amount of pose variation. In contrast, people are multi-scale, and each image includes multiple people with occlusions and background clutter in VOC2007, which make the detection more difficult. However, our method still achieves competitive results. First, we discover and divide the sub-categories by using the layout topic. Compared with the specific parts distribution, the abstract layouts are easier to cluster into similar poses as sub-categories. In addition, we also obtain the discriminated parts by using the layout organization.

This paper presents a novel method for learning a category-level object model being composed of several part-based sub-category models. For the sub-category partitioning and the sub-category modeling, the layout-part topic model is proposed and an iterative learning process is described. Finally, our method is demonstrated on six public datasets of two object categories, and our method is compared with the other existing methods. The results have shown that our method provides competitive performance.

Although our method is general and independent of the object category in theory, some key performance still needs to be optimized in order to be used in practice, for example, adopting the tactics of parallel computing to improve the running time; exploring the relationship between the layout codebook and the object category to improve the learning ability. In the future, it is expected to construct the generic layout codebook for the object representation, and develop the method for combining these sub-category models into a generic category model.
