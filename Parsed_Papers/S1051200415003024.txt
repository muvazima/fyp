                  This paper proposes a novel diffusion subband adaptive filtering algorithm for distributed networks. To achieve a fast convergence rate and small steady-state errors, a variable step size and a new combination method is developed. For the adaptation step, the upper bound of the mean-square deviation (MSD) of the algorithm is derived and the step size is adaptive by minimizing it in order to attain the fastest convergence rate on every iteration. Furthermore, for a combination step realized by a convex combination of the neighbor-node estimates, the proposed algorithm uses the MSD, which contains information on the reliability of the estimates, to determine combination coefficients. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of the convergence rate and the steady-state errors.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The distributed estimation strategy has been widely used for many applications such as wireless and sensor networks since it is more robust but less computational comparing to a centralized estimation strategy [1–8]. It aims to adaptively estimate unknown parameters based on input and output data at every node in the distributed network, where each node is considered to operate as an individual adaptive filter. Recently, several real-time processing strategies for the distributed estimation were suggested in [9–15]. Among them, the diffusion LMS algorithm [10] suggested a scheme that makes all nodes share and fuse the estimates of their neighbor nodes by employing a linear combiner. The general version of this algorithm has been provided in [13], where Adapt-then-Combine (ATC) and Combine-then-Adapt (CTA) diffusion LMS algorithms are formulated that allow the higher level of information exchange. Several diffusion-type algorithms have been developed based on the ATC and CTA schemes to improve the performance in terms of the convergence rate and the steady-state estimation errors by adjusting step-size parameter in the adaptation step or assigning suitable coefficients for linear combiner in the combination step. The step size is an important parameter that determines a compromise between a fast convergence rate and a small steady-state estimation errors, and thus some researches solved the conflict between them by varying the step size of the DLMS algorithm [16–19]. These algorithms achieved improved performance comparing to the fixed step-size DLMS algorithm, but they suffer from a deteriorated convergence rate when the input signal is highly correlated. Thus, there still remain issues for developing algorithms with better performance under highly correlated input signals. Besides the step size parameter, the combination coefficients for linear combiner can affect the performance of the algorithm. Recently, various approaches to determine the combination coefficients have been proposed in [10–14,20–23]. Most papers that deal with diffusion networks adopt the static combination method suggested in [10–14], where the combination coefficients are determined based on the network topology solely. Since the network topology cannot absolutely represent the reliability of each node, some adaptive combination methods have been proposed in [22,23]. These adaptive combination methods are advantageous under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions comparing to the static combination methods. However, they require rather high computational complexity and still carry out suboptimal performance when different step sizes or highly correlated input signals are used across the nodes.

In this paper, we propose a variable step-size scheme and a combination method for a diffusion subband adaptive filtering algorithm to improve the performance in the aspect of the convergence rate and the steady-state estimation errors regardless of the characteristics of input signals. The proposed algorithm consists of two steps; the adaptation step for intermediate updates and the combination step for local updates. In the adaptation step, the subband adaptive filtering algorithm [24] is adopted for the intermediate weight estimation because it is beneficial in a sense that it improves the convergence rate by whitening the input and output signals. Also, the upper bound of the intermediate mean-square deviation (MSD) is derived and minimized to decide the step-size parameter, an important factor that determines the compromise between the fast convergence rate and the small steady-state estimation errors, so as to achieve the largest decrease of the MSD on every iteration. In the combination step, a novel combination method is proposed that interprets the MSD values as the reliability indicators of the estimates at each node. The combination coefficients are determined inversely proportional to the intermediate MSDs of neighboring nodes so as to assign the more weight to the more reliable node. Based on the proposed combination coefficients, the local MSD is derived as the harmonic sum of the intermediate MSDs of neighboring nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves improved performance in terms of the convergence rate and the steady-state estimation errors in various environments.

In this section, we adopt the variable step-size scheme to the adaptation step in (2) to achieve fast convergence rate and small steady-state estimation errors. The upper bound of the intermediate MSD is analyzed in advance, where the step size is derived by minimizing the MSD by extending the work of [25] and [26] to the distributed situation. Furthermore, we propose a new combination method to assign the combination coefficients in (3) by utilizing the MSD as a reliability indicator.

To analyze the mean convergence behavior, the expectations to both sides of (22) should be evaluated. For the tractable analyses, several assumptions on the signal are adopted.


                        
                           Assumptions
                           1. Both the step size and the combination coefficients are independent of the input signal, the measurement noise, and the weight error.

2. The noise

                               and spatially independent. Also, it is assumed to be independent of the input signals.

These assumptions cannot really hold for the time-varying step size and combination coefficients, but they are generally used in adaptive filtering because the results are proved to match well to the empirical results [19,22].

Under these assumptions, taking the expectation of both sides of (22) leads to

Prior to compare the performance of the several diffusion adaptive filtering algorithms, the computational complexity of the proposed and the competing algorithms are examined. For the adaptation step, the representative several diffusion algorithms, the DLMS [13], variable step size DLMS (VS-DLMS) [16,17], and noise-constrained VS-DLMS (NC-VS-DLMS) [18] algorithms, are chosen as competing algorithms. The DLMS algorithm is the simplest one, which requires 
                           M
                           +
                           1
                         multiplications per an iteration in the adaptation step. The VS-DLMS [16] and [17] algorithm requires additional 3 and 
                           4
                           M
                           +
                           4
                         multiplications for the step size, respectively. The NC-VS-DLMS [18] algorithm requires additional 
                           M
                           +
                           5
                         multiplications for the step size. The proposed algorithm requires 
                           3
                           M
                           +

                           L

                           2
                        , where L denotes the length of the analysis filter of the subband adaptive filtering algorithm and the additional complexity for the step size and the recursion of the MSD for the adaptation step is 
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 s
                              
                           
                           +
                           9
                         which makes few contributions to the overall complexity because of scalar operations. For the combination step, the computation for the combination coefficients affects the complexity. Combination methods in Table 2 are compared to the proposed algorithm. The uniform, metropolis, and relative degree methods require 1 division at each node. The number of division for the relative-degree variance method [13] is 
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                           
                         at node k to compute the combination coefficients. The hastings rule [14] requires 1 multiplication and 1 division at each node. The complexity of the adaptive combiner [22] is heavier than the forementioned static combination methods, where it needs

                        . The optimal combiner [23] requires 
                           M
                           +
                           2

                                 n

                           2
                         divisions. The proposed combination method has complexity of 
                           
                              
                                 n

                         divisions at node k and it is fewer than that of the existing adaptive combination methods.

In the diffusion adaptive filtering algorithm, the communication complexity as well as the computational complexity should be considered. The communication complexity at each node k is determined by the amount of transmitted data to the neighboring nodes. As we only consider the intermediate estimate exchange at each node in the adaptation step, the competing diffusion algorithms and the proposed algorithms require 
                           M

                                 k
                              
                           
                         transmission in common. In addition to the intermediate estimate, the parameters that participate to determine the combination coefficients 
                           
                              
                                 a
                              
                              
                                 j
                                 ,
                                 k
                              
                           
                         increase the communicational complexity. The amount of data transmission to the neighboring nodes toward several combination methods in Table 1 is compared. The uniform combination method, the adaptive combiner [22], and the optimal combiner [23] do not use additional data to determine the combination coefficients. The metropolis [11] and the relative degree [12] method transmit a scalar value

                         to the neighboring nodes, and thus they require

                        . As can be seen, the proposed step-size achieves much faster convergence rate and smaller steady-state errors than the competing algorithms. Moreover, the fastest convergence rate and the smallest steady-state estimation errors are established when both the step size in (12) and the combination method in (14) are used.

                        . It is confirmed that the proposed variable step size allows the algorithm to achieve faster convergence rate and smaller steady-state estimation errors than the competing algorithms under highly correlated input signals.


                        Figs. 5–6
                        
                         show the MSD learning curves of the diffusion subband adaptive filtering algorithm in (2) toward various combination methods in Table 1. Two network topologies in Fig. 2(a) and (b) are used for the simulations in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, respectively. The input signals and the SNR are set to the same as the simulations in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. In both of the Figs. 5 and 6, the proposed combination method allows the algorithm to achieve faster convergence rate and smaller steady-state estimation errors than other competing combination methods. Because not only the noise variance but the input characteristics affect the performance of the algorithm, the use of the MSD as a reliability indicator is suitable in the environment with highly correlated input and various noise characteristics.

To clearly verify the effect of the proposed combination method, we depict 3-D MSD learning curves at each node for several combination methods in Fig. 5. Among the static combination methods, the relative-degree variance method [13] is compared to the proposed method in this simulation because it considers not only the network topology but the noise variance at each node. In addition, the adaptive combination methods suggested in [22,23] (adaptive and optimal combiner) are chosen as the competing methods. The simulation environment is the same as that of the Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 7
                        (a)–(c), the existing combination methods provide uneven-shaped MSD curves over all nodes. The relative-degree variance method assigns larger coefficients to nodes 1 and 2 due to high SNR, but highly correlated input signals are applied to those nodes. It leads to the degraded convergence rate and large steady-state estimation errors at nodes 1 and 2. The adaptive combiner shows performance degradation at node 12 because of highly correlated input signal and bad SNR condition at node 11. The optimal combiner shows largely different performance among all nodes because the combination coefficients are directly affected by bad SNR conditions and input correlation. On the other hand, the proposed combination method in Fig. 7(d) shows flat-shaped MSD curved over all nodes. Since the derived MSD

                         is a factor that represents how well estimate the true weight vector at node k, the combination coefficient in eqn. (14) can be the reliability indicator of the estimates at each node. It makes the proposed combination method share well-estimated information with neighboring nodes and effectively suppress the effect of bad information.

To verify the tracking ability of the proposed algorithm, the MSD learning curves of the proposed and the competing algorithms in a non-stationary environment are depicted in Fig. 8
                        . The unknown system is abruptly changed at iteration 
                           i
                           =
                           30
                           
                           000
                        . The proposed algorithm is utilized with the re-initialization algorithm in [31]. As shown in Fig. 8, the proposed algorithm immediately tracks the changed system and maintains its improved performance without degradation of convergence rate or steady-state estimation errors.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, the diffusion subband adaptive filtering algorithm with the variable step size and a new combination method was proposed. In the adaptation step, we derived the optimal step size by minimizing the upper bound of the intermediate MSD of the filter to achieve the largest decrease of the MSD on every iteration. Thus, the fast convergence rate and the small steady-state estimation errors could be established. Furthermore, in the combination step, the novel combination method was suggested that interprets the MSD as information on the reliability of the estimates at each node. It enables to reflect information on the noise variance as well as input characteristics when assigning combination coefficients. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm had achieved better performance than the competing algorithms regardless of the input characteristics.
