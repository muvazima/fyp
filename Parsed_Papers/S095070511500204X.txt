                  Covering rough sets are a generalization of Pawlak rough sets, in which a partition of the universal set induced by an equivalence relation is replaced by a covering. In this paper, covering rough sets are transformed into generalized rough sets induced by binary relations. The paper discusses three theoretical topics. First, we consider a special type of covering in which the neighborhoods form a reduction of the covering, and we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for neighborhoods in a covering form a reduction of the covering. Second, we study another special type of covering, and give conditions for the covering lower and upper approximations to be dual to each other. Finally, we give an axiomatic system that characterizes the lower and upper approximations of rough sets based on a partial order.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Rough set theory, proposed by Pawlak [14,15] in 1982, is a useful tool for dealing with vagueness and granularity in information systems. Pawlak rough set theory is built on equivalence relations. However, equivalence relations impose restrictions and limitations in many applications [3,5,7,8,13,24,26]. Thus, one of the main directions of research in rough set theory is the generalization of rough approximations. Many extensions have been made to the theory by replacing equivalence relations with notions such as arbitrary binary relations [19,21,26], fuzzy relations [11], and coverings [16,20,23,30,33] of the universal sets. Zakowski [29] first extended Pawlak rough sets by using coverings of the domain rather than partitions.

Many types of covering rough set model have been proposed and investigated since Zakowski [29] extended Pawlak rough sets; see, for example, [4,31,33]. Bonikowski et al. [1] formulated conditions for the existence of operations on covering rough sets. Diker and Ugur [4] introduce relations between coverings and dicoverings within the framework of rough sets. In [17], Restrepo et al. investigated properties of approximation operators, and proved a characterization for pairs of approximation operators that are both dual and adjoint. In [18], they continued their study of covering approximation operators, and organized covering rough sets into 6 dual pairs. More recently, Yun et al. [28] characterized the conditions for a neighborhood 
                        
                           {
                           N
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           |
                           x
                           ∈
                           U
                           }
                        
                      to form a partition of the universal set U. The problem of reduction arises in many practical applications and is an important area of research in database and information systems [9]. A useful method for reduction of information systems is the rough set theory approach that depends on partitioning the universal set of objects using equivalence relations. As we know, reduction is also a significant topic in covering rough sets. The concept of reduction in coverings was introduced by Zhu and Wang [32], who moreover gave a procedure for finding a reduction for a covering. In contrast with the conditions from [28] for a neighborhood 
                        
                           {
                           N
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           |
                           x
                           ∈
                           U
                           }
                        
                      to form a partition of universal set U, a neighborhood 
                        
                           {
                           N
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           |
                           x
                           ∈
                           U
                           }
                        
                      is not in general a reduction of a covering. A natural question to ask is whether we can characterize the conditions under which 
                        
                           {
                           N
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           |
                           x
                           ∈
                           U
                           }
                        
                      forms a reduction of C. This is clearly an interesting mathematical question, and in this paper we answer it affirmatively. In addition, neighborhoods are also an important concept in topology. The answer to this question provides more insight into the topological structure of covering rough sets. We hope that the results in this paper can be used to select useful features and eliminate superfluous attributes in covering information systems.

The motivation of the paper is the question above. In this paper we only consider one type of covering rough sets based on neighborhoods. Our purpose is three theoretical topics. First, we give necessary and sufficient conditions under which 
                        
                           {
                           N
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           |
                           x
                           ∈
                           U
                           }
                        
                      is the reduction of a covering of U. Second, we consider conditions under which 
                        
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 ̲
                              
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 ‾
                              
                           
                        
                      are dual to each other. Finally, we study axiomatic approaches to rough sets, which are important for understanding their mathematical structure and may help with developing methods for real applications. There has been much effort made in researching axiomatic approaches [11,22,25]. However, up until now, rough sets based on a partial order have not been axiomatized. Partial orders are an important type of relation. We give an axiomatic system for rough sets induced by a partial order in this paper.

Throughout the paper there is no requirement for the universal set to be finite. That is, we work over a fixed universal set U, where unless otherwise stated the cardinality of U is infinite.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review standard definitions of rough sets, covering rough sets, and reductions of coverings. In Section 3, we study interesting properties of neighborhoods 
                        
                           {
                           N

                      and the approximations

                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 N

                      induced by a covering C of U. We also obtain conditions for neighborhoods in a covering to form a reduction. In Section 4, we consider conditions under which

                      are dual to each other. In Section 5, we investigate the properties of posets, and give an axiomatic system for rough sets based on a partial order. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 6.

This section reviews briefly the fundamental notation and notions based on generalized rough sets, covering rough sets, and neighborhoods. We refer to [11,32,33] for details.

Although there are many different types of generalized rough sets, we only consider the type proposed by Yao [26], which is the most commonly used one in rough set theory. Let U be a universal set and R be an arbitrary relation on U. The left R- and right R-relative sets for an element x in U are defined as

Reduction is an important concept in covering rough set theory, and many algorithms for reduction in coverings have been proposed [32]. The following definition of reduction in a covering was proposed by Zhu and Wang [32].

Other than equivalence relations, another important type of binary relation on a universal set U is partial orders. Let S be a partial order on U. Then the set U together with S is called a poset which we denote by 
                        
                           (
                           U
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                     . It is well known that posets are useful in set theory, Boolean algebra, sorting and searching.

An axiomatic approach to rough sets is appropriate for studying the mathematical structure of rough sets, and many types of generalized rough sets have been axiomatized [10,32]. However, rough sets based on a partial order have not yet been axiomatized. In this section, we present an axiomatic system that characterizes lower and upper approximations induced by a partial order.

                      to form a partition of U. These conditions are equivalent to R being an equivalence relation on U. Furthermore, R is an equivalence relation if and only if R is symmetric. Thus, the conditions for a neighborhood 
                        
                           {

                      to form a partition of U are equivalent to the symmetric property of R. In contrast to the symmetric property of R, we consider the antisymmetric property of R. That is, we study the conditions under which R is a partial order. Because R is reflexive and transitive, 
                        
                           (
                           U

                      is a poset if and only if R is antisymmetric. We need a technical lemma.

If S is a partial order, then conditions (1) and (3) are clear. We only need to prove (2). By reflexiveness,

                           . By xSy, we have

Let S be a partial order on U and let 
                              
                                 f
                                 =

                           . Then it is easy to verify that f satisfies requirements (1) and (2).

Conversely, if f satisfies requirements (1) and (2), then by Lemma 5.2, there exists a unique reflexive and transitive relation S on U such that 
                              
                                 f
                                 =
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                    
                                    
                                       ‾
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . By Lemma 4.1, condition (2) guarantees that S is antisymmetric. Thus S is a partial order on U.

Thus we have given an axiomatic system that characterizes the lower and upper approximations induced by a partial order.

In this paper, we focus on one type of covering rough sets based on neighborhoods. Using a reflexive and transitive relation R defined by a covering C, we have established a relationship between covering rough sets and generalized rough sets induced by binary relations. For a given covering C of U, we have obtained three results. First, we have given necessary and sufficient conditions for

                      are dual to each other. Finally, we have given an axiomatic system for lower and upper approximations induced by a partial order. The results in this paper may have practical applications in the areas of machine learning, knowledge extraction and reduction, cognitive science, and so on. An important problem is how to apply the results given in this paper to covering reduction algorithms in information systems.
