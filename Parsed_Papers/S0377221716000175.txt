                  We consider the two-machine no-wait job shop minimum makespan scheduling problem. We show that when each job has exactly two equal length operations (also called a proportionate job shop), the problem is solvable in O(nlog n) time. We also show that the proportionate problem becomes strongly NP-hard when some jobs are allowed to visit only one machine. Finally, we show that the proportionate problem with missing operations becomes solvable in O(nlog n) time when all missing operations are on the same machine.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In a two-machine no-wait job shop scheduling problem, a set of jobs follows the M
                     1 → M
                     2 processing route and another set of jobs follows the M
                     2 → M
                     1 processing route where M
                     1, M
                     2 denote the first and second machine respectively. Furthermore, the start time of the second operation of each job must coincide with the completion time of the first operation of the same job satisfying the no-wait restriction. The no-wait restriction is imposed either to prevent degradation of the product in certain chemical and/or steel manufacturing processes or because of the prohibitive high cost of waiting in certain service industries.

The most popular objective in the scheduling literature is the minimization of the maximum job completion time (makespan, C
                     max ). Using the standard three-field notation for scheduling problems, we denote the two-machine no-wait job shop minimum makespan scheduling problem as the J2/nwt/C
                     max  problem where the term nwt indicates the no-wait restriction.

A comparable manufacturing environment arises in a two-machine job shop problem with blocking in which there is no buffer space between the two machines and any job completing its first operation must remain on the respective machine until the other machine becomes available. Just-in-time production systems generate the blocking environment because of their objective to maintain a low level of in-process inventories. Any two-stage schedule with blocking can be converted to a no-wait schedule with the same makespan value by appropriately shifting any blocked operation so that its completion time coincides with the start time of the other operation of the same job. Therefore, our analysis of the two-machine job shop applies to both the no-wait and the blocking environments and their applications.

In a general job shop, the number of operations per job is not necessarily equal to the number of machines. If there is only a single operation, i.e. a job is allowed to skip visiting a machine, then the problem is denoted as either the J2/nwt, mo1/C
                     max  or the J2/nwt, mo2/C
                     max  problem; mo1 indicates that all missing operations are on the same machine and mo2 indicates that some jobs have missing operations on one machine and some other jobs have missing operations on the other machine. On the other hand, if a job is allowed to visit a machine more than once, then some jobs will have more than two operations and the resulting problem is denoted as the J2/nwt, o > 2/C
                     max  problem.

The J2/nwt, o > 2/C
                     max  problem was shown to be ordinary NP-hard by Sriskandarajah and Ladet (1986) even when all operations have unit processing times. Woeginger (2004) discusses the existence or not of a PTAS (Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme) for the J2/nwt, o > 2/C
                     max  problem.

The J2/nwt/C
                     max  and J2/nwt, mo1/C
                     max  problems were shown to be strongly NP-hard and the J2/nwt, mo2/C
                     max  problem was shown to be ordinary NP–hard by Cho and Sahni (1979) with arbitrary job processing times. These complexity results justify the identification of special cases that are solvable in polynomial time. One such case is the proportionate case in which the two operations of a job have equal length. The resulting problems are called proportionate shop problems and are identified by the term prpt in the middle-field of the problem definition.

The objective of this paper is to analyze the J2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max , J2/prpt, nwt, mo1/C
                     max  and J2/prpt, nwt, mo2/C
                     max  problems. We will show that the J2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  and the J2/prpt, nwt, mo1/C
                     max  problems are solvable in O(nlog n) time while the J2/prpt, nwt, mo2/C
                     max  problem is strongly NP-hard. Our results indicate that the complexity of the problem depends not only on the presence of missing operations but also on the allocation of the missing operations to the machines.

The consideration of shops with equal processing times for all operations originated in the case of a flow shop and is justified by practical applications. Panwalkar, Dudek, and Smith (1973) discussed practical applications of shops with job processing times exhibiting some similarity among machines; they observed that about three-quarters of industrial parts fall in that category.

In general, the proportionate assumption is applicable when the processing time depends on the size of the item being processed and not on the process itself. For example, let us consider the painting of a car using different layers of paint applied at different workstations. The painting time depends on the car size and is the same at all painting stations.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we present an optimal O(nlog n) algorithm for the J2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  problem. In section 3, we present an optimal O(nlog n) algorithm for the J2/prpt, nwt, mo1/C
                     max  problem and show that the J2/prpt, nwt, mo2/C
                     max  problem is strongly NP-hard. The conclusions of this research are summarized in Section 4.

In any instance of the J2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  problem, jobs can be partitioned into the J12, J21 job subsets; jobs in J12 (J21) must follow the M
                     1 → M
                     2 (M
                     2 → M
                     1) processing route respectively. Let pj
                      (qj
                     ) denote the processing time on both machines of the jth job in the SPT sequence of J12 (J21). In general, |J12| ≠ |J21| where |A| denotes the cardinality of A. We can add the necessary number of dummy jobs with either

                      so that the total number of jobs is 2n equally split between J12 and J21. We renumber jobs in each subset in the shortest processing time (SPT) order (it is possible that several initial jobs in one SPT sequence are jobs with zero processing times on both machines).


                     Sahni and Cho (1979) as well as Panwalkar and Koulamas (2014) have used the concept of job pairings to implement the no-wait restriction; we will also use the concept of job pairing here. However, in the J2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  problem, job routings cannot be selected by the scheduler. So the 2n jobs should be first arranged optimally in n pairs so that each pair (j, j′) contains one job j ∈ {J12} and one job j′ ∈ {J21}; then, these n pairs should be sequenced optimally.

The job pairs can be divided into two groups G1, G2 with pu
                      ≤ qu
                      for all pairs in G1 and pu
                      > qu
                      for all pairs in G2. Let

                      for G2 pairs denote the idle time (depicted in Fig. 1) when these pairs are sequenced.

In order to form a complete schedule, the job pairs should be concatenated. When we concatenate different pairs, the following can be observed.


                     Observation 1: If we concatenate a (u, u′) pair in G1 and a (v, v′) pair in G2, the total idle time on both machines will be 
                        
                           
                              δ
                              u
                           
                           +
                           
                              θ
                              v
                           
                        
                      as shown in Fig. 2
                     . The idle time values do not change if the pair order is reversed.


                     Observation 2: If we concatenate any two pairs (i, i′) and (j, j′) belonging to the same group (e.g., G2) in either order, the total idle time on both machines will be max {θi, θj
                     } as shown in Fig. 3
                     . Informally, we can state that the max {θi, θj
                     } value absorbs the min {θi, θj
                     } value.

Observations 1 and 2 indicate that when two pairs belonging to different groups are concatenated their idle times are added; in contrast, when two pairs belonging to the same group are concatenated the smaller idle time is absorbed by the longer one. Therefore, in an optimal schedule, job pairs belonging to the same group should be concatenated prior to concatenating job pairs belonging to different groups. The next observation shows how to concatenate job pairs belonging to the same group.


                     Observation 3: When a partial sequence of the pairs in G2 is formed, the total idle time will be

                      when the |G2| pairs are sequenced so that the pair with the θ
                     max  value is sequenced in some position k (1 ≤ k ≤ |G2|), all pairs placed in positions

                     1 forms a single interval in the interior of the schedule. The preference for this schedule among a number of alternative schedules with the same total idle time is to facilitate the solution of the J2/prpt, nwt, mo1/C
                     max  problem (considered in the next section) by simply extending the algorithm for the J2/prpt, nwt/C

                      value is a lower bound on the total idle time because of the way the job pairs can be concatenated in a no-wait two-machine proportionate job shop. Therefore, the above constructed schedule will be optimal if jobs are paired so that the

                      value is minimal. We define a (u, u′) pair as a standard pair if job u ∈ {J12} and job u′ ∈ {J21} have the same position in the SPT sequence of J12 and the SPT sequence of J21 respectively. The next lemma shows the optimality of standard job pairing.

The running time of the J2_NWT algorithm is O(nlog n) dominated by the sorting of the 2n jobs and the sorting of the n pairs. The optimality of the J2_NWT algorithm follows from the

We close this section by comparing the solution approach for the J2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  problem with the solution approach for the corresponding open shop O2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  problem analyzed by Panwalkar and Koulamas (2014).

In the O2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  problem, the SPT sequence includes all jobs and the standard pairs are formed by pairing two consecutive jobs. We select the routing of each job and the optimality of the standard job pairing is relatively easy to prove. In contrast, in the J2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  problem, there are two distinct SPT sequences (one for the jobs in J12 and one for the jobs in J21) and the proof of optimality of standard job pairing is substantially more involved. Also, the predetermined routing in the J2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  problem necessitates a new original way of concatenating the standard pairs (compared to the O2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  problem).

In any instance of an J2/prpt, nwt, mo2/C
                     max  problem, jobs can be grouped into the J12, J21, J1 and J2 subsets; the J12, J21 subsets are defined as in Section 2 while the J1 (J2) subset contains jobs that require processing only on M
                     1 (M

                     2 with length

We now turn our attention to the J2/prpt, nwt, mo2/C
                     max  problem in which J1 ≠ ∅ and J2 ≠ ∅. We show next that the J2/prpt, nwt, mo2/C
                     max  problem is strongly NP-hard using a reduction from the strongly NP-hard 3-partition problem stated next.

Any pairing of jobs j ∈ {J12∪J21} is a standard pairing with n pairs because all jobs j ∈ J21 are identical; also, all n pairs belong to G2. The optimal θ↑ ordering of the n pairs yields the schedule depicted in Fig. 5
                      with

In this schedule, there is a single idle time interval on M
                     1 at the end of the schedule with length nB in which we can “fit” job

                     . Also there are n equal idle time intervals on M
                     2 of length B each. Therefore, if there exists a 3-partition, we can “fit” jobs 
                        
                           {

                           ,
                           
                           5
                           n

                      in these n intervals.

Let us now assume that there is no 3-partition. Observe that when

                      there is no idle time on either machine. The ordering of the n pairs in any order other than the θ↑ order will not generate a single idle time interval of length nB on M
                     1; the existence of such an interval provides the only possible way to schedule job

We showed that in the case of the J2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  problem, the complexity of the problem depends not only on the presence of missing operations but also on the allocation of the missing operations to the machines. We utilized the concept of standard job pairing to solve the J2/prpt, nwt/C
                     max  problem in O(nlog n) time when there are no missing operations and when all missing operations are on the same machine.

It is of interest to investigate the effectiveness of forming standard job pairs in a two-machine proportionate job shop with alternative objective functions such as the minimization of the total job completion time (∑Cj
                     ) leading to the J2/prpt, nwt/∑Cj
                      problem.

Let us revisit the 8-job numerical example in Section 2. If we form the standard job pairs and implement all 8 pyramid orders of the δ values, we obtain 
                        
                           
                              ∑
                              
                                 j
                                 =
                                 1
                              
                              8
                           
                           
                              C
                              j

                      as the best total job completion time value among these eight sequences (the makespan value for all 8 sequences is 97). An alternative reasonable schedule for the J2/prpt, nwt/∑Cj
                      problem is one in which the standard job pairs are sequenced according to the non-decreasing order of the job processing times which is the 1-2-3-4 pair sequence for our problem with 
                        
                           
                              ∑
                              
                                 j
                                 =
                                 1

                           440
                        
                     . On the other hand, if we form the non-standard job pairs (2, 1′), (3, 2′), (1, 3′), (4, 4′) and implement the 1-2-3-4 pair sequence we obtain 
                        
                           
                              ∑
                              
                                 j
                                 =
                                 1

                              C
                              j
                           
                           =
                           430
                        
                     .

These findings indicate that the standard job pairing may not be optimal for the J2/prpt, nwt/∑Cj
                      problem and that the analysis of the J2/prpt, nwt/∑Cj
                      problem will require substantial additional research effort and/or a complexity proof for the problem.

A similar conclusion can be reached for the J2/prpt, nwt, unsp/C
                     max  problem (where unsp stands for unequal machine speeds si
                     ) in which
