                  The presence of jamming usually degrades the detection performance of a detector. Moreover, sufficient information about the jamming may be difficult to be obtained. To overcome the problem of adaptive array signal detection in noise and completely unknown jamming, we temporarily assume the jamming belongs to a subspace which is orthogonal to the signal steering vector in the stage of detector design. Consequently, by resorting to the criteria of generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and Wald test, we propose two adaptive detectors, which can achieve signal detection and jamming suppression. It is shown, by Monte Carlo simulations, that the two proposed adaptive detectors have improved detection performance over existing ones.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Detection of a multichannel signal in unknown disturbance is a hot topic in the field of array signal processing. The most pioneering and prominent detectors are Kelly's generalized likelihood ratio test (KGLRT) [1], adaptive matched filter (AMF) [2,3], and adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) [4]. Particularly, in [1] the signal has a known steering vector but with an unknown amplitude, and the noise is Gaussian distributed with an unknown covariance matrix. To estimate the covariance matrix, it is assumed that a set of independent and identically distributed (IID) training data is available. Consequently, the KGLRT is proposed according to the GLRT criterion. The AMF is designed for the same detection problem in [1], but it is obtained according to the two-step GLRT (2S-GLRT) criterion [2,3]. The KGLRT and AMF are both conceived for the homogeneous environment, where the training data and the test data share a common noise covariance matrix. In contrast, the ACE is devised in [4] based on the GLRT criterion for the partially homogeneous environment, where the test data and training data share the same noise covariance matrix only up to an unknown scaling factor. The KGLRT, AMF, and ACE are all for the point-like target detection, which is further investigated in [5–8] recently. Moreover, the problem of distributed target detection is dealt with in [9–13, and the references therein].

Note that all the cited references above do not take into account jamming. In practice, however, there usually exists intentional or unintentional jamming [14]. Suppression of deceptive jamming is considered in [15], where the jamming is rejected by multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar with frequency diverse array (FDA). A mainlobe jamming suppression method is proposed in [16] based on eigen-projection and covariance matrix reconstruction. An intrusion detection system (IDS) framework for jamming detection and classification is proposed in [17] for wireless networks. The problem of detecting chaff centroid jamming is addressed in [18], and it is solved with the aid of the global positioning system (GPS) and inertial navigation system (INS). In [19] the jamming is deterministic and lies in a known subspace, many GLRT-based detectors are designed. For convenience, the jamming model in [19] is referred to as the subspace jamming, which is also considered in [20], but it is assumed to lie in both the test and training data, and a detector is proposed based on the method of sieves. The problem of signal detection in subspace jamming is further investigated in [21–24], where the potential target is spread in the range domain.

Remarkably, in most of the aforementioned references involved jamming it is assumed that some information about the jamming is known in advance. However, in practical applications it may be very difficult to obtain sufficient knowledge about the jamming. This brings a great challenge for signal detection. How to model the completely unknown jamming and devise effective detectors is the main motivation of this paper. Particularly, we focus on array signal detection of a point-like target in the presence of completely unknown jamming. An ad hoc model for the jamming is adopted at the stage of detector design. Precisely, we temporarily assume that it lies in a subspace orthogonal to the signal steering vector. Subsequently, we propose two adaptive detectors according to the GLRT and Wald test criteria. These two detectors admit certain intuitive physical interpretations, and they can achieve signal integration and jamming suppression simultaneously. For the performance evaluation, the cases of unknown (completely unknown or partially unknown) jamming and no jamming are all considered. It is shown that in the presence of unknown jamming, the two proposed detectors exhibit improved detection performance over the existing ones. Moreover, in the case of no jamming the proposed detector, derived according to the GLRT criterion, can still provide slightly better detection performance than the existing detectors in some situations.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates the problem to be solved. Section 3 gives the proposed detectors and shows some important properties of them. Numerical examples are provided in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the paper.

Besides the possible signal, the test data 
                        x
                      also contains disturbance 
                        d
                     , which consists of colored noise 
                        n
                      (including clutter and white noise) and jamming 
                        j
                     . The noise 
                        n
                      is modeled as a zero-mean complex circular Gaussian vector with an unknown covariance matrix 
                        R
                     , which is positive definite Hermitian. The jamming 
                        j
                      is completely unknown. For the detector design, we temporarily assume that 
                        j
                      is deterministic and lies in a subspace spanned by an

                     . For ULAs, the signal steering vector is often Vandermonde [25], such as (2), and the array response drops off very quickly if the angle between the jamming and signal exceeds the beamwidth [26]. Therefore,

                      is usually small, especially for the jamming with low or moderate power. Hence, (5) can be approximated by (3).

                         which, for convenience, is referred to as the adaptive orthogonal rejection detector (AORD).

It should be noted that the AORD does not need any information about the jamming, whereas the detector in [22] must know the subspace where the jamming lies in advance.

For clarity, the algorithm representations for the proposed AORD and AOPD are given in Table 1
                        .

In this subsection, we first give equivalent forms of the AOPD and AORD, which bear certain intuitive physical interpretations. Based on these equivalent forms, we show the block diagrams of them to indicate how they work.

The AOPD in (16), after some algebra, can be expressed as

Noticeably, we know from (19) and (22) that both the AOPD and AORD perform data whitening, jamming suppression, signal integration, and energy test. To gain a deeper understanding, Fig. 1
                         gives the block diagrams of the AOPD and AORD, where the notation

It is worth noting that the AOPD in (16) ensures the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property w.r.t. the unknown covariance matrix 
                           R
                        , which is shown in Appendix B. Moreover, the AORD in (18) also has the CFAR property, which can be obtained by directly using the results in [22].

We compare the proposed detectors with the well-known KGLRT and AMF. Several types of jammings, as well as the case of no jamming, are considered. The reason why we choose these two detectors to be compared is that they, likes the proposed AOPD and AORD, do not need a priori information about the jamming, and they are CFAR w.r.t. the noise covariance matrix

                         The results in Fig. 2 highlight that the AORD outperforms the AOPD, and the latter in turn exhibits higher PD than the KGLRT and AMF. Particularly, the performance improvement of the AORD w.r.t. the KGLRT in terms of SNR is roughly 4 dB at

                        Fig. 3
                         displays the PDs of the detectors in the presence of deterministic interference under different JNRs. It is seen that the JNR has a significant effect on the detection performance of the detectors. The PDs of all the detectors decrease, as the JNR increases. Moreover, the proposed AOPD and AORD have considerable performance improvement over the KGLRT and AMF.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the PDs of the detectors under different normalized spatial frequencies of the deterministic jamming. At each jamming angle, the detection performance of the AOPD and AORD is superior to that of the KGLRT and AMF, and the AOPD has the best performance. Remarkably, there is a notch for each PD curve. Precisely, when the target is close to the jamming (that is, they nearly have the same normalized spatial frequency), there is a significant performance loss for each detector. This seems reasonable, since the nearer the target and jamming in the space is, the more difficult it is to distinguish them.


                        Fig. 5
                         illustrates the PDs of the detectors under different normalized spatial frequencies of the target in the presence of deterministic jamming. The results shown in Fig. 5 are similar to those in Fig. 4. Precisely, there is a notch for the PD curves, and the AORD has the best detection performance.

For random jamming, two subcases are considered. One is phase-random, and the other is totally random. Precisely, a phase-random jamming has a form of (25), but its normalized spatial frequency

                         investigates the detection performance of the detectors in the presence of totally random jamming. It is seen that the AORD and AOPD have significant performance improvement w.r.t. the KGLRT and AMF. Moreover, the KGLRT has worst performance, and it has a lower velocity than the other detectors in the increase of the PD as the SNR increases.

Two kinds of partially known deterministic jamming are investigated in this subsection. One is that the jamming lies in the subspace 
                           〈

                           〉
                        . That is to say, the jamming can be represented by (3). For convenience, we call this type of jamming the orthogonal jamming. The other type of jamming is satisfied the generalized eigenrelation (GER) [26], and it is referred to the GER jamming. Precisely, the GER jamming

                         is for the GER jamming. It is shown that in the cases of these two kinds of partially known jammings, the AORD has the highest PD, followed in sequence by the AOPD, KGLRT, and AMF. In addition, the performance improvement of the AORD and AOPD w.r.t. the KGLRT and AMF is higher for the GER jamming than for the orthogonal jamming in the parameter setting.

The results highlight that the proposed detectors have detection performance close to the KGLRT and AMF in the absence of jamming. Moreover, for the chosen parameters the AORD can even exhibit a slightly higher PD than the KGLRT when

Note that in all the simulations, the values of N (the number of the sensors) and L (the number of the training data) are fixed. Some other simulations, not presented here for brevity, verify the superiority of the AORD and AOPD to the KGLRT and AMF under other values of N and L.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have proposed two adaptive detectors, namely, the AOPD and AORD, for array signal detection in the presence of completely unknown jamming. The AOPD and AORD can achieve signal detection and jamming suppression without requiring any information about the jamming. Moreover, these two adaptive detectors are CFAR w.r.t. the unknown noise covariance matrix. Remarkably, the AOPD and AORD have improved detection performance over the KGLRT and AMF, no matter whether the jamming is deterministic or random. It is found that the power of the jamming has an important effect on detection performance. In addition, the AORD can also provide a slightly higher PD than the KGLRT and AMF in some cases when no jamming exists.

                              In this supplementary material, we compare the detection performance of the proposed detectors AOPD and AORD with the well-known KGLRT and AMF with values of the number of the sensors and the number of the training data, different from that adopted in the main body in the paper. The results show that for the chosen parameter setting the AOPD and AORD still have better detection performance than the KGLRT and AMF.
