                  In general, a portfolio problem minimizes risk (or negative utility) of a portfolio of financial assets with respect to portfolio weights subject to a budget constraint. The inverse portfolio problem then arises when an investor assumes that his/her risk preferences have a numerical representation in the form of a certain class of functionals, e.g. in the form of expected utility, coherent risk measure or mean-deviation functional, and aims to identify such a functional, whose minimization results in a portfolio, e.g. a market index, that he/she is most satisfied with. In this work, the portfolio risk is determined by a coherent risk measure, and the rate of return of investor’s preferred portfolio is assumed to be known. The inverse portfolio problem then recovers investor’s coherent risk measure either through finding a convex set of feasible probability measures (risk envelope) or in the form of either mixed CVaR or negative Yaari’s dual utility. It is solved in single-period and multi-period formulations and is demonstrated in a case study with the FTSE 100 index.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Identifying agent’s risk preferences has been and continues to be one of the main thrusts of decision making under uncertainty. von Neumann and Morgenstern (1953) were the first who proposed four axioms on a preference relation: completeness, transitivity, continuity, and independence and showed that these axioms admit a numerical representation in the form of expected utility. Due to its mathematical elegance and relative simplicity, the expected utility theory (EUT) still remains a normative model of the theory of choice despite continuing debate and criticism since its inception. On the one hand, empirical evidence (so-called paradoxes) shows that some of EUT’s axioms are consistently violated (see, e.g., Allais paradox (Allais, 1953)), whereas, on the other hand, even if the four axioms are agreed to follow, an agent faces an exhaustive questionnaire procedure for identifying his/her utility function. A considerable number of alternative theories of choice have emerged only to encounter their own paradoxes and to reveal that they hardly have advantage over the EUT; see dual utility theory (Röell, 1987; Yaari, 1987), weighted expected utility theory (WEUT) (Fishburn, 1983), rank-dependent (anticipated) utility theory (AUT) (Quiggin, 1993), prospect theory (Fox & Poldrack, 2009; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), cumulative prospect theory (CPT) (Kahneman & Tversky, 1992), regret theory (Loomes & Sugden, 1982), disappointment theory (Bell 1985), mean-deviation theory (Grechuk, Molyboha, & Zabarankin, 2012), to mention just a few.

While all utility theories begin with axioms on a preference relation and then derive numerical representations for those axioms, the recently emerged theory of coherent risk measures (Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, & Heath, 1999) introduces the notion of acceptance set
                     
                        A
                     for risky alternatives (random variables) and measures risk of a random variable (r.v.) X as the minimum amount of cash C that makes 
                        
                           X
                           +
                           C
                        
                     acceptable. In other words, a risk measure ρ of X can be determined as 
                        
                           ρ
                           (
                           X
                           )
                           =
                           min
                           {
                           C
                           ∈
                           R
                           |
                           X
                           +
                           C
                           ∈
                           A
                           }
                        
                     . If 
                        A
                     is a closed positively homogeneous convex cone containing all nonnegative r.v.’s and no strictly negative r.v.’s, then ρ is a positively homogeneous convex functional and is called coherent risk measure (Artzner et al., 1999). In this case, it admits a dual representation in the form 
                        
                           ρ

                              X
                              )
                           
                           =

                                 Q
                                 ∈
                                 Q
                              
                           
                           E
                           
                              [
                              Q
                              
                                 (
                                 −
                                 X
                                 )
                              
                              ]
                           
                           ,
                        
                     where 
                        Q
                     is a closed convex set whose elements are nonnegative r.v.’s with expected value of 1 (constant 1 is also included). The set 
                        Q
                     is called risk envelope and each its element can be interpreted as a “distortion” of the underlined probability measure. Namely this interpretation ties risk preferences to a certain convex set of probability measures. In other words, the agent can specify “scenarios” of probability measures and can evaluate risk of an r.v. X as the negative expected value of X under the worst-case probability measure over the convex hull of the specified probability measures; see, e.g., Lesnevski, Nelson, and Staum (2007). In fact, there is a one-to-one relationship between coherent risk measures and risk envelopes.

Given the elegant risk-envelope characterization and the attractive properties (convexity, positive homogeneity, monotonicity, and constant translation) of coherent risk measures, the agent may reasonably assume that his/her risk preferences have a numerical representation in the form of a coherent risk measure ρ, which he/she would use in a variety of decision making problems: optimal portfolio selection (Miller & Ruszczyński, 2008), optimal risk sharing (Jouini, Schachermayer, & Touzi, 2008), optimal hedging (Rudloff, 2009), etc. Also,

                           ρ
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                     plays the role of a utility functional of an r.v. X, and the question of identifying ρ(X) is equivalent to the one of identifying the utility functional 
                        
                           U
                           (
                           X
                           )
                           =
                           −
                           ρ
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                     . One of the approaches to finding ρis to solve the inverse portfolio problem: if the agent minimizes the coherent risk measure ρ over some set of r.v.’s (portfolio returns), and X
                     * is known to be optimal, i.e. the rate of return of an optimal portfolio, then ρ can be recovered from X
                     * through determining the risk envelope 
                        Q
                     associated with ρ. This approach was demonstrated in identifying a deviation measure in a Markowitz-type portfolio selection problem; see Grechuk and Zabarankin (2014) and (Zabarankin & Uryasev, 2014, Section 8.2.4). However, in general, the results in (Grechuk & Zabarankin 2014) cannot be used directly to solve the inverse portfolio problem with an unrestricted class of coherent risk measures, since deviation measures correspond one-to-one to averse measures of risk (Rockafellar, Uryasev, & Zabarankin, 2002, 2006a),
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        In Rockafellar et al. (2002, 2006a), they are originally called strictly expectation bounded risk measures.
                      which, in contrast to coherent risk measures, are not required to preserve monotonicity of preference relations; see Rockafellar et al. (2002, 2006a) and (Zabarankin & Uryasev, 2014, Section 2.3). In fact, these two classes of risk measures have a nonempty intersection called coherent averse measures of risk that correspond one-to-one to lower range dominated deviation measures (subclass of general deviation measures). For example, the standard deviation is not lower range dominated, and as a result, it has no counterpart in coherent risk measures through the one-to-one correspondence established in (Rockafellar et al., 2002, 2006a). Also, the work (Grechuk & Zabarankin, 2014) assumes X
                     * to be SSD-efficient to guarantee the existence of a law invariant solution, which is no longer required here.

This paper solves the inverse portfolio problem with coherent risk measures in both single-period and multi-period formulations. In the single-period formulation, a set 
                        X
                     of feasible portfolio rates of return at some time moment t
                     0 in the past is given, and the agent’s optimal portfolio rate at t
                     0 is known to be 
                        
                           
                              X
                              *
                           
                           ∈
                           X
                        
                     . The inverse problem is then finding a coherent risk measure ρfrom a given class 
                        
                           R
                           ,
                        
                     determined by some additional requirements/constraints on agent’s risk preferences, such that X
                     * is agent’s optimal choice. It is shown that if a law-invariant solution to the inverse problem exists, it can always be represented in the form of mixed CVaR, and a technique for explicitly computing that mixed CVaR is suggested.
                        3
                     
                     
                        3
                        In Grechuk and Zabarankin (2014), the technique for identifying deviation measures requires X
                           * to have unique risk identifiers with respect to all CVaR’s, which considerably limits the number of appropriate X
                           * (especially of real-life instruments). Here, the corresponding technique works for arbitrary X
                           *.
                      Moreover, if an exact solution does not exist, the technique returns the “best” approximate mixed CVaR. In the multi-period formulation, a sequence of agent’s optimal portfolio rates of return is given (each of which is from a given feasible set), and 
                        
                           ρ
                           ∈
                           R
                        
                     is sought to make all those portfolio rates optimal (or at least close to optimal).

The rest of the paper is organized into four sections. Section 2 introduces coherent risk measures. Section 3 formulates and solves the inverse portfolio problem with coherent risk measures, whereas Section 4 constructs approximate solutions in the form of mixed CVaR. Section 5 concludes the work and proposes future research directions.

                     . The set 
                        Q
                     in (3) can then be interpreted as the set of Radon–Nikodym derivatives of probability measures, or scenarios, which the agent considered “likely,” and the risk measure in (3) is then interpreted as the average loss under the “worst” scenario. If the supremum in (3) is attained for some Q, it is called a risk identifier for X (Rockafellar, Uryasev, & Zabarankin, 2006c). The set of all risk identifiers for X is denoted by 
                        
                           
                              Q

The agent may combine any requirements (a)–(d) on the existing preferences with any assumption (i)–(iii) on the form of coherent risk measure. In general, let 
                        R
                     be the set of all coherent risk measures satisfying agent’s requirements/assumptions. For example, 
                        R
                     can be a set of all law-invariant coherent risk measures such that

If 
                        R
                     is not a singleton, how to choose a particular risk measure 
                        
                           ρ
                           ∈
                           R
                        
                     ? One of the approaches is to recover ρfrom the inverse portfolio problem: the agent assumes that the rate of return of the portfolio that he/she either believes to be optimal or is relatively satisfied with minimizes ρ over the set 
                        X
                     . The portfolio optimality conditions are then used to find the risk envelope associated with ρ, and ρis given by (3).

Once ρ is recovered, the agent may use it to find an optimal portfolio over a different set 
                        X
                     of portfolio rates of return, X, and subject to additional constraints, e.g. E[X] ≥ π for some π > 0; see e.g. Miller and Ruszczyński (2008). However, the knowledge of ρ is critical far beyond portfolio selection. One example is optimal risk sharing between two agents who use law-invariant coherent risk measures ρ
                     1 and ρ
                     2 as numerical representations of their attitudes towards risk. Namely, given agents’ endowments X
                     1 and X
                     2, it is often possible to find agents’ shares Y
                     1 and Y
                     2 of the aggregate endowment 
                        
                           X
                           =

                     such that

                           =
                           X
                           ,
                        
                     but ρ
                     1(Y
                     1) < ρ
                     1(X
                     1) and ρ
                     2(Y
                     2) < ρ
                     2(X
                     2), see Jouini et al. (2008). Another example is hedging in an incomplete market, when, in contrast to a complete market, not every contingent claim can be replicated with the existing set of assets, and the agent needs to find a hedging strategy that minimizes the risk (measured by ρ) of the residual of a replicated claim, see Rudloff (2009).

                           A risk-neutral probability measure is a measure under which the expected discounted future price of any instrument is equal to the current one, see Föllmer and Schied (2011).
                         By the fundamental theorem of asset pricing (see, e.g., Föllmer and Schied (2011, Theorem 1.7)), the existence of the risk-neutral probability measure is equivalent to the no-arbitrage assumption, i.e. no portfolio has excess return non-negative with probability 1 and strictly positive with positive probability. If this assumption does not hold, the investor can borrow at the risk-free rate unlimited amount of money and can invest in the risky assets making portfolio risk as small as desired, so that there is no optimal portfolio, and the inverse portfolio problem (19) has no solution.

This section seeks to find law-invariant solutions to the inverse portfolio problem (19). The following proposition establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence.

                                    The inverse problem (19) has a solution in the form of worst-case mixed CVaR (7).

                                          A master fund of positive/negative type is an optimal mean-deviation portfolio that has positive/negative unit price and zero weight in the risk-free asset, see Rockafellar et al. (2006b, Definition 2, p. 758). It is a “tangent portfolio” on the mean-deviation positive/negative efficient frontier of risky assets.

                                        Then condition (b) in Proposition 2 does not hold, hence there are no law-invariant solution to the inverse problem (19).

There are two reasons for presenting Example 1(i), where X
                        * is chosen to be the rate of return of a mean-variance portfolio. First, Markowitz’s mean-variance portfolio is often viewed as a reference result in the modern portfolio theory and capital asset pricing. However, the standard deviation (or, equivalently, variance) is not, in fact, a measure of risk but rather the one of deviation. It does not preserve monotonicity of a preference relation and, as a deviation, cannot be used alone to express risk aversion. In this case, the question of interest is not whether the Markowitz’s mean-variance portfolio is desirable, but rather what a “rational equivalent” of the mean-variance model in the class of risk measures, which are monotone and risk averse, is. In other words, the inverse portfolio problem allows to uncover the “rational side” of the mean-variance model. Second, Example 1(ii) shows that for X
                        * of a real-life instrument, e.g. the FTSE 100 index, the inverse problem typically may not have exact law-invariant solution. In this case, the investor has two options:

                           
                              (a)
                              Solve the inverse problem to find an exact non law-invariant solution, or

Find a law-invariant risk measure, which solves the inverse problem approximately.

Option (a) is addressed in Section 3.3, whereas option (b) is pursued in Sections 4.1–4.4.

If the inverse problem (19) with 
                           X
                        given by (18) has no law-invariant solution, it can always be solved in the class of all coherent measures provided that the market is arbitrage-free.

                           14
                           A market is considered to be the set of one risk-free and n risky financial instruments, whereas an arbitrage-free market is the one in which no portfolio has excess rate of return non-negative with probability 1 and strictly positive with positive probability; see Föllmer and Schied (2011).

Under the conditions in Proposition 1, Proposition 6 describes the best possible solution for the inverse portfolio problem (19). In terms of acceptance sets, it returns the coherent risk measure ρ, for which the given rate of return X
                        * along with α 
                        X
                        * for any α > 0 is acceptable, but any other r.v. X is not.

In general, the set 
                           Q
                        in Proposition 6 is not unique: if the risk neutral Q
                        * is not unique, the investor can choose either a “favorite” or the maximal possible set 
                           Q
                        such that the corresponding coherent risk measure is a solution to the inverse portfolio problem (19).

The solution (33) can be viewed as a robust approach to identifying risk preferences: it includes the Radon–Nikodym derivatives of all possible scenarios, for which given rate of return X
                        * belongs to investor’s acceptance set, i.e. X
                        * is not worse than the risk-free rate. Observe that (33) is independent of the feasible set

In general, the system (40) may have no solution in the following cases:
                     
                        
                           (a)

                              such that (24) holds, the inverse problem (19) has no solution in the form of mixed CVaR (5), and therefore, there is no solution in the form (14). This is the case in Example 4 (ii).

For a general probability space, the inverse problem (19) may have no solution in the form (14) even if conditions (a)–(e) in Proposition 2 hold.

If the probability space Ω is finite uniform with T atoms, and the inverse problem (19) has a law-invariant solution, then the solution can be chosen in the form (14) with

In these cases, the investor may seek to find an approximate solution to the inverse problem (19). There are at least three different approximation approaches.

                        . In Grechuk and Zabarankin (2014), the problem (41)was formulated for deviation measures (Rockafellar et al., 2002, 2006a) and was reduced to finding a piecewise linear approximation of a convex function on (0, 1). The drawback of this approximation approach is that it requires knowing the exact solution ρ
                        *, which, moreover, may not exist.

An alternative formulation of the inverse problem (19) is: given optimal (preferred) rate of return

In contrast to the existing SSD-efficiency tests Grechuk (2014); Kopa and Chovanec (2008); Post (2003), (51)has the advantage to return an explicit optimal risk measure (or dual utility) for SSD-efficient portfolios as well as an “approximately optimal” risk measure for inefficient ones. In the later case, the optimal value in (51) can also be interpreted as a measure of SSD-inefficiency for

                        is in the interior of 
                           
                              Y

                        so that an exact solution of the inverse problem (19) does not exist and we seek to find an approximate one. The problem (42) is then asks for a point on the boundary of 
                           
                              Y
                              ,
                           
                        which is “closest” to the given point 
                           
                              y

                                 ^
                              
                              )
                           
                        in its interior, where a measure of closeness can be defined in different ways. In contrast, the problem (45) requires finding a hyperplane 
                           A
                        that contains 
                           
                              y
                              (
                              
                                 X
                                 ^
                              
                              )
                           
                        such that the distance from 
                           A
                        to the supporting hyperplane parallel to 
                           A
                        is as small as possible.

The first approach identifies a risk measure ρ
                        1 such that optimal portfolio with ρ
                        1 is as “close” to 
                           
                              X
                              ^
                           
                        as possible, i.e. a similar portfolio is optimal, whereas the second approach finds a risk measure ρ
                        2, such that risk
                        
                           
                              
                                 ρ
                                 2
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 
                                    X
                                    ^
                                 
                                 )
                              
                           
                        is as close to the optimal risk as possible, i.e. a given portfolio is almost optimal.

This work has proposed to identify agent’s risk preferences in the form of a coherent risk measure by solving the inverse portfolio problem in single-period and multi-period formulations. The negative coherent risk measure is viewed as agent’s utility functional and can be recovered either through identifying a convex set of admissible probability measures (so-called risk envelope) or through finding either the risk profile in mixed CVaR or the weight function in negative Yaari’s dual utility (the last two representations are law-invariant coherent risk measures and may not exist). The inverse portfolio problem assumes that the rate of return of the portfolio that the agent is most satisfied with minimizes the sought coherent risk measure and is given as a sequence of known random variables (r.v.’s) for the multi-period case (single r.v. for the single-period case). In Examples 1–4 and 6, the coherent risk measure is recovered in all three forms based on the weekly historical rates of return of a portfolio formed by 92 stocks from the FTSE 100 index for the period from 3-January-2011 to 30-June-2014. As a future research, the suggested inverse portfolio problem approach can be extended to identifying risk preferences in the frameworks of other decision theories.
