                  The main goal of this study was to numerically quantify risk of duodenal stump blowout after Billroth II (BII) gastric resection. Our hypothesis was that the geometry of the reconstructed tract after BII resection is one of the key factors that can lead to duodenal dehiscence. We used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with finite element (FE) simulations of various models of BII reconstructed gastrointestinal (GI) tract, as well as non-perfused, ex vivo, porcine experimental models. As main geometrical parameters for FE postoperative models we have used duodenal stump length and inclination between gastric remnant and duodenal stump. Virtual gastric resection was performed on each of 3D FE models based on multislice Computer Tomography (CT) DICOM. According to our computer simulation the difference between maximal duodenal stump pressures for models with most and least preferable geometry of reconstructed GI tract is about 30%. We compared the resulting postoperative duodenal pressure from computer simulations with duodenal stump dehiscence pressure from the experiment. Pressure at duodenal stump after BII resection obtained by computer simulation is 4–5 times lower than the dehiscence pressure according to our experiment on isolated bowel segment. Our conclusion is that if the surgery is performed technically correct, geometry variations of the reconstructed GI tract by themselves are not sufficient to cause duodenal stump blowout. Pressure that develops in the duodenal stump after BII resection using omega loop, only in the conjunction with other risk factors can cause duodenal dehiscence. Increased duodenal pressure after BII resection is risk factor. Hence we recommend the routine use of Roux en Y anastomosis as a safer solution in terms of resulting intraluminal pressure. However, if the surgeon decides to perform BII reconstruction, results obtained with this methodology can be valuable.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Computer simulations today are almost common medical tool used for prediction and sophisticated medical diagnostics. In conjunction with modern medical devices used for data acquisition computer simulation can be used for theoretical consideration and education, and also as a patient specific medical diagnostical tool. Multidisciplinary approach in medicine is necessary due to need of cooperation between medical doctor, computer scientist and engineer [1]. Using this modern tool medical doctors can perform their interventions more easily and safely. Due to limited hardware resources as well as software and medical acquisition devices, in the beginning computer scientists were not able to simulate complicated systems such as soft tissue organs with many physiological functions. That is the reason why first steps were made in the field of orthopedics and maxillofacial surgery where the problem could be solved with less powerful computer simulation [2,3]. In this study advantages of multidisciplinary approach were shown in the field of gastrointestinal surgery. We used three-dimensional computer simulation in regard to the real anatomical state in a human body. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine with sensitive, motor and secretory functions regulated by neurological and hormone-dependent mechanisms [4–8]. Very important role of duodenum and pyloric sphincter becomes especially evident after surgical interventions on the gastroduodenum [9,10].

Many authors researched complex feedback mechanisms in physiological state, but in this study our interest was to investigate how surgical intervention changes these mechanisms [11–13]. Experienced surgeons ex juvantibus know that geometry of gastroduodenum after Billroth II gastric resection is very important, but we tried to precisely numerically quantify influence of this factor [14]. According to literature insufficient attention has been paid on how geometry of the reconstructed gastroduodenal region influences pressure distribution and afferent loop syndrome that may cause duodenal stump blowout.

There are various types of reconstruction after distal gastric resection, although Billroth II with omega jejunal loop and Roux en Y are most common. Billroth II gastric resection represents anastomosis (artificial connection) between the gastric stump and a loop of jejunum (gastrojejunal anastomosis, gut to side), and this type of intervention is the subject of our study. The afferent loop conducts duodenal juice toward the gastric stump and the rest of the intestine. The distal or efferent loop is the part of the duodenum that is downstream of the anastomosis, and it conducts duodenal and gastric stump content distally to the small intestine. The anastomosis is antecolic when the jejeunal loop is positioned in front of the transverse colon, or the jejunal loop may be brought up posteriorly through an opening made in the transverse mesocolon (retrocolic anastomosis). There are other methods of gastrointestinal tract reconstruction after gastric resection, and one of these is called Roux en Y gastrojejunoanastomosis, in which the small bowel is cut distal to the ligament of Treitz, and the anastomosis is created between the distal limb of the jejunum and remaining gastric tissue (or esophagus in cases of total gastrectomy). The proximal limb of the jejunum is positioned downstream to the jejunum at a distance of at least 45cm, where a termino-lateral end-to-side anastomosis is created. Dehiscence is a surgical complication in which surgical suture ruptures. In both of surgical interventions mentioned above dehiscence is the most dangerous complication (leading to peritonitis and sepsis) [15]. It is well known that after Billroth II gastric resection duodenal stump leakage and blowout is much more frequent than in case of reconstruction using Roux en Y jejunal limb [16].

Standard reoperative procedure in case of afferent loop syndrome involves conversion to Roux en Y type of reconstruction by cutting afferent limb immediately proximal to an obstruction and creating gastrojejunal reanastomosis using 45–75cm long loop of the jejunum. Roux en Y gastrojejunostomy is also better in controlling dumping and bile reflux gastritis. Because there are not enough data from definite prospective randomized studies, surgeon preference often dictates the type of reconstruction [17]. Billroth II gastric resection is surgical intervention where omega jejunal loop is attached to gastric remnant (gastrojejunal anastomosis) and this type of intervention was the subject of our study (Fig. 1
                     ). We tried to get numerical proof that pressure in the afferent loop after Billroth II gastric resection is relatively high and it could be one of the main factors that cause duodenal dehiscence.

The length of the afferent loop is variable and depends on anatomical variations (e.g. length of the mesenterium of the small intestine and adhesions), as well as the surgeon's preferences. There is a hypothesis that increased intraluminal pressure in the afferent loop is the dominant cause of duodenal stump dehiscence, that was our main subject of interest in this study. Possible causes of afferent loop syndrome are the length of afferent jejunal loop, narrow gastrojejunoanastomosis, insufficient peristaltic movements, etc. [18–20].

Our presumption was that too long afferent loop in cases of surgery without Braun anastomosis between afferent and efferent loop can cause increased pressure in duodenal stump. Afferent loop should be tension free after surgery, thus should not be too short because it could lead to vascular insufficiency. Surgeon should be aware that conversion (in case of surgical complication) into Roux en Y reconstruction would be very difficult or impossible if gastrojejunal anastomosis with omega jejunal loop is created near ligament of Treitz. Inclination of gastrojejunal anastomosis should facilitate efficient emptying of afferent loop and also directs flow of gastric remnant content into efferent loop. Except increased duodenal intraluminal pressure there are a few other factors that have contributing role in pathogenesis of this complication, such as location and extent of cancer, non-adequate surgical technique (excessive dissection of duodenal stump; ischemia and necrosis of tissues caused by suturing too close or ligating too tight; local bleeding; increased tension of afferent loop, inappropriate usage of diathermy and coagulation), the presence of bacteria colonizing digestive tract, duodenal tissue quality, comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, pneumonia, asthma, malnutrition, hypoproteinemia) [21].

Efferent loop is the part of the intestine positioned downstream of the anastomosis, and it conducts duodenal and gastric stump content distally to the small intestine. Position, shape and diameter of the anastomosis have influence on gastric and afferent loop emptying. Main factors that can interfere afferent loop emptying are obstructions from adhesion, kinking at the anastomosis, internal hernia, stomal stenosis, cancer recurrence, anastomotic edema or local inflammation [22].

Suture dehiscence with consecutive peritonitis can occur as a complication after surgical intervention. Duodenal stump blowout is considered as a serious postoperative complication, with high mortality rate [23,24]. Duodenal suture dehiscence after distal gastric resection has been interesting subject for many researchers, but still many pathological mechanisms causing this postoperative complication remain unclear [25].

There are just a few attempts of numerical solution to this type of problem [26]. We present numerical methods in order to quantify various parameters that cause duodenal stump dehiscence.

In this study we used finite element computational fluid dynamics simulation, as well as ex vivo experiments on animal model.

Preoperative three dimensional FE models were created using the DICOM data acquired from MSCT scanner. For that purpose 64 slice Toshiba Aquilion MSCT was used. We used the DICOM images of patients who were prepared for the resection of the stomach for cancer, and it was part of their routine preparations, regardless of our study. Personal data of patients were not used or presented. Three dimensional reconstruction and noise filtering were performed with our own software [27,28]. Using initial models we performed virtual Billroth II surgical intervention by changing the geometry in order to get adequate postoperative models. This was done using Femap software. In all computer simulations the walls of organs were considered as rigid, only the fluid was simulated. Our objective was to investigate how afferent loop length and inclination of gastrojejunal anastomosis as main geometrical parameters affect pressure distribution in postoperative state. We tried to focus on models with extreme geometry in that sense. For this purpose several models were created. Thus our attention was on models with maximal and minimal afferent loop length and with inclination of gastrojejunal anastomosis that provides minimal (negative inclination) and maximal (positive inclination) flow through anastomosis (Fig. 2
                        ).

We have carried out numerical simulation of gastroduodenal region before the surgery and it was the starting point for a virtual resection (Fig. 3
                        ).

All the models were segmented into finite elements in the same way, thus virtually the same density of the mesh was achieved. We used TetGen for segmenting the models into tetrahedrons [29], and our own software for splitting tetrahedrons into bricks [27,28]. We used bricks for calculations because of numerical stability [30]. Average number of nodes in one FE model is about 650,000. Boundary conditions and loads were prescribed to all the models using data from literature [31]. Our solver PAKF considered transit of chyme as a viscous incompressible fluid flow governed by the Navier–Stokes equations as well as continuity equation

                        =1, 2, 3 [32,33]. The first equation represents balance of linear momentum, while the Eq. (2) expresses the incompressibility condition. For calculating transport of saliva, pancreatic juice and bile, mass was also taken into account thus additional transport equation was implemented into solver. We had assumption that the concentration of these juices has no influence on gastric fluid flow (i.e. a diluted mixture is considered). The mass transport process is governed by the convection–diffusion equation:

Our solver was compared to analytical solution for shear stress and velocities for Poiseuille flow. The finite element equations are solved with respect to velocities after the pressure was eliminated by a penalty procedure. The solution is obtained by use of an incremental–iterative approach and implicit integration scheme over time. The system of algebraic equations of balance for a finite element, and for a time step and equilibrium iteration “m”, can be written as:

We used the material of animal origin, duodenal segment of domestic pig (Sus domestica), Landrace race, 1–2 years of age, weighing 50–80kg, male and female, that were kept and fed in the traditional manner on a commercial farm. Animals were not sacrificed for the purpose of the experiment, but due to the use of meat for commercial purposes, as it is usual in the slaughterhouses. The study was conducted with the permission of the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medical Sciences in Kragujevac, the number 01-2759/5. Isolated non-perfused ex vivo porcine duodenal segments were used to create a model of the afferent loop. We used porcine bowel models because of their similarity to human bowel in terms of histopathology. We used duodenal specimens of 7 animals. Duodenal segment was removed immediately after sacrifice of the animals and immersed in 0.9% NaCl saline. With respect to the absence of blood flow, the experiment was performed within an hour after sacrifice. Duodenal stump was sutured in four types of the suturing:
                           
                              1.
                              interrupted, single layer suturing

Short description: the bowel end was cleaned. Stay sutures are inserted in the mesenteric and anti mesenteric borders and seromuscular sutures are inserted and tied in an interrupted fashion (Lembert suturing).

continuous, double layer suturing

Short description: continuous seromuscular sutures started at mesenterial border, reaching antimesenterial end and tied. Than, suture line was reinforced with second layer of inverting seromuscular sutures inserted in an continuous fashion, completing the double layer.

continuous in the first layer with interrupted in the second layer

Short description: continuous seromuscular suturing started at mesenterial border, reaching antimesenterial end and tied. Finally, anastomosis was reinforced with inverting seromuscular sutures inserted in an interrupted fashion, completing the double layer.

Moynihan suturing

Short description: the bowel end is held in a non-crushing clamp and suturing started at the antimesenteric border. Suturing was performed as a continuous over-and-over suture incorporating the full thickness of the duodenal wall, starting from mesenteric border and reaching antimesenterial border. Then, the clamp removed and the stitch returned as a continuous stitch to the begining and tied. The second layer of seromuscular sutures are inserted in an interrupted fashion invaginating the anastomosis.

For all the models suturing material we used was the same, Maxon 3.0 and was done manually. For each type of suturing we used ten samples.

As a part of our experimental equipment we used a MPXA6115A/MPXH6115A series piezoresistive transducer, that is a monolithic, signal conditioned, silicon pressure sensor. This sensor combines advanced micromachining techniques, thin film metallization, and bipolar semiconductor processing to provide an accurate, high level analog output signal that is proportional to the applied pressure. In this experimental setup the MASTERFLEX EASY-LOAD II PUMP HEAD is used for gradually increased the pressure in the tissue specimen. The pressure control is achieved by adjusting the constant flow rate of pump on 480ml/min value into ex vivo preparation. The pressure increase during time due to the outflow is closed by tissue and it keeps liquid inside them all time before tissue damage. The pressure data is recorded using MPX 2100 pressure sensor.

                     cm2/s. Daily secretion before surgery: saliva 1000ml, gastric secretion 1500ml, bile and pancreatic secretion together 2000ml, Brunner's gland secretion 200ml [31]. Boundary conditions are pancreatic juice and bile Q

                     =1.0(g/cm3). Software used for simulation is in-house software PAKF which was verified in number of publications [32,33]. Rigid walls were assumed during all simulation. Data in the simulation were modified according to BII gastric resection. Each simulation was considered as a steady state. It can be observed that velocities in the zone of duodenal stump suturing are lower than in the rest of the afferent limb (Fig. 4a). Particle tracking was done for pancreatic juice and bile as well as for saliva (Fig. 4b).

Mass concentration distribution for pancreatic juice and bile was done independently from saliva (Fig. 5
                     , Case A).

Pressure distribution after Billroth II gastric resection for all three cases: A–C are presented in Figs. 6–8
                     
                     
                     .

For each of the models it is obvious from the simulation results that the maximum pressure is reached in zone of the duodenal stump the suturing. The pressure is decreasing continuously toward gastrojejunal anastomosis. In the zone of duodenal stump suturing Case C has the lowest pressure value while Case A has the highest pressure value. Difference in the maximum pressure for these models is about 30%.

In order to calculate and validate numerical simulation with experiment we generated simplified example of porcine bowel model for prescribed maximal pressure of 292mmHg for Moynihan suturing. The elasticity modulus was assumed to be E
                     =1MPa. Stress distribution for this case is presented in Fig. 10.

According to our measurements suturing type with maximal resistance to dehiscence was Moynihan suturing and minimal continuous, double layer suturing. For each sample graphic pressure versus time has the similar shape. Duodenal segment sample with Moynihan suturing has been shown in Fig. 9
                     
                     . Average value of dehiscence pressure for each type of the suturing is presented in Table 1

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

According to our simulation the duodenal pressure before the surgical intervention was approximately 2–5mmHg, which is in agreement with the literature data [12]. Comparison of the duodenal pressure distribution prior to and after surgery suggested that after Billroth II surgical procedure the duodenal pressure was about ten times higher than before surgery. It was probably one of the contributing factors that caused dehiscence, namely, the bowel wall was not prepared to tolerate high pressure and duodenal tissue ruptured at the sites of surgical sutures. According to our experimental models results in any case there was no rupture of the surgical suture material, but always duodenal wall ruptured.

Our results showed that geometry of reconstructed GI tract after Billroth II gastric resection has a great influence on the pressure distribution at duodenal stump. We sorted our postoperative models in regard to afferent loop length and inclination of gastrojejunal anastomosis. In all models maximum pressure was in the region of suturing line of duodenal stump. Results revealed graduation of maximal pressure in regard to model's geometry. Most preferable model, in regard to pressure distribution, was with shortest afferent loop and positive inclination, and the least preferable model was with longest afferent loop and negative inclination. Certainly, the surgeon must keep in mind that too positive inclination of gastrojejunal anastomosis could lead to well known nicking of afferent loop and consequent afferent loop syndrome [22].

Difference of the maximal pressure between most and least preferable models was about 30%.

If surgery is done technically correct with all variants of reconstructed GI tract geometry, maximal duodenal stump pressure is four to five times lower then the pressure level that could lead to duodenal dehiscence according to our experimental measurements. Our conclusion is that these two geometrical factors (afferent loop length and inclination of gastrojejunal anastomosis) have no crucial influence on duodenal stump dehiscence, although surely have influence in conjunction with other predisposing factors. In our study we have neglected the factor of afferent loop obstruction caused by suturing in more than one layer, kinking or herniation of afferent loop, stenosis of gastrojejunal anastomosis, volvulus of afferent limb, adhesions involving afferent limb, because all of them are well known causes of afferent loop syndrome [34].

Our measurements were performed on ex situ models and correspond to an ideal situation where the surgeon has sufficient duodenal tissue for safe placement of one of these suturing types. If there is not enough duodenal tissue because of the extent of the pathological process, the surgeon is forced to perform stitching of “difficult duodenal stamp” using Nissen's or Bancroft's procedure. In this case, our assumption is that the dehiscence occurs at lower pressure level.

Using the experience during this surgical intervention the surgeon always tries to create most preferable GI reconstruction with relatively short afferent loop and positive inclination between gastric remnant and afferent loop. Sometimes, however, it is not possible due to patient specific anatomy. In that case the surgeon should choose the closest geometrical solution and suturing type that can withstand pressure level predicted by computer simulation. If computer simulation predicts duodenal hypertension, according to our study, it is desirable to use Moynihan's suturing in conjunction with well known methods of duodenal hypertension prevention such as Devin's duodenal stump drainage or Braun's anastomosis [35,36]. Our results suggest that it is better to perform the reconstruction with Roux en Y anastomosis, instead of Billroth II with omega loop after distal gastric resection. It is well known that afferent loop syndrome (partial or complete obstruction of the afferent jejunal limb with high intraluminal pressure) occurs almost exclusively after Billroth II reconstruction, and rarely after Roux en Y reconstruction [14,37]. The probable reason is the following: in BII resection significantly higher secretion of gastric remnant appears, compared to Roux en Y type of reconstruction, and also with Roux en Y type of reconstruction the gastric and pancreatic juices bypass the gastric stump and go directly to the intestine. This is the reason why some authors declare that even there is no need for nasogastric tube placement in the patients with Roux en Y reconstruction unlike Billroth II reconstruction type [16]. Meta-analysis that included a large number of randomized controlled trials have yielded significant advantage of Roux en Y reconstruction type after distal gastric resection in comparison with Billroth I and Billroth II reconstruction in terms of reflux esophagitis and gastritis [38].

Except geometric factors that we studied, there are several others that can lead to duodenal stump blowout such as location and extent of cancer, non-adequate surgical technique (excessive dissection of duodenal stump; ischemia and necrosis of tissues caused by suturing too close or ligating too tight; local bleeding; increased tension of afferent loop, inappropriate usage of diathermy and coagulation), the presence of bacteria colonizing digestive tract, duodenal tissue quality, comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, pneumonia, asthma, malnutrition, hypoproteinemia) [21].

All of computer simulations in this study analyze more–less favorable geometry of gastro-duodenal segment after surgical reconstruction, as well as it's small variations. In such cases extremely high pressures leading to dehiscence will not be developed, as simulation clearly shows. Measurements on materials of animal origin only give one of the parameters that is very important – the pressure value at which a dehiscence occurs. Experimental measurements on the isolated intestine model are not control, but rather a supplement to computer simulation in the sense that if the simulation shows duodenal hypertension then, based on data derived from measurements, it is necessary to select the type of suturing that is resistant to high intraluminal pressure at the duodenal stump.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The methodology presented in this study can be used for theoretical considerations in order to get general suggestions for safe surgical interventions; it could be used in education, as well as patient specific predictive tool. The aim of methodology described here is not to replace the surgeon in making decision, but to assist him or her in safer surgery. Certainly, the basic principles of surgical work, particularly the maintenance of vascularization and gentle surgery must be followed. Our general conclusion is that Billroth II gastric resection with omega jejunal loop reconstruction has disadvantage taking into account increased afferent loop pressure after surgery that may lead to afferent loop syndrome and duodenal dehiscence.

Therefore, our suggestion is routine use of Roux en Y type of reconstruction after distal gastric resection If surgeon decide to perform BII type of reconstruction, findings obtained by this preoperative simulation are very useful in terms of minimizing the risk of duodenal dehiscence.

All authors declare that they do not have any conflict of interests.
