                  Scarce healthcare resources require carefully made policies ensuring optimal bed allocation, quality healthcare service, and adequate financial support. This paper proposes a complex analysis of the resource allocation in a hospital department by integrating in the same framework a queuing system, a compartmental model, and an evolutionary-based optimization. The queuing system shapes the flow of patients through the hospital, the compartmental model offers a feasible structure of the hospital department in accordance to the queuing characteristics, and the evolutionary paradigm provides the means to optimize the bed-occupancy management and the resource utilization using a genetic algorithm approach. The paper also focuses on a “What-if analysis” providing a flexible tool to explore the effects on the outcomes of the queuing system and resource utilization through systematic changes in the input parameters. The methodology was illustrated using a simulation based on real data collected from a geriatric department of a hospital from London, UK. In addition, the paper explores the possibility of adapting the methodology to different medical departments (surgery, stroke, and mental illness). Moreover, the paper also focuses on the practical use of the model from the healthcare point of view, by presenting a simulated application.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A hospital department may face the situation when patients are turned away because all beds are occupied, and the corresponding healthcare service is thus postponed due to the insufficient number of available beds. An insufficient financial support or a poor resource management often causes this situation. On the other hand, an over-provision of hospital beds or an unrealistic health service time is a waste of the already limited resources. Accordingly, there is need for a complex involvement bringing together under the same umbrella advanced analytical methods and machine learning techniques to help make better decisions regarding the allocation and use of hospital beds in order to improve patient care and save money.

A wide range of different techniques have been used and reported in the literature. [1] presents a model of the cost of treating stroke patients within a healthcare facility using a mixture of Coxian phase type model with multiple absorbing states. A non-homogeneous discrete time Markov chain incorporating time-dependent covariates is developed in [2] to model the patient flow in a cost or capacity constrained healthcare system. A multi-objective comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization with a representation scheme based on binary search for bed allocation problem in general hospital is presented in [3]. [4] developed a semi-closed migration network to capture patient flow into the clinic, and between the clinic and hospital.

Although queuing models are widely used in industry to improve customer service, the number of applications in healthcare, however, is relatively small. This is probably due to the different nature of the two domains, the client-patient equivalence being however difficult to be generally accepted. Previous works [5,6] have introduced M/PH/c and M/PH/c/N queuing models in order to optimize the use of hospital resources both in a loss model and in an extended model providing an extra waiting room. A multi-objective decision aiding model based on queuing theory and goal programming is introduced in [7] for allocation of beds in a hospital. A queuing approach based on non-homogeneous arrival patterns, non-exponential service time distributions, and multiple patient types along with a spreadsheet implementation of the resulting queuing equations is used in [8] to increase the capacity of an Emergency Department. In [9] a decision support system based on the Erlang loss model is developed to evaluate the size of nursing units.

Compartmental models have previously been shown to provide a suitable description of the patient flow through a hospital department, especially for geriatric medicine. Starting with a deterministic two-compartment mathematical model [10], further progress occurred when stochastic models along with mixed exponential distributions, continuous-time Markov model and Bayesian belief networks have been proposed [11–14].

This paper proposes a flexible strategy to improve the hospital management regarding its two main aspects: (a) bed allocation policy, and (b) financial resource utilization. First, it uses results from queuing theory to model the patient flow, where a Poisson process describes the patients’ arrivals, hospital beds are servers, and the length of stay is modeled using a phase-type distribution. Second, in conjunction with the queuing system, a compartmental model describes the hospital department. Finally and most importantly, the previous approach has been enriched with the support of the evolutionary paradigm used to optimize both the bed allocation policy and the resource utilization. In addition, a “What-if” analysis has been performed to explore in depth the various possible options available for the hospital management. The main contributions of the paper are twofold: first, the evolutionary-based optimization of the hospital management, and, secondly, the “What-if” analysis allowing the evaluation of different available options.

The theoretical model refers to a M/PH/c queuing system in which M denotes Poisson (Markov) arrivals, the service distribution is phase-type [15], the number of servers is c, and no queue is allowed. In such a loss model in which the customers that find all the servers busy are lost for the system, λ represents the Poisson arrival rate, and the phase-type service has the probability density function given by:

In other words, B(c, a) represents the fraction of customers that is lost by the system [16,17]. Note that the above results apply when the system is in statistical equilibrium, i.e., after a sufficiently long period of time, Pj

Basically, there are three fundamental quantities of interest for queuing models:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 L – the average number of customers in system.


                                 W – the average time spent in system by an arbitrary customer.


                                 ρ – the server occupancy.

Among useful relationships between the above characteristics, we mention:
                           
                              •

                                 B(c,
                                 a)], representing the average number of customers in system, also known as Little’s formula.

                                 ⋅[1−
                                 B(c,
                                 a)].

                                       =

One of the two main goals of this study is an evolutionary-based optimization of the bed occupancy management by estimating the model’s parameters c, λ and τ, in order to obtain:
                           
                              •
                              An acceptable threshold for the delay probability B(c, a), seen as the suitable proportion of refused patients which the system is prepared to tolerate.

The corresponding average time spent in system.

The corresponding average number of customers in system.

A main concern in proposing a model to solve real-world issues, especially in healthcare, is to provide the best service to customers with minimum costs by using the maximum utilization of existing resources. In queuing models, this could be “translated” by maintaining the lost requests (lost potential customers) at a minimum level with minimum costs. Following [5], a base-stock policy approach [18] is used to set up an associated cost model to balance the fraction of customers that is lost by the system against the service costs.

As it was stated above, the model’s parameters c, λ and τ are supposed to be variable. This study focuses on finding their (near) optimal values providing a trade-off between serving costs and penalty costs corresponding to unsatisfied demands.

In order to define the associated cost model, let us consider that the number c of servers comprises both the number of occupied beds and the number of idle beds, ready to be used in emergencies.

In a similar fashion to the newsvendor model [18], the cost model envisages the two following parameters:
                           
                              •
                              A holding cost of h units per day per empty (non used) server.

A fixed penalty cost of π units per unsatisfied orders.

With the aim of improving servers occupancy and resource utilization in the long-run department activity, the cost per day under the base-stock policy with server level c can be expressed as a function of the queuing system parameters c, λ, τ, and the cost model parameters h, π, by:

                                 }
                              
                           
                        
                     

Based on the cost function g(c, λ, τ, h, π), the issue of optimizing the inventory level, in other words, the resource utilization, is equivalent to a minimization problem, i.e., to find c, λ, τ, h, and π in order to minimize the cost (fitness) function g.

A controversial method still in use in healthcare to measure the inpatients activity is based on the turnover per allocated bed per year, given by the ratio between the number of admissions per year and the number of allocated beds per year. Thus, the average turnover T is given by 
                           
                              T
                              =
                              365
                              ·
                              λ
                              /
                              c
                           
                         admissions/patients per bed [19]. The cost function along with the average turnover represent the main economic parameters measuring the efficiency of the resources utilization.

One of the ideas to bear on patient flow modeling is to consider compartmental models, which have been shown to provide an efficient proven description of patient dynamics at least for geriatric medicine [10]. Briefly, patients are admitted to the first compartment (e.g., acute care). Some are successfully treated and discharged, and, unfortunately, some die. A third group may need additional treatment, and thus, these patients are transferred to another section (e.g., rehabilitation); patients may be discharged from this compartment, or die there. This process may continue, depending on the specific case, three to six compartments being considered [12,20,21]. The situation describing the simplest but the most common case, a classical two-compartment model, is depicted in Fig. 1
                        .

The admission policy envisages the situation where admissions occur at random (i.e., Poisson arrivals), such an assumption being reasonable for a stable hospital system.

Regarding the service time distribution, such compartmental models, either discrete-time deterministic or continuous-time stochastic, may be regarded as phase-type [15] with the number of components equaling the number of compartments. These distributions describe the time to absorption of a finite Markov chain in continuous time, when there is a single absorbing state and the stochastic process starts in a transient state.

Computer-based patient modeling sounds well and represents a major concern in patient management. The optimization method chosen in this case involves the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) to estimate an acceptable threshold for the delay probability B(c, a), and to minimize the cost function g(c).

GAs are natural computing algorithms consisting of the following components: populations of chromosomes, selection according to fitness, crossover to produce new offspring, and random mutation of new offspring. The algorithm consists of the following steps [22,23]: (Step 0) – the data are encoded in a vector form and the recombination and mutation rates are picked; (Step 1) – the population, consisting of a certain number n of chromosomes, is chosen; (Step 2) – the fitness function is computed for each chromosome; (Step 3) – the iteration takes place through the following steps (selection, crossover and mutation) until n chromosomes have been generated; (Step 4) – replacing the current population by the new one, and (Step 5) – using the termination criterion to stop the evolutionary process.

We present below the corresponding evolutionary algorithm.


                        GA algorithm
                        
                           
                              1.
                              A population consisting of a certain number n of chromosomes is randomly chosen from an appropriate interval.

Using the tournament selection operator, n chromosomes are chosen for reproduction; one chromosome can appear several times in the newly formed population.

Using the recombination probability, m parents are chosen for reproduction.

The newly formed offspring replace the m parents.

The new population is formed by the (n–m) chromosomes that were not chosen for reproduction plus the newly formed m offspring.

Using the mutation probability pm
                                 , the normally distributed mutation operator is applied on the whole population. If the fitness of the mutant is better than the original chromosome’s fitness, then the mutant replaces the original in the population.

The cycle is repeated until the termination criterion is reached.


                           
                              
                                 1.
                                 A problem related to the convergence speed of a GA is the appropriate choice of the population size n. Using a heuristic evaluation, with population sizes ranging from 50 to 150 chromosomes, the best performance has been obtained for n
                                    =100 chromosomes.

Another problem that arises in the use of GAs is the appropriate choice of the parameters defining the variations operators. We considered the parameter tuning, using the whole (total) arithmetic recombination with the crossover rate pc
                                    
                                    =0.35 and parameter α
                                    =0.3, and the non-uniform (normally distributed) mutation with mutation rate pm
                                    
                                    =0.4.

Using a heuristic evaluation, with the number of generations ranging from 50 to 150, the manual inspection of the values of the fitness functions (either B or g), combined with different thresholds indicated that 100 is the (near) optimal value.

Since the distribution of data is not always normal (Poisson arrivals, phase-type service), the appropriate intervals (search space) for the corresponding chromosomes were estimated as <mean±1.96×SD>, seen as substitutes of the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the mean of each parameter.

The management of hospital beds is an important nowadays task, and various models have been proposed, mostly based on operations research techniques (e.g., stochastic processes, queuing theory, etc.) [1,2,5–7,12,13,21]. This approach involve the construction of the corresponding mathematical model, which is time and resources consuming, due to the computational and statistical nature of most of these techniques. An attractive and effective alternative to this classical approach is represented by the use of GAs. Some of the reasons to use GAs are: (a) they can solve any optimization problem described with chromosome encoding, (b) the method is very easy to understand and implement without deep mathematical knowledge, (c) the number of parameters can be very large, and (d) there are no major constraints for the fitness function. Due to their efficacy, computation speed and wide range of applicability, we have chosen to use GAs as optimization technique for hospital bed occupancy and resource utilization.

The first task of this research is to optimize the bed-occupancy management by estimating the sufficient number of beds in order to maintain at a tolerable level the number of rejected requests.

When using the GA approach, a chromosome is represented by a vector (c, λ, τ), with the genes c, λ and τ belonging to specified domains (95% CI) matching real-world medical data. The corresponding fitness measure is given by the delay probability B(c, a). Since, in this context, the main task is maintaining the rejection probability level as low as possible, the objective (fitness) function B(c, a) has to be minimized, depending on different thresholds.

The second aim of the study is to estimate the optimal model parameters enabling the best healthcare service to patients with maximum resources utilization, in other words, to find the optimal balance between holding costs and penalty costs.

Technically, a chromosome is represented this time by the vector (c, λ, τ, h, π), the fitness function being now represented by the corresponding cost function g.

In the end, health professionals can use the model to answer several questions regarding the management of hospital departments (arrival policy, average length of stay, optimum bed occupancy, costs, etc.) enabling them to anticipate hospital bed allocation and expected healthcare costs.

“What-if analysis” has been finally performed with the purpose of exploring the effects on the outcomes of the queuing system and resource utilization through systematic changes in the input parameters. Given an input change (parameters c, λ, τ, h, and π), this sensitivity analysis detects how the two main models’ performance measures: (a) the delay probability B, and (b) the cost function g are affected by this change, and how could they be tuned to respond to the management optimization issue.

The methodology presented above is illustrated using bed-occupancy data collected at the Department of Geriatric Medicine – St. George’s Hospital, London (1969–1984) [19], and January 2000 [24]. The healthcare assistance consisted of acute, rehabilitative and long-stay medical service.

During these years, different admission policies and inpatient management were considered. Admission experienced annual changes, with periodic increases and decreases due to both management policies and seasonal events (Christmas, Easter, influenza epidemic, etc.).

Three different styles were adopted for the inpatient management: (a) one-compartment model (combined acute, rehabilitative and long-stay) in 22% of cases, (b) two-compartment model (combined acute and rehabilitative wards, with separate long-stay) in 38% of cases, and (c) three-compartment model (separate acute, rehabilitative and long-stay wards) in 25% of cases. As it can be seen, the two-compartment case, depicted in Fig. 1, is the most prevalent.

As inventory policy, the department allocated, on average, 186 beds per year. Whatever the case, a mean arrival rate equaling λ
                        =5.9 patients per day and a mean length of stay equaling τ
                        =24.9days were found to be well described by the data [5].

Regarding the associated cost model, since the data came from the National Health Service (NHS), the profit was assumed zero. Taking into account the general practice in those times, the cost parameters were estimated as follows [5]:
                           
                              •
                              The total cost per patient per day is £168 (£50 are incurred with respect to the bed, and £118 with respect to the treatment).

The holding cost is h
                                 =£50 per day.

The penalty cost π is computed as follows. Considering that the total cost of turning away a patient may equal the cost per day multiplied by the expected length of stay, and the penalty cost represents 25% of the total cost of turning away a patient, we can estimate the penalty cost π
                                 =168×24.9×0.25=£1046.

It is worth noting that this assumption is only indicative, estimating the lowest approximation for cost based on the assumption that penalty may be broadly regarded as lost revenue incurred when a patient is turned away due to no empty beds available.

Unlike the usual patients, geriatric patients have to face different healthcare experiences regarding hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, long-term care, assisted living, etc., resulting in different flow patterns (admission, length of stay), compartmental type, and costs. In this regard, when adapting the model from geriatrics to other medical departments, although the underlying paradigm can be kept, the practitioners have to anticipate a more dynamic patient flow, with different values of the corresponding parameters, and the cost function components [19].

Theoretically, changing policies might lead to a reduction in length of stay (or indeed arrival rate). When hospital administrators seek to improve the patient management, whatever the department specialty, they find the difficulty to implement the change. This is true especially when recommended changes directly affect the patient quality of healthcare (e.g., length of stay). On the other hand, the arrival rate is influenced by external factors, and cannot be directly controlled by healthcare professionals. Accordingly, in addition to the difficulty of such an approach regarding possible changing policies, the lack of confidence in the success of proposed changes puts a serious obstacle on continuous improvement efforts.

According to the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey of Hospitals [25], the corresponding parameters referring to surgery were estimated as λ
                           =16.14 patients per day, τ
                           =5.5days, and c
                           =150 beds -community hospitals (one-compartment system).

The data originates from the UK’s Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database and concerns stroke patients [26,27]. The corresponding parameters were estimated as λ
                           =286.2 patients per day, τ
                           =14.29days, and c
                           =5587 beds -three-compartment system.

The data originate from the Center for Mental Health Policy and Services Research (CMHPSR), Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania (Medicaid) [28]. The corresponding parameters were estimated as λ
                           =1.907 patients per day, τ
                           =1151days, and c
                           =562 beds -three-compartment system.

The inpatient hospital costs represent the largest component of healthcare expenditures in most developed countries nowadays. The inpatient costs are far from being uniformly and undoubtedly assessed. According to [29,30], the average hospital adjusted expenses per inpatient day was $1730 throughout USA, and £225 in UK. Consequently, the actual inpatient costs are estimated by each hospital. While the cost function g may be used as it is, the parameters h and π may be adjusted by each user following the same paradigm as in the geriatric model.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In what follows, the evolutionary based optimization is used to provide an efficacious management of bed occupancy and resources utilization, enabling thus the hospital manager to balance the beds inventory against the cost of refusing patients’ access to healthcare facilities and service.

In this subsection, the experimental results envisaged the use of the proposed GA to estimate the near optimum values of the parameters c, λ and τ to maintain at a tolerable level the probability of lost demands B(c, a). In this regard, the aim is to minimize the objective (fitness) function B, taking into account different constraints (thresholds) regarding its range of values. There is no consensus among practitioners regarding what qualifies a certain percentage of lost demands as a tolerable level in geriatric medicine, but it suggests that running with percentage occupancy above eighties leads to significant increases in rejection of patients [31]. We consider the highest threshold equaling 10% as a maximum rejection tolerable level, with the corresponding percentage occupancy ranging between 88% and 95%.The corresponding search spaces for the chromosomes encoding the queuing model parameters are the following:

                                 [24.5, 25.5].


                        Table 1
                         illustrates the GA approach to optimize the queuing model by presenting some values of the rejection/delay probability B(c, a) in ascending order as function of different values of the queuing system parameters c, λ, and τ, and different thresholds.

The GA approach has revealed that the minimum rejection probability (1.5% of patients being turned away) can be achieved with 146 beds, arrival rate around 5.22 patient/day, and an average service time (length of stay) equaling 25days, figures close to the standard of a geriatric department. It is worth noting that this potential managing performance was obtained using the GA approach for 146 beds only, much lower than the standard 186 beds. Moreover, it is worth noting that, from the evolutionary experiment, it resulted that the queuing system is extremely flexible since the same rejection probability of 5% can be achieved either with 138 beds or 164 beds, but depending on different arrival rates and service time (5.29/25.7 vs. 5.18/31.04). Taking into account this observation, the manager can juggle the number of beds according to the given situation.

Next, Table 2
                         presents some values of the models’ performance measures L, W, and ρ as functions of c, λ, and τ.

The first row displays the system characteristics corresponding to the minimum proportion of refused patients, obtained using GA. In addition, we can see from this table that the bed occupancy is not directly related to the number of allocated beds, in the sense that, as we would expect, the greater the number of beds, the lower the bed occupancy. For instance, the same bed occupancy equaling around 93% is obtained both with 132 beds and with 165 beds, the other parameters playing, naturally, a significant role. Irrespective of different values of c, λ, and τ, comparable with the common practice, the average time spent by a patient is close to the average value (24.61 vs. 24.9), while the average number of patients varies noticeably (from 121 to 154). It follows that, given the framework complexity, it is difficult to manage the bed allocation without the aid of computer simulation and optimization.

In what follows, we illustrate the evolutionary-based optimization of the corresponding healthcare costs, thus facilitating an efficient access to medical service. The experimental results envisaged the use of the proposed GA to estimate the near optimum values of the parameters c, λ, τ, h and π in order to maintain at a minimum feasible level the cost function g, but with a reasonable proportion of patients turned away. In this context, the goal is to minimize the objective (fitness) function g. In addition to the cost minimization, the corresponding average turnover per allocated bed per year (T) is also computed. Table 3
                         presents some values of the cost function g in ascending order, and the corresponding turnover per allocated bed, as functions of different values of the queuing system parameters c, λ, τ, and the associated costs h and π. Since the chromosomes may be initialized in searching spaces where optimal solutions are likely to be found, we considered the penalty cost ranging between £1046 and £2050 [5], the starting value equaling the default estimation (the lowest approximation for the penalty cost).

The evolutionary approach has revealed that the minimum healthcare cost (£610.91) can be achieved with 149 beds, arrival rate around 5.51 patient/day, an average service time (length of stay) equaling 25days, a holding cost h
                        =£30, and a penalty cost π
                        =£1250. These figures are close to the standard of a geriatric department, excepting the number of allocated beds (149), much lower than the yearly average (186), and the holding cost ratio π/h
                        =41.67 better than the optimal one reported in literature [5], equaling 40.

The model we have developed, based on the strengths of the GAs, can be used as supporting tool to efficiently improve the stock policy of a geriatric department, by simultaneously using all the parameters defining the system. It can be extended without major difficulties to different medical departments.

We envisaged a “What-if analysis” using 35 simulated data in the following context: c

The purpose of this sensitivity analysis is twofold:
                           
                              (a)
                              First, to explore how the delay probability B is affected by changing the number of beds, the arrival, and the mean service time. Two scenarios have been considered in this respect: (a) evaluating B(c, τ) for constant avg. λ
                                 =5.31 patient/day, and (b) evaluating B(λ, τ), for avg. c
                                 =141 beds. The first scenario enables simulated experiments with different number of beds and mean medical service time for a fixed arrival rate λ
                                 =5.31 patient/day, which is close to the customary case. These changes are feasible for the hospital management, as long as it cannot change, practically, the arrival rate. The second scenario enables the exploration of the influence of the balance between the arrival rate and the mean service time upon the delay probability for a fixed number of c
                                 =141 beds (inventory frequently encountered in reality).

Second, to investigate the change of the cost per day under the base-stock policy g depending on the changes of both the department facilities/policy (number of beds and mean service time) and the cost model parameters h and π. Two scenarios have been considered in this respect: (a) evaluating g(c, τ) for constant avg. π
                                 =£1534, h
                                 =£64, λ
                                 =5.31 patient/day, and (b) evaluating g(π, h), for constant avg. c=141 beds, λ
                                 =5.31 patient/day, and τ
                                 =25.54days.

Inspired by the indifference curves paradigm [32] and by the previous work [5], we can analyze under what conditions we are indifferent between neighboring values of the control variables (c, τ), (λ, τ), and (π, h), regarding both the delay probability and cost function. Extrapolating the level/contour curves concept, the underlying equations involved in this approach are: B(c, τ)=
                        B(c
                        +Δ
                           c
                        , τ
                        +Δτ), B(λ, τ)=
                        B(λ
                        +Δλ, τ
                        +Δτ), g(c, τ)=
                        g(c
                        +Δ
                           c
                        , τ
                        +Δτ), and g(π, h)=
                        g(π
                        +Δπ, h
                        +Δ
                           h
                        ), where Δ represents the increasing factor. Geometrically, it is about “plateaus” with some possible “peaks” and “ravines”, illustrating the relative “flatness” of the response variables B and g. We have illustrated the indifference surfaces through 3D graphics obtained with the freely available R programming language. R is widely used in Statistics and Data Mining, has extensive documentation and active online community support, being a very good environment for statistical computing and graphics.

The results corresponding to the first two scenarios described in (a) are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3
                        
                        .

The graph and the corresponding data suggest that we may be indifferent to the delay probability B if:
                           
                              •
                              The number of beds ranges from 130 to 164 (Δ
                                    c
                                 
                                 =34) and the mean service time is 25days (Δτ
                                 =0.02), thus yielding avg. B
                                 =2.02%, SD=0.38%.

The number of beds ranges from 132 to 142 (Δ
                                    c
                                 
                                 =10) and the mean service time is 25.36 (Δτ
                                 =1.78), thus yielding avg. B
                                 =8.88%, SD=0.83%.

Accordingly, the hospital manager may choose to keep a number of beds equaling 130 for an expected lost demand percentage not exceeding, on average, 2% and assuming a mean service time equaling 25days. On the other hand, 132 beds are sufficient to keep the lost demand percentage around 9%, supposing an increase of the mean service time up to 25.36days. It is worth noting that the significant increase of the lost demand was affected by a relative small increase of the mean service time. These observations are consistent with the analysis based on the indifference surfaces that highlights the two “plateaus” of the graph of B.

The graph and corresponding data, along with the indifference surfaces analysis, suggest that we may be indifferent to the delay probability B if:
                           
                              •
                              The arrival rate ranges from 5.15 to 5.68 (Δλ
                                 =0.53) and the mean service time is 25 (Δτ
                                 =0.02), thus yielding avg. B
                                 =1.96%, SD=0.36%.

The arrival rate ranges from 5.05 to 6 (Δλ
                                 =0.95), the mean service time is 25.35 (Δτ
                                 =1.78), thus yielding avg. B
                                 =8.88%, SD=0.82%.

These results are consistent with the previous ones. Thus, for a mean service time equaling 25days, the average lost demand percentage is around 1.96%, increasing to 8.88% for a mean service time equaling 25.35days, insignificantly depending on the arrival rate.

In both above scenarios, the hospital manager can control the delay probability mainly through the mean service time. Note that the arrival rate is naturally governed by randomness and cannot be directly controlled. From the above results, it follows that the delay probability is mainly sensitive to the change of the mean service time and is not significantly affected by the relative changes of the number of beds and arrival rate. This fact is also confirmed by Table 2, regarding the influence of c and λ upon the average number of patients in hospital.

The results corresponding to the second two scenarios described in (b) are illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                        .

The graph and corresponding data, along with the indifference surfaces analysis, suggest that we may be indifferent to the cost function g if:
                           
                              •
                              The number of beds ranges from 130 to 164 (Δ
                                    c
                                 
                                 =34) and the mean service time is 25 (Δτ
                                 =0.2), thus yielding avg. g
                                 =£632.15, SD=£14.62.

The number of beds ranges from 125 to 142 (Δ
                                    c
                                 
                                 =17) and the mean service time ranges from 25 to 25.67 (Δτ
                                 =0.67), thus yielding avg. g
                                 =£1513.11, SD=£92.83.

As evidenced by the fist scenario, a balanced policy regarding the number of beds and the mean service time, with emphasis on the latter one, may lead to a lower lost demand percentage, with corresponding lower penalty cost. Analogously, a bed allocation equaling 130 and a mean service time no more than 25days may lead to minimum lost demands and minimum costs for the hospital.

This graph and corresponding data, along with the indifference surfaces analysis, suggest that we may be indifferent to the cost function g if:
                           
                              •
                              The penalty cost ranges from £1046 to £1650 (avg. π
                                 =£1332, SD=£205) and the holding costs are £30, thus yielding avg. g
                                 =£629.19, SD=£13.53.

The penalty cost ranges from £1450 to £2050 (avg. π
                                 =£1750, SD=£216) and the holding costs is £105, thus yielding avg. g
                                 =£1530.95, SD=£84.17.

Consequently, the hospital manager may choose to keep the holding costs equaling £30 for an expected average cost function g
                        =£629.19, irrespective of the penalty cost no more than £1650. On the other hand, the holding costs above £105 may lead to an increase of the function cost up to £1614.93 (avg. g
                        =£1530.95) if penalties increase up to £2050.

As an overall conclusion, the substantial difference between the holding cost and the penalty cost makes the weight of the rejected applications B to significantly surpass the weight of the number of empty beds, as revealed by formula (4). Under these circumstances, the hospital manager can choose the adequate minimum number of beds and a suitable mean service time, in order to minimize the costs and maintain a proper medical care, by keeping at a low level the percentage of the lost demands.

Note that the penalty cost is just indicative, being based on the assumption that penalty may be regarded in some sense as lost revenue incurred when a patient is turned away (no empty beds available).

Unlike the previous approach focused on queuing techniques only, the methodology proposed in this paper inherits the versatility and efficiency of the evolutionary computation, encoding in a complete and unitary manner by means of the chromosome, the whole information provided by both the queuing side (c, λ, τ) and cost side (h, π). Instead of providing partial results regarding the optimization of the inventory or of the costs, by considering as control variables just the number of beds and the penalty to holding cost ratio, we considered all the five parameters defining the degrees of freedom for the model, providing solutions for optimum inventory and costs, and potential valuable suggestions resulting from the “What-if” analysis.

Different approaches originating in the machine learning techniques and operations research brought a significant contribution to providing practical ways of managing patients in a more efficient manner [33]. An effective patient flow can reduce the unwanted and potentially harmful case of rejected patients, the overcrowding of hospital departments, inefficient beds allocation, increasing the healthcare quality and providing a patient-friendly environment.

From a theoretical point of view, the people involved in the hospitals management need to: (a) understand and evaluate the patient flow parameters, the available inventory and financial resources, (b) identify the actual possibilities of amending the decision parameters (e.g., length of stay, availability of unstaffed beds, costs per occupied/unstaffed bed, penalty costs, etc.), (c) estimate/forecast changes in the government healthcare philosophy regarding bed stock and financial support, and (d) analyze and estimate how the calendar and time of day affect admissions.

The implementation of the model should encompass the following steps: (a) analysis of the data records regarding the patient flow in order to estimate the queuing model parameters and the corresponding searching space (GA implementation), (b) analysis of the bed allocation history (constrains in bed stock, bed closure, bed crisis, etc.) allowing the use of different scenarios regarding the bed inventory (“What-if analysis”), (c) analysis of the changes in the hospital management philosophy regarding the allocated budget in order to estimate an appropriate mean service time τ, affordable number of occupied/unstaffed beds, affordable average cost for inpatient day, and (d) analysis of the time series regarding the pattern of hospital admissions in order to identify its principal components (trend, cyclical, seasonal, and irregular) allowing to forecast its behavior and to propose optimal future costs policies.

There are, generally, two kinds of parameters defining the underlying queuing model. Thus, there are parameters the healthcare professional cannot change, such as the arrival rate or the mean service time (length of stay). We consider these parameters as “objective” parameters. It is noteworthy that even these objective parameters may change in some circumstances. For instance, the arrivals can vary due to external factors (e.g. demographics, epidemiology, or perceptions). On the other hand, even for particular procedures, the lengths of stays for two different patients were seen to differ by more than one week [34]. The other parameter type that can be changed by the healthcare professionals in some circumstances is seen as “subjective” parameter.

For the evolutionary-based optimization, we implemented a standard GA [35] in Java. The model described in the paper can be implemented using freely available software (e.g., Java, R programming language, ECJ (ECLab-George Mason University (http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/), etc.), or a classical software package (e.g., MATLAB/Genetic Algorithm Solver). It is worth mentioning that one can use, for instance, the moving average forecast to estimate a certain parameter at time T, as average of the last m observations, where m is the moving average interval chosen by the user, if the mean does not change dramatically. MS Excel provides an easy way to calculate the moving average of a time series.

To illustrate the above considerations, we present a fictitious example consisting in three different bed allocation policies. Imagine a steady-state geriatric department with the “objective” parameters λ
                     ≈5.22 patients per day and length of stay τ
                     ≈25days, and the “subjective” parameter c within the range 120–170. The penalty cost π equals the default value of £1046 [5]. Applying the mix queuing/GA model, we simulated three different scenarios regarding the choice of the control (“subjective”) parameters c and τ, along with the corresponding rejection probability B, carried load L (average number of inpatients), and incurred costs, computed as: (a) total costs TC=£168×
                     L (cost per patient per day multiplied by the average number of inpatients); (b) penalty cost PC corresponding to the fraction of lost patients computed as PC=
                     π
                     ×
                     B; (c) costs of unstaffed beds UBC=£50×
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 c
                              
                              
                                 ∼
                              
                           
                        
                      (cost per bed multiplied by the number of unstaffed beds 
                        
                           
                              
                                 c
                              
                              
                                 ∼
                              
                           
                        
                     ). The results are displayed in Table 4
                     .

In order to reduce the healthcare costs, which are a current subject of political debates, the managers commonly seek to allocate the minimum possible number of beds (adding extra beds, if necessary), although the opposite situation can also be imagined. Assume that in this case the default number of beds is c
                     =132. Using the optimization model, they may face the following alternatives:
                        
                           –
                           
                              Scenario #1: Choosing the smallest number of bed c
                              =132. The drawbacks of such a choice consist of the largest fraction of rejected patients (B
                              =5.7%), with possible negative consequences regarding the public perception, and the largest costs (TC=£20,674, PC=£59.62); UBC=£0.


                              Scenario #2: Adding 11 extra beds (c
                              =143 allocated beds). The corresponding advantages of this choice consist of a 2.6 times smaller fraction of rejected patients (B
                              =2.2%), and reduction of associated costs (minus £817 for TC, and minus £73 for PC). On the other hand, the cost per unstaffed beds increased by £550.


                              Scenario #3: Adding 14 extra beds (c
                              =146 allocated beds). Although the difference towards the above scenario regarding the number of beds (plus three beds) might seem insignificant, the benefits related to costs are notable. TC increased by £104, while PC decreased by £7.32. The cost per unstaffed beds increased by £150. Compared to the first case, TC decreased by £921, and PC also decreased by £44; the cost per unstaffed beds increased by £700. The most consistent advantage is that the fraction of rejected patients decreased by approximately four times. In addition, if we assign, for instance, a penalty cost π
                              1
                              =£1950 in the first scenarios, π
                              2
                              =£1450 in the second one, and π
                              3
                              =£2050 in the third one, respectively, then the corresponding cost functions g’s are estimated as g
                              1
                              =£1596.51, g
                              2
                              =£621.22, and g
                              3
                              =£681.96. Comparing the first and the last models (the largest difference of beds, 14), one can see that a difference of £100 regarding the penalty cost results in a decrease of about £915 of the corresponding function cost even though the number of beds increased by 14. To conclude, this simple example highlights the importance of considering the associated function cost to any patient model.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a mix Operations Research and Artificial Intelligence approach to support the hospital bed occupancy and resource utilization. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals a supporting computer-aided tool to decide what policies could be introduced at greatest effect. It is noteworthy to mention that such an approach is far to be directly used by hospital administrators, its main role being to offer a support decision-making.

The paper focused on three goals. First, starting from a standard M/PH/c queuing model for bed-occupancy in hospitals, a novel evolutionary-based approach is proposed to optimize the hospital management by providing an efficient way to estimate the system control parameters in order to obtain:
                        
                           •
                           A suitable proportion of refused patients which we are prepared to tolerate.

The corresponding average time spent in hospital.

The corresponding average number of patients in hospital.

The bed occupancy.

Secondly, by considering a base-stock policy often used in inventory systems of expensive and slow-moving items, and assuming the non-profit practice common to the National Health Service, we provided a way to optimize the resource utilization based on the evolutionary paradigm. Taking into account both the queuing model features and the cost model characteristics, encoded in a chromosome vector form, we have provided the hospital manager the means to estimate the appropriate parameters for optimal resource utilization. Thus, juggling with the bed inventory, arrival rate, mean service time, holding and penalty costs, it is possible in such a way to make a hospital department more effective.

Finally, we proposed a “What-if” analysis that enables the hospital manager to simulate several scenarios, so that, depending on the circumstances, to make the (near) best decision.

We illustrated the methodology using bed-occupancy data based on the practice of the Department of Geriatric Medicine of St. George’s Hospital, London, UK. The cost model was inspired by a previous study [5], this approach being meant to be indicative, actual costs depending only on the concerned hospital.

The idea of using the evolutionary paradigm to optimize the hospital inventory and corresponding healthcare is advantageous and handy in several aspects:
                        
                           •
                           It encodes in the chromosome the whole information provided by both the queuing system and the cost model.

The GA approach is transparently presented.

The corresponding algorithm is easy to understand and implement.

The optimization process is straightforward and is based on the use of the whole information at one dash.

This methodology can be adapted to a wide variety of situations of this type.

The use of queuing models is widely widespread in healthcare systems to improve the patient management. On the other hand, GAs are natural computing algorithms, mostly used in optimization problems, due to their efficiency and relative comprehensibility and easy-to-use. The effectiveness of the novel approach, which brought together the queuing models and the evolutionary paradigm, was proved on the task of optimizing the patient management and healthcare costs. The model has been applied to a real-world-like situation, inspired by a geriatric department of a hospital in London, UK.Future research may lie in:

                           The use of an extended queuing system of M/PH/c/N type, allowing a fixed N>
                              c maximum capacity, which avoids the straight patient rejection when all beds are occupied. Such a system allows the existence of a (N–c) waiting room.

The setup of the corresponding cost model.

The evolutionary-based optimization of the extended model.
