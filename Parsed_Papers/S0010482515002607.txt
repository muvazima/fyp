                  Background
                  Bipolar electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation (AF) can have an appearance of chaotic/random behavior. The aim of this study was to use a novel electrogram morphology recurrence (EMR) analysis to quantify the level of order in the morphology patterns in AF.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Rapid atrial pacing was performed in seven dogs at 600bpm for 3 weeks leading to sustained AF. Open chest high density electrical recordings were made in multiple atrial sites. EMR plots of bipolar electrograms at each site were created by cross-correlating morphologies of each detected activations with morphologies of every other activation. The following features of the EMR plots were quantified: recurrence rate (RR), determinism (DET), laminarity (LAM), average diagonal line length (L), trapping time (TT), divergence (DIV), and Shannon׳s entropy (ENTR). For each recording site, these measures were calculated for the normal sequence of morphologies and also after random shuffling of the electrogram orders.
               
               
                  Results
                  Electrograms recordings from a total of 3961 sites had average cycle lengths of 104±22ms resulting in an average of 100±19 activations detected per 10-s recording and an average RR of 0.38±0.28 (range 0.02–1.00). Shuffling the order of the activation morphologies resulted in significant decreases in DET, LAM, L, TT, and ENTR and significant increases in DIV.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  EMR plots of AF electrograms show varying rates of recurrence with patterns that suggest an underlying deterministic structure to the activation sequences. A better understanding of AF dynamics could lead to improved methods in mapping and treating AF.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Electrical activity during atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by complex activation patterns that are difficult to interpret. This includes variable activation times and changing atrial electrogram amplitudes and morphologies giving the appearance, at times, of highly erratic baseline behavior. To elucidate the evolution of these patterns and their clinical relevance is a challenge. One suggested mechanism for sustained AF is multiple reentrant circuits that wander in the atria [1,2]. There also has been growing evidence that some of these rhythms are driven by stable sources in the atria [3–8]. These sources can be in the form of focal activation, rotors, or reentry patterns resulting in the complex fibrillatory activity seen in the rest of the atria. There is still much that is not understood about dynamical behavior of AF and its impact on AF electrograms.

The recurrence plot (RP) was invented and used by Eckmann et al. [9] as a means to visualize non-linear dynamical behavior. Eventually many investigators in diverse fields, such as physics, astronomy, biology, and economics, studied complex dynamical behavior not readily apparent from observed raw time series [10]. The plots were used to visualize a pattern representing the evolution of a sequence of points of some variable in one or a small number of dimensions and characterize its structure. The processes studied using RPs can be mathematical time series generated by computer solutions to linear and nonlinear differential equations or time series generated by real sequential processes occurring in nature.

We have recently adapted the recurrence quantification analysis designed for scalar and vector time series to study electrogram morphology recurrence (EMR) during AF [11]. We previously showed that mapping using EMR could be used to identify areas of rapid and repeatable electrogram morphologies in patients with persistent AF [11]. From this technique it was also observed that even sites with changing morphologies had noticeable patterns that were not random. The aim of this study was to quantify the features of EMR plots obtained from a canine model of AF using methods proposed by Zbilut et al. [12,13] and Marwan et al. [17] that have been previously used to quantify the visual structures observed in recurrence plots of scalar and vector time series.

@&#METHODS@&#

Electrograms obtained from a canine rapid atrial pacing model of AF were used for this study. Previously published techniques were used to create this animal model in seven purpose-bred hound dogs weighing 25–35kg [14]. Sterile surgery for pacemaker implantation was performed with endocardial pacing leads placed in the right atrial appendage (RAA). The pacemakers were programmed to pace at 600bpm at four times the capture threshold for 2–3 weeks. The pacemaker was turned off prior to studying the dogs in sustained AF. This protocol conforms to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern University.

Electrograms during spontaneous AF were obtained during an open chest study performed via a lateral thoracotomy [15]. A Unemap electrical mapping system (UnEmap, Auckland, New Zealand) was used to record bipolar electrograms from a triangular-shaped high density plaque with 130 electrodes. The electrodes were equally spaced (2mm) and allowed 117 simultaneous bipolar electrograms to be obtained in each recording. Recordings were sequentially obtained from the anterior portion of the left atrial appendage (LAA), superior portion of the posterior left atrium between the left and right pulmonary veins bordering the left atrial roof (PLA1), mid portion of the posterior left atrium between the four pulmonary veins (PLA2), the anterior portion of the RAA, and the free wall of the lateral right atrium (RAFW). The left and right atrial sites were chosen to provide a diverse representation of AF electrogram characteristics. The posterior left atrium and pulmonary veins are known regions that are important for AF maintenance. The appendages are known locations for more organized atrial activity. There are known left and right atrial differences in activation rate. Ten seconds of data were obtained at each site.

The principle for morphology recurrence analysis is illustrated in 
                        Fig. 1. Here, the recurrence pattern of the famous tongue twister “PETER PIPER PICKED A PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS” is used as an example. The grid shown in Fig. 1 represents the recurrence plot with the text phrase on both the x and y axes. The square is colored black if the letter on the x-axis matches the letter or space on the y-axis that it intersects with and colored white if the letters or spaces do not match. It can be noted that all the squares falling on the line of identity are colored black as each letter and space is matched with itself. All other black squares represent letters and spaces that recur in the phrase.

There are a couple features of the recurrence plots that can be observed which offer insight on the dynamical behavior of the system. In the example presented in Fig. 1, there are diagonal lines besides the line of identity that are present in the recurrence plot. These short diagonal lines occur when there is a recurrence of a sequence of letters. For example, the sequence “_PICK” occurs twice in the tongue twister as does “ER_PI”, both of which result in 5-point diagonal lines where the two occurrences meet on the x and y axes. Systems that have recurrences in sequences that results in diagonal lines have been described as having “deterministic” behavior. Additionally, recurrence plots can have vertical (and horizontal) lines that represent repetitive elements in the sequence. In Fig. 1, the double “P” in the word “PEPPERS” result in vertical lines with length of 2. Systems that have repetitive elements that result in vertical lines have been described as having “stationarity”.

Recurrence plots for electrogram morphology can be created in a similar fashion to the text example in Fig. 1. Detecting recurrences in morphology of activation waveforms first requires robust detection of activation. This was accomplished using a previously validated cycle length iteration technique. Each activation waveform was defined as a 100-ms segment centered at the point of detection. As previously described [11], the morphology recurrence plot was generated by calculation of the cross-correlation coefficient of each electrogram to all other electrograms and plotted on a grid as indicated in 
                        Fig. 2. For the present analysis, whether morphologies of two different activation waveforms matched were determined if the cross-correlation coefficient was greater than the threshold (1−ε). Fig. 2 illustrates the process of creating a morphology recurrence plot from an electrogram signal. The top of the figure shows an AF bipolar electrogram consisting of 13 discrete activations. These 13 activation waveforms were compared with each other with cross-correlation. The color-coded plot displays the cross-correlation coefficients for every combination of the activation waveforms. The black and white plot is a thresholded recurrence plot which identifies the pairs of activations that have cross-correlation coefficients greater than the (1−ε) threshold, where ε=0.2. If the electrogram recording only contains electrograms with very similar morphology, a recurrence plot that is completely black would be expected.

As determinism and stationarity are the key features to gleaned from the recurrence plot, one of the ways to emphasize these elements over sporadic single point recurrences due to chance or noise is to perform an operation known as “embedding” [16]. Increasing the embedding dimension (m) essentially defines a stricter criterion for recurrence by requiring a sequence with length equal to the embedding dimension to repeat in order to show up as a recurrence on the recurrence plot. The examples shown thus far in Figs. 1 and 2 show recurrence analyses with embedding dimension of 1. With embedding dimension of 2, all single point recurrences that do not form diagonal lines would drop out. All other diagonal lines would remain but decrease in length by 1. Similarly for an embedded dimension of 3, all diagonal lines with two or less points would drop out and all remaining diagonals would remain with one less point. Mathematically, we defined recurrence of sequences i and j with embedding dimension m and assuming r

                        Fig. 3 shows an illustration of the effect of changing embedding dimension and threshold on the morphology recurrence plot of one AF electrogram recording. It can be seen how increasing the embedding dimension and decreasing the threshold effectively “filters” the recurrence plots making them sparser. Although embedding dimensions of 1, 2, and 3 and thresholds on 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 were tested for all the recurrence analysis in this study, only embedding dimension of 1 and threshold of 0.2 will be reported in the results.

In the traditional analyses of recurrence plots from scalar or vector time series data, three features stand out: diagonal lines, vertical lines, and isolated points. Diagonal lines, excluding the line of identity, are associated with determinism in the recurrence patterns and are particular evident with periodicity. Vertical lines, on the other hand, are associated with stationarity. A recurrence plot with only single dots and very few diagonal or vertical lines reflects a stochastic process whereas a recurrence plot of a deterministic process would have very few single dots but many diagonal or vertical lines. In this paper, we have adapted established methods of quantifying the patterns of diagonal and vertical lines in the recurrent plot first developed by Zbilut et al. [12,13] and Marwan et al. [17]. They are as follows:


                        Recurrence rate. The recurrence rate (RR) is simply the density of the recurrence points in a recurrence plot. For a given recurrence matrix R

A sequence of electrograms with a given recurrence rate could have diagonal and vertical lines in the recurrence plot that occur by chance even if the recurrent electrograms have random timings. However, we hypothesized that there would be an order to electrogram patterns that results in a greater frequency and longer length of diagonal and vertical lines in the recurrence plot than would be encountered if the timings of the electrograms were completely random. To test this hypothesis, we compared the recurrence quantification measures of each electrogram recording with those obtained with random shuffling of the order of the detected electrograms. The randomly-shuffled activation waveforms with embedding dimension of one would have the same recurrence rate with only the order changed. One hundred shuffles were performed for each electrogram recording and the mean values of each of the 100 shuffles were used as the representative value.

All data are represented as means and standard deviations. ANOVA was used to determine whether there were regional differences for each measure. Comparisons of the recurrence variables between non-shuffled and shuffled activation waveform sequences were made with Student׳s t test. Linear regression was used to determine the relationship between the changes in recurrence measures from the original electrogram orders to the shuffled electrogram orders with recurrence rate. The P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

@&#RESULTS@&#

A total of 3691 electrogram recordings from the right and left atria of 7 dogs were analyzed. These signals had average cycle lengths of 104±22ms resulting in an average of 100±19 activations detected per 10s recording. The average recurrence rate of these signals was 0.38±0.28. 
                     Fig. 4 shows a histogram of the distribution of recurrence rates for all electrograms. The histogram is heavily weighted on the lower end of the RR values. However, there is a noticeable increase of the frequency of electrogram recordings with RR values greater than 0.9 from the frequency of electrogram recordings with RR values between 0.8 and 0.9. The figure also shows examples of electrogram recordings and recurrence plots with RRs of 0.66, 0.31 and 0.18, where the relationship between the density of the plots and the RR values can be seen.


                     
                     Table 1 shows a regional summary of all the recurrence measures. The highest average recurrence rate was seen in the RAA and the lowest in PLA1. Similarly, the RAA also had the highest average DET, LAM, L, and TT and the lowest DIV. PLA1 had the lowest DET and LAM while the RAFW had the lowest L and TT and the highest DIV. There were little differences in ENTR between the sites.


                     
                     Table 2 shows the results summary of morphology recurrence plot measures before and after electrogram order shuffling. DET, LAM, L, TT, ENTR all significantly decreased with shuffling. DIV significantly increased with shuffling. All changes were significant at p<0.0001.


                     
                     Fig. 5 shows examples of the effect of shuffling the order of the detected electrograms on the recurrence plots. From top to bottom, the three examples have RRs of 0.69, 0.41, and 0.34. Since the same set of detected electrograms are analyzed, the RRs are identical before and after shuffling when analyzed with an embedding dimension of one.

Qualitatively, it can be appreciated how prior to shuffling, large square blocks are present in the recurrence plot and how the recurrence plots consist of many more blocks of smaller size after shuffling. This suggests that the original sequences tended to have more periods of long runs of activation with repeated morphologies, whereas the shuffled sequences have a more even distribution of the different morphologies. The quantification measures shown on the side of each plot appear to reflect these differences. For the examples with the higher RR values of 0.69 and 0.41, DET and LAM did not show much change from the original to the shuffled recurrence plot. These measures represent the percentage of recurrence points that are part of diagonal or vertical lines. However, there was a significant decrease in DET and LAM in the RR=0.34 case, as percentages of diagonal and vertical lines were eliminated due to shuffling. L and TT, which measure the average length of the diagonal and vertical lines, respectively, were significantly less in all three examples. DIV, which is the reciprocal of the longest diagonal, was increased in all three examples with shuffling. ENTR, which measures the variability of diagonal line lengths, was increased with shuffling in the first example but decreased with shuffling in the other two.


                     
                     Fig. 6 shows each of the recurrence measures plotted against recurrence rate both before (blue dots) and after electrogram order shuffling (red dots). Each measure also has a corresponding plot which plots the difference between shuffled and the original electrogram orders versus recurrence rate. For both determinism and laminarity, the original values are generally higher than the shuffled values and the difference between shuffled and original electrograms in general increase with decreasing recurrence rate, although they converge at both recurrence rates near 1 and 0. For average diagonal line length and trapping time, the original values were again in general higher than the shuffled electrograms, however the difference between shuffled and original electrograms increase with recurrence rate. For divergence, the original values were in general lower than the shuffled values. The difference between shuffled and original divergence increased with decreasing recurrence rate. Shannon׳s entropy tended to be lower for the original electrograms at lower recurrence rates but higher at higher recurrence rates. The difference between shuffled and original electrograms appear to increase with recurrence rates closer to 0 or 1.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Recurrence analysis is a non-linear approach that has been used to find deterministic and stationarity patterns within complex time series. Adapting recurrence analysis to study AF electrogram morphology patterns has allowed us to see the checkerboard patterns that form, which indicates a level of spatiotemporal organization in even the most chaotic appearing AF signals, whether near or remote from a purported source of AF. Comparing the recurrence quantification measures of the shuffled and non-shuffled sequences of electrograms showed that there are quantifiable patterns of vertical and diagonal lines in the recurrence plots that occur in greater levels than would be expected by chance.

Previous studies have characterized spatiotemporal organization of AF with other methods. Gerstenfeld et al. showed using an orthogonal catheter placed in the right atrium of AF patients that activation directions during AF had a tendency to be “linked”, meaning it was common to see several consecutive activations having similar activation directions [18]. Other studies have observed levels of spatial coherence at a given radius from a particular site using time [19] and frequency [20] domain methods. Experiments in Langendorff-prepared sheep hearts showed that AF could be driven by stable rotors that can be identified by high dominant frequencies [5,21]. Sites of high dominant frequency have also been observed clinically in patients undergoing AF ablation [8,22,23], although ablation of high dominant frequency sites have not shown a clear benefit [24,25]. Others have also observed potential pathophysiological significance of areas of electrogram waveform repeatability [26–31]. Focal Impulse and Rotor Modulation mapping is a recent phase mapping approach that has been used to locate rotor and focal activity using a basket catheter positioned in the right or left atrium [32–34].

Although morphology recurrence analysis is a modification of previously published recurrence analysis techniques of scalar time series, there are differences between the techniques that require special consideration when interpreting the results. The main difference is the criteria used to define recurrence. Recurrence for a pair of scalar or vector time series points occurs when the absolute distance between the two points is within a given threshold. Morphology recurrence of waveforms was defined as having cross-correlation coefficient between the two waveforms which exceed a given threshold. Although recurrence analysis of the full signal with a high-ordered embedding dimension could potentially be used to detect recurrences in morphology, the recurrences of the activation waveforms would be difficult to separate from the recurrences of the isoelectric portions of the waveform. The morphology recurrence technique makes the electrogram deflections the emphasis of the analysis. Webber et al. showed that when using standard recurrence plot technique on electrograms recorded during AF, the isopotential regions of the recordings are the main sources of recurrence structures in the plot [35].

What can be gleaned from the morphology recurrence analysis performed in this study is that AF electrogram recordings exhibit a large range of recurrence rates, from repeating 100% of the time to rarely repeating. Although the frequency and lengths of diagonal and vertical lines increase with recurrence rate, diagonal and vertical lines are both more frequent and longer than would be expected by chance even at very low recurrence rates. To aid us in interpreting these results, we can consider a 6-sided die in which we assume an equal probability (p=1/6) to roll numbers between 1 and 6 and the probability of the next rolled number is independent to what was previously rolled. For every roll, the probability of rolling the same number on the next roll is p=1/6. To roll the same number three times in a row, the probability drops to p=1/36. For four times in a row, the probability is p=1/216. Thus, for runs with lengths of at least 2, we should expect the length of 2 to be far and away the most common run length. If instead a special die is used where rolling one number increases the chances of the same number occurring on the next roll, the average run length would increase and entropy of the run lengths would also increase since run lengths greater than 2 would be more common.

For our study, randomly shuffling the order of electrograms mimics the condition where the electrogram morphology is completely independent to the electrogram morphologies that preceded it. The RPs of the original morphology order to have diagonal and vertical line lines lengths and entropy greater than those with shuffled order. This points to non-random patterns in the timings of the morphology recurrences. This suggests that there are constraints to the timing and directions of atrial activation directions that produce these elements of determinism and stationarity in electrogram waveform patterns. Constraints may come from factors such as anatomic obstacles in the atria, fiber orientation of the myocardium, or stable drivers that serve to perpetuate AF. Developing a better understanding of these AF dynamics is important in our continuing quest to better understand the pathophysiologic basis of this arrhythmia in humans which could, in turn, improve treatments for this arrhythmia.

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

This study details an initial attempt to characterize the structure of morphology recurrence plots of AF electrograms. The results from the AF animal model used may not generalize to human AF and the exact mechanisms of the AF in this model are not known. Although many electrogram recordings were analyzed, they come from only seven dogs. The recordings were only ten seconds in duration and may miss longer term recurrence patterns.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Using a novel method to measure recurrence of electrogram waveform morphologies, a quantifiable amount of spatiotemporal organization was detected at multiple levels of electrogram complexity. The pathophysiological significance of the different recurrence patterns found in the atria during AF needs to be explored. Morphology recurrence analysis might also be a useful technique to characterize complex behavior in other settings in medicine or nature.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

Atrial fibrillation is a complex arrhythmia with activation patterns that resemble chaotic behavior. Using a novel morphology recurrence analysis technique to characterize the patterns of electrogram morphology changes, structures are apparent that indicate significant levels of determinism and stationarity in atrial fibrillation electrograms. Recurrence plots have traditionally been used to visualize recurrences in complex time series. Adapting these plots to show recurrence patterns of electrogram morphologies revealed that diagonal and vertical lines in these plots occur with longer lengths and greater frequency than those measured if the electrogram orders were randomly ordered. This suggests that atrial fibrillation is highly organized. Future investigation is needed to determine how to utilize this information in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.
