                  Column generation for solving linear programs with a huge number of variables alternates between solving a master problem and a pricing subproblem to add variables to the master problem as needed. The method is known to often suffer from degeneracy in the master problem. Inspired by recent advances in coping with degeneracy in the primal simplex method, we propose a row-reduced column generation method that may take advantage of degenerate solutions. The idea is to reduce the number of constraints to the number of strictly positive basic variables in the current master problem solution. The advantage of this row-reduction is a smaller working basis, and thus a faster re-optimization of the master problem. This comes at the expense of a more involved pricing subproblem, itself eventually solved by column generation, that needs to generate weighted subsets of variables that are said compatible with the row-reduction, if possible. Such a subset of variables gives rise to a strict improvement in the objective function value if the weighted combination of the reduced costs is negative. We thus state, as a by-product, a necessary and sufficient optimality condition for linear programming.
                  This methodological paper generalizes the improved primal simplex and dynamic constraints aggregation methods. On highly degenerate linear programs, recent computational experiments with these two algorithms show that the row-reduction of a problem might have a large impact on the solution time. We conclude with a few algorithmic and implementation issues.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Column generation, invented to solve large-scale linear programs (LPs), is particularly successful in the context of branch-and-price (Barnhart, Johnson, Nemhauser, Savelsbergh, & Vance, 1998; Lübbecke & Desrosiers, 2005) for solving well-structured integer programs. Column generation is used to solve the LP relaxations at each node of a search tree, and often produces strong dual bounds. It alternates between solving a restricted master problem (an LP) and one or several subproblems (usually integer programs) in order to dynamically add new variables to the model. Like the primal simplex method, column generation suffers from degeneracy. This defect is particularly visible when solving LP relaxations of combinatorial optimization problems, a main application area of branch-and-price.

In this methodological paper, we present a row-reduced column generation (RrCG) method which turns degeneracy into a potential advantage. Our method differs from standard column generation only in iterations where degeneracy occurs in the restricted master problem (RMP). We dynamically partition the RMP constraints based on the numerical values of the current basic variables. The idea is to keep only those constraints in the RMP that correspond to strictly positive basic variables. This leads to a row-reduced restricted master problem which does not only discard most variables from consideration in column generation, but also reduces the number of constraints, and in particular the size of the current working basis. In linear algebra terms, we work with a projection into the subspace spanned by the column-vectors of the non-degenerate variables. This is similar to the idea of a deficient basis in the simplex method (Pan, 1998). This row reduction comes at the expense of a computationally more involved pricing subproblem which needs itself to be solved by column generation.

Degeneracy in column generation has been dealt with using perturbation of the right-hand side as in the standard primal simplex method. In particular, certain dual variable stabilization approaches explicitly use perturbation, see Ben Amor, Desrosiers, and Frangioni (2009) for a stabilized column generation framework and the many references therein. Recently, a new line of research emerged for coping with primal degeneracy in linear programming, namely the 
                        improved primal simplex
                      method (IPS) (Elhallaoui, Metrane, Desaulniers, & Soumis, 2010; Raymond, Soumis, & Orban, 2010). Our work generalizes IPS for solving degenerate linear programs and the dynamic constraints aggregation method (Elhallaoui, Desaulniers, Metrane, & Soumis, 2008; Elhallaoui, Villeneuve, Soumis, & Desaulniers, 2005; Elhallaoui, Metrane, Soumis, & Desaulniers, 2010) for solving LP relaxations of set partitioning problems (by column generation) stemming from vehicle routing and crew scheduling applications. The referenced papers suggest that, on highly degenerate linear programs, a row-reduction of a problem shows great promise in reducing overall solution times.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls the column generation method with the definitions of the master problem MP, its variable-restricted version RMP and its pricing subproblem SP. Section 3 presents the RrCG approach. It essentially defines the row and column partitions of the master problem based on a current degenerate solution, introduces the row-reduced restricted master problem RrRMP and its associated pricing subproblem rSP, and finally brings in a specialized column generator cSP for single columns compatible with the row-reduced master problem. Section 3.4 discusses the case of inequality constraints followed by an algorithm. Section 3.6 provides a necessary and sufficient optimality condition for linear programs. Finally, Section 4 discusses some properties followed by implementation issues. Our conclusions complete the paper in Section 5.

Let us briefly recall the mechanism of standard column generation, see Lübbecke and Desrosiers (2005) for a general introduction. We would like to solve the following linear program, called the master problem (MP), with a prohibitively large number of variables

                      for its cost coefficient. Column generation works with a restricted master problem (RMP) which involves a small subset of variables only. At each iteration, RMP is solved to optimality first. Then, like in the primal simplex algorithm, we look for a non-basic variable to price out and enter the current basis. That is, we either find a column

                        . There is one notable exception: The set N will not denote the non-basis (but usually a superset). Even though one never actually computes the inverse of a basis matrix, our exposition will sometimes rely on“tableau data,” when it is conceptually more convenient.

RMP is a column-reduced MP and its variables are generated as needed by solving SP. The row-reduced column generation comes into play when the current solution of RMP is degenerate with 
                        
                           p
                           <
                           m
                        
                      positive variables. In what follows, we define a row-reduced RMP, denoted RrRMP, which decreases the number of rows to only p. The case with equality constraints is treated first as formulated in (1), and a generalization to the inequality-constrained case is presented in Section 3.4.

We emphasize that the basis we constructed for MP is not unique. The form we propose has convenient properties, but even there it is our choice which rows appear in P, see Section 4.1.

To exploit the degeneracy of the solution exhibited in (6), we row-reduce the RMP, denoted by RrRMP. To this end, we discard the rows in set Z:

We have assumed (1) to be feasible which means that it either has a finite optimal value or is unbounded. In both scenarios, the pricing problem (11) and its dual are always feasible and bounded. Indeed, in a context of column generation, it is always possible to generate a basic variable of reduced cost 0. With respect to the unbounded case, the detection of this eventuality is done during the step size stage according to the ratio-test mechanism as stated in the following section.

The reader who is more accustomed to IPS will remember that the basic variables are not available for pricing. That being said, one could modify the convexity constraint with a less-than-or-equal-to sign. The repercussion in (10) is the added upper bound of 
                           
                              μ

                              0
                           
                        . For all intent and purposes, this is equivalent to having an artificial column of null content priced at 0 that could be selected in the pricing problem when the current solution is optimal.

The number of positive variables in the new solution is at most p, that is, it can be more degenerate.

On the other hand, we can solve rSP (11) to look for a convex combination of columns to improve the objective value of MP. Subproblem rSP is a linear program solved by column generation over X. In its pricing step, we look for a column

We summarize our discussion with a pseudo-code of our row-reduced column generation algorithm for degenerate master problems. As long as the solution is non-degenerate, we have the classical alternation between RMP and SP (until line 9). When a degenerate solution is identified in line 10 (
                           
                              p
                              <
                              m
                           
                        ), the row-reduced RrRMP benefits from this (lines 11 to 19).

After solving RMP (line 4) or RrRMP (line 13), the optimality test for MP is via the solution of a pricing subproblem, either the classical SP (line 8) if the current solution is non-degenerate or rSP which is solved by column generation (line 17). In both situations, new columns are added to RMP if

                         in line 18, we add subsets of incompatible columns to RMP and iterate (again from line 4). The algorithm stops when RMP and hence MP are optimal (line 19).

Column generation generalizes the primal simplex algorithm. In the same spirit, the improved primal simplex method (IPS) used for solving degenerate linear programs (Elhallaoui, Metrane, Desaulniers, et al., 2010; Raymond et al., 2010) can be seen as a special case of the row-reduced column generation RrCG. The main difference is that rSP (11) itself needs to be solved by column generation, whereas in IPS all columns are explicitly given in advance. Moreover, given basis

                        , all variables can be characterized a priori as either compatible or incompatible. Hence, in IPS, the row-reduced master problem is defined on the compatible variables and a complementary pricing subproblem is solved over the incompatible variables only. Although not explicitly stated in previous IPS papers, the following result is a direct consequence of the pricing subproblem structure.

This has a nice interpretation in set partitioning models that are common in vehicle routing, crew scheduling, and many other applications. Given an integer solution,

                         can be chosen as follows: keep one row from each group of identical rows of

                        . Again this forms a set of p groups of rows, and the same compatibility interpretation applies. This is what is being used in the dynamic constraints aggregation method (Elhallaoui et al., 2005; Elhallaoui et al., 2008; Elhallaoui, Metrane, Soumis, et al., 2010; Benchimol, Desaulniers, & Desrosiers, 2012). Furthermore, the convex combination of incompatible variables in (11) simply expresses the fundamental exchange mechanism of set partitioning solutions, that is, removing elements from some groups to insert them back in other groups.

Another interpretation can be given in the context of the minimum cost flow problem with non-negative flow variables, see Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin (1993). Any feasible flow can be represented (in the residual network) as a collection of positive arcs (the non-degenerate arcs forming a forest) and all other arcs at zero (the degenerate ones). The column-vectors of the positive arcs form 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                              
                           
                        . A degenerate arc is compatible if and only if it can be written in terms of the unique subset of positive arcs forming a cycle with it. Fig. 1
                         represents the residual network in which the flow on the non-degenerate (positive) arcs is free to go in both directions while the degenerate arcs are at zero. Arc (8,9) can be written in terms of the free arcs (9,10), (11,10) and (11,8), hence the corresponding variable 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    x
                                 
                                 
                                    8
                                    ,

                         is compatible. An incompatible arc must link two trees of the forest. The combination of several incompatible arcs together with a selection of free arcs can form a cycle. In Fig. 1 are two incompatible arcs. However, combined with free arcs (9,10), (11,10), (5,1) and (1,6), they form a cycle, hence the sum

                                    x
                                 
                                 
                                    5
                                    ,

                         of these two incompatible variables is compatible as well as their convex combination with an equal weight of one-half on each. Now observe the row partition derived from that network flow example. In the small tree composed of free arcs (1,5) and (1,6), two independent flow conservation constraints need to be selected to be part of set P, hence any one amongst nodes 1, 5 or 6 appears in set Z. This is the same mechanism for the larger tree composed of the five arcs (2,11), (2,7), (11,10), (11,8), and (9,10): any one amongst nodes 2, 7, 11, 10, 8 or 9 is selected to be part of set Z while the remaining four flow conservation constraints are in the set of independent rows of P. This leads us to the following two propositions regarding the choice of the working basis.

Consider two different working bases

                         and

                        , where Q provides an alternative set of p linearly independent rows of

                        . The reduced costs of the positive basic variables are zero, hence independent of the selected working basis. However, their column coefficients in RrRMP (9) are different since they are given by the column coefficients of the selected working basis. For cSP, Proposition 2 shows that the reduced costs of the compatible variables are indeed identical in the two subproblem versions, namely cSP
                           P
                         and cSP
                           Q
                         and their coefficient components are equivalent. Therefore cSP, the specialized pricing subproblem for generating compatible variables, is independent of the selected working basis. The proof is presented in Appendix A.

Regarding the interpretations in set partitioning models and minimum cost flow problems, we have the following. In the first case, for both integer or fractional solutions, each group is composed of identical rows in 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                              
                           
                        , hence a single one per group is selected to appear in row-set P. The choice is therefore irrelevant. In the second case, each tree t of the forest contains 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                              
                           
                         nodes and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                              
                              -
                              1
                           
                         free arcs. One (root) node per tree has to be removed and its flow conservation constraint appears in row-set Z. The choice of a root node per tree of the forest, currently nodes 1 and 2 in Fig. 1, does not change the composition of any cycle nor its cost or reduced cost.

A consequence of the necessary and sufficient optimality condition of Theorem 1 is that the role of RrRMP could be relegated to only updating the current feasible solution, see (15). Indeed, there is no need to keep the generated columns, except those comprised in the current solution. Pricing problem rSP is sufficient to prove optimality of the solution or to provide a convex combination of columns for a strict improvement of the objective function. However in practice, several subsets of columns are selected at every iteration, either from cSP or from rSP, and sent to RrRMP or to RMP for an improvement of the current solution, by solving a linear program. This is possible because the compatibility notion is somewhat flexible. For example, one can include or not in the set of degenerate variables a variable that is at an implicit upper bound. In set partitioning models, this is the case for variables at value one.

Classical column generation works with a restricted master problem (RMP), that is, a subset of a model’s variables that are dynamically added via a pricing subproblem SP. Like the simplex method, column generation is known to suffer from degeneracy. Inspired by recent successes in coping with degeneracy in the primal simplex method, we propose a row-reduced column generation method (RrCG). RrCG exploits degeneracy as the restricted master problem only has as many rows as there are positive basic variables.

Columns/variables are characterized as compatible or incompatible with respect to RrRMP. Compatible columns allow for a strict decrease of the objective function when entered into the basis, that is, a non-degenerate pivot. Two types of subproblems are proposed to generate variables: a specialized subproblem cSP for compatible variables, and rSP to price out any type of variables. The latter also needs to be solved by column generation. Pricing subproblem cSP is the original subproblem SP augmented with a set of linear constraints imposing compatibility requirements. It selects compatible columns as long as they are useful for non-degenerate pivots in RrRMP. When the reduced costs of all compatible columns are zero (or larger than a specified threshold), the pricing subproblem rSP is solved. It selects a convex combination of columns such that, again, the objective value strictly improves when they all enter into the current basis. In both cases, the row-size of RrRMP can be dynamically modified. The structure of the pricing problem rSP allows to derive a necessary and sufficient optimality condition for linear programs.

Decomposition in column generation for integer programs is based on the modeling structure of a compact formulation. It exploits the pricing subproblem for the selection of objects 
                        
                           x
                           ∈
                           X
                        
                     . Row-partition in RrCG takes advantage of degenerate solutions, reduces the row-size of the master problem and its associated working basis, and thus, the computational effort for re-optimization. Combining column generation and dynamic row-partition during the solution process allows for exploiting both the modeling structure of its formulation and the algebraic structure of its solutions. Two special cases of RrCG are the improved primal simplex method and the dynamic constraints aggregation method for solving by column generation LP relaxations of set partitioning problems. On highly degenerate instances, recent computational experiments with these algorithms have shown a substantial impact on the solution time. This already opened the door to further research within that field, notably an integral simplex algorithm for the set partitioning problem (Zaghrouti, Soumis, & Elhallaoui, 2011) and a specialized version for the capacitated network flow problem which turns out to be strongly polynomial (Desrosiers, Jacques, Gauthier, Jean Bertrand, & Lübbecke, 2013).

Of course, only experimentation can show whether the potential speedup when re-optimizing the master problem is not overcompensated by a slowed down solution of the pricing step. Specialized subproblem cSP may be more difficult to solve than rSP or the original SP, in particular when the latter is solved by a customized algorithm. The additional constraints enforcing compatibility in cSP may modify or even destroy the subproblem structure. On the positive side, the subproblems do not automatically inherit degeneracy from the master problem, since at least part of the overrepresentation of the current basic solution is removed from the pricing subproblem as well.

We expect that the new method is most helpful in cases where re-optimization of the master problem is very difficult, as it is the case for many large-scale vehicle routing and crew scheduling problems. As for any simplex or column generation algorithm, future work is needed on RrCG, mainly on implementation strategies. Amongst these are the moment for an update of the row-partition of RrRMP, efficient solvers for cSP and rSP, which pricing subproblem to call, whether to add many incompatible columns or their (single column) convex combination as returned from rSP, and much more on relaxed compatibility.

We next show that the reduced costs of the compatible variables are indeed identical in the two versions of cSP, namely cSP
                        P
                      and cSP
                        Q
                      and their coefficient components are equivalent. Therefore cSP, the specialized pricing subproblem for generating compatible variables, is independent of the selected working basis. We first provide these two versions of cSP, adapted from (12):
