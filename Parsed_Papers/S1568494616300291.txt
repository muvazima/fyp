                  This paper proposes Improved Colliding Bodies Optimization (ICBO) algorithm to solve efficiently the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. Several objectives, constraints and formulations at normal and preventive operating conditions are used to model the OPF problem. Applications are carried out on three IEEE standard test systems through 16 case studies to assess the efficiency and the robustness of the developed ICBO algorithm. A proposed performance evaluation procedure is proposed to measure the strength and robustness of the proposed ICBO against numerous optimization algorithms. Moreover, a new comparison approach is developed to compare the ICBO with the standard CBO and other well-known algorithms. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of the developed algorithm to solve efficiently different OPF problems compared to the reported optimization algorithms in the literature.
