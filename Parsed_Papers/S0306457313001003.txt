                  Although most of the queries submitted to search engines are composed of a few keywords and have a length that ranges from three to six words, more than 15% of the total volume of the queries are verbose, introduce ambiguity and cause topic drifts. We consider verbosity a different property of queries from length since a verbose query is not necessarily long, it might be succinct and a short query might be verbose. This paper proposes a methodology to automatically detect verbose queries and conditionally modify queries. The methodology proposed in this paper exploits state-of-the-art classification algorithms, combines concepts from a large linguistic database and uses a topic gisting algorithm we designed for verbose query modification purposes. Our experimental results have been obtained using the TREC Robust track collection, thirty topics classified by difficulty degree, four queries per topic classified by verbosity and length, and human assessment of query verbosity. Our results suggest that the methodology for query modification conditioned to query verbosity detection and topic gisting is significantly effective and that query modification should be refined when topic difficulty and query verbosity are considered since these two properties interact and query verbosity is not straightforwardly related to query length.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Most of the queries submitted to search engines are composed of a few keywords and have a length that ranges from three to six words as reported by Kumaran and Carvalho (2009); short queries became common due to the advent of the WWW search engines. According to Bogatin (2006), which was cited by Kumaran and Carvalho (2009), more than 15% of the total volume of the queries are written in natural language using more than four terms that might contain redundant and unnecessary keywords for the purposes of IR rather than selecting a small number of well-focused keywords; these keywords may even introduce ambiguity and cause topic drifts, thus reducing the effectiveness of retrieval. As well as the (small) fraction of long and/or verbose queries typed at web search engines, this will be an issue with voice querying, queries by example, and longer interactions with search engines – all of which are likely to increase. The detection and processing of these queries, which are called verbose queries, is the topic of this paper.

Whereas “verbose query” has the same meaning as “long query” in the relevant literature, we prefer to distinguish between “long” and “verbose” – while the former is basically measured by the number of keywords, the latter means that the query is too long, detailed, uses or is expressed in more words than are needed. This definition of “verbose” does not imply that a query must necessarily be long to be verbose – a short query may also be verbose and a long query may also be succinct.

The main objectives of the paper are to:
                        
                           •
                           assess the extent to which verbose queries affect the performance of a retrieval system;

design and evaluate a methodology for processing verbose queries in order to improve system performance;

provide a scheme for deciding which methods have to be applied for improving retrieval effectiveness depending on query length and verbosity.

Topic difficulty can be a cause of query verbosity and, in general, may affect query length. In this paper a topic is considered difficult when the IR system is unable capture one or more aspects of the topic, or relationship between aspects. When a user perceives a topic as difficult, he might try to either add words to his queries, thus inflating queries with useless or noisy words, or remove words, thus making queries very short without necessarily removing one or two unnecessary and noisy words. When considered in the context of query reformulation, the former can be the case of reformulations which involve specialization, while the latter can be the case of query generalization – see (Huang & Efthimiadis, 2009; Jansen, Spink, Blakely, & Koshman, 2007) for a taxonomy of web queries. Checking whether a query is difficult is a crucial step for query expansion. Indeed, the TREC Robust 2004 test collection was used in the experiments reported in this paper, since it contains more difficult topics than the other TIPSTER test collections.

As regards the study of query verbosity, research in IR exemplified by Bendersky and Croft (2008), Hoenkamp, Bruza, Song, and Huang (2009), and Park and Croft (2010) has considered long queries without assessing the actual information content and verbosity of queries. Because we have separated query verbosity from query length, we engaged a group of human assessors who assessed verbosity for each query on the basis of the definition of query verbosity introduced in this paper. The query verbosity assessment provided four sets of queries: short-and-succinct, long-and-succinct, short-and-verbose, long-and-verbose.

To automate the recognition of verbose queries, we implemented a predictor based on a C4.5 decision tree. The training data used to implement the predictor include a score based on a variant of the method of Lesk (1986) and features based on the semantic relationships (e.g. generalization, aggregation, inclusion, temporal collocation relationships) among terms contained in a linguistic database. These semantic relationships have been exploited to implement some algorithms for extracting the query term synonyms and for topic gisting. In particular, this approach to verbose query detection complements those reported by Bendersky and Croft (2008) and Park and Croft (2010) which are mainly focused on key concept or key term identification, which are then combined with the original query (which is actually the description of the TREC topic). Moreover, the work reported in this paper extends those works since our algorithms for verbose and succinct queries processing exploit both query modification by concept expansion and syntactic features.

This paper reports the experimental results about the impact of the above mentioned verbose query detection and processing algorithms on the overall retrieval effectiveness of an IR system. The results suggest that the proposed query verbosity detection and processing algorithms can increase retrieval effectiveness to a statistically significant extent. Finally, the paper summarizes the methodological and experimental results and provides a scheme that is a blueprint for future use of query expansion and reduction algorithms in verbose query detection and processing. We would like to emphasize on the methodological contribution of this paper; the experiment on the robust track is only as a thorough application that shows the feasibility of the proposed methodology.

The proposed methodology that combines an ad hoc incremental query expansion based on external resources with query term filtering based on part-of-speech tagging and query classification sounds natural since most of these techniques are used in automatic summarization by sentence extraction (Dang & Owczarzak, 2008) and the experiments reported in this paper give some evidence that it could work in IR.

In this paper, we argue that queries can automatically be classified as verbose or not. The classifier used in the experiments reported in the paper can correctly detect verbose queries with small yet non-zero error. Moreover, the paper provides a blueprint for exploiting the information provided by the classifier to improve retrieval.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a background and reports on the literature devoted to verbose query processing and detection; Section 3 describes the methodology we have proposed for verbose query processing and detection; Section 4 describes the experiments; Section 5 discusses the results and provides a scheme for query expansion and reduction algorithms in verbose query detection and processing.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

The main aim of this section is to discuss the issues related to verbose queries. In particular, we want to motivate the study of this type of query and highlight possible applications. After presenting a brief overview of the historical evolution of IR systems, paying attention to the “query evolution” (Croft, 2009), we will explore the application context of query verbosity. Furthermore, some of the approaches described and the strategies used for processing (and, in particular, for reducing) queries will be presented.

Over the years the structure of the query submitted to an IR system has significantly changed. In the 1970s, most of systems were based on Boolean logic and queries were characterized by a complex structure, the formulation of which required familiarity with the syntax and some expertise in retrieving information. For this reason, in general, only qualified personnel were able to interact with the system in an effective way and were often forced to frequently reformulate the query to make it suitable to retrieve relevant documents.

Since the advent of search engines on the World Wide Web, the formulation of queries has from the user’s viewpoint become simpler and generally consists of a few keywords. Since then, long queries are much less frequently submitted than short queries; according to Bendersky and Croft (2009) 90.3% of 15 million queries are less than five words long and 99.9% are less than 12 words.

Although queries are in the majority of cases very short, increase of average query length has been observed for a few years according to Kumaran and Carvalho (2009). The use of long queries reflects more complex information needs and in general the user’s difficulty in choosing the best words to represent his information needs. Long queries become frequent when some specific yet popular IR applications are considered; for example, collaborative question answering (CQA) and forum search involves complex or highly specific information needs. In case of speech recognition or contextual search, verbose query processing is strongly suggested.

A related aspect to verbosity is difficulty; an example of expansion based on difficulty is reported in Chirita, Firan, and Nejdl (2007) where the number of expansion terms is a function of the ambiguity of the original query in the Web (or in the personal information repository of the user), as measured by the clarity score (Cronen-Townsend & Croft, 2002).

Although short queries make the user’s task easier, these queries can make distinguishing the context impossible and make selecting the relevant documents more complicated from the system viewpoint due to the lack of evidence for estimation and prediction as stated by Bendersky and Croft (2008).

The problem is that IR effectiveness decreases as query length increases and it seems that a reduction aimed at extracting the correct meaning is an effective means for increasing or stopping the decrease in effectiveness. Among the studies which demonstrated how the use of shorter queries is more effective than long queries, those of Bendersky and Croft (2008) and Xue, Jeon, and Croft (2008) are worth mentioning; the former is about the impact of the use of different TREC topic fields, the latter is about the use of question–answer pair archives.

Techniques that modify queries (e.g. query expansion and context-based profiles) have been developed to remedy this problem, but the successes have been rather limited according to Croft (2009). Automatic query expansion has the potential to overcome the reluctance of users in providing succinct and exhaustive queries, however, there is not a silver bullet for the query vocabulary problem as explained by Carpineto and Romano (2012); they have provided an up-to-date survey of automatic query expansion. In some cases, long or verbose queries, i.e. queries that use a number of terms greater than actually needed to express the user’s information need are shortened. In other cases, research focussed on how to decompose complex queries in shorter queries.

In the context of CQA Huston and Croft (2010) examined verbose query processing techniques prior to submission to a search engine. The queries were considered verbose when they exhibit a sentence-like structure. Huston and Croft (2010) found that the process of learning and removing stop structure from a query can be effectively automated and that the most effective approach for improving retrieval effectiveness is to simply remove stop structure instead of only stop words.

Some recent proposals are worth mentioning apart from those made in the past such as automatic summarization: Doyle (1962), Edmundson and Wyllys (1961), Endres-Niggemeyer, Maier, and Sigel (1995), Luhn (1958), Paice (1994), Rothkegel (1995), Rush, Salvador, and Zamora (1971) and Skorochod’ko (1972); these papers are relevant to our work because report the characteristics of verbose full-text documents leveraged by automatic summary generators – these characteristics are leveraged in this paper for preparing our experimental dataset. In contrast, Park and Croft (2010) used a dependency parsing tree – nodes are keywords and edges are dependencies between keywords. The dependencies modeled by the dependency parsing trees used by Park and Croft (2010) are based on prepositions or other stopwords which make the management of sentences possible. In this way, a long query can be structured and the parts-of-speech can be made explicit.

Query segmentation is yet another approach to processing long queries. Xue, Huston, and Croft (2010) described a method for selecting query term subsets forming a query segment or sub-query – the authors have stated that the selection and use of sub-queries improve retrieval effectiveness over systems that do not use sub-queries. Xue et al. (2010) designed and implemented sub-query selection using conditional random fields which assign the conditional probability that a word follows another to each pair of query words.

Query segmentation may be preliminary to the assignment of numerical weights to the query segments. Bendersky, Metzler, and Croft (2011) proposed a model for ranking sub-queries using a parameterized combination of diverse importance features. Weights are learnt not only for the explicit sub-queries, but also for the latent concepts associated with the query – the association between query and its latent concepts is implemented through pseudo-relevance feedback – this is indeed a pseudo-relevance feedback-based method of query expansion.

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is related to our work since some methods of the methodology presented in this paper were used in many papers focusing on WSD. A WSD method related to our work is the method of Lesk (1986): this algorithm discriminates between the different meanings of the terms on the basis of the number and the type of overlaps between the term definitions provided by a dictionary or vocabulary.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

This section illustrates the methods used for detecting and processing verbose queries before they are submitted to an IR system. The methods that have been adopted are the following:
                        
                           •
                           stopword removal and stemming for the English language;

query expansion based on a linguistic database;

topic gisting based on a linguistic database;

verbosity detection based on a decision tree;

document retrieval based on the vector-space model.

Because the main aim of this paper is to propose methods for detecting and processing verbose queries, the retrieval model and the indexing algorithms have been controlled and kept constant; therefore, we describe the other methods in the following.

The query expansion method has been based on the addition of synonyms which have been extracted from the linguistic database and related to the original query words by OR; for example, “Falkland petroleum exploration” was expanded to “Falkland petroleum OR oil OR gasoline OR petrol OR petrolatum exploration”.

Topic gisting is usually adopted to create summaries from text or speech as reported by Eagle, Singh, and Pentland (2003) and Hovy and Lin (1998) for example. In this paper, the aim of topic gisting is to extract from a linguistic database the concepts related to a query; in this way, the query is expanded. To this end, the set of concepts related to a query term is intersected with the sets of concepts related to the other query terms. Because multiple intersections might produce empty concept sets, a recursive procedure has been adopted in our methodology so that empty intersections are replaced by the original query terms; empty intersections are more frequent when the query is longer and topic gisting is more useful when the query is verbose which is often long. Fig. 1
                      describes the algorithm. In practice, large concept sets might cause topic drifts or computational overhead – a part-of-speech tagger has been adopted for selecting nouns and verbs in order to reduce topic drifts and computational overhead.

The reasons of why this particular algorithm was chosen are:
                        
                           •
                           The algorithm relies on a basic query expansion mechanism which is general enough to be applied with any linguistic database that associates a term to a set of concepts. A concept may be a term or any other more complex data structure. No predefined organization is supposed to govern the linguistic database, thus making basic set operations (i.e. intersection and union) sufficient to implement the algorithm.

The algorithm is simple yet can be extended to address some computational issues; for example, lines 7–8 of the algorithm split the set of the query term in C
                              1,C
                              2 at the m-th word without regarding any property of the terms or words; an improved version might include some rules for reducing the probability that the intersection computed at line 10 is null, since this computation would waste some computational resources.

The extensions to the algorithm regarding the linguistic database and the selection of the concept can be added in the future when the object of investigation will be the particular linguistic database or query expansion method.

Query verbosity has been detected through the C4.5 classification algorithm run on a decision tree. The features that have been associated with each query are as follows:
                        
                           •
                           number of words; although query verbosity is significantly correlated with query length, there are short queries that might be verbose;

number of synonyms: depending on the length of the query, the number of synonyms is an indicator of the fact that the query is verbose or not; this value was calculated as the sum of the number of synonyms for each query word;

score calculated on the basis of the number of concepts extracted: it was decided to use a variant of the method of Lesk (1986) – rather than calculating the similarity between terms by checking the number and type of overlap between the definitions of them, we estimated text verbosity considering the number of concepts contained in the intersections calculated by the algorithm of Fig. 1;

number of repetitions: the presence of many repeated terms might affect query verbosity detection because this value can be connected to the length of the queries; this value was calculated as the sum of the frequencies that each distinct term occurs in the query if it is greater than one.

We used the C4.5 algorithm implementation by Hunt reported by Tan, Steinbach, and Kumar (2006), for example. This implementation consists in the recursive construction of a decision tree by partitioning the records that are part of the training set into even smaller subsets. To avoid overfitting we pruned the tree so that it is entirely and only built on the basis of the training set.

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

The aim of the experiments was to test the hypothesis that query verbosity impacts on retrieval effectiveness independently of query length, i.e. long queries do not necessarily adversely impact on retrieval effectiveness when they are succinct and short queries might adversely impact on retrieval effectiveness when they are verbose.

A topic is a description of a user’s information need and usually structured in title, description and narratives fields (see Fig. 2
                        ); it cannot be considered a real query, yet it contains all the information useful and necessary for building queries, in particular, it might contain information about difficulty. Because topic difficulty has been considered a cause of query verbosity in our experiments, the 2004 TREC Robust Track test collection was used in our experiments; the collection comprises 250 topics and about half million documents – the importance of this test collection is the presence of many difficult topics; Voorhees (2004) reports the details.

We selected 30 topics out of the 150 topics provided with the test collection – the selection of the topics used in the experiments was not random because an almost uniform number of relevant documents per topic was crucial for the preparation of the verbose queries; therefore, we checked that each topic was at least assigned a relevant document and then we selected those topics with a number of relevant documents per topic close to the average; the selected topics are: 302, 315, 323, 326, 330, 333, 335, 340, 341, 346, 349, 350, 351, 366, 368, 375, 376, 378, 384, 385, 389, 399, 402, 418, 421, 422, 428, 435, 443, 449 (the difficult topics are in bold).

Because the experiments aimed at testing the hypothesis that query verbosity impacts on retrieval effectiveness independently of query length, we have processed the topics in order to build two types of query: a verbose query and a succinct query – in this way, the comparison in terms of retrieval effectiveness between two system configurations, that is, verbose query versus succinct query was possible for each topic.

Had we wanted a viable and easy way to build the verbose version and the succinct version for each topic, we should have for example used topic titles to build the succinct version and topic descriptions or narratives to build the verbose version – however, this way would have been little effective because long queries are not necessarily verbose queries and short queries are not necessarily succinct queries; for example, the narrative field of a topic is highly informative and has carefully been prepared, without noisy words, since it was designed to inform assessors about the criteria adopted to assess whether a document is relevant.

The problem of building verbose queries was in our experiments addressed by looking at the behavior of a user who is reading through a fulltext document and is encountering a passage including relevant information to his information need; in this case, the user may be willing to highlight, copy and paste a relevant passage to the clipboard for further processing, for example, submitting some passages to a system which might retrieve additional relevant documents since the submitted passages are often an effective representation of an information need. In this way, a passage usually contains text representing information relevant to the user’s information need.

Passage retrieval was indeed an effective method for improving retrieval effectiveness because a passage including relevant information often includes keywords which can discriminate relevant documents as reported by Callan (1994), Melucci (1998), Mittendorf and Schäuble (1994) and Salton, Allan, and Buckley (1993). Nevertheless, the fact that a passage usually contains text representing information relevant to the user’s information need was only a necessary yet not sufficient condition to make passage retrieval an effective technique – passage retrieval effectiveness was mainly due to the combination of many passages and not to the use of only one passage – the approaches to passage retrieval were indeed based on: preliminary retrieval of the most similar passages; passage ranking; top-ranked passage selection; passage keyword selection; query expansion.

In contrast, a passage that implements a query cannot be combined with other passages and contains more words than needed and might thus become the verbose version of the user’s information need since the passage might contain ambiguous, imprecise or erroneous words which cannot be counter-balanced by other words found in other passages as happens in passage retrieval (see Fig. 3
                        ).

Therefore, the approach to the problem of building verbose queries consisted of extracting some passages from the documents that are relevant to the topic for which a verbose query has to be built; the passages extracted from the relevant documents contain information relevant to the topic, that is, these passages are what an assessor would read if he assessed a document as relevant. Because these passages were fed through the input of the experimental IR system, which reduces queries to little structured word sequences, passage selection and verbose query construction have not paid attention to passage readability.

Thirty topics were utilized in our experiments. Each topic was assigned to four queries, each query was either verbose or succinct, and either short or long. We manually prepared the short and verbose queries; the succinct versions of short and long queries were implemented by topic titles and descriptions, respectively. Because the verbose queries were prepared from relevant documents, these documents were removed from the test collection and the experiments were carried out with the residual collection. When we finished off the query set preparation, there were 30×4=120 queries. The method of verbose query construction we designed may be problematic because it implies some arbitrariness; however, the compilation of verbose queries cannot easily be automated and human intervention is necessary; furthermore, a unique human provider is crucial in order to avoid inconsistencies.

To control arbitrariness, each topic and its four query versions were submitted to a pool of a nine judges who assessed query verbosity. In particular, each judge was provided with:
                           
                              •
                              the following common definition of verbosity:
                                    “Too long and detailed, using more words than needed; redundant; summarized without loss of information.”
                                 
                              

some topics;

the four query versions representing each topic.

The query set was divided in three subsets so that each subset included queries of every type (short or long, verbose or succinct); because each subset was submitted to three different judges, nine judges were involved so that we harvested 120×3=360 assessments. Each query was assessed verbose when two or three judges suggested that the query is indeed verbose. After the assessment provided by the judges with respect to verbosity, each query was assessed by verbosity (verbose or succinct) and length (short or long):
                           
                              1.
                              long and verbose query implemented by relevant documents and verbosity assessment (Fig. 3(a));

short and verbose query implemented by relevant documents and verbosity assessment (Fig. 3(b));

long and succinct query implemented by the topic description (Fig. 3(c));

short and succinct query implemented by the topic title (Fig. 3(d)).

The results of the query verbosity assessment are reported in Appendix A; the table of Fig. 4
                         gives an account of the frequency distribution across short or long, verbose or succinct queries. Appendix B reports the topics.

ConceptNet was the linguistic database used for query expansion and topic gisting. ConceptNet is a semantic relationship database and includes several dictionaries and thesauri (Speer & Havasi, 2012): it is implemented as a graph; nodes store words, terms or phrases; edges store semantic relationships such as generalization-of, location-of, part-of, subevent-of. ConceptNet is a huge database and only some subsets were useful and interesting for our purposes; for example, the subsets of other languages than English and the cross-language translations have not been useful and interesting because the focus of our experiments was on the English language – nevertheless, the methodology presented in this section can be implemented for other languages too. More precisely, we used WordNet, Wiktionary, DBPedia and the database stored 3,973,647 nodes, 10,439,973 edges, 51 relationship types. About 84% nodes store one or two words.

As for part-of-speech tagging, the Stanford Parser reported by de Marneffe and Manning (2008) has been used for reducing topic drifts and computational overhead. A query classifier has been implemented by the decision tree depicted in Fig. 5
                        ; the decision tree was trained by Weka; classification accuracy is summarized in Fig. 6
                        (a) and detailed in Fig. 6(b) – these figures, and in particular the value of the Cohen’s Kappa statistics suggest that the classifier effectiveness is moderate and almost substantial (Landis & Koch, 1977) and the classifier can be an effective means for detecting verbose queries. For the evaluation of the decision tree, we used leave-one-out cross-validation in which each test set contains exactly one record. This approach has the advantage of using the greatest number of data for training as possible. In addition, the test sets are mutually exclusive and cover the entire set of data; the disadvantages of this approach are greater computational time and performance variability.

For each topic, two succinct queries were then made available, that is, the topic title and the topic description; however, the compilation of verbose queries was not feasible for some topics and finally we ended with 27 verbose long queries and 23 verbose short queries. We decided to separately report the experimental results for the topics with verbose long queries from those with verbose short queries, since a few topics have both long and short verbose queries.

The baseline used in the experiments is the retrieval model implemented in the Apache Lucene Library, version 3.1
                           2
                           For details see http://lucene.apache. org/core/3_6_2/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html.

                         which implements the Vector Space Model but consider additional normalization factors. Moreover, Lucene allows to explicitly specify boolean constraints in the definition of the queries. For instance, synonyms were combined in the query by OR. The experiments exploit the default settings for the retrieval model and the stemmer of the Lucene English Analyzer. In this work we focused on this state-of-the-art IR system configuration. Indeed, our aim was actually to explain that it is possible to automatically classify queries by verbosity other than length, observe significant effectiveness variations, and devise a methodology such as that depicted in Fig. 13 which guides the researcher toward the most effective exploitation of some linguistic database for query modification. Since the adopted IR system configuration exhibits this result, we think that our objective has been achieved. This outcome does not prevent further investigation for showing whether or how many other configurations exhibit the same result; however, we would like to keep this further investigation to the future research.

We are aware that some other techniques and data structure can be injected into the experimental system configuration, however, we wanted to avoid to control many variables and in contrast to concentrate on a state-of-the-art system configuration which can be effective in many different settings. Our objective was to show that automatic query classification by verbosity and length is feasible and may improve retrieval effectiveness.

                         report the results for the topics with verbose long queries: the table in Fig. 7 reports the experimental results obtained with the complete set of queries organized by type of query; the table in Fig. 8 reports the experimental results obtained with the non-difficult topics; Fig. 9 summarizes the difficult topics. Similarly, the tables in Figs. 10–12
                        
                        
                         report the results for the topics with verbose short queries. The rows of the tables are labeled by retrieval algorithm:
                           
                              •
                              baseline: only stopword and stemming;

synonyms added: baseline followed by query expansion based on synonyms addition (Section 3);

concepts added: baseline followed by topic gisting (Section 3);

synonyms+concepts: baseline followed by “synonyms added” and then by “concepts added”;

concepts+synonyms: baseline followed by “concepts added” and then by “synonyms added”;

nouns+concepts: “concepts added” using nouns only;

nouns+verbs+concepts: “concepts added” using nouns and verbs.

The best performances are in bold; statistical significance was tested using the sign test (p
                        <0.05); significant results are labeled by:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 l in comparison with long version;


                                 s in comparison with short version;


                                 b in comparison with baseline;

The results reported in Figs. 7–12 confirm the results reported by Bendersky and Croft (2008), Bendersky and Croft (2009), and Bendersky et al. (2011) that short queries produce higher performance than long queries independently of verbosity. The values that are statistically significant suggest some regularities, for example, the addition of synonyms and concept is beneficial on the retrieval effectiveness. Section 5 will discuss a methodology we designed on the basis of the obtained experimental results. The methodology depicted in Fig. 13
                         guides the researcher toward the most effective exploitation of some linguistic database for query modification and summarizes the contribution of this paper.

We found that the situation is a bit more complicated when topic difficulty and query verbosity are considered. Therefore, we analyzed the experimental results and in this paper we proposed a scheme which helps researchers to find the best strategy depending not only on query length but also on topic difficulty and query verbosity – the scheme is depicted in Fig. 13(a), (b), and (c) for all topics, non-difficult topics, and difficult topics, respectively. We further comment in the following.

Synonyms was found beneficial in our experiments probably because they help make the meaning of query words more specific, thus reducing topic drift. The fact that adding synonyms increases effectiveness when a query is short is due to the increment of information provided by the additional words, which better discriminate documents. The increase of effectiveness was confirmed in previous research; finding synonyms of a query word was often implemented using a thesaurus and mostly using WordNet which is a lexical database introduced by Miller (1995).

Synonym addition, which is suggested in our scheme whenever the query is verbose and short, was also found beneficial in the previous literature on Query Expansion. Indeed, synonymy may cause a decrease of recall due to the failure to retrieve relevant documents; the same failure is caused by a change in the form of a word (typically the ending) to express a grammatical function or attribute such as tense, mood, person, number, case, and gender. This problem was analyzed by Furnas, Landauer, Gomez, and Dumais (1987).

Our findings suggest that adding nouns is beneficial whenever the query is long and recall should be increased. Long queries are less affected by topic drift, that is, the alteration of the focus of a search topic caused by improper expansion and then are less affected by loss of precision. A reason for this limited loss is the topic gisting algorithm which does not simply add words, but it does in contrast “reason” about how to add words, thus reducing the risk that an expansion term matches unrelated concepts when it is correlated with a single word of the original query rather than with the entire query.

Another finding has been that adding verbs may improve retrieval when a query is succinct. An explanation may derive from what happens when stemming is adopted. When expanding queries, a straightforward method of expansion is associating query words to inflectional variants. This association may be implemented by a stemmer which may remove inflected forms of a word that strictly follow the language syntax, for example tenses of verbs. Adding verbs selected from a linguistic database may resemble stemming, yet the former differs from the latter because selection is based on pre-computed associations rather than on stems computed on the basis of grammatical rules.

Another finding has been that there are more ways to improve retrieval when query is not difficult than when it is difficult. This finding is consistent with the findings reported in past papers which stressed that doing nothing when a query is difficult is a better decision than adding words. In contrast, adding words to non-difficult topics is often worthwhile.

The scheme depicted in Fig. 13(a)–(c) can be considered as a part of a more complex methodology where the query verbosity predictor is one of the system components. The system can automatically determine the most effective way to process the submitted query on the basis of the verbosity and other query features, e.g. the clarity score (Cronen-Townsend & Croft, 2002). The work reported in this paper, in a sense, follows the final suggestion provided in Buckley (2009). In that paper the author discusses some of the RIA workshop findings and identifies ten categories of topics for which current IR engines fail – the results refer to the seven IR systems used in the workshop. For some of those categories, under the hypothesis that the system is automatically able to identify the topic category, it was suggested how to improve the retrieval effectiveness. One of the major conclusion of that paper is that “it may be more important for research to discover what current techniques should be applied to which topics, than to come up with new techniques”. The basic rationale underlying the retrieval techniques proposed in our work is the adoption of query expansion.

The major contribution of this paper is that our proposed methodology (and the resulting scheme) results in a “conditional query expansion” – indeed it suggests how to perform the expansion (e.g. exploting concepts, nouns, or verbs) on the basis of the topic (and the query) type.

Our findings are also partly related to those reported in Kelly and Fu (2007). In that paper the authors investigate the effectiveness of a clarification form to elicit most effective description of the user information need. The investigation was carried out as a part of the TREC 2004 High Accuracy Retrieval from Documents (HARD) Track, the objective of which was to validate the hypothesis that a single, highly focused interaction with the user could be exploited to improve retrieval effectiveness. They observed a significant relationship between query length and performance, using only user-generated terms. The most effective form entries used for query expansion were the response to the question “describe what you already know about the topic” (Q2) and “why do you want to know about this topic?” (Q3).

Because of the way we build verbose queries in our test collection, their content is much more likely to contain the answer to the above questions. But unlike from Buckley, Salton, and Allan (1994) and Kelly and Fu (2007) where a significant relationship between query length and performance was observed, our findings suggest the need of an appropriate methodology instance for processing long queries, where the methodology instance is determined according the query verbosity.

The objective of this work was to show that automatic query classification by verbosity and length is feasible and may improve retrieval effectiveness; the experiment on the robust track was only as a thorough application that shows the feasibility of the proposed methodology. Query expansions strategies similar to the gisting algorithm proposed in this paper seem to work even better on other TREC tracks like Web 2010 (Nguyen & Callan, 2010) as well as on CLEF–INEX 2012 Tweet Contextualization Track (Vivaldi & da Cunha, 2012); it has also been observed in this last track (Bellot et al., 2012) that part-of-speech tagging query term filtering could have a major impact.

                      Those results suggest that our hypothesis on the feasibility of the proposed methodology could be confirmed also when adopting other test collections. Diverse configurations obtained changing topics, collections, classifiers, and query expansion methods will be kept to the future research and perhaps reported by a survey paper.

This week, Dr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran’s foreign minister, denied that Iran was holding 148 aircraft as Iraq maintained and said it only had 22 - a claim that has mystified Western military analysts, who also support the higher figure. Mr Hassan Ebrahim Habibi, the Iranian first vice-president, denied last month that Iran was considering holding on to the aircraft as war reparations. ‘The damage inflicted on Iran during the eight-year war is so huge that a few second-hand and wrecked planes cannot compensate even one thousandth of it,’ he said. The US State Department said it had evidence that Iraq had recently shipped oil to Iran in violation of UN Security Council resolutions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.

FDA agrees that increasing the number and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant microbes may have serious human health implications if those microbes are themselves pathogens of humans or domesticated animals, or share the same microenvironment as such pathogens.

Girls tend to become depressed and withdrawn while boys act out. “Children are often punished, rather than treated, for their mental health problems,” she says. “But these are classic mental health problems that in the past have not been associated with sexual abuse.” Children with low intelligence or learning disabilities are also vulnerable to mental disorders, says Claire Kopp, a developmental psychologist at UCLA. Cognitive problems can lead to aggression, conduct disorders and psychosis. In general, the risk of having a mental disorder increases with the number of risk factors. One study found that the likelihood of having a mental disorder increased tenfold when four or more risk factors were present. “Fundamentally, we still believe strongly that mental illness has a very, very strong genetic component,” said Steven M. Paul of the NIMH, one of the authors of the new study. “We just haven’t found the genes yet.” Paul and others say their work actually suggests that many types of mental illness may be caused by more than one gene. In an effort to locate such genes, the NIMH is currently beginning a major study, at 10 U.S. medical centers, of families with a history of manic-depressive illness, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease.

The census estimates that just 81.3m people live in the country, of whom 38 per cent are less than 40 years old – compared with unofficial estimates of around 88m. The average age has increased from 16 to 19years old. The population as a whole rose by an average of just 2.3 per cent in the decade. Although the population growth rate has eased slightly – 3.3 per cent in 1988–89 to 2.7 per cent this year – more women are now reaching reproductive age and they are the ones the government is most anxious to reach with its family planning message. Africa’s population growth of 2.9 per cent a year is the highest in the world, easily outstripping Asian and Latin American growth of less than 2 per cent, the report says. Although many developing countries have seen steady falls in total fertility rates – the average number of children born to each woman – they have also seen life expectancy soar in the past 40years from 41years to 61years, according to the UNFPA.
