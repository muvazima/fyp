                  Background
                  Temperature-sensitive liposomes (TSL) in combination with hyperthermia (HT) exposure have emerged as a potentially attractive option to achieve therapeutic drug concentration at targeted tumour site while reducing adverse side effects associated with systemic administration of anticancer drugs. The aim of this study is to elucidate the interplay among different kinetic steps by means of computational modelling.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A multi-compartment model for TSL-mediated delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) is developed, which incorporates descriptions of the pharmacokinetics of TSL and DOX, and their accumulation in tumour tissue following intravascular triggered release. By examining dynamic interactions among TSL properties, tumour physiological properties and treatment regimen, peak intracellular DOX concentration is predicted for continuous and pulse HT exposures.
               
               
                  Results
                  Drug release rate from TSL has a saturable effect on peak intracellular drug concentration, and no further gain could be achieved for release rates greater than 0.1018s−1. A similar effect has also been found for heating duration, such that for a given bolus injection, peak intracellular drug concentration reaches its maximum and then levels off after HT duration of 2h. These results suggest that both TSL release rate and HT duration can be optimised in accordance with other parameters, e.g. clearance rate of TSL and administration mode, in order to achieve a desirable level of intracellular drug concentration. However, prolonged heating is not effective for resistant tumour cells with overexpression of ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter proteins.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The results obtained in this study can be used to guide the design and optimisation of TSL parameters and treatment regimens.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Liposomal encapsulation of anticancer agents, as a drug delivery system, has been developed to overcome the limitations of conventional free drug treatment, by reducing systemic cytotoxicity, prolonging plasma half-life and passively targeting tumour sites as a result of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [1]. Liposomal formulations of doxorubicin (DOX) (e.g., Doxil®) have been approved for clinical use in the treatment of ovarian cancer; however, their clinical efficacy is limited by insufficient local DOX concentration due to slow release kinetics. Therefore, considerable effort has been made on designing liposomes that are capable of targeting tumour actively and releasing encapsulated agents rapidly in response to specific stimulus, temperature-sensitive liposomes (TSL) being one of these [2].

As a localised therapy, TSL are expected to remain stable at body temperature but can be triggered to release the encapsulated drug rapidly (within seconds to minutes) when they are heated to a designated temperature at the tumour site [3,4]. In addition, local hyperthermia (HT) alone has been shown to improve accumulation of TSL in solid tumour by accentuating the leakiness of tumour vasculature [5]. Among several HT applicators, such as radiofrequency, microwave, and lasers, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has a distinct advantage due to its non-invasive and controllable nature [2]. More importantly, when combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI guided HIFU can offer real-time temperature monitoring with a feedback control, which is critical to TSL-based delivery systems activated by HIFU [6].

The application of TSL in conjunction with local HT has shown promising prospect both in preclinical studies and in clinical trials. Current TSL research is mainly focused on formulation design, especially with regard to release kinetics in response to HT exposure. However, among the multiple transport steps in a drug delivery process, drug release is an intermediate step that is preceded by the upstream transport (systemic circulation) and followed by the downstream transport (transvascular/interstitial and eventually intracellular transport). Furthermore, the target output, i.e. peak intracellular drug concentration, is not only influenced by interactions among these multiple transport steps, but also by the characteristics of HT applicators. It is a formidable task to measure the entire range of drug concentrations as well as a large amount of parameters experimentally. On the other hand, it is beyond our intuitive understanding to appreciate temporal variations of drug concentrations, and their dependence on the constituent parameters. For these reasons, an in silico model can play a key role in gaining insights into the transport processes of TSL in combination with their response to HT exposure. In silico experiments can be carried out as a precursor and supplement to experimental studies, in order to provide guideline for further design and optimisation of TSL drug delivery systems and their combination with various HT applicators.

Based on the concept of multi-compartment model, a number of mathematical models [7–12] have been developed to describe biological transport processes involved in stealth liposomes and TSL. These models have provided various levels of insight into the delivery of liposomal carriers, bioavailability in the tumour tissue, and its correlation to cytotoxic effect. In particular, mathematical models of TSL delivery require tempo-spatial profiles of temperature as input (stimulus) to account for temperature-dependent release kinetics. This can be achieved by assuming a homogeneous distribution of desired temperature in the entire tumour region [10], or by coupling with a bio-heat transfer model. In their recently published computational studies, Gasselhuber et al. [9,13] predicted distributions of temperature and drug concentration in response to two different heating modalities, and their numerical results showed a qualitative agreement with preliminary in vivo data. However, a systematic study with a thorough sensitivity analysis of the input parameters is lacking.

Employing a multi-compartment model together with the assumption of a homogeneous temperature distribution, the present study aims to provide clear-cut information on the interplays among multiple transport steps involved in the the delivery of TSL-encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX). Compared to the mathematical models employed by Gasselhuber et al. [9,10,13], an additional compartment for tumour plasma is introduced in the present study, which allows distinction of TSL in systemic plasma from those in tumour plasma. A systematic study is then performed by contrasting and comparing numerical results in response to continuous and pulse temperature stimuli. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine which input parameters have the greatest influence on the peak intracellular drug concentration (

A multi-compartment model (
                     Fig. 1) is adopted to describe the transport of liposomes and unencapsulated drug following intravenous injection of drug-loaded TSL. The model consists of three high level compartments: systemic plasma, lumped tissue and tumour. The tumour compartment is further divided into three sub-compartments, namely tumour plasma, tumour extravascular extracellular space (EES) and tumour intracellular space. There are eight variables representing drug concentrations in either liposomal or free form in different compartments and the mass conservation equation for each variable incorporates kinetic transfer and reaction processes. A general assumption underlying all compartmental models is homogeneity in each compartment, i.e. a well-mixed system with a uniform temperature and uniform tumour cell density. In the equations described in the subsequent sections, drug concentrations are expressed in micrograms (μg) per mm3 of the volume of their corresponding compartment.

Pharmacokinetics of TSL is described by one compartment, i.e. systemic plasma. The volume of the central compartment is set to the volume of systemic plasma (

Pharmacokinetics of free DOX is described by a two-compartment model, with one common systemic plasma compartment shared with TSL and the other representing lumped body tissues with significant drug uptake. Free DOX is present in systemic plasma compartment due to instability of TSLs at body temperature and is cleared from the body at rate

                           . Unencapsulated DOX in response to HT in tumour plasma provides the driving force for transvascular drug transport into tumour EES. Diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism for transvascular drug transport as convection is negligible in tumours due to elevated interstitial fluid pressure. The diffusive flux across the interface between tumour plasma volume and tumour EES is determined by the product of vascular permeability and surface area (

Transvascular transport of TSL to tumour EES is assumed to be negligible for two reasons: (1) for intravascular triggered release, which is the mode of TSL release examined in the current study, release of DOX is triggered before extravasation of TSL from tumour plasma to tumour EES; and (2) vascular permeability of TSL is several orders of magnitude lower than that of free DOX.

                           ). Two different intracellular uptake mechanisms are accounted for: passive diffusive transport and active transport modelled by Michaelis–Menten kinetics. On the other hand, intracellular drugs can be pumped out of cells, most likely by membrane transporter proteins (e.g. P-glycoprotein), which could be significant in resistant tumour cells associated with overexpression of transporter proteins. In addition, binding of free drugs to interstitial proteins (e.g. albumin) should be accounted for. At binding rate

The system of ordinary differential equations was solved by using Ode15s implemented in Matlab. In all simulations unless otherwise stated, TSL are administrated intravenously by bolus injection at a dose of 0.7mg/kg body weight (assuming an average human weight of 70kg). HT exposure is applied simultaneously with TSL administration and is assumed to result in a desired temperature at the target site instantly. Initial concentrations of all drugs are set to be zero except that of TSL in systemic plasma where

Model parameters used in the current study can be broadly classified into four categories: pharmacokinetics, drug release kinetics, tumour physiology, and cell related parameters. Since DOX is a commonly studied agent, values of parameters describing DOX pharmacokinetics, transport and uptake are directly adopted from the literature. For TSL drug carriers, their release kinetics and pharmacokinetics vary significantly according to their formulation. TSL release kinetics reported by Hossann et al. [14] was adopted as baseline values in the present study, with estimated release rates

                        s−1 at HT and physiological temperatures, respectively. Ultra-fast release kinetics has been reported in Thermodox® (a commercially available TSL, Celsion, Columbia, MD) with a release rate up to 0.3s−1. In addition, tumour physiological properties are highly heterogeneous even in the same tumour, not to mention various tumour types. Therefore, simulations were carried out with baseline values first, which were extracted from the literature (
                        Table 1). This was followed by a thorough sensitivity analysis to evaluate the relative importance of multiple kinetic transport processes. Further details about the ranges of parameters adopted in the sensitivity analysis are described later in Section 3.

A systematic investigation of TSL delivery combined with HT was performed. Compared to conventional stealth liposomes, predicting the intracellular drug concentration with TSL-mediated delivery is more complicated as the system is controlled not only by drug signal (TSL injection) but also by hyperthermia exposure; the latter can be achieved through continuous or pulse heating. In order to focus on providing essential insight into the interplay between biological and biochemical processes involved, simulation results corresponding to continuous heating are presented first. The effects of pulse heating are then evaluated by comparing simulation results performed under different heating schemes.

Upon arrival in tumour plasma, rapid release of DOX is triggered in response to local HT, which gives rise to a sharp increase in DOX concentration in tumour plasma compartment

Following the analysis of continuous HT exposure, it is more natural to understand how drug concentrations evolve over time under pulse HT exposure. Results shown in 
                        Fig. 3 reveal the time-course of all drug concentrations in the baseline case, with 60min HT exposure at 42°C. Comparisons with results in Fig. 2 show that sudden changes in drug concentrations occur at cessation of heating (t=60min), which causes a dramatic reduction in the release rate of DOX from TSL.

Although a similar trend is observed under continuous HT, in which case the process is regulated by the interplay between different kinetic transport steps, the reverse transport observed under pulse HT is triggered by termination of heating. Comparisons of results in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that: (1) peak intracellular drug concentration is reached at approximately 120min under continuous heating; and (2) peak intracellular drug concentration is higher under continuous heating than 60min pulse heating.

Among all drug concentrations, peak intracellular drug concentration

The local sensitivity analysis described above has shed new lights on the relative importance of and complex interplay among different kinetic steps. This has led to a further detailed investigation on how these parameters would influence the time-course of intracellular drug concentration and determine the peak intracellular drug concentration over a biologically reasonable parameter range under continuous and pulse HT. These are presented in

                            indicates longer circulation time, which helps to maintain sufficient TSL concentration in systemic plasma (and tumour plasma) for a longer period. Therefore, longer HT exposure (continuous exposure as a limiting case) is favoured for sustained release of DOX from TSL, which leads to higher intracellular drug concentration.

A range of release rates can be found in the literature, and the value chosen in the baseline calculation [14] represents a moderate release rate (complete release in ~3min) which is comparable to release kinetics in other computational studies [e.g. 19].

The burst release of DOX from TSL triggered by HT provides a powerful local source of DOX in tumour plasma to drive its downstream transport. Since varying the release rate does not affect the kinetics of downstream transport, intracellular drug concentrations reaches its peak at the same time regardless of the large variation in

                            increases. This is because at high perfusion rates, a large amount of bioavailable DOX released upon HT from tumour plasma is transported back to systemic plasma, where DOX is cleared rapidly by systemic clearance. Such an adverse effect has been demonstrated by a limiting case examined by Gasselhuber et al. [9], where enhanced intracellular accumulation of DOX was found following vascular shutdown induced by a short intense HT exposure after a routine HT exposure. The results indicate that high

                            is achieved at relatively low perfusion rates.

Tumour vascular network is highly irregular with dilated and tortuous vessels; as a result, vascular permeability and vascular density are heterogeneous even within the same tumour. Under the compartmental model setting, a lumped parameter (

                           ) – the product of vascular permeability of DOX and vascular surface area, is used to describe the transvascular transport of DOX. Its effect is further examined over an arbitrarily broad spectrum of values (0.1–10 folds of the baseline value), to account for differences in tumour vascular permeability and vascular density. In a recent study based on a patient-specific liver tumour reconstructed from magnetic resonance images [21], vascular density, measured in terms of surface area of blood vessels per unit volume of tumour tissue was found to vary between 0.4 and 2.2 folds of its baseline value.

                            also causes more intense reverse diffusion of DOX to tumour EES when the concentration gradient is reversed, thus lowering intracellular drug concentration after approximately 2h following drug administration.

                            exert their effects by enhancing the amount of DOX available in tumour EES, and when they reach a sufficiently large value, it is the kinetics of transmembrane transport that determines the intracellular drug concentration. It also implies that improved vascular permeability as a result of heating may enhance intracellular drug accumulation in the first 2h of HT exposure.

                            reduces intracellular drug concentration in general and the time required to reach equilibrium between influx and efflux, thus bringing forward the reversal transport across cell membrane. As a result, a large fraction of free DOX released upon continuous HT is forced to exit tumour compartment and perfuse back to systemic plasma, whereas discontinuity in HT may help to reduce this reverse transport. On the other hand, when intracellular drug concentration is down-regulated by a reduction in the maximum influx rate (

As shown in 
                           Fig. 10(a) under continuous HT, the time-course of intracellular drug concentration is shifted to the right along the time axis with an increment in T
                           
                              d
                           . With prolonged TSL infusion, it takes more time for the transport and accumulation of DOX in the tumour intracellular space. Within this context, the time scale of HT exposure is a constraint, which may limit the level of intracellular drug concentration. Such an effect is obvious from Fig. 10(b) that peak intracellular drug concentration is almost independent of infusion time under continuous heating, while it falls continually under 1h pulse HT exposure. Results suggest that shorter infusion time is preferred under pulse HT.

The effect of heating duration is presented in 
                           Fig. 11, which shows that increasing HT exposure up to approximately 2h can dramatically increase

                           . This suggests that the duration of pulse HT exposure has a saturable effect on peak intracellular concentration.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

TSL in combination with HT have recently emerged as a potential solution to delivering high concentrations of chemotherapeutics to targeted tumour sites. The current study focuses on a novel release mode of TSL, by which release of encapsulated drug is triggered during transit of TSL within tumour plasma in response to HT. Intravascular triggered release is a preferred release mode for TSL delivery of DOX in combination with HT [14], as it can provide a boosted local supply of drug at the tumour site and enhance the driving force for drug penetration in tumour interstitium [22].

Although a rich body of experimental research has been centred on the design of TSL formulation for improved stability and drug release behaviour, there is a lack of understanding on the role of these properties in upstream (systemic) and downstream (transvascular and intracellular) transport steps in response to HT exposure. We aim to address this question systematically by using a multiscale computational model, which incorporates descriptions of pharmacokinetics of TSL and free DOX, and drug deposition inside the tumour combined with release triggered by HT, on the basis of mechanistic understanding of drug delivery. Different from traditional experimental research, the in silico experimentations presented here are performed on a well-defined TSL-tumour system with a controlled source of variability and heterogeneity to uncover the complex interplay among different kinetic steps.

Following a bolus injection of TSL, intracellular drug concentration is found to culminate after approximately 2h of HT exposure even under continuous HT. When heating duration is less than 2h,

Moreover, increasing heating duration may not be effective for drug-resistant tumour with overexpression of transmembrane transporters (i.e. p-glycoprotein), as heating cannot compensate for the altered kinetics of trans-membrane transport due to increased maximum efflux transport rate. Targeted TSL has been suggested as a novel strategy to overcome multidrug resistance, e.g. folate-targeted TSL developed by Gaber [23].

                     , it is also associated with high peak drug concentration in systemic plasma which is related to cardiotoxicity [24]. Consequently, continuous infusion with longer duration of HT exposure may help to maximise peak intracellular drug concentration while keeping a low level of drug concentration in systemic plasma.

In conclusion, by employing a multi-compartment model, the current study provides numerical results that help to elucidate how peak intracellular drug concentration is regulated by the complex interplay among tumour physiology, drug specific properties and treatment regimen for TSL-mediated drug delivery combined with intravascular triggered release upon local hyperthermia. The mathematical model presented here can be used as a platform to accommodate additional complexities and has the flexibility to be tailored for any specific tumour-drug systems.
