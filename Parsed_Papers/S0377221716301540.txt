                  We present the Incident Based-Boat Allocation Model (IB-BAM), a multi-objective model designed to allocate search and rescue resources. The decision of where to locate search and rescue boats depends upon a set of criteria that are unique to a given problem such as the density and types of incidents responded in the area of interest, resource capabilities, geographical factors and governments’ business rules. Thus, traditional models that incorporate only political decisions are no longer appropriate. IB-BAM considers all these criteria and determines optimal boat allocation plans with the objectives of minimizing response time to incidents, fleet operating cost and the mismatch between boats’ workload and operation capacity hours.
                  IB-BAM methodology includes three major steps: In step-1, the model ranks and assigns a weight to each incident type according to its severity, using Analytical Hierarchy Process technique. In step-2, considering historical incident data, a Zonal Distribution Model generates aggregated weighted demand locations. In step-3, a multi-objective mixed integer program determines locations and responsibility zones of search and rescue boats. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model with respect to the Aegean Sea responsibility area of the Turkish Coast Guard boats. The results show that IB-BAM implementation led to a more effective utilization of boats considering the three objectives of the model.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Each year the Turkish Coast Guard (TurCG) receives hundreds of distress signals and calls from the vessels in danger. Immediate response to these signals is crucial for both victim survival and damage prevention. Moreover, in a Search and Rescue (SAR) operation, the difference between life and death can sometimes be measured in minutes. Additionally, a SAR operation consumes considerable amounts of time, effort and money. Thus, emergency response actions should be well-planned and neatly organized. A distinguished review by Green and Colesar (2004) analyzed details of the research about emergency response systems and development of OR/MS applications in the area. They argued that, despite many challenges, OR/MS applications play an important role in minimizing the impact of emergencies. This observation is particularly applicable to SAR operations conducted by TurCG.

According to the national SAR plan, TurCG has the responsibility for coordinating and conducting SAR activities/operations in the Turkish Maritime SAR Zone, which is divided into four sub-responsibility areas as follows: the Black Sea, the Sea of Marmara and Adjacent Straits, the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Among these sub-areas, the Aegean Sea has the heaviest marine traffic due to maritime transportation from and to the Black Sea, shipping, cruise tours, yachting, windsurfing and enormous illegal-border crossing activities. The heavy traffic on narrow waters, among 3000 islands of various sizes, increases the risk and hence the ratio of maritime incidents to traffic levels and risk in maritime safety (Goerlandt & Kujala, 2011). Miliou et al. (2012) studied characteristics of marine traffic and high risk traffic conditions for the Aegean Sea and reported that the number of vessels passing through the region more than doubled from November 2009 to October 2011. Furthermore, the risk in the area increases with the number of ships carrying hazardous cargo and the lack of designated shipping lanes, together with narrow and dangerous routes. According to their research, of the 72,919 vessels that crossed the Aegean Sea (via three channels, Mykonos-Ikaria, Ikaria-Samos and Evia-Andros) between 2009 and 2011, 65 percent were cargo ships, 21 percent were tankers, 5 percent were passenger ships and 9 percent were others.


                     Soares and Teixeira (2001)’s analysis of the world-wide marine incident databases suggests that fire, grounding and collision are the most common accident types. However, the incident statistics for the Aegean Sea in Fig. 1
                      represent a significantly different ranking, mainly because of its unique political and physical geographical features. Yearly incident data provided by TurCG reveals that, of the recorded 1933 incidents that occurred in the Aegean Sea between 2009 and 2014, 60 percent were drifting/machinery breakdown notably associated with illegal-border crossing and yachting/surfing activities, 21 percent were medical assistance, 9 percent were missing, 4 percent were capsizing, 3 percent were flooding, 2 percent were grounding, 0.8 percent were fire and 0.2 percent were collision. Despite the reduction in the number of incidents from 2009 until 2012, the analysis displays a marked increase starting from 2012. The main reason for this increase can be explained with the turmoil in Syria and Iraq, which caused a respectable increase in the number of refugees and migrants crossing the Eastern Mediterranean since 2013 (UNHCR Global Appeal, 2015). The Aegean Sea is such a main route for immigrants to illegally cross EU borders that the number of migrants caught along the route has tripled in 2014 from 2863 to 10,445 (Giuliani, 2015). In 2014 alone, TurCG conducted 842 operations, 716 of which were in the Aegean Sea. TurCG incident data reveals that during those operations, 12,901 victims were saved, 190 boats were recovered undamaged and 154 lives were lost, while 62 percent of all operations were related to illegal-border crossing activities.

As a consequence, the risk stemming from the increasing traffic density has accentuated the problem of establishing well-planned SAR organizations in the region. Discussions with TurCG representatives have revealed that this question has not been sufficiently investigated with regard to the incidents observed in the area. Currently, resource deployment decisions are not carried out according to scientific criteria but rather political decisions. Thus, this study concerns the tactical aspect of the emergency incident response problem, i.e., determining locations of SAR resources. Concerning the importance of immediate response to catastrophic casualties and high costs associated with the boat operations, we proposed an optimal allocation plan for SAR resources in the Aegean Sea sub-area.

TurCG executes SAR operations with three types of platforms: (1) SAR ship (single type) with a length of more than 85 meters, (2) SAR boats (12 different types) under 45 meters in length, and (3) aircraft (airplanes and helicopters). Since surface units are the primary platforms used to respond maritime incidents, we focus on surface units and their allocations among the available ports. Although aircrafts are also accepted as effective SAR platforms, the problem of their optimal allocation is out of our scope. We are specifically devoted to allocate 9 types of surface units; namely the SAR ship and 8 types of SAR boats (the ones that can operate in the confined and shallow waters of Aegean Sea), to 25 different pre-determined candidate ports along the coast of the Aegean Sea in accordance with SAR missions and historical incident data.

SAR missions carried out in the Aegean Sea include cases of drifting, capsizing, grounding, fire, collision, flooding, missing, and medical assistance. Each type of incident requires an individual operation with specific types of boats. For example, in case of a fire incident, decision makers must assign a boat with fire-fighting capability, while it is that of a high speed boat in the case of medical assistance. In our problem, the operation duration of an incident represents a demand (in hours) based on the incident's location and allocated annual operation hours of a boat represents supply (in hours). A SAR plan is accepted as ‘successful’ if it has the following properties: (1) appropriate and sufficient number of boat assignments to incidents, (2) short response time, (3) low fleet operating cost, (4) balanced workload distribution among the boats, and (5) successfully implemented business and technical rules. Therefore, a tool that can help us develop a successful SAR plan can be very useful for decision makers. Accordingly, this paper explains IB-BAM (Incident Based Boat Allocation Model), the tool that we have developed for determining optimal SAR allocation plans.

The paper is organized as follows: a literature research of various resource allocation models is presented in Section 2. Our main technical contribution is the development of IB-BAM, a structured resource allocation model in Section 3. In our model, we first use the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)-a widely-used Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique-to generate weights for incident types. We obtain concentrated demands, called “superincidents”, by applying a weighted k-clustering algorithm on a historical dataset of incidents. Considering the criteria mentioned above for a successful SAR plan, we develop a Multi-Objective Mixed Integer Program (mo-MIP) that enables determining locations of SAR resources and workload distribution among boats. We illustrate our proposed approach and results with respect to the Aegean Sea sub-area in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we present a summary and conclusion of our work.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

Planning an effective SAR organization is a sub-class of resource allocation problems. Below, we first review studies that address general resource allocation problems and then the relevant literature on military and SAR resource allocation problems.

Studies on resource allocation problems in the literature generally comprise common models such as p-median problems (p-MP) (Campbell, 1996, Church & ReVelle, 1976, Church, Scaparra, & Middleton, 2004, Hakimi, 1964), p-center problems (p-CP) (Davidović, Ramljak, Šelmić, & Teodorović, 2011, Drezner, 1984, Suzuki & Drezner, 1996), along with covering problems that can be sub-categorized into maximal covering location problems (MCLP) (Balcik & Beamon, 2008, Church & ReVelle, 1974, Schilling, Jayaraman, & Barkhi, 1993) and set-covering problems (SCP) (Badri, Mortagy, & Alsayed, 1998, Beasley & Jørnsten, 1992, Caprara, Toth, & Fischetti, 2000).

The p-MP, first introduced by Hakimi (1964), is the problem of finding the location of p facilities so as to minimize the total weighted sum of travel distances between demands (incidents) and facilities (SAR resources). The p-CP, also known as the minimax problem, seeks locations of p facilities with the objective of minimizing the maximum distance of any demand to its closest facility. In coverage problems, the demand is said to be covered if it can be served within a specified time. In the SCP, the objective is to minimize the cost of facility location while ensuring a predefined level of coverage. Such problems also allow us to analyze the minimum number of facilities required to achieve the desired level of coverage to all customers. In cases where resources are not sufficient to satisfy the desired level of coverage, the objective is shifted so that available resources are used to give the desired level of coverage to as many customers as possible. This new objective is that of the MCLP (Church & ReVelle, 1974, Owen & Daskin, 1998), and it finds application in other areas as well, such communication network design (Craparo, How, & Modiano, 2011). During the last 45 years, several books and research papers in this area have been written. Interested readers can refer to (Aikens, 1985, Caunhye, Nie, & Pokharel, 2012, Church & Murray, 2009, Daskin, 2011, Drezner, 2004, Farahani et al 2012, Farahani, SteadieSeifi, & Asgari, 2010, Francis, McGinnis, & White, 1983, Jia, Ordóñez, & Dessouky, 2007, Krarup & Pruzan, 1979, Krumke, 1995, Leonardi, 1981, Li, Zhao, Zhu, & Wyatt, 2011, Murali, Ordóñez, & Dessouky, 2012, Revelle, Marks, & Liebman, 1970, Shen, Coullard, & Daskin, 2003, Tansel, Francis, & Lowe, 1983a, 1983b) to find out more about typical resource allocation problems.

The resource allocation problem has various types of sub-classes, of which safety organizations and emergency response systems constitute a large amount. Fire stations and ambulance services are notable cases of emergency response systems where allocations are strategic to cover demand points in a short response time. Being one of the earliest location studies about emergency facilities, Toregas, Swain, ReVelle, and Bergman (1971) apply an SCP model to locate emergency facilities. Again as an emergency facility location problem, Badri et al. (1998) prepared an SCP to determine locations of fire stations for Dubai City Fire Department and developed an integer goal programming model with 11 conflicting strategic objectives. Similarly, Serra and Marianov (1998) addressed the problem of locating fire stations in Barcelona, where there is uncertainty in demand, travel times or distance, with an approach of p-MP modeling. Aktaş, Özaydın, Bozkaya, Ülengin, and Önsel (2013) used SCP and MCLP models to study the same problem for Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. Based on a maximum five-minute response time, their solution increased the city's fire station coverage performance significantly.

Quick response to accidents on roads is crucial for the transportation of victims to hospitals. Erdemir et al. (2008a) studied how to serve stationary demand points and continuous paths (i.e. travel routes) from facilities. They developed two detached models as quadratic MCLP and geometrical network forms and implemented them on locating cellular base stations. In another paper of theirs, Erdemir et al. (2008b) utilized their quadratic MCLP model to determine optimal aeromedical base locations so as to respond to motor vehicle crashes with the objective of maximizing total coverage of crash nodes and crash paths. One classic example of resource utilization is the fight against forest fires, as mentioned in Dimopoulo and Giannikos (2004). Upon detecting fire, an immediate action is taken in order to minimize the damage. As the fire continues, the reallocation of resources is conducted with the help of the dynamic model. In their study, Huang and Pan (2007) developed an incident response management tool (IRMT) which combines Geographic Information System (GIS), traffic simulation, and optimization techniques with the objective of minimizing the total travel time to traffic incidents. They also showed that the proposed optimal incident response strategy outperforms the conventional ones. The resource allocation problem is also seen in planning of public health emergency cases, such as a bioterrorist attack (Lee, Chen, Pietz, & Benecke, 2009). It seeks to determine locations for the distribution of medicine, such as vaccines or drugs, followed by allocating resources to the chosen destinations. In another paper, Mishra, Sharma, Khasnabis, and Mathew (2013) studied resource allocation for large fleets of buses, with the intention of maintaining service standards with a limited budget for an aging fleet. The authors built up an integer programming model that shares funds among different fleet improvement programs along with minimizing the total cost.

In our review of the literature pertaining to the allocation of military or SAR resources, we encountered a number of studies in the US Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) considering the allocation of Turkish Air Force (TUAF) assets for various purposes. For example, Basdemir (2000) modeled an MCLP for allocating SAR helicopters to candidate bases to satisfy pre-defined demand points (incident regions). He solved the problem for the Aegean and the Western Mediterranean regions of Turkey with generic data under three scenarios, each differing in coverage distances. He then combined the findings to come up with a solution set that maximizes coverage in all scenarios with the minimum number of bases. In another study, Alkanat (2008) applied both SCP and MCLP models to optimally locate SAM sites to defend specific areas of Turkish Air Space. In his study, Sarikaya (2009) analyzed three combat scenarios Turkey might encounter and developed an MCLP model to determine optimal orbit locations for Turkish Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft in the combat arena. As another example of a location study in the specialty of TUAF, Acar (2015) developed a VBA & LINGO Software interface to determine the information for the required number of SAR units and their locations for TUAF SAR resources. He applied the three following resource allocation models: SCP to determine the minimum number of SAR Deployment Points (DPs) for covering aircraft training areas, MCLP to obtain maximum coverage with a given SAR DP number, and p-MP to provide locations of SAR DPs while obtaining minimum aggregate or average response time.

The US Coast Guard (USCG) and Air Force (USAF) have also applied similar models in a variety of contexts. For example, Brown, Dell, and Farmer (1996) developed an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to schedule USCG district cutter assignments for patrol missions with the objective of either minimizing total assignment costs or minimizing the change from the previous scheduling period. Dawson, Bell, and Weir (2007) combined p-MP and p-CP models to determine the locations of security teams over a geographic area to maintain security for USAF Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Systems. This combined model aimed to minimize the distances traveled while minimizing the maximum distance from any missile site to required security forces. Afshartous, Guan, and Mehrotra (2009) considered the problem of determining locations of the USCG air stations to respond to emergency distress calls and utilized an optimization and simulation based methodology. They modeled and solved the problem as a p-Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (p-UFLP), a hybrid of p-MP and UFLP, and used simulation to test the robustness of the initial solution. The authors assumed that the demand for each client is equal and served with a single resource. Although we consider it to be a similar problem, our structure differs in that demand for each incident varies and each demand can be covered from multiple resources (boats). Nelson et al. (2014) also developed a MIP model for allocating USCG aircrafts to air stations, while meeting other USCG business requirements such as training, patrolling, maintenance and periodic duties. Running their optimization model over a set of station-specific scenarios, they determined optimal deployment assignments, operational levels, and aircraft allocations.

In their study, Abi-Zeid and Frost (2005) applied search theory to SAR missions and developed a geographic decision support tool, called SARPlan, to assist the Canadian Forces in the optimal planning of search missions for missing aircrafts. Wysokiński, Marcjan, and Dajda (2014) developed a similar system for the Polish SAR teams. Breivik and Allen (2008) presented an ensemble-based SAR model for the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea. However, these tools and models are designed to operate at the operational level with the primary purpose of maximizing detection probability but are not capable of optimizing boat locations.

Narrowing the scope of our review, to the best of our knowledge Azofra, Pérez-Labajos, Blanco, and Achutegui (2007), Losea (1976), Pelot, Akbari, and Li (2015), Radovilsky and Koermer (2007) and Wagner and Radovilsky (2012) are the only studies that directly address the problem of optimal allocation of CG boat resources. In his thesis, Losea (1976) described a resource allocation plan for the USCG from a political and social science perspective, and did not attempt to build a model. As a more general allocation model of SAR resources, Azofra et al. (2007) proposed two gravitational models, namely Individual and Zonal Distribution Models, to optimally allocate rescue boats to candidate ports. In the Individual Distribution Model, each port is evaluated with respect to several factors and labeled with a coefficient which provides a criterion for assigning a specific boat to a port. In the Zonal Distribution Model (ZDM) accidents are clustered into zones and each zone is provided with a centroid called “superaccident”. Later, the authors computed the effectiveness of all possible allocation schemes in terms of boat-port suitability, the distance between each port and superaccident, and superaccident weights. Part of our work is inspired by this study with some distinctions. Azofra et al. (2007) obtains the location of a superaccident by simply computing the arithmetic mean of the latitudes and longitudes of the accidents that occurred in the zone. However, the authors do not attempt to obtain weights of incident types. We improve their general approach by integrating AHP to derive the weights according to incident types, applying a k-clustering algorithm for grouping incident locations. In their study Pelot et al. (2015) consider the SAR boat location problem for the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG). They categorize SAR boats based on their capabilities and use historical incident data to solve the allocation problem. The authors also classify incidents based on their severity and establish a response time requirement for each type.


                     Radovilsky and Koermer (2007) developed an ILP model for optimally allocating small boats among the USCG stations with the objective of minimizing shortage or excess capacity at the stations. In the model, they defined boats as primary decision variables, and did not consider boat hours. They only considered small boats and did not allow sharing them among multiple demand points. Wagner and Radovilsky (2012) improved Radovilsky and Koermer (2007)’s work and developed a more realistic mo-MIP model called the Boat Allocation Tool (BAT) for the same problem. Despite the fact that this work results in a significant impact on USCG fleet performance (such as a decrease of 87.6 percent in these shortage hours as well as a reduction of 62.3 percent in the excess hours at the stations), it also contains substantial limitations, especially for fleets operating in shallow and confined waters: (1) The authors identify the demand as station's demand (in hours) for each station. They later budget each boat type with a standard annual supply (capacity) of hours and match the station's demand with the total amount of all boats’ standard supply hours at a station. However, with this approach, the model does not consider actual locations of the demand (locations of incidents that received a response), which in practice could influence the allocation plan. In a real situation, from which station a boat is assigned depends on the distance between the incident location and stations. Besides, especially for CG fleets which comprise smaller sized boats, the assignment decision is limited to the boat's operating range. Therefore, both incident-station distance and boat range should be taken into consideration in such plans. (2) The objective function focuses mainly on cost minimization and does not consider response time to incidents. In contrast, the models addressing public and emergency services generally should focus on user accessibility and response time (Balcik & Beamon, 2008). (3) The model does not incorporate a variety of critically important technical and tactical limitations required in managing boat allocations, i.e., boat range and speed limits, station's physical capacity, etc. In our paper, we encompass some important aspects of this work, and specifically address these weaknesses.

In the following, we summarize the main contribution of our methodology. In this paper, we:

                        
                           •
                           Define an analytic way of obtaining relative weights for incident types.

Develop a mo-MIP resource allocation model that addresses the tactical configuration of the SAR resources.

Compare the performance of the IB-BAM-derived allocation plan with the current allocation plan with respect to TurCG historical incident data.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

Optimal allocation of SAR resources is a strategic process which is to be carried out with an excellent plan to react to all incidents at sea rapidly to increase the rate of survivals and decrease material damages. Furthermore, construction of an allocation model must consider some key factors such as:

                        
                           •
                           Historical data of incidents in the area of interest.

Types, requirements and severity of incidents.

Resource limits.

Geographical factors.

Available ports and their limitations.

Business rules of the organization.

In this study, all above factors were taken into account and IB-BAM was formulated with the methodology displayed in Fig. 2
                     . Briefly, this methodology includes three major steps: (Step-1) determining incident type weights, (Step-2) the ZDM and (Step-3) the optimization model. Now we describe the key aspects of IB-BAM in more detail.
                  

Maritime casualties pose various risks in terms of human, environmental and economic loss. The likelihood or the magnitude of loss is highly related with the type of the incident. Therefore, prioritization of incident types might be a necessity in planning SAR operations, especially when the amount of resources is limited or scarce.

There are a number of MCDM techniques in the literature for assisting decision-makers in their decision making or ranking problems. These techniques allow them to assess various alternatives for achieving their goals. Among these, we propose the use of AHP, the most popular MCMD technique, to determine the grade of severity (weight) of maritime incident types.

The AHP technique first introduced by Saaty (1980) is a very popular approach in addressing how to obtain the relative importance of a set of alternatives in an MCDM problem. In the application process, the decision problem is decomposed into a hierarchy of sub-problems, which are easier to evaluate and a hierarchical decision model is constructed. Next, pairwise comparisons are made to determine the importance of the decision criteria with regard to the criterion preceding them in the hierarchy. This enables decision makers to focus on the relative preference or importance of just two objects, thus decreases the influence of extraneous factors. (Badri, 2001, Dağdeviren & Yüksel, 2008). Although Vaidya and Kumar (2006)’s review displays that AHP has a large scale of applications in fields such as engineering, education and manufacturing, it is not applicable in large problem instances (Daim, Yates, Peng, & Jimenez, 2009). AHP is perfect for our consideration since there are few criteria and alternatives involved.

AHP methodology has five main steps to follow:

                           
                              (1)
                              Define the problem and state the desired objectives.

Construct the decision hierarchy tree. The top of the tree is the goal of the decision-maker. The intermediate level comprises of criteria and sub-criteria that relate to the objective while the lowest level is about alternatives.

Establish priorities among the elements of the hierarchy by a series of pairwise comparisons. Firstly, compare each criterion with the others on the same level. Then, compare each alternative with others with respect to each criterion.

Synthesize these comparisons to obtain a set of final (or global) priorities of the alternatives.

For each set of the comparisons, check the consistency of the judgments by calculating a Consistency Ratio (CR). If the CR is greater than 0.1, then the judgments are considered to be untrustworthy and must be repeated.

Pairwise comparisons are undertaken using the intensity matrix (see Table 1) introduced by Saaty (1987). The scale indicates the strength with which one factor dominates another in respect to a higher-level factor. Comparison value “1” indicates that compared items are equally important. As the comparison value increases, the discrepancy in the balance of importance increases as well. Large value indicates higher importance for the compared item.

For our ranking problem, we include eight incident types observed in the Aegean Sea; drifting, capsizing, grounding, fire, collision, flooding, missing, and medical assistance as the alternatives. The importance or the impact associated with an incident is often specified using different attributes. After discussing with experts, fatality, material damage, response arduousness and environmental impact are determined to be the most important attributes affecting the ranking (See Table 2
                         for criteria definitions). The resulting decision tree that represents the hierarchical relationships between those elements is shown in Fig. 3.
                        
                     

Next we developed a MATLAB-based AHP tool and integrated it with the ZDM (in Step-2). The tool enables users to change/add/delete incident alternatives, criteria and pairwise comparisons. After entering each acceptable value of comparison, it displays the weight for each incident type in the comparison. The largest weight means the most severe incident type.

In this step we propose a ZDM in order to obtain the amount and location of demand. Firstly, we define demand points at the individual incident locations obtained from the historical data. However, information visualization displays and maps can easily get crowded from a few hundred data points. Besides, solving an ILP model by considering all data individually may increase the CPU time drastically. One way to accommodate such large data sets is to create aggregates. Fredrikson, North, Plaisant, and Shneiderman (1999) defines an aggregate as “a single point that represents or summarizes the group of data points”. Many of the fields to which facility location and resource allocation models have been practiced take the data base as some aggregation of geographically dispersed demand (Goodchild, 1979). Although it brings an increase in the model error, aggregation is preferred for its decreasing the cost of computing, data collection and modeling, along with confidentiality concerns and data statistical uncertainty (Francis, Lowe, Rayco, & Tamir, 2009).

There exists a large number of clustering techniques which produce an aggregate cluster point, and the k-means clustering algorithm (k-MCA) is the simplest and most commonly used algorithm. First published by MacQueen (1967), k-MCA on n given data points yields a set of k centers called “centroids” that minimizes the sum of squared distances between each point and its centroid. However in this algorithm, every data point has equal importance in locating the centroid. This property no longer holds in our case where each data point (incident point) has a different weight. Hence, the clustering algorithm has to consider a weight associated with each incident point in the computation of cluster centroids. Kerdprasop, Kerdprasop, and Sattayatham (2005) addressed this problem and proposed the “weighted k-means clustering algorithm” (wk-MCA) which simply minimizes the weighted sum of squared distances between each point and its weighted-centroid.

Now we can formulate the basic framework for generating superincidents as follows:

                           
                              k ∈ K
                           
                           
                              : Set of incidents

: Set of incident types.

: Set of (superincident) zones.

: Set of incidents of type i ∈ I that occurred in zone z ∈ Z.

: Set of incident operation times (hours) where tk
                                  denotes its k
                                 th element.

: weight of incident of type i. (obtained from Step-1)

We implemented Kerdprasop et al. (2005)’s wk-MCA in MATLAB® such that each weighted data point is represented by an incident k ∈ K of type i ∈ I with a weight wi

                        , which is simple and suitable for all types of data (Kodinariya & Makwana,2013). For each zone z ∈ Z, the wk-MCA generates a weighted-centroid, which we call as a “superincident”.

During an annual period, not all boats are operational 100 percent of the time mainly because of scheduled events (such as overhauling, maintenance, exercises, sea trials) or unexpected situations (such as breakdowns, crew shortage). In order to maintain a certain level of service without interruption, the business rule of “minimum number of boats requirement” is implemented.

One common objective used in many resource allocation related studies is to minimize the fixed and variable costs associated with locating the new facility (Tsouros & Satratzemi, 1994). In our case we define our “fleet operating cost” as the sum of fixed and variable costs of boat operations. At the end of each fiscal year, the “annual fleet operating budget” is declared and distributed over available boats in the following year. Constraint (12) measures the deviations from budget as follows:

The multiobjective function, given by Eq. (20), attempts to minimize three terms. The first term measures the total weighted deviations resulting from exceeding critical response times. The second term represents the deviation resulting from exceeding the budget. The final term measures the total deviation of supply from capacity. Minimizing both positive and negative deviations aims to balance workload such that for each boat type assigned to a port the excess and shortage operation hours over annual capacity is minimized.

For each goal g ∈ {1, 2, 3}, ωg
                            and θg
                            represent the weights assigned by the decision maker, and the normalization factor, respectively. Normalization factors θg
                            are used to scale objective function terms which have different magnitudes, enabling to get consistent solutions with the weights ωg
                           . In our model, we use the normalization technique described by Grodzevich and Romanko (2006), pp.93. The technique is developed for scaling the weighted sum of objective functions in multiobjective optimization problems. It requires calculation of two special locations in the solution space for each goal g: Nadir (upper bound on objectives) and Utopia (lower bound on objectives) points, denoted by

                            respectively. Then it uses the differences in those points and gives the normalization factors as

In this section, we experiment and measure the performance of IB-BAM. To identify the quantifiable impact of the model, we compared several sets of boat allocation results. First, we defined a number of performance metrics that reflected the outcomes of a boat allocation plan. Next, we computed the performance of the current boat allocation plan in the Aegean Sea, called the Current Plan. Utilizing the incident data of 2014, we then measured the performance of IB-BAM.

Implementation of Step 1 and 2 (weight determination and ZDM) is conducted in MATLAB® R2013a. We solve the optimization model (Step 3) in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS©) environment using CPLEX 12.2.0.2.

TurCG is responsible for responding to incidents and gathering data for planning and operation assessment purposes. Their database has a record of every incident that occurred in all SAR sub-responsibility areas around the mainland. When an incident occurs and the necessary action is taken, an operator at the Operations Management Center fills in an incident report form. The form has detailed information about the incident, including incident type, location, time and date, weather conditions, boats that responded, operation time, departure and arrival times, incident causes, the number of people killed or injured, etc. The incident data that we used in our analysis are derived from incident record files for the Aegean Sea sub-area that were provided to us by the TurCG. Specifically, there are 716 incidents of 8 different types that occurred in the Aegean Sea during 2014.

We considered 9 different types of boats and obtained data regarding a number of their characteristics such as: total number, AOC, minimum and maximum allowable number of boats at a port, range, operation speed, length, fixed annual costs and variable costs per hour. We also determined the capacity (mts) and suitability data for 25 candidate ports in the Aegean coastline. For confidentiality purposes we name boats as B1, B2,…, B9 and ports as P1, P2,…, P25.

In our ranking problem, eight incident types are assessed in terms of four criteria. The determination of the relative importance of each criterion toward the others is carried out through pairwise comparisons, for which experts express their preference by assigning a numerical value from Table 1 in respect to the data. Results in Table 3 indicate that the criterion “fatality” has the highest weight of 0.542, followed by “environmental impact” which has that of 0.247. Therefore, “fatality” and “environmental impact” should be the main concerns in ranking the severity of incident types. “Response arduousness” and “material damage” have weights of 0.134 and 0.077, respectively. These results indicate that when ranking incident types, these two criteria are least concerned. The inconsistency value is determined as 0.03.

Given the accepted criteria structure and the resulting importance weights obtained in Table 3, the participants (TurCG representatives) were asked to pairwise compare the incident types with respect to each criterion. Tables 4–7
                        
                        
                        
                         show comparisons with fatality, material damage, response arduousness and environmental impact respectively.


                        Fig. 4
                         provides a summary of the overall results of the comparative study. The first four value sets represent the local weights of eight alternatives for each criterion and the last value set represents final weights. Capsizing has the highest weight of 0.249, followed by fire with that of 0.188. Also note that capsizing and fire attain the highest two local weights respectively consistently in all four criteria. This means that, these two incident types are critical in terms of fatality, material and environmental damage, and are also defined as the toughest incident types to respond to. They are followed by collision, missing and medical assistance with weights of 0.139, 0.119, 0.116, respectively. The least important incident types are determined as flooding, grounding and drifting with weights of 0.085, 0.060 and 0.044, respectively.

Incident type weights and incident data (location, type and response duration) are the primary input data for our ZDM. Table 8
                         shows key parameters related to incident types, viz. weights, number of incident types observed in the area and average demand per incident in hours. Drifting is the most common incident type observed in the region (474 incidents) followed by medical assistance (118 incidents). Collision and fire are the least common incident types observed in 2014 with 2 and 4 occurrences respectively. In terms of demand per incident, capsizing requires the longest duration of 76 boat-hours on average whereas collision and medical assistance requires only 3 boat-hours for response.

                        Table 9
                         is a summary of ZDM outputs. For each superincident region it contains the breakdown of number of incidents and demands for each incident type and superincident zone. The results reveal that the superincident 15 has the highest demand of 1114 hours, probably caused by the dense illegal immigration from Bodrum to Greek Islands. Superincidents 3, 7, 13 and 18 represent the regions with relatively less yearly demand, i.e. less than 200 hours.

The IB-BAM optimization model uses the superincident locations and demand obtained in previous step as the main input data. Parameters cfbp,cvb, Sb
                        , and crti
                         used in our optimization model are adopted from the SAR documents and budget plans. Briefly, the yearly fixed cost cfbp
                        of using a single type b boat in port p considers logistics costs and support overhead. The hourly cost cvb
                        of operating a type b boat is calculated by averaging seven years of materials cost, repairs, maintenance costs, etc. For each boat type, the default annual operation capacity Sb
                        , measured in hours, is derived from the expected lifespan of boats. Response time rtbpz
                        is simply computed by dividing the distance between port p and zone z with the operation speed of boat type b. The distance between a port and a zone is determined with the help of an online tool (sea distance calculator in Marine vessel traffic©, www.marinevesseltraffic.com) which calculates the shortest distance by water between two given locations.

                        8) to compare the effectiveness of an IB-BAM allocation plan with the current plan. In Table 11

                         respectively. Weights used in IB-BAM plans are defined by TurCG experts and are prescribed to impose a greater weight on the total delay component of the objective function, and equal weights to the remaining two components. The main distinction is that, setting

                        , Plan-2 sets a much higher importance on minimizing the total delay and keeping budget and supply hour component weights at minimal levels, whereas Plan-1 seeks a more balanced result among all components. As noted in the table, both IB-BAM plans have a significant positive practical impact on the current plan and substantially improve the performance metrics.

First, in terms of metrics PM
                        1 and PM
                        2, IB-BAM plans outperform the current plan significantly. The total response time over the critical reaction time threshold is decreased from 25.6 hours to 7.755 hours (Plan-1) and 2.143 hours (Plan-2) which imply a 70 percent (Plan-1) and 92 percent (Plan-2) reduction. Similarly, the total weighted delay is reduced by 86 percent (Plan-1) and 95 percent (Plan-2). Second, PM
                        3 metric results imply that there is no shortage on the budget in any of the plans. However Plan-1 and Plan-2 result in a cost saving of 7 percent and 6 percent respectively (metric PM
                        4). The main reason for this is the decreased total yearly fixed cost which is associated with the utilized fleet percentage, measured as 90 percent (Plan-1) and 92 percent (Plan-2) in metric PM
                        8. Third, metrics PM
                        5, PM
                        6 and PM
                        7 suggest that the mismatch between workload hours and targeted AOCs is greatly improved. In specific, Plan-1 has no significant deviation and Plan-2 ends up with a total of 263 deviation hours which is approximately 7 percent of the current plan. Thus, the optimized plans obtained from IB-BAM indicate that the fleet is utilized more effectively, with respect to the three objectives of the model and eight performance metrics. Having a quick look at Plan 1 and 2 results, one can gain an understanding of the tradeoffs in the different objective function components as their weights change, e.g. longer delay time, lower cost and less workload-AOC mismatch in Plan-1, and just the opposite in Plan-2.

After the supply hours sbpzi
                         are determined, they are evenly assigned to boats of the same type in each port. That is the total workload of a type b boat in port p is simply calculated as follows:

                        . This approach enables a balanced AOC deviation among all boats of the same type in a port.

After determining optimal boat allocation plans using IB-BAM, we created two recommended plans (Plans 1 and 2 summarized in Table 11) to replace the original allocation. With regard to the recommended plans and their outcomes, the authorities think that the new SAR allocation plan should be adopted to increase the performance of operations with respect to the eight performance metrics.

Currently, IB-BAM does not consider variability in the demand in that it generates allocation plans for a given set of historical incident data. Although the model uses deterministic data, risk associated with the demand variability is incorporated into the system as follows: First in any implemented optimal plan, there will be a safety stock of boat hours associated with the remaining 15 percent of the fleet. Second, as requested by TurCG, the model determined allocation plans for the worst case situation (year 2014), where the demand reaches its peak value among previous five years. Furthermore, for strategic long run planning purposes a demand estimate can be used according to the forecasted number of incidents and the ZDM can easily be updated.

We demonstrated the results of IB-BAM for two TurCG defined objective function component weights. For the purpose of strategic and flexible resource planning, decision-makers also requested the optimal boat allocation plans when the objective function component weights are varied. So, as a sensitivity analysis, we thought it might be meaningful to evaluate the results of other weighting strategies. Therefore, while demonstrating the flexibility of IB-BAM, this analysis attempts to help decision makers understand the trade-offs in different prioritization and weighting strategies. In our tests we also violate the expert judgment that the total delay should receive a greater weight and quantify the impact of this policy. Table 12
                         and Fig. 6
                         summarize the performance metric values for 15 test cases. Test cases #8 and 12 represent IB-BAM Plan 1 and 2, respectively.

First, data in this table show that there is no budget shortage risk for any considered weighting strategy. Second, it shows that test cases # 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are dominated by case #5 in terms of objective function components, PM
                        2
                        , PM
                        3 and PM
                        7. Hence, it makes sense to assign weights as ω
                        1 > ω
                        2, ω
                        3, in accordance with the expert opinion. Third, test case #15 reveals that it is almost possible to eliminate delay with the cost of a total 1907 deviation hours of supply from AOC while utilizing almost all the fleet. Similarly, test case #7 reveals that one can almost eliminate the mismatch between workload hours and targeted AOCs with the cost of total 1.081 weighted delay hours.


                        Fig. 6 exhibits the tradeoff in the total weighted delay (PM
                        2), percentage of budget used (PM
                        4), total deviation on the AOC (PM
                        7) and percentage of utilized fleet (PM
                        8) for each test case. The analysis shows the response time can drastically be decreased at the cost of utilizing a greater percentage of the fleet and a higher mismatch between the workload and AOC hours of boats. In all settings it is encouraging to see that the total operating cost is below the budget and weighted delay is less than the 15 percent of the weighted delay in the current plan (except for test case-1, where

                              =
                              0
                           
                        ).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have presented a new tactical model IB-BAM, developed for determining optimal placement of SAR boats. The model is a resource allocation model with additional capabilities that can be structured within three steps: It first utilizes the AHP technique to determine weights for each incident type. Next, using a ZDM with historical incident data it generates high resolution concentrated demand locations and hours. As the final step it determines the optimal allocation plan and workload distribution among boats for the SAR fleet using a mo-MIP model. The optimization model is developed from the perspective of providing low response time to incidents while minimizing costs and mismatch between the workload and AOC of boats. As a real-world problem we illustrated our proposed model to optimize TurCG boat resources with respect to the Aegean Sea sub-area. After tailoring IB-BAM for the specific requirements of TurCG, we implemented the organization's business and technical rules in the optimization model.

We presented the results for two different TurCG defined objective function component weight settings and evaluated their performance with respect to eight performance metrics. The results showed a significant impact of the model. In particular, in Plan-1 the positive weighted deviation associated with the critical reaction time threshold is decreased by 84 percent. While keeping total fleet operating costs below the planned budget the total shortage and excess hours of AOCs were decreased from 2620 hours to 30 hours. In addition to those settings, we conducted a number of experiments for various weight settings to exhibit the trade-offs in prioritization of objective function components. The tradeoff analysis shows that attaining a low level of response time to incidents for a given budget level is possible by efficiently deploying the boats to determined ports.

For future work on this study, we are motivated to consider forecasting future incident rates and implement a dynamic optimization model which incorporates the cost of re-locating a boat among ports. This approach can further improve the performance of the model and possibly minimize the number of boats that switch ports at each reallocation decision time. Another future study may consider developing a combined optimization model which includes both SAR aircraft and surface units.
