                  Due to the dramatic increase in the world’s container traffic, the efficient management of operations in seaport container terminals has become a crucial issue. In this work, we focus on the integrated planning of the following problems faced at container terminals: berth allocation, quay crane assignment (number), and quay crane assignment (specific). First, we formulate a new binary integer linear program for the integrated solution of the berth allocation and quay crane assignment (number) problems called BACAP. Then we extend it by incorporating the quay crane assignment (specific) problem as well, which is named BACASP. Computational experiments performed on problem instances of various sizes indicate that the model for BACAP is very efficient and even large instances up to 60 vessels can be solved to optimality. Unfortunately, this is not the case for BACASP. Therefore, to be able to solve large instances, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for generating an optimal solution of BACASP from an optimal solution of BACAP using a post-processing algorithm. In case this condition is not satisfied, we make use of a cutting plane algorithm which solves BACAP repeatedly by adding cuts generated from the optimal solutions until the aforementioned condition holds. This method proves to be viable and enables us to solve large BACASP instances as well. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest instances that can be solved to optimality for this difficult problem, which makes our work applicable to realistic problems.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The proportion of containerized trade in the world’s total dry cargo has increased from 5.1% in 1980 to 25.4% in 2008 (UNCTAD, 2009). Containers provide a reliable and standardized means of transportation, which results in shorter transit times, possibility of using multiple modalities and eventually in reduced shipping and handling costs. As a result of these factors, container traffic has increased by 53.3% between years 2000 and 2010, 11% of which is attributed to year 2010 alone (UNCTAD, 2010). This rate of increase has made efficient management of container terminal operations crucial, resulting in a significant amount of research from an Operations Research point of view (Steenken, Voß, & Stahlbock, 2004; Stahlbock & Voß, 2008). Container terminal operations are very complicated, requiring close coordination of ships, cranes, trucks, storage space and personnel. Huge data and computational resource requirements make it impractical to consider decision problems on the entire set of operations at once. Instead, container terminal operations are typically grouped as seaside, transfer and yard operations and the corresponding problems are investigated separately (Vis & de Koster, 2003). In this paper, we concentrate on integrated seaside operations (Meisel, 2009), and refer the reader to the recent work of Vacca (2010) for more information about transfer and yard operations.

Various problems in seaside operations have been investigated in the literature. One of the first lines of research on analysis of seaside operations investigates the applications of queuing models in port investment decisions for container berths (Edmond & Maggs, 1978). However, more recent research on seaside operations has focused on solving operational planning problems. In particular, the berth assignment problem (BAP) deals with the determination of optimal berthing times and locations of ships such that incoming vessels arrive and depart within their allowed time windows and no two vessels occupy the same berth-time segment simultaneously (Lai & Shih, 1992; Brown, Lawphongpanich, & Thurman, 1994). The quay crane assignment problem (CAP) deals with allocating cranes to vessels such that each vessel is assigned to a number of cranes within some specified bounds, and the total number of cranes is not exceeded (Steenken et al., 2004). CAP can be extended in such a way that the specific cranes used for the service of vessels are also determined. This problem is referred to as CAP (specific) in Bierwirth and Meisel (2010), which we name as CASP. This means that in addition to the number of cranes assigned to a vessel, it is also determined in CASP which individual quay cranes serve that vessel. More detailed constraints regarding physical alignment of cranes along a rail are considered as well (Daganzo, 1989; Peterkofsky & Daganzo, 1990). We refer the reader to Bierwirth and Meisel (2010) for a detailed literature survey on seaside operations.

BAP and CASP can be solved sequentially as suggested by the initial research. However, the distribution of cranes to vessels has a direct effect on the vessels’ processing times. Therefore, later research has focused on integrating these problems. To the best of our knowledge, first attempts for integration are due to Daganzo (1989), Peterkofsky and Daganzo (1990), where the authors unify CAP and quay crane scheduling problem (CSP) called CACSP. The aim of CSP is to find a detailed schedule for each crane by taking into account all unloading and loading operations with task precedence constraints. Recently, Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Makui, Salahi, Bazzazi, and Taheri (2009) propose a new mixed-integer programming formulation and a heuristic solution algorithm for CACSP. The integration of BAP and CAP into berth allocation and quay crane assignment problem (BACAP) has received more attention (Blazewicz, Edwin Cheng, Machowiak, & Oguz, 2011; Bierwirth & Meisel, 2010; Meisel & Bierwirth, 2005; Meisel & Bierwirth, 2009a, 2009b; Hendriks, Laumanns, Lefeber, & Udding, 2008; Giallombardo, Moccia, Salani, & Vacca, 2010; Liang, Huang, & Yang, 2008). In addition to proposing solution algorithms for BACAP, Park and Kim (2003) and Imai, Chen, Nishimura, and Papadimitriou (2008) propose post-processing approaches for the determination of the specific cranes used. Rashidi (2006) and Theofanis, Golias, and Boile (2007) develop an integrated mathematical programming formulation for BACAP that yields the optimal berthing times and positions of the vessels in addition to the number of cranes.

The BACAP model proposed in Liu, Wan, and Wang (2006) is weaker in the sense that the authors determine optimal vessel berthing times, crane numbers and specifications, but an optimal solution does not include any information about berthing positions. Besides, they preprocess CSP to generate possible handling times for each vessel and each assignable number of cranes. The same approach is adopted by Meier and Schumann (2007), Meisel (2009), Meisel and Bierwirth (2013) and Ak (2008). Meier and Schumann (2007) try to achieve this by functionally integrating their integrated CACSP model with BAP. However, Meisel (2009) and Meisel and Bierwirth (2013) functionally integrate BACAP with CSP: crane schedules are determined according to the berthing times while crane assignments are obtained by solving an integrated BACAP model. In his work on the optimal planning of the seaside operations, Ak (2008) develops a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that integrates BAP, CAP and CSP. His model calculates optimal berthing times, berth allocations and crane number assignments of the vessels, and crane schedules simultaneously for given specific crane assignments, which makes the presented integration as the deepest of the available ones. However, the author suggests a Tabu search heuristic since his model can only handle very small problem instances. Zhang, Zheng, Zhang, Shi, and Armstrong (2010) focuses on the integration of BAP and CASP (which we call BACASP in the sequel). Due to the complexity of their formulation, a commercial solver package for MILP problems can only deal with up to three vessels within 1 one hour of CPU time. Therefore, the authors apply a method based on Lagrangian relaxation and sub-gradient optimization to solve the problem.

In this work we follow this line of research and formulate two new MILP formulations deeply integrating first BAP and CAP (BACAP), and then BAP and CASP (BACASP). Both of them consider a continuous berth layout where vessels can berth at arbitrary positions within the range of the quay and dynamic vessel arrivals where vessels cannot berth before the expected arrival time. The crane work plan found by solving the BACASP formulation determines the specific crane allocation to vessels for every time period. As a result, BACASP may be seen as a deep integration of BAP and CASP for which there is no study according to the recent survey of Bierwirth and Meisel (2010). In the work plan obtained by solving the BACASP model, when two vessels are at the berth at the same time, cranes are assigned to vessels in such a way that the one having a position before the other gets cranes such that the cranes of the former are positioned before those of the latter. We propose a necessary and sufficient condition for obtaining an optimal solution of BACASP from an optimal solution of BACAP by a post-processing algorithm. We also develop an exact solution algorithm for the case where this condition is not satisfied. This is a cutting plane algorithm that generates cuts for the BACAP formulation until the condition is satisfied. Then it becomes possible to apply the aforementioned post-processing algorithm and obtain an optimal solution of BACASP. Experiments show that cutting plane algorithm finds optimal solutions for problem instances containing up to sixty vessels. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest instances solved to optimality in the literature, which makes our work applicable for the solution of real-life problems.

The next section is devoted to the formulations of the new models. We present the new necessary and sufficient condition for generating a regular work plan from an optimal solution of BACAP and propose a simple post-processing procedure in Section 3. In Section 4 we present the new cutting plane algorithm that gives the optimal solution of BACASP. Section 5 reports the results of the computational study we perform with the new formulations, post-processing procedure and the new cutting plane algorithm. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 6.

Before describing our mathematical formulations for BACAP and BACASP, we will first discuss the underlying assumptions of our models, which are given as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           The planning horizon is divided into equal-sized time periods.

Crane relocation time is negligible since the length of each time period is much larger than the crane relocation time.

The berth is divided into equal-sized berth sections.

Each berth section is occupied by no more than one vessel in each time period.

Each quay crane can be assigned to at most one vessel per time period.

Each vessel has a minimum and maximum number of quay cranes that can be assigned to it.

The service of a vessel by quay cranes begins upon that vessel’s berthing at the terminal, and it is not disrupted until the vessel departs.

The number of quay cranes assigned to a vessel does not change during its stay at the berth, which is referred to as a time-invariant assignment (Bierwirth & Meisel, 2010). Furthermore, the set of specific cranes assigned to a vessel is kept the same.

Assumptions 1–7 are quite common in the literature as far as BAP and BASP problems are considered. There are different assumptions, however, regarding the number of cranes assigned to a vessel during the time the vessel is at the berth. Some authors assume that the number of cranes may change dynamically between the minimum and maximum number of cranes (see, e.g. Park & Kim (2003), Meisel & Bierwirth (2009b)), and some others allow a limited number of changes (Zhang et al., 2010). There are also approaches as the one by Giallombardo et al. (2010), which can be seen as a compromise between these two modeling assumptions, where the authors introduce quay crane assignment profiles that represent the number of cranes available to a vessel during a work shift. These profiles help to consider a limited number of changes (one or two) in the number of cranes across work shifts. However, the set of profiles has to be known a priori for each vessel and an increase in their number has a substantial effect on the size of the model. Indeed, the resulting MILP model developed by Giallombardo et al. (2010) becomes hardly solvable even for small instances as the authors point out in their paper. Therefore, they resort to a Tabu search heuristic for generating feasible solutions. In our model, quay crane assignment profiles could be potentially combined with Assumption 2 about the negligibility of crane relocation time to partially relax Assumption 8, but this unfortunately yields a different formulation with the additional binary variables related to assignment of profiles to vessels. The number of these binary variables is inevitably huge depending the on the number of profiles, which gives rise to the fact the resulting model cannot be solved efficiently to optimality. As a result, although Assumption 8 appears to be restrictive, it allows us not only to reduce large setup losses due to reallocation of quay cranes, but also results in an MILP model that can be solved exactly for large instances. Last but not least, although we do not explicitly consider decreasing crane productivity rates in our paper, we prefer not to state this fact as a separate assumption because it can be addressed to a certain extent through parameter 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                           
                        
                     , which is the processing time of vessel i if k cranes are assigned to it.


                     Table 1
                      lists the parameters used in our mathematical models for BACAP and BACASP along with their brief descriptions. Similarly, Table 2
                      displays the decision variables. We will next discuss the details of our solution approaches.

As described in Section 1, BACAP is an extension of the berth allocation problem (BAP), in which the (aggregate) capacity of quay cranes is considered. BACAP aims to find optimal berthing sections and berthing times of vessels as well as the number of cranes assigned to each vessel so as to minimize the total cost.

Let us define a binary variable 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    X
                                 
                                 
                                    ijt
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                              
                           
                        , which is equal to one if vessel i starts berthing at section j in time period t, and k quay cranes are assigned to it, and zero otherwise. Constraint (1) ensures that each vessel berths at a unique section and time period, and the number of quay cranes assigned to it lies between the minimum and maximum allowed quantities:

                        The next set of constraints eliminates overlaps between vessels at the berth. In particular, constraint set (2) guarantees that each berth section is occupied by at most one vessel in each time period (see Assumption 4). To put it differently, there should not be any overlap among the rectangles representing vessels in the two-dimensional time-berth section space, which are located between

Constraint sets (1) and (2) represent the feasible region of BAP. We next discuss how quay crane availability can be handled in the BACAP model. Let us denote the number of available quay cranes by N. Constraint set (3) ensures that in each time period the number of active quay cranes is less than or equal to the available number of cranes:

The objective function (4) of our model minimizes the total cost, whose components for each vessel are: (i) the cost of deviation from the desired berth section, (ii) the cost of berthing later than the arrival time, and (iii) the cost of departing later than the due time. Our integer programming formulation for BACAP can be summarized as follows:

                        A compact presentation of the formulation is included in the appendix. In this formulation, the cost of berthing away from the desired berthing position is a linear function of the deviation from the desired berthing position. When a vessel is berthed away from its desired berthing position, the distance to the storage area in the yard, where containers are stored, also increases. This may require the use of additional transport vehicles, which increases the corresponding cost. In case this cost component is a nonlinear function of the deviation, then the model can easily be modified by revising the term ϕ

The other two cost components are related to late arrival and departure of vessels. The terms ϕ

Note that our model contains O(NVBT) binary variables and O(V
                        +
                        BT) constraints. Although it contains a significant number of binary variables, we observe that constraint set (1) exposes a set partitioning structure while constraint set (2) exhibits a set packing structure in the formulation. Furthermore, both constraint sets define specially ordered sets of type 1 (SOS1) whose special structure can be exploited by integer programming solvers for efficient branching (Nemhauser & Wolsey, 1988). Therefore, even though our formulation contains a large number of binary variables, it has a special form that increases the efficiency of the solution procedure. We should emphasize, however, that all these computationally favorable properties of the mathematical model are due to Assumption 8 about the time-invariant crane assignments. Therefore, its relaxation to make the model more realistic with time-variant crane assignments would also destroy the special structure of the formulation.

Recall that although the availability of quay cranes is considered in constraint set (3) in BACAP, it is not determined which particular crane is assigned to which vessel in a given time period, and thus the working periods of the cranes are unknown. Therefore, it would not be surprising that a feasible solution of BACAP yields an infeasible assignment for some or all of the cranes, which necessitates additional crane movements during which the service on some vessels is disrupted. For the clarification of this issue, consider an example with three vessels and 12 quay cranes. Table 3
                         includes the data associated with this small problem. Note that the length of each vessel is five units in terms of the number of berth sections and six cranes have to be assigned to each vessel in each time period. The vessels have different desired berth sections (s

                                    i

                        ). An optimal solution of this BACAP instance is depicted in Fig. 1
                        .

In this figure, the x-axis and y-axis represent, respectively, the time periods and the berth sections. Each vessel is displayed as a rectangle. In particular, Vessel 1 is assigned to berth Section 1 in period 5. Since its processing time is 30 periods and its length is 5 units, it occupies the area designated by V1 in the two-dimensional time-berth section space. Note that each vessel is associated with a unique combination of berth section, time period, and number of cranes (constraint set (1)), and none of the rectangles overlaps with another one (constraint set (2)). Moreover, no more than 12 quay cranes are required in any period (constraint set (3)). In fact, between periods 5 and 19 when vessel 1 is at the berth, six cranes are needed, while 12 cranes are used between periods 20 and 34 since both vessel 1 and vessel 2 are at the berth. From period 35 to period 44, again six cranes are required to serve vessel 2, while 12 cranes have to be in charge between periods 45 and 59 because vessel 2 and vessel 3 are together at the berth. Finally, the service for vessel 3 is performed by six cranes between periods 60 and 94. Although no more than 12 cranes are required in any period, it is not possible to assign the cranes without making a change in the group of cranes that serves each vessel or moving some of the cranes over some others to change their relative order. Both of these operations require setup and hence a delay in the service provided to the vessels. For example, if cranes indexed 1–6 are assigned to vessel 1 and cranes 7–12 are assigned to vessel 2, the first crane group has to be used for vessel 3 as well, but this requires the change of the relative order of cranes 1–6 with respect to cranes 7–12, i.e., the former group must be positioned after the latter group. This implies that a feasible solution to BACAP is not necessarily feasible for BACASP. Note, however, that all feasible solutions of BACASP are feasible for BACAP.

To develop a mathematical programming formulation for BACASP we extend the formulation for BACAP by including the constraint sets (1)–(3) and defining new variables and constraints so that feasible specific crane assignments are obtained for quay cranes, which do not incur setup due to the change in the relative order of cranes. We should remark that if quay cranes i
                        −1 and i
                        +1 are assigned to a vessel in a time period, then quay crane i has to be assigned to the same vessel as well since quay cranes are located along the berth on a single railway. In order to incorporate this requirement, we define a crane group as a set of adjacent quay cranes and let the binary variable

                                    it
                                 
                                 
                                    g
                                 
                              
                           
                         denote whether crane group g assigned to vessel i starts service in time period t. Constraint set (5) relates the X and Y-variables. It ensures that if k quay cranes are assigned to vessel i, it must be served by a crane group g that is formed by ∣C(g)∣=
                        k adjacent cranes, where C(g) is the index set of cranes in group g and ∣·∣ denotes the cardinality of a set. Moreover, G is the total number of crane groups.

Notice that in constraints (5), C(g)’s are pre-determined and hence are parameters of the model. For example, if N
                        =3, the size of possible crane groups can be one, two, or three, and the total number of crane groups G
                        =6. Crane groups of size one, i.e. crane groups consisting of one crane, are C(g
                        =1)={1}, C(g
                        =2)={2}, C(g
                        =3)={3}. Similarly, crane groups of size two are C(g
                        =4)={1,2} and C(g
                        =5))={2,3}. It is important to point out that C(g)={1,3} is not a valid group because cranes 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Finally, there is only one crane group of size three, namely C(g
                        =6)={1,2,3}. It should be emphasized that each crane can be a member of multiple crane groups. However, each crane can operate as a member of at most one group in each time period. The next set of constraints (6) guarantees that this condition holds:

Even though constraints (5) and (6) make sure that each quay crane is assigned to at most one vessel in any time period (Assumption 5), they do not guarantee that quay cranes are assigned to vessels in the correct sequence. In particular, let the quay cranes be indexed in such a way that a crane positioned closer to the beginning of the berth has a lower index. Also, without loss of generality, we can assume that the berth sections are oriented horizontally from left to right. This implies that a crane having a smaller index is located on the left-hand side of another crane with a larger index. Since all cranes perform their duty along a rail at the berth, they cannot pass each other or stated differently their order cannot be changed. The next four constraint sets help to ensure preserving the crane ordering. Here, Z

Constraint set (7) simply states that the positions of the cranes (in terms of berth sections) are respected by the index of the cranes. This means that the position of crane c is always less than or equal to the position of crane c
                        +1 during the planning horizon. Constraint set (8) makes sure that the last crane (crane N) is positioned within the berth. By defining

                         as the index of the crane that is, respectively, the leftmost and rightmost member of crane group g, constraint set (9) guarantees that if crane group g is assigned to vessel i and vessel i berths at section j, then the position of the leftmost member of crane group g is greater than or equal to j. Similarly, constraint set (10) ensures that if crane group g is assigned to vessel i and vessel i berths at section j, then the position of the rightmost member of crane group g is less than or equal to j

We now analyze the set of constraints (1)–(3), (5)–(9) and (10) of BACASP. As a result of this analysis, we are able to show in Propositions 1 and 3 that some constraints of BACASP are in fact implied by the others. We also demonstrate in Proposition 2 that (7)–(10) yield the desired quay crane sequence.

Consider the mathematical model without constraints (6) and assume that a crane is assigned to more than one vessel in a period. This implies that the two vessels are at the berth in the same period. However, as a result of Proposition 2, we know that the index of the rightmost crane assigned to the vessel on the left is strictly smaller than the index of the leftmost crane assigned to the vessel at the right, which is a contradiction.□

                        In order to increase readability we included a compact presentation of the formulation in the appendix. As can be observed, this formulation has O(N

                        VT) variables and O(N

                        2) constraints, which makes our BACASP formulation significantly larger than our BACAP formulation. Hence, it should be expected that only small BACASP instances can be solved exactly using CPLEX 12.2. As will be demonstrated in the computational study, this is indeed the case and although our formulation proposed in this paper for the BACASP problem is relatively more efficient than the other models existing in the literature, it can optimally solve problem instances up to 15 vessels. Using the formulation of BACAP, on the other hand, we can solve instances up to 60 vessels. This fact has motivated us to make use of the formulation for BACAP in solving larger sized BACASP instances to optimality. The next section is the outcome of our efforts towards that goal.

By carefully analyzing the optimal solutions of BACAP and BACASP in small sized instances, we have figured out that an optimal solution of BACASP can be generated from an optimal solution of BACAP provided that the condition given below in Proposition 4 is satisfied. This amounts to first solving BACAP optimally, and then finding an optimal solution of BACASP using a polynomial time algorithm. In case this condition is not satisfied, we devise a cutting plane algorithm in which the added cuts ultimately yield an optimal BACAP solution satisfying it. The mentioned condition, which plays a crucial role in our solution procedure, is based on the notion of complete sequence of vessels (with respect to their occupied berthing positions), which is defined as follows.
                        Definition 1
                        A vessel sequence v
                           1, v
                           2,…, v
                           
                              n
                            in a given feasible solution of BACAP is complete if
                              
                                 i. v
                                    1 is the closest vessel to the beginning of the berth,

ii. v
                                    
                                       n
                                     is the closest vessel to the end of the berth,

iii. v
                                    
                                       i
                                     and v
                                    
                                       i+1 are two consecutive vessels with v
                                    
                                       i
                                     closer to the beginning of the berth,

iv. Two consecutive vessels in this sequence have to be at the berth concurrently during at least one time period.

A complete sequence is said to be proper when the sum of the number of cranes assigned to vessels in this sequence is less than or equal to N. Otherwise, it is called an improper complete sequence. As mentioned before, we assume that a vessel v
                     
                        i
                      is positioned on the left-hand side of another vessel v
                     
                        j
                      if the former is closer to the beginning of the berth. Fig. 2
                      depicts an optimal BACAP solution of an instance with 21 vessels considered later in Section 4.1 (more specifically, it is the instance whose parameter values are provided in Table 5). The number in the parenthesis under the vessel number within each rectangle gives the number of cranes assigned to the vessel. By analyzing Fig. 2, we find that the vessel sequence {V2,V3,V4} is complete. Similarly, the vessel sequence {V14,V13,V16} is also complete. There are many other complete sequences in the BACAP solution shown in this figure. Notice that all of the complete sequences in Fig. 2 are proper because the sum of the number of cranes assigned to the vessels in each sequence is less than or equal to N
                     =12 as defined later in Section 4.1.

                           ) of BACASP can be obtained from it if and only if every complete sequence of vessels extracted from 
                           X
                           ∗ 
                           is proper.
                        

First we show that if an optimal solution (X
                           ∗,
                           Y

                           Z
                           ∗) of BACASP can be obtained from an optimal solution X
                           ∗ of BACAP, then every complete sequence of vessels is proper, i.e., the sum of the number of cranes assigned to vessels in every complete sequence is less than or equal to N. Suppose that the sum of the number of cranes assigned to vessels in a complete sequence of vessels v
                           1, v
                           2,…, v
                           
                              n
                            is larger than N and θ
                           
                              i
                            cranes are assigned to vessel v

                            in the optimal solution of BACAP. Then, the smallest index of the rightmost crane assigned to vessel v
                           1 is θ

To show that if every complete sequence of vessels that can be extracted from an optimal solution X
                           ∗ of BACAP is proper, then an optimal solution of BACASP with decision variables values (X
                           ∗,
                           Y

                           ∗, we make use of a constructive method called Algorithm 1. Note that it is sufficient to show that this algorithm generates a feasible solution (X′,
                           Y′,
                           Z′) for BACASP because such a solution is also optimal since the objective function of BACASP is the same as that of BACAP.

                           . Due to the selection rule v

                            is already in the set

                                       A
                                    
                                 
                              
                            when v
                           
                              j
                            is added to 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       V
                                    
                                    
                                       A
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . Due to the assignment rule, the index of the rightmost crane assigned to vessel v
                           
                              i
                            is less than the index of the leftmost crane assigned to vessel v
                           
                              j
                           . This implies that at the end of Algorithm 1, a particular crane is assigned to at most one vessel in a given time period. Notice that the assignment of cranes to vessels using Algorithm 1 does not make any change in the objective function because the berthing positions and berthing times of the vessels are not modified. Thus the solution given by Algorithm 1 is an optimal solution of BACASP.□

As a result of Proposition 4, it is possible to obtain an optimal solution of BACASP from an optimal solution of BACAP using Algorithm 1 provided that every complete sequence of vessels is proper. From the implementation point of view, determining whether this condition is satisfied or not requires both the generation of all complete sequences and checking their properness.

Let us construct a directed acyclic network in which nodes correspond to vessels. Therefore, we use the terms “node” and “vessel” interchangeably in the remainder of this subsection. Two dummy nodes v
                        0 and v
                        
                           n+1 are also added to the graph. There is an arc from node v
                        0 to any other node v
                        
                           i
                         which corresponds to a vessel with no other vessel on their left-hand side during the time periods it is at the berth. The weight of this arc is the number of cranes assigned to vessel v
                        
                           i
                         in the optimal solution of BACAP. In the network, there is also an arc going from node v
                        
                           i
                         to node v
                        
                           j
                         if v
                        
                           i
                         is on the left-hand side of v
                        
                           j
                         with no vessel in between. The weight of this arc is the number of cranes assigned to v
                        
                           j
                         in the optimal solution of BACAP. Finally, there is an arc from every node, which corresponds to a vessel with no other vessel on its right-hand side during the time periods it is at the berth, to node v
                        
                           n+1, and the weight of this arc is zero. Note that the construction of this network requires that the order of the vessels from left to right at the berth (or from the beginning of the berth to the end) in the optimal solution of BACAP be found in each time period.

It is easy to observe that the nodes on each directed path from node v
                        0 to node v
                        
                           n+1 represents a complete sequence of vessels in this network. Also, each complete sequence corresponds to a path beginning at node v
                        0 and ending at node v
                        
                           n+1 in the network. Furthermore, the length of each such path gives the sum of the number of cranes assigned to vessels in the corresponding complete sequence. As a result, finding the complete sequence with the largest number of cranes amounts to identifying the longest path in this network, which can be used to check the properness condition in Proposition 4. If the length of the longest path, i.e., the total number of cranes in the corresponding complete sequence is less than or equal to N (or equivalently this complete sequence is proper), then the condition given in the proposition is satisfied and it is possible to generate an optimal solution for BACASP. Notice that the length of the longest path in a directed acyclic graph can be found in polynomial time (Ahuja, Magnanti, & Orlin, 1993).

To illustrate the idea explained above, consider again the optimal BACAP solution given in Fig. 2. To find out whether it is possible to generate an optimal solution of BACASP from this optimal solution of BACAP, we construct the directed acyclic graph displayed in Fig. 3
                        . Since the length of the longest path (there exist multiple such paths) in this graph is 12, which is equal to the number of available cranes N, we can apply Algorithm 1 to generate an optimal solution of BACASP as shown in Proposition 4. This solution is illustrated in Fig. 4
                        .

If there is at least one improper complete sequence of vessels in an optimal solution of BACAP, namely a complete sequence where the sum of the number of cranes assigned to vessels is larger than N, then we cannot apply Algorithm 1 to obtain an optimal solution of BACASP. In that case, it is possible to add the cut given in (20) corresponding to an improper complete sequence into the formulation of BACAP, where 
                           
                              IS
                           
                         refers to an improper complete sequence and

                         is the total number of vessels in it. Note that this cut is used to eliminate feasible solutions that involve

The addition of these cuts is repeated until an optimal solution of BACAP does not contain any improper complete sequences. At that instant, Algorithm 1 can be called to generate an optimal solution of BACASP from the existing optimal solution of BACAP. As a result, the cutting plane algorithm outlined below as Algorithm 2 can be used to find an optimal solution of BACASP.

In the following example, we explain the procedure of generating the cuts. The vessel-related parameters of the instance in the example are given in Table 4
                        . As can be seen in this table, two cranes have to be assigned to every vessel, and processing times

                         are 3, 4, and 3, respectively when two cranes are assigned to the vessels. Moreover, the number of available cranes N is equal to four.


                        Fig. 5
                         shows an optimal solution of BACAP before any cuts are generated. It can be seen in this figure that there is an improper complete sequence of three vessels where the sum of the number of assigned cranes is equal to six, which is larger than N. Hence, we add the cut

                        , where another improper complete sequence can be identified. Then we add the second cut

                         with still an improper complete sequence. Here it is worthwhile to note that the cost of having vessel 3 berthed at Section 4, i.e., one unit away from desired berth section s
                        3
                        =3 is equal to ϕ
                        31
                        ×1=1000 units. This cost is larger than the cost which would incur if vessel 3 waits until vessel 2 completes its operations and departs at the end of period 5. In that case vessel 3 would berth at the beginning of period 6, which is two periods later than its arrival time e
                        3
                        =4, resulting in an additional cost of ϕ
                        32
                        ×2=2000 units. The BACAP formulation finally yields an optimal solution without any improper complete sequences after adding the fourth cut

                        . Notice that in this optimal solution vessel 2 is delayed until the departure of vessel 1 with a cost of 2000 units. An alternative optimal solution is that vessel 2 berths at period 4, which is its arrival time e

                        =2 with the same cost of 2000 units. The only difference between this alternative optimal BACASP solution and the one presented in Fig. 9 is that cranes 3 and 4 would be assigned to vessel 2 instead of cranes 1 and 2, and cranes 1 and 2 would be assigned to vessel 3 (after terminating their operation on vessel 1) instead of cranes 3 and 4 in the current optimal solution.

As can be noticed even in this small instance, after adding a cut to eliminate an improper complete sequence from the feasible region, another improper complete sequence of the same vessels with different berthing times and/or berthing positions may appear. In order to simultaneously exclude all feasible solutions with these improper complete sequences, and thus speed up the convergence of the cutting plane algorithm, we modify it in the following way. When an improper complete sequence

                        Solving BACAP with these cuts immediately provides the optimal solution of BACASP given in Fig. 9. Notice that we solve the BACAP formulation twice as opposed to the previous case of adding a single cut where five CPLEX calls are necessary. As a second example, we consider the instance examined before, i.e., the instance with three vessels and 12 quay cranes, whose parameters were given in Table 3. Recall that for this instance an optimal solution of BACASP could not be obtained for the optimal solution of BACAP depicted in Fig. 1. By implementing the cutting plane algorithm with single and multiple cuts, the optimal solution of the BACASP instance can be obtained as shown in Fig. 10
                        . In the single cut strategy, the number of improper complete sequences identified, the number of cuts generated, and the CPU time in seconds are equal to 11,023, 11,023, and 199,166seconds, respectively. In the multiple cut strategy, on the other hand, the corresponding values are 317, 951, and 3946seconds, respectively. This indicates that when multiple cuts are used, the number of improper complete sequences detected, which actually represents the number of 0–1 integer programs solved, is much less than the number of cuts obtained using the single cut strategy. This also explains why much less computation time is spent when multiple cuts are generated. Notice that in the optimal solution presented in Fig. 10, vessel 3 berths at Section 5, that is 11 sections away from its desired berth section s
                        3
                        =16. This is because of the proper alignment constraints of the quay cranes. As an alternative, vessel 3 could wait for vessel 2 to terminate its operations and then berth at its desired berth section. However, doing so would delay its berthing time to period 60 with a 15 periods difference from its arrival time e
                        3
                        =45. The associated cost of berthing 15 periods later than the arrival time amounts to ϕ
                        32
                        ×15=15,000 units that is higher than the cost of berthing 11 berth sections away from the desired one, which is ϕ
                        31
                        ×11=11,000 units. Therefore, vessel 3 is better off if berthed relatively far from its desired berth section as illustrated in Fig. 10.

In this section we perform computational experiments on a set of problem instances using our BACAP and BACASP models. All the experimental study is carried out on a computer with Intel Xeon 3.16gigahertz processor and 130gigabytes of RAM working under Windows 2003 Server operating system.

Our first set of instances consists of seven small and medium instances and they have been derived from the real data used in Zhang et al. (2010) taken from the Tianjin Five Continents International Container Terminal in Tianjin, People’s Republic of China. In this real data set, there are 21 vessels and 12 quay cranes where the 1200 meters long berth is divided into 24 berth sections each of which is 50m and the planning horizon is 200hours. The parameters related to the vessels are given in Tables 5 and 6
                        
                        . Table 5 includes the length of the vessels, the minimum and maximum number of cranes that can be assigned to each vessel, the desired berth section, the arrival time, and the due time of each vessel. Table 6 contains the processing time

                                    i

                         of vessel i when k cranes are assigned to it. They are generated by dividing the total operational time of each vessel, which is expressed as the number of crane-time periods required to discharge and load all the containers of that vessel in Zhang et al. (2010), by the number of cranes that can be assigned and rounding up to the nearest integer. For example, the total operational time of vessel 2 is 96 crane-time periods and 3–6 cranes can be assigned to it; therefore

                        . The cost parameters are also taken from Zhang et al. (2010) as follows: ϕ
                        
                           i1
                        =1000, ϕ
                        
                           i2
                        =1000, and ϕ
                        
                           i3
                        =2000 for all the vessels. We generate seven instances taking that part of the whole data set which includes the first 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 vessels.

First, we solve the BACAP model using commercial solver CPLEX 12.2. Table 7
                         shows the optimal objective values as well as CPU times required for generating the model and solving it. We can observe that all the instances can be solved in less than two minutes. This is a promising result since Zhang et al. (2010) mentions that a commercial integer programming solver can only handle up to three vessels within 1hour.

To investigate the efficiency of the BACASP formulation, we solve the same seven instances using CPLEX 12.2 and report the results in Table 8
                        . As can be seen, we can solve instances up to 15 vessels. This is a significant outcome in terms of the size of the instances since to the best of our knowledge, there are no reported solutions in the literature for berth allocation and quay crane assignment (specific) problem instances of this size.

As we showed in Section 3.1 we can generate an optimal solution of BACASP from an optimal solution of BACAP depicted in Fig. 2 by constructing the directed acyclic graph displayed in Fig. 3. As we noticed in Section 3.1 since the length of the longest path in this graph is 12, which is equal to the number of cranes N, we can apply Algorithm 1 to generate an optimal solution for BACASP as shown in Proposition 4. This solution is illustrated in Fig. 4. As is the case with instance 7, it turns out that an optimal solution of BACAP can be transformed to an optimal solution of BACASP for the other six instances as well. Also we observe that the computation time requirements are much less when compared with those of the BACASP model.

In Table 9
                         we provide the values of different cost components with respect to vessels. They indicate that the penalty due to berthing away from the desired berth section has the largest contribution to the overall objective value, which is followed by the penalty due to berthing later than the arrival time of the vessels.

To examine the performance of the BACAP model for large instances we randomly generate additional test instances by keeping the length B of the berth, the number N of available cranes, and the cost coefficients ϕ
                        
                           i1, ϕ
                        
                           i2, and ϕ
                        
                           i3 at the same value as before. We vary the number of vessels V from 20 to 60 with increments of five. The length ℓ
                           i
                         and the desired berth section s
                        
                           i
                         of each vessel are generated, respectively, from discrete uniform distributions DU[3,8] and DU[1,B
                        −ℓ
                           i
                        
                        +1]. The total operational time of each vessel expressed in terms of crane-time periods, which is then used to obtain the processing time 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    p

                         of vessel i if k cranes are assigned to it, is also taken as a discrete uniform random variable supported in the interval [10,120]. For each problem set with V vessels we generate five instances. The results are provided in Table 10
                         in terms of averages for the optimal objective value and CPU time requirements for generating and solving the model.

As can be observed, even the largest instance with V
                        =60 vessels and T
                        =600hours can be solved in nearly 40 CPU minutes. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that in all of these 45 instances it is possible to generate an optimal solution of BACASP from an optimal solution of BACAP using Algorithm 1 since the condition in Proposition 4 holds. It is also of great importance to be able to solve large instances when this condition does not hold. Since the BACASP model can only be solved for relatively small instances (see Table 8) within a reasonable amount of computation time, the cutting plane algorithm used to generate cuts to be added to BACAP remains as the unique solution method that we propose. In the next subsection, we focus on the efficiency of this method.

First we test the cutting plane algorithm that solves BACASP on small and medium instances by comparing the required CPU time with that of solving the BACASP model with CPLEX 12.2. The results are shown in Table 11
                        . It is interesting to note that for these instances the optimal solutions of BACAP satisfy the condition of Proposition 4, and thus no cutting planes are needed. This implies that an optimal solution of BACASP can be obtained from an optimal solution of BACAP using Algorithm 1. The benefit of our approach is obvious when the CPU times are examined in Table 11.

To examine the efficiency of the cutting plane algorithm in large instances, we generate a new set of test problems for which the optimal solutions of BACAP do not satisfy the condition of Proposition 4. For this purpose, we take the number of vessels the same as before, i.e., V increases from 20 to 60 with increments of 5, while the number of cranes is set to four (N
                        =4). Each vessel requires two cranes (

We would like to emphasize at this point that these instances may not always reflect real-life situations and are generated only to assess the efficiency of our cutting plane algorithm.

Each instance is solved by using the BACAP model and running the cutting plane algorithm first with the single cut and then the multiple cuts. Table 12
                         includes the results. Note that for the instances with V
                        ⩾30, the cutting plane algorithm employed with the single cut does not terminate within 172,800seconds, which is equal to two days. We also observe that for the first two instances that can be solved by single and multiple cuts, the number of the resulting complete sequences is much less when multiple cuts are applied, which explains the smaller CPU time requirements of multiple cuts.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have introduced two new mathematical programming models: a 0–1 integer linear programming model for the berth allocation and quay crane assignment problem (BACAP) and a mixed-integer linear programming model for the berth allocation quay crane assignment and scheduling problem (BACASP). The formulation for the more difficult problem BACASP extends the formulation of BACAP, and can solve problem instances that involve up to 15 vessels. Although this is a significant improvement over the results found in the literature, we can solve to optimality instances of BACASP up to 60 vessels. This becomes possible due to a proposition which states that an optimal solution of BACASP can be generated from an optimal solution of BACAP provided that a condition holds. This necessary and sufficient condition is based on the sum of the number of cranes assigned to vessels in a complete sequence of vessels. If this number is less than or equal to the number of available cranes in every complete sequence, then an optimal solution of BACASP can be obtained from that of BACAP by using a polynomial-time algorithm developed for this purpose. If the condition does not hold, then we devise a cutting plane algorithm which adds cuts to the formulation of BACAP to eliminate those complete sequences in which the number of assigned cranes is larger than the number of available ones. We consider two types of cuts: single and multiple. Experiments performed on randomly generated test instances indicate that the new cutting plane algorithm implemented with multiple cuts can solve to optimality problem instances up to 60 vessels, which is a significant improvement in terms of problem size. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other studies in the literature that can solve instances of comparable size to optimality.

As a possible research direction, we consider extending our models by relaxing Assumption 8 in order to include the flexibility that the number of cranes assigned to a vessel can change during the periods the vessel is at the berth. This extension can also take into account the setup cost occurring as a result of crane movements between two positions at the berth. Our analysis shows that incorporating this possibility of changing the number of cranes assigned to a vessel from period to period brings additional complexity to the BACAP and BACASP formulations as the existing structure of the constraint matrix is lost.
