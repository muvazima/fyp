                  Splines can be constructed by convolving the indicator function of a cell whose shifts tessellate

                     . This paper presents simple, geometric criteria that imply that, for regular shift-invariant tessellations, only a small subset of such spline families yield nested spaces: primarily the well-known tensor-product and box splines. Among the many non-refinable constructions are hex-splines and their generalization to the Voronoi cells of non-Cartesian root lattices.

Univariate uniform B-splines can be defined by repeated convolution, starting with the indicator functions
                        1

                        An indicator function takes on the value one on the interval but is zero otherwise.
                      of the intervals or cells delineated by knots. This construction implies local support and delivers a number of desirable properties (see de Boor, 1978, 1987) that have made B-splines the representation of choice in modeling and analysis. In particular, B-splines are refinable. That is, they can be exactly represented as linear combinations of B-splines with a refined knot sequence. Refinability is a key ingredient of multi-resolution and adaptive and sparse representation of data. Refinability also guarantees monotone decay of error when shrinking the intervals.

By tensoring univariate B-splines, we can obtain splines on Cartesian grids in any dimension. Box-splines de Boor et al. (1993) generalize tensoring by allowing convolution in directions other than orthogonal ones. As a prominent example in two variables, the linear 3-direction box-spline consists of linear pieces over each of six equilateral triangles surrounding one vertex (Frederickson, 1971). Shifts of this ‘hat function’ on an equilateral triangulation sum to one. Convolution of the hat function with itself results in a twice continuously differentiable function of degree 4; and m-fold convolution yields a function of degree

                     . Since this progression skips odd orders of smoothness, van de Ville et al. (2004) proposed to directly convolve the indicator function of the hexagon and build splines customized to the hexagonal tessellation of the plane (cf. Fig. 1
                     a). They went on to show that the resulting hex-splines share a number of desirable properties familiar from box-splines. But the authors did not settle whether the splines were refinable (van de Ville and Unser, 2010), i.e. whether hex-splines of the given hexagonal tessellation T can be represented as linear combinations of hex-splines based on a scaled-down hexagonal tessellation, say

                           this paper presents simple geometric criteria necessary for regular shift-invariant tessellations to admit refinable indicator functions.

In contrast to tensor-product and box splines, we show that hex-splines and similar multi-variate lattice-based constructions can only be scaled, but not refined since scaled spaces are not nested.

Section 2 reviews tessellations induced by lattices, hex-splines and their generalizations. Section 3 exhibits two non-algebraic, non-harmonic criteria – chosen for their simplicity – for testing whether a tessellation can support a refinable space of splines that are constructed by convolution of indicator functions of its cells.

An n-dimensional lattice is a discrete subgroup of full rank in an n-dimensional Euclidean vector space. Alternatively, such a lattice may be viewed as inducing a tessellation of space into identical cells without n-dimensional overlap.
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        A common convention is to define the cells to be half-open sets so that they do not overlap on facets, but nevertheless cover.
                      The tessellation is then generated by the translational shifts of one cell. In particular, lattice points can serve as sites of Voronoi cells (nearest-neighbor regions). The Euclidean, 
                        n
                        =
                        2
                      plane admits three highly symmetric tessellations. The regular tessellation into squares can be associated with uniform tensor-product B-splines (de Boor, 1978), the hexagonal partition with the bivariate hat function of the Introduction and, if we allow for two types of regular triangles, say ‘up’ △ and ‘down’ ▽, the regular triangulation can be associated with half-box splines (Prautzsch and Boehm, 2002).

An interesting additional type of spline arises from convolving the indicator function H of the hexagon with itself. Such hex-splines, a family of

That paper compares hex-splines to tensor-product splines and uses the Fourier transform of hex-splines to derive, for low frequencies, the

                      approximation order, as a combination of the projection into the hex-spline space and a quasi-interpolation error. Condat et al. (2005) derived quasi-interpolation formulas and showed promising results when applying hex-splines to the reconstruction of images (see also Condat et al., 2006; Condat and van de Ville, 2007, 2008). van de Ville et al. (2004) also observed that hexagons are Voronoi cells of a lattice and that the cell can be split into three quadrilaterals, using one of two choices of the central split. Thus H can be split into three constant box splines whose mixed convolution yields higher-order splines. This approach has been generalized to Voronoi cells of the face-centered cubic (FCC, see Fig. 2

Translation-invariant or shift-invariant tessellations are a special case of transitive tilings where every cell can be mapped to every other cell by translation, without rotation.


                     
                        Proposition 2
                        
                           If T is a shift-invariant tessellation, 
                           
                              χ
                              (
                              T
                              )
                            
                           is refinable only if T contains, for each facet f, the hyperplane through f as a union of its facets.
                        

The coarser-scaled copies of T contain enlarged copies of every facet in T. By Proposition 1 these copies must be a union of facets of T. Therefore a shifted copy of every facet is strictly contained in the interior of and so extended by some coarser facet. Shift-invariance then implies that every facet f lies strictly inside such an extension. Ever coarser tessellations provide a sequence of extensions of f in any direction by any amount.  □

Of the three regular tessellations of the plane, only the Cartesian grid satisfies the assumptions of Proposition 2. The regular triangulation satisfies the hyperplane constraint, but requires reflection to map △ into ▽, i.e. is not a shift-invariant tessellation of one type of triangle. The partition into hexagons is shift-invariant, but does not contain the required hyperplanes. We conclude that 
                        Corollary 1
                        
                           Hex splines are not refinable.
                        

We can generalize this observation by simplifying the inspection criterion.

                      (Conway and Sloane, 1998) are suitable for building refinable splines by convolution of their Voronoi cells. Conway and Stoane (1998, 21, 3) characterize the Voronoi cells of crystallographic root lattices in terms of fundamental cones, the fundamental simplex, extended Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams and Wythoff's construction. However, the following proof is based on more elementary notions. 
                        Corollary 2
                        Root lattices


                        
                           Splines obtained by convolving the Voronoi cell of a non-Cartesian crystallographic root lattice are not refinable.
                        

By definition, crystallographic lattices satisfy the reflection assumption of Proposition 3. We need only determine whether the Voronoi cells of the root lattices contain a pair of facets that meet with an obtuse angle, the obtuse-angle assumption of Proposition 3. Choosing one Voronoi site (cell center) as the origin, we will exhibit, for each lattice, two lattice points,

The technical report of Peters (2012, Section 4) explores whether a superposition of several families of hex-splines is refinable. Specifically, if 
                        
                           
                              {

                              }

                      is a family of distinct shift-invariant tessellations obtained by shifts of some

                     , the technical report investigates whether each member of the family can be expressed as a linear combination of the scaled-down copies of splines of the family. Since the outcome for families on non-Cartesian root lattices is also negative, and since the proofs are technical and intricate, this material is not included here.


                     Proposition 2 fails for transitive tilings that allow for rotation. For example, let T be the L-triomino tiling. Since four L-triominos pack into one double-sized L-triomino, 
                        χ
                        (
                        T
                        )
                      is refinable. However, the full hyperplanes through the facets 
                        
                           
                              f
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              f
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      forming the reentrant angle of the L-triomino are not contained in T since 
                        
                           
                              f
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              f
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      are never strictly contained in a coarse L-triomino: they always include the end-point of any coarser facet edge. Similarly, trapezoid tessellations show that Proposition 2 fails for transitive tilings that allow for reflection. A good question is whether a proposition similar to Proposition 2 can be formulated to address refinement of more general transitive tilings.

The paper identified several necessary criteria for tessellations to admit a refinable space of (convolutions of) indicator functions. The criteria were chosen for their simplicity. For example, we showed that admissible shift-invariant tessellations must contain, for every facet, the whole plane of which the facet is a piece of the same dimension. Already for hex-splines an alternative algebraic proof of non-refinability is considerably more complicated.

Other than their innate beauty, increased isotropy of their Voronoi cells is a major reason for considering non-Cartesian root lattices: these lattices have high packing densities that can improve sampling efficiency (Petersen and Middleton, 1962). Unfortunately, Corollary 2 shows that exactly this increased isotropy prevents refinability of splines via cell convolution.

In conclusion, if we seek shift-invariant refinable classes of splines from convolving indicator functions of polyhedral cells, remarkably few options exist apart from tensor-product B-splines and box-splines. In particular, the approach of convolving non-Cartesian lattice Voronoi cells fails to provide the important spline property of refinability. This does not imply that more general lattices fail to have associated refinable splines representing their symmetry and translational structure. In the bivariate setting, odd orders of continuity on the hexagonal dual of the regular triangulation can be filled in by half-box splines (Prautzsch and Boehm, 2002). Moreover, if fractal support is acceptable, Oswald and Schröder (2003), Han and Riemenschneider (2002) provide refinable functions with approximately hexagonal footprint. Combining families of symmetric box-splines, such as Kim and Peters (2011), yields refinable splines for any level of smoothness and crystallographic structure.
