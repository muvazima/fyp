                  Introduction
                  Understanding the basic concepts of physiology and biophysics of cardiac cells can be improved by virtual experiments that illustrate the complex excitation–contraction coupling process in cardiac cells. The aim of this study is to propose a rat cardiac myocyte simulator, with which calcium dynamics in excitation–contraction coupling of an isolated cell can be observed. This model has been used in the course “Mathematical Modeling and Simulation of Biological Systems”. In this paper we present the didactic utility of the simulator MioLab®.
               
               
                  Methods
                  The simulator enables virtual experiments that can help studying inhibitors and activators in the sarcoplasmic reticulum sodium–calcium exchanger, thus corroborating a better understanding of the effects of medications, which are used to treat arrhythmias, on these compartments. The graphical interfaces were developed not only to facilitate the use of the simulator, but also to promote a constructive learning on the subject, since there are animations and videos for each stage of the simulation. The effectiveness of the simulator was tested by a group of graduate students.
               
               
                  Results
                  Some examples of simulations were presented in order to describe the overall structure of the simulator. Part of these virtual experiments became an activity for Biomedical Engineering graduate students, who evaluated the simulator based on its didactic quality. As a result, students answered a questionnaire on the usability and functionality of the simulator as a teaching tool. All students performed the proposed activities and classified the simulator as an optimal or good learning tool. In their written questions, students indicated as negative characteristics some problems with visualizing graphs; as positive characteristics, they indicated the simulator's didactic function, especially tutorials and videos on the topic of this study.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The results show that the simulator complements the study of the physiology and biophysics of the cardiac cell.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

With major technological advancements, many computational tools have been used to develop mathematical models related to biological systems [1]. As a result, these models, which were intended in the past only to research, are now being incorporated to education in the teaching–learning process of basic concepts of sciences in general, particularly biology. This is applied to studies in neuroscience and motor control, where a practical approach using laboratory experiments and computer simulations can complement theoretical classes [2]. This also occurs in cardiac cell physiology and biophysics, where the development of computational models for cardiac myocytes began as an extension to the Hodgkin–Huxley model [3], i.e., equations for giant squid axon, and originated a wide variety of models for cardiac cells [13].

General purpose simulators were developed focusing on cardiac cell physiology and biophysics such as the LabHEART® simulator [4], which describes the properties of ionic currents and contractile forces for rabbit ventricular myocytes, and can also be used for educational purposes. However, even with implemented tutorials, the user must be an expert in the area under study, since the didactic part of the simulator is not its primary focus.

Another option for a software that can be used for cardiovascular system teaching is CircAdapt – Advanced Cardiovascular Modeling and Simulation. This simulator is developed from a mathematical model that describes the overall circulation of the human heart. This cardiovascular system is modeled with a concatenation of modules that represent heart chambers, valves and blood. Currently, it is used for teaching and in fundamental research in cardiovascular pathophysiology [5]. It is possible to simulate pathologies such as stenosis of aortic and tricuspid valves. The software is open and can be downloaded for free at www.circadapt.org.

Many cardiac myocyte models are available using the CellML platform, a standard language for describing cellular models based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML), in order to share and reuse the components of a given model [6]. The CellML platform has a repository of models that allows reuse by research groups. To edit, simulate and analyze the models available in this platform, two software are included: OpenCor and OpenCell (www.cellml.org). Both of them function in an open-code multi-platform modeling environment and can be executed in Windows, Linux or OS X, allowing a great advance in divulgation and reutilization of biological models by researchers. Nevertheless, its main goal is not to teach cardiac physiology. There is therefore no teaching approach in these simulators, since there are no tools related to the understanding of cardiac cell dynamics in its whole, e.g., the complex process of excitation–contraction coupling (ECC). Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to present and highlight the didactic characteristics (exercises, videos and animations) of rats’ cardiac myocytes simulator, as well as to report its advantages as useful tools for teaching physiology and biophysics of cardiac cells. MioLab® offers, as a distinction if compared with other simulators, tutorials, videos and animations that can be useful for teaching cardiac myocytes’ physiological and biophysical processes. The first version of the MioLab® simulator was developed for research on bioengineering [7]. In that article, the authors describe in detail the mathematical model on which the design of the MioLab® simulator was based, as well as the validation of the simulator using experimental data. The architecture of the model and its graphical interface and validation paved the way for its implementation for educational purposes.

After the description of the main components of the simulator, also aiming to highlight the importance of virtual experiments (in silico) in computational modeling [8], this paper presents activities proposing experiments in silico, which allow using the simulator as a tool that complements the study in physiology and biophysics of cardiac cells. Finally, the results of a survey conducted with Mathematical Modeling and Simulation of Biological Systems graduate students from Masters and PhD Program in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Mogi das Cruzes will also be mentioned regarding the usability and functionality of the simulator.

Results show that the simulator can be used in the classroom as a tool that complements the teaching of basic principles of physiology and biophysics of cardiac cells.

@&#METHODS@&#

Below is a brief description of the model structure used for the development of the MioLab® simulator. The model includes pulse of calcium (Ca2+) through L-type channels, Ca2+ release induced by Ca2+, sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump and sarcoplasmic reticulum, sarcolemmal sodium–calcium exchanger, and Ca2+ leak from the sarcolemma, myofilaments of Ca2+ kinetics and cross bridges dynamics to determine force of contraction. Besides allowing the calculation of contractile forces in rat cardiac myocytes based solely on Ca2+ dynamics, the model also enables simulations involving the study of some drugs that affects the NCX exchanger, SERCa2+ pump and in the Ca2+ L-type channel. The following is a brief description of the implemented dynamic modeling:

The whole model has 9 coupled differential equations, 15 auxiliary equations and 47 biophysical parameters. A full description of the mathematical model used for the development of the MioLab® simulator and its validation can be found in Silva et al. [7]. The activity diagram describing the sequence of steps to perform a simulation is shown in Fig. 1
                           .

The source code for the simulator and information for installation on a personal computer can be found at www.robson.mat.br/miolab.html, with Portuguese and English versions.

The main screen of the simulator (Fig. 2A) has interactive menus for which part of the cell changes in the components’ biophysical parameters are possible to be made. Each menu leads to a secondary screen. For example, the screen of the Ca2+ influx via L-type channels and leak channels (Fig. 2B). On this screen, it is possible to change the parameters for the Ca2+ input in the cell (Ca2+ pulse), and also run a simulation, visualize data, compare two simulations (study and control group) and watch a video on the functioning of the heart.

By clicking on the “ATP” menu located on the main screen, below the SR Ca2+, it is possible to access the screen where parameters for this organelle can be changed and videos on the functioning SR's Ca2+-ATPase (Fig. 3
                           ) can be watched. Also on the main screen, it is possible to access explanatory animations such as the origin of the cell (Fig. 3B), NCX “exchanger” operation scheme (Fig. 3C), among others.

It is important to mention that the simulator has a “HELP” menu on each interface, opening a PDF file with an overview of physiology and a brief description of the mathematical modeling being used.

On each screen of the simulator, a “Data Visualization” menu is available. It allows visualizing output data directly from the simulation environment through interactive charts, including zoom and drag functions (Fig. 4
                           ).

All graphics are generated using Matlab® scripts, but the user is not required to have prior knowledge of programming using Matlab®. The user only interacts with the user-friendly interface (developed with Object Pascal), which is responsible for running a code written in C++ and Matlab®.

The MioLab® simulator also allows exporting output data to a text file (*.txt). It can be read by most mathematics software such as Matlab® or Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets. To present the connection among the components used, the architecture of the simulator generated in UML (Unified Modeling Language) is shown in Fig. 5
                           .

In order to present the main software features from the user's point of view and thus a better understanding of the MioLab® simulator, Fig. 6
                            shows the diagram of use cases. In this diagram, it is possible to see the interfaces that the user can access to change parameters, run the simulation and view graphs and explanatory videos.

The Mathematical Modeling and Simulation of Biological Systems discipline is offered at the Masters and PhD Program in Biomedical Engineering to students from various fields: engineers, mathematicians, physiotherapists, biologists and others. The course is offered at the University of Mogi das Cruzes (UMC, Mogi das Cruzes, SP, Brazil) and is part of the Graduate Program curriculum of Biomedical Engineering. The topics covered in the course include introduction to mathematical modeling, history of evolution of biological system models and mathematical models for cardiac myocyte. The last topic is part of the study on cardiac cell physiology and biophysics basic concepts, where LabHeart® 
                        [4] and MioLab® 
                        [7] simulators are presented.

Classes are based on an active interaction between the supervisor (Professor Robson Rodrigues da Silva) and students. The first part of the course introduces the basic concepts of the subject under study. In the second part, students present predetermined topics, extending the activity to the practical part of the lesson. At the end of the Mathematical Modeling and Simulation of Biological Systems course and after the activities described in the next section, a survey was conducted with students to review the MioLab® simulator. A group of nine graduate students was invited to participate in this survey as collaborators. The questionnaire consists of eight objective questions and two essays, considering that, in the first four objective questions (Block A), the student could choose from the following alternatives: (a) Excellent, (b) Good, (c) Poor, and (d) Irrelevant. As for Block B, the student had only the option to answer, i.e., yes or no. Table 1
                         presents the questionnaire.

The main objective of this evaluation is to obtain feedback from students who used the simulator concerning its strengths or weaknesses, so that the simulator can be updated, further developed and newly applied.

Below are some activities implemented during the course. The proposed activities describe virtual experiments (in silico), which were performed using the MioLab® simulator. Observing the charts generated, each student was asked to interpret the results and fill a table with the respective values of output variables. The graphics and results generated in simulations 1 and 3 will be presented in Section 3. It is noteworthy that the texts from the following activities are quoted exactly as described in the material provided to students, given to them just after the presentation and explanation of the main equations used in modeling (Eqs. (1) and (2)), as well as the general functioning of the simulator.

In diastole, the free calcium internal concentration ([Ca2+]
                              i
                           ) in cardiac myocyte is about 1000 to 10,000 times smaller than in extracellular medium. However, the depolarization of the sarcolemma during the cardiac action potential results in the opening of “Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channel” (VDCC), especially L-type channels. When activated, these channels allow the entry of Ca2+ depolarizing ions [9]. In the proposed model, the Ca2+ influx via L-type channels

Although simplistic in a mathematical point of view, it is justified for allowing the simulation of Ca2+ entry into the cytoplasm via L-type channels. It also enables changes in the parameters that represent the “A
                           0” pulse amplitude (in μM/s), the time of Ca2+ peak occurrence, t
                           1, in seconds, and the exponential adjustment parameter that can be related to channel's opening and closing time, which produces an increase or a decrease in the flow of Ca2+:
                              
                                 (a)
                                 Simulating the Ca2+ influx through L-type channels during the interval of 5s and using the View Data button, fill in one table the following output variables: maximum concentration of free Ca2+ (Max[Ca2+]
                                       i
                                    ) in the cytoplasm, maximum peak of contraction force (F
                                    max) and its time of occurrence (t
                                    p); and time required for the contraction force to be reduced to half its peak value (t
                                    1/2).

Simulate the Ca2+ influx via L-type channels to an A
                                    0
                                    =100μM/s amplitude at a frequency of 2Hz, simulating time and the pulse application of 5s to n
                                    =2 and n
                                    =4. Visualize both pulse types in the Control×Chronic mode, fill in table with the opening time (t) of these channels.

The entry of Ca2+ via L-type channels induces the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which is a reservoir of that ion within cells [9]. This biophysical process is called Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release and it was proposed by Fabiato [10]. Changes in the parameters of Ca2+ release from the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum directly influence the concentration of Ca2+ in the cell and, therefore, the contractile force. Running the simulations described below and visualizing them in Control×Chronic button, verify what happened to the maximum concentration of free Ca2+ (Max[Ca2+]
                              i
                           ) in the cytoplasm to the peak contraction force (F
                           max) and to the fraction of receptors in the open state (x
                           2).

To simulate the control group, use the default parameters (parameters used for model validation and already inserted in simulator's screens) and 5s of simulation time. To simulate the chronic group, use the default parameters with a 5-s simulation time, and then duplicate the constant of Ca2+ association to ryanodine receivers (L1) in the CICR screen.

The reduction of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]
                              i
                           ) concentration to basal levels is a key event to end the contraction and, in order to relax the cardiac cell, several Ca2+ carriers compete for the removal of cytosolic Ca2+ to the interior of organelles or to the extracellular environment [9]. The following carriers are included in this model: sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (SERCa2+ pump-ATPase), the sodium–calcium (NCX) exchanger and the sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump (SL Ca2+-ATPase). Certain drugs act in these organelles changing the concentration of free calcium in the cytoplasm. Suppose a X drug acting on the SERCa2+ pump-ATPase, e.g., the drug 2,5-di (tert-butyl) 1,4-hydroquinone (tBQ), reducing the maximum speed of Ca2+ uptake. Using the simulation with the default parameters and simulation time of 5s as a control group, verify what happens with the concentration of free Ca2+ and the contraction force after the application of a drug responsible for a 50% inhibition of SERCA.

@&#RESULTS@&#

We present below the results of the activities proposed in the previous section, giving examples of how to use the simulator as a useful tool to study and understand the complex process of excitation–contraction–relaxation of cardiac cells. Virtual experiments allow a detailed study of the mechanisms concerning Ca2+ kinetics in myofilaments and cross-bridges dynamics, generating the contraction force [9]. Thus, it is possible to analyze factors that may lead to arrhythmias and study the partial effects of drugs that are used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases [7] and act on specific components of cardiac cells. The simulations presented here are related to answers of the activities 1 and 3 proposed in Section 2.

To simulate the Ca2+ influx via L-type channels, frequencies of 1Hz and 2Hz were applied with amplitude (flow) of 100μM/s and 5s duration. The concentration of Ca2+ at rest ([Ca2+]
                           r
                        ) is given by 0.10μM. The parameters used in this simulation were adjusted in order to obtain a simulation of the transient Ca2+ similar to experimental results reported in Silva et al. [7]. Using the “View Data” menu, it is possible to verify what the influence of the Ca2+ influx was in other output variables such as transitory Ca2+ and contractile force (Fig. 7
                        ).

By analyzing the graphs above and using various features of the simulator, for instance, the application of “zoom” and a tool to find points on the graph, it is possible to fill Table 2
                         with the peak of maximal contraction force (F
                        max) and free Ca2+ concentration, as well as the time of peak contraction force (t
                        p) and the time needed for the force to be reduced to half from its peak value (t
                        1/2).

The following example is the simulation described in Activity 3. To simulate the inhibition of SR Ca2+-ATPase, the maximum Ca2+ uptake speed was reduced by 50% over the default value. This reduction can be performed at the simulator “inhibition” screen (Fig. 8A). After running the simulation, using the “control×chronic” menu, it is possible to view (Fig. 8B) the differences between the control (no drug that produces SR inhibition) and chronic (presence of the drug) groups.

All students performing the proposed activities rated the MioLab® simulator as an excellent or good learning tool. In the open-ended questions, among the weaknesses, there is a problem with the black background of the window where simulation results are plotted. Students also observed the lack of instruction buttons, graph noise, color scheme, the need to use scroll bars and difficulties in the application install. As to strong points, the educational part of the simulator is highlighted, especially tutorials and videos on the topic in question. The full results of the above evaluation are presented in Fig. 9
                        .

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this paper, a rats’ cardiac myocytes simulator (MioLab®) is presented. With this simulator, it is possible to reproduce Ca2+ dynamics and contractile forces in rats’ cardiac myocytes and execute virtual experiments on application of drugs in a cardiac cell organelle. The model validation can be found in Silva et al. [7].

The simulator availability for installation on a personal computer (offline use), the graphic interface update, the improvement of tutorials and the insertion of explanatory videos on cardiac physiology enabled a use not only to research purposes but also as a learning tool. These characteristics differentiate this simulator from other existing software. This can be mainly observed when the educational part of the MioLab® simulator is considered, mainly its videos and website links.

As an initial proposal and in order to verify its effectiveness, the simulator has been used in Mathematical Modeling and Simulation of Biological Systems lessons for Graduate students. The satisfactory result of the simulator as a learning tool (Table 1 and Fig. 9) corroborates its future use in undergraduate courses in Cardiac Physiology, thus reaching a greater number of students for its evaluation. In this case, the suggestion is to first use the software in the classroom by the teacher, following the exposure of a topic, such as calcium in the dynamics of contraction and relaxation of cardiac myocytes. Thus, after a brief presentation on the theme and the presentation of other software used in this study, in a later class, computer lab or with their notebooks, students would be asked to do some activities using as the basis for their answers the knowledge acquired in class and their analysis of the results of each simulation. However, the importance of this prior assessment conducted by graduate students must be highlighted, since the few criticisms received will lead to a new update of the simulator. For instance, the indication about the lack of instruction buttons is due to the fact that probably these pupils did not activate the “help” button, which is available in all the screens of the simulator or they found difficulties to interpret the available texts. This fact enable us to reflect about an actualization of this information. Regarding the item reporting discomfort with scrollbars, the problem appears when the simulator is installed in computers with screen resolution different from the original format, altering the screen size and inserting automatically the scrollbars. In other words, it was not possible to visualize some simulator screens completely. That problem was solved by using an specific command of Delphi (software used to elaborate the screens). This update of the simulator, also occurs with its mathematical modeling, in which the insertion of “Ca2+ buffer” [11], mitochondrial exchangers [12] and sodium and potassium channels are being implemented.

Simulations presented in the previous section are just some of the virtual experiments that can be performed with the simulator. By changing only a few parameters, it is possible to simulate the inhibition or stimulation of Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcolemma or sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), inhibition or stimulation of sarcolemmal NCX exchanger, Ca2+ release from the SR, among others.

These virtual experiments allow students to discover the best way to interpret the results and confront their conclusions with the theory presented in the literature. It is important to mention that all simulations can be performed by students with no prior knowledge of programming languages. But the whole simulator potential will be better used if students have some prior knowledge on physiology and biophysics of cardiac cells.

The results show that the MioLab® simulator, which describes the dynamics of Ca2+ and contractile forces during the process of contraction and relaxation of cardiac cells, can be used in the classroom as a tool that complements the study in physiology and biophysics of cardiac cells, especially when used in conjunction with other existing software, such as LabHeart®, depicting the electrical part of cardiac cells, and CircAdapt®, which enables macroscopic-level simulations, namely a general view of the heart's circulatory system. Finally, we remark that the availability of the model for platform CellML is part of the project we are developing (Grant #2013/20220-5, São Paulo Research Foundation – FAPESP). Thus, we intend to make possible the reutilization of the model using software OpenCor and OpenCell.
