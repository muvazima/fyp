                  Verification of the quantities of interest computed with the finite element method (FEM) requires an upper bound on the strain energy, which is half of the energy norm of displacement solutions. Recently, a modified finite element method with strain smoothing, the node-based smoothed finite element method (NS-FEM), has been proposed to solve solid mechanics problems. It has been found in some cases that the energy norm formed by the smoothed strain of NS-FEM solutions bounds the energy norm of exact displacements from above. We analyze the bounding property of this method, give three kind of energy norms of solutions computed by FEM and NS-FEM, and extend them to the computation of an upper bound and a lower bound on the linear functional of displacements. By examining the bounding property of NS-FEM with different energy norms using some linear elastic problems, the advantages of NS-FEM over the traditional error estimate based methods is observed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One problem with the FEM is the verification of the finite element solutions; this leads to the development of error bound methods for providing the evaluations of the global quality of finite element analyses [1–6]. In engineering design, verification of the computation of the quantities of interest plays an important role in improving the structural design for safety, such as the displacements at a point, the stresses in a local area and the stress intensity factors at crack tips. Some verification methods have been proposed for computing upper and lower bounds on quantities of interest that are the functions of displacements [7–10], and a key ingredient of these methods is the computation of global upper and lower bounds on the total strain energy.

It is known that finite element approximations based on the potential energy principle and the complementary energy principle produce a lower bound and an upper bound on the total strain energy, respectively [11]. The former is referred to as the displacement method, the latter the equilibrium method, which is not commonly used in the commercial softwares for the difficulties arising in handling the boundary conditions [11–14]. In recent years, the methods for the computation of guaranteed upper bound on the energy norm of the exact error in the finite element solutions have been developed [15–20], which provided an alternative approach for finding an upper bound on the strain energy by solving independent subproblems based on elements or patches. In these methods, boundary loads on element edges are needed to construct elemental independent subproblems for solving the equilibrium stresses, or the boundary loads on element edges are waived in constructing the patch based independent subproblems to solve the equilibrium stresses, that is the so called flux-free methods.

Recently, a modified finite element method with strain smoothing, the node-based smoothed finite element method (NS-FEM), has been proposed to solve solid mechanics problems. It has been found that the strain energy computed by NS-FEM bounds the exact strain energy from above in the computational experiments [21–26]. This method was first proposed to develop a stabilized nodal integration scheme for the Galerkin mesh-free method by introducing a strain smoothing stabilization to compute nodal strains by a divergence counterpart of a strain spatial averaging [27].

In this study we analyze the bounding properties of the NS-FEM, and give some inequalities for comparing different energy norms of displacements computed by the FEM and the NS-FEM. We also extend this method to compute the upper and lower bounds on the functions of displacements, and all of the examples are specifically chosen, such as tension, bending problems with different boundary conditions, and the problem with stress concentration, to show the performance of the method.

This paper is organized as follows, in Section 2 the problem statement and definitions are introduced. In Section 3 the NS-FEM and some properties are briefly described thereof. In Section 4 the upper and lower bounds on the linear functionals of solutions are derived, and some lemmas and remarks to these bounds are given. In Section 5 some numerical experiments are reported and commented on. Finally some conclusions are drawn in the last section.

For simplifying the expression of the method in this paper, we only consider the equations of two dimensional linear elasticity. Let us consider a bounded elastic body

We can see these expressions of upper and lower bounds are non-computable, since they depend on the exact solutions of both primal and dual problems. We can use finite elements (displacement method) to compute a lower bound on

The two inequalities in the lemmas give the comparison of different kinds of energy norms obtained by FEM and NS-FEM, the energy norm by the compatible strain of FEM solutions is the smallest, while the energy norm by the compatible strain of NS-FEM solutions is the largest. Now we define another form of energy norm associated with the bilinear form

We illustrate the method with some examples of linear elasticity, and linear triangle finite elements approximations are used for both primal and dual problems. Uniform mesh refinement is used in all examples to illustrate the bounding property with respect to the mesh size.

The first example is a rectangle elastic body assumed in a plane stress state, its geometrical and material data are plotted in Fig. 2
                        , a uniform load

                         is acted on the right end of the body. Different meshes are used to compute the bounding results, the coarsest mesh with mesh size H is plotted in Fig. 3

Different displacement constraints cases and loading cases with uniform loads as shown in Fig. 2 are considered, including both bending and pure tension modes.

                         to test the method. With this coarsest mesh with eight elements, the energy norm of solutions computed with the NS-FEM is 49.60 that is not an upper bound on the reference value that is 49.69. But when the mesh size is smaller, the results computed with the NS-FEM is really an upper bound on the exact energy norm of solutions. The finest mesh consists of 8192 elements, and on which the gap between the two bounds is 0.0104, quit small as compared with the reference value 49.69. In Fig. 5

                         is zero. Fig. 6
                         gives the results of energy norm of solutions of the primal problem computed with the FEM and the NS-FEM. The energy norm of solutions computed with the NS-FEM is an upper bound on the exact value even for the coarsest eight elements mesh. This means that the upper bound property of the NS-FEM may not only depend on the mesh size. With the bounds formulations in (17), we calculate the lower and upper bounds of the exact output as shown in Fig. 7
                        , and the average of the bounds is exactly the output.

For problem (c) in Fig. 2, the output is with the same form as the one in the example of problem (a), and they are approximately equal. It is a pure tension problem, in such a case the FEM can always give the exact energy norm of displacement, and the corresponding output is 50, which is not related to the mesh sizes. The NS-FEM behaves the same as the FEM, it always gives the exact energy norm of solutions not depending on the mesh size. We do not plot the energy norm of solutions and the output as all of them are constant.

For problem (d) in Fig. 2, the output is zero as the result of problem (b). We do not compute the results using the coarsest eight elements mesh, because there is only one element on the left end of the plate, it means that there is no node in the middle of the edge, which could be fully fixed. Since problem (c) is the dual problem for problem (d), from the results of problem (c) we know that all of the output results calculated on different meshes are constant, which are independent of the mesh size. With the bounds Eq. (19), we find the terms with square root are zero, and the other terms, the outputs, are also zero. Therefore the upper and lower bounds are all zero, which are the same as the exact solutions. We do not plot the bound on the output as it is a constant, but we plot the energy norm of solutions in Fig. (8)
                        . We found that for this problem, the energy norm of solutions by the NS-FEM is not convergent, although they provide an upper bound on the exact solution. The difference between problem (b) and problem (d) is only the Dirichlet boundary conditions, i.e., the displacement constraints.

The second example is an elastic plane stress problem with a crack of opening mode [28], see Fig. 9
                        , which involves an elastic plate under tension with a crack of length 8 perpendicular to the direction of loading. Since the symmetry of geometry and loading, we need only to solve the open mode stress intensity factor

                         is very small, thus we can set 395.41 to be the reference stress intensity factor. The results of stress intensity factor and its upper and lower bounds obtained on different meshes are plotted in Fig. 11
                        . For clearly showing the output results, the outputs by the FEM and the NS-FEM are also plotted in Fig. 12
                        , which shows that the outputs are also an upper and a lower bounds on the reference stress intensity factor.

                         below is 0.7, the accuracy is better than the one above, which is corresponding to the bounds shown in Fig. 11, the convergence rate is 0.5. This Figure shows all gaps for outputs or bounds can converge, but the convergence rates are different, the lowest rate is due to the divergence of NS-FEM in the example.

We examine the NS-FEM with linear triangle elements and extend it to compute the upper and lower bounds on outputs in elasticity using three energy norms of displacements, the first one is the energy norm of finite element solutions, and the second one is the energy norm formed by the smoothed strain of NS-FEM, the third is the energy norm of NS-FEM solutions. With the values of three energy norms in ascending order, we construct two intervals, and in our computational experiments, the exact energy norm of solutions is always in the two intervals, even sometime it violates the first interval, but is in the second interval. Another feature of the bounding procedure is that they are very easy to implement, as this simply requires a modification of a few lines of our underlying finite element code. This is an advantage over the equilibrium method to obtain upper bounds, and it can be used as an alternative heuristic approach, for example the relaxation method that relaxes the stiffness matrix with some smaller part of the local stiffness, for the verification of outputs.

There are still some problems to be solved for this method. The first one is that sometimes it does not provide an upper bound with a coarse mesh, e.g. the mesh with eight elements in the subproblem (a) of the first example. Therefore, in the practical applications, we should always use the second interval as the second line of defense for verifying the outputs. The second one is that the energy norm formed by the smoothed strain of NS-FEM occasionally does not asymptotically converge to the exact solution, as shown in Fig. 8. The NS-FEM generally provides a bound from above by relaxing the stiffness, but there is a lack of conditions for guaranteeing the asymptotic convergence.
