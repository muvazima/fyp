                  This paper proposes a new global optimization metaheuristic called Galactic Swarm Optimization (GSO) inspired by the motion of stars, galaxies and superclusters of galaxies under the influence of gravity. GSO employs multiple cycles of exploration and exploitation phases to strike an optimal trade-off between exploration of new solutions and exploitation of existing solutions. In the explorative phase different subpopulations independently explore the search space and in the exploitative phase the best solutions of different subpopulations are considered as a superswarm and moved towards the best solutions found by the superswarm. In this paper subpopulations as well as the superswarm are updated using the PSO algorithm. However, the GSO approach is quite general and any population based optimization algorithm can be used instead of the PSO algorithm. Statistical test results indicate that the GSO algorithm proposed in this paper significantly outperforms 4 state-of-the-art PSO algorithms and 4 multiswarm PSO algorithms on an overwhelming majority of 15 benchmark optimization problems over 50 independent trials and up to 50 dimensions. Extensive simulation results show that the GSO algorithm proposed in this paper converges faster to a significantly more accurate solution on a wide variety of high dimensional and multimodal benchmark optimization problems.
