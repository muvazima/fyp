                  A judgment post-stratified (JPS) sample is used in order to develop statistical inference for population quantiles and variance. For the 
                        p
                     th order of the population quantile, a test is constructed, an estimator is developed, and a distribution-free confidence interval is provided. An unbiased estimator for the population variance is also derived. For finite sample sizes, it is shown that the proposed inferential procedures for quantiles are more efficient than corresponding simple random sampling (SRS) procedures, but less efficient than corresponding ranked set sampling (RSS) procedures. The variance estimator is less efficient, as efficient as, or more efficient than a simple random sample variance estimator for small, moderately small, and large sample sizes, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that JPS sample quantile estimators and tests are asymptotically equivalent to RSS estimators and tests in their efficiency comparison.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Main motivation behind judgment post-stratification (JPS) and ranked set sampling (RSS) designs is to use a collection of a few number of experimental units without measurement to create homogeneous groups of measured observations. In a ranked set sample, for each measured observation, researcher selects a set of 
                        H
                      experimental units at random from a population of interest. These units are assigned ranks 1 through 
                        H
                     . Ranks are assigned without measurement based on either some concomitant variables or subjective opinion of the researcher on the size of the units. Out of these 
                        H
                      units, only one unit is measured, yielding a single observation,

                     . The square brackets are used to indicate that ranking of the units in the sets may be in error. If the ranking process is error-free, the square brackets are replaced with the round ones. In this case, judgment ranked order statistics become usual order statistics form a simple random sample of size 
                        H
                     . The judgment ranks in a ranked set sample act like strata in stratified sampling design by putting similar observations in the same judgment group. Hence, efficiency improvement in an RSS design can be anticipated from the general theory or a stratified sampling design.

A JPS sample, proposed by MacEachern et al. (2004), starts with a simple random sample and uses additional experimental units to create post-strata among already measured observations. The construction of a JPS sample requires selecting a sample size 
                        n
                      and set size 
                        H
                     . One then selects a simple random sample, 
                        
                           
                              X

                        ;
                        i
                        =
                        1
                        ,
                        …
                        ,
                        n
                     , of size 
                        n
                      and measures all of them. For the 
                        i
                     th measured unit, a JPS sample needs 
                        H

                        1
                      additional units to form a set of size 
                        H
                     . The units in this set are ranked from smallest to largest without a measurement, and the rank of the measured unit, on which

                      is used to denote that the ranks in a JPS sample are random variables.

It is clear from the description of RSS and JPS samples, there are two major differences between these two designs. The first difference is in the way that the ranking process is applied to the units in each set. In an RSS design, ranking is performed prior to measurement of a unit in a set. On the other hand, ranking is performed after measurement in a JPS design. As a result, the assigned ranks in a ranked set sample design become a part of the measured observations. They cannot be separated from the observed values. Hence, an RSS sample must be analyzed with an appropriate statistical procedure developed specifically for an RSS design. In a JPS sample, since the ranks are assigned after the fact that a simple random sample (SRS) has been collected, it can be analyzed as an SRS by ignoring the ranking information.

Another significant difference between a JPS and RSS sample is due to distributional properties of the sample size vector of the judgment rank classes. Let

                     , is a deterministic vector and must be determined prior to the construction of the sample while it is a random vector in a JPS sample. Therefore, a JPS sample could be highly unbalanced for small sample sizes and tends to create empty strata. This additional variation in the sample size vector makes a JPS sample less efficient in comparison with an RSS sample. It is then important to investigate the impact of the random sample size vector on a JPS sample.

The JPS sampling design has drawn attention in recent literature. Wang et al. (2008) constructed an estimator for the population mean based on stochastic ordering of judgment class distributions. Stokes et al. (2007) and Wang et al. (2006) constructed several estimators for population mean based on a JPS sample that combines ranking information of multiple rankers. Frey and Ozturk (2011) developed an estimator for the population cumulative distribution function (cdf) that uses a weaker ordering constraint than the stochastic ordering constraint of the judgment class distributions. Ozturk (2012) introduced a sampling scheme that incorporates ranking information from multiple sources to improve the JPS sampling design. For small sample sizes, it is highly possible that the JPS sample may contain empty strata. Wang et al. (2012) introduced an estimator for the population cdf that deals with the empty strata in JPS samples. Frey and Feeman (2012) showed that standard JPS estimator of a population mean is inadmissible and constructed an optimal estimator within a class of unbiased estimators. Ozturk (2013a) developed a class of estimators for population moments and median in an infinite population setting. Ozturk (2013b) constructed estimators for the population mean and total in a finite populations setting. Most recently, Dastbaravarde et al. (in press) provided a theoretical framework to show that JPS moment estimators are less efficient than RSS moment estimators for finite sample sizes.

The main contribution of this research is to use a JPS sample to draw distribution-free statistical inference for the population quantile of order 
                        p
                      and the population variance. Section  2 introduces a quantile loss function to estimate the 
                        p
                     th quantile of a population. The estimating equation of this quantile function is used to develop a two-sided distribution-free test for the population quantile. The test statistic is calibrated to minimize the impact of possible ranking error in the ranking process. Section  3 constructs a distribution-free confidence interval. Section  4 introduces another estimator for the population quantile that minimizes the quantile loss function under the stochastic ordering constraint of the judgment class cumulative distribution functions (cdf). Section  5 introduces an unbiased estimator for the population variance. Section  6 provides empirical results to evaluate the finite sample properties of the estimators, tests and confidence intervals. Finally, Section  7 provides a concluding remark.

                        6

                     , the variance of the sign statistic in a JPS sample is different from the variance of the sign statistic in an RSS sample. Main difference is due to the coefficients

                      to its limit is very slow. Hence, its plot is expressed in logarithmic scale in 
                        x
                     -axis. Fig. 1 indicates that

                      achieves its lower bound for large sample sizes. Based on Fig. 1, one may conclude that the variance of the JPS sample sign statistic is always larger than the variance of the RSS sample sign statistic. The sign statistics based on both sampling designs yield the same variance for the large sample sizes, but the required sample size for the equivalence may be very large.

Note that the asymptotic null distribution of the sign statistic of a JPS sample is the same as the asymptotic null distribution of a sign statistic of an RSS sample. On the other hand, for a finite sample size, the variance of a JPS sample sign statistic is larger than the variance of an RSS sample sign statistic.

                      This estimator requires at least two observations from each judgment class group.

                      has the minimum variance among all unbiased estimators in that class.

Recently Frey and Feeman (2013) proposed a class of unbiased estimators for the population variance in a JPS sample by conditioning on the observed sample size vector. They further minimize the conditional mean square error of the estimator in this class to construct a conditionally optimal unbiased estimator. In this section we provide an unconditional unbiased estimator for the population variance based on a JPS sample.

The quality of judgment ranking information is modeled with the Dell and Clutter (1972) model. This model uses the joint distribution of the response and ranking variables to assign a rank to measured unit in each set. The quality of ranking information is controlled by the correlation coefficient 
                        ρ
                      between the response and ranking variables. In order to maintain the desired correlation coefficient, the response variable is scaled so that it has a variance one. The correlation coefficient 
                        ρ
                        =
                        1
                      yields perfect ranking while 
                        ρ
                        =
                        0
                      yields a random ranking in each set. The other intermediate ranking information can be considered by the selection of a correlation coefficient between 0 and 1 (
                        0
                        ≤
                        ρ
                        ≤
                        1
                     ). Readers are referred to Dell and Clutter (1972) and Ozturk (2013a) for the detailed development of this model. The simulation study selects the correlation coefficient to be 
                        ρ
                        =

                     Table 3 presents simulation results for standard normal distribution. It is clear from the relative efficiencies that the quantile estimator under the stochastic ordering constraint on judgment class cdfs yields higher efficiencies than the JPS and SRS quantile estimators of order

                     , the JPS estimators may be less efficient for small sample sizes

                     , but they become as efficient as or more efficient than the SRS quantile estimators for large sample sizes 
                        
                           (

                     . In this case estimation of the extreme quantiles requires larger sample sizes. As expected the efficiency gain decreases when 
                        ρ
                      becomes smaller.

                     , respectively. This can be explained from the fact that the stochastic order restriction is more frequently violated for small sample sizes. Hence the estimator

                      makes a correction on ranking error through the stochastic order constraint and improves the efficiency. For large samples, there is less violation on stochastic order restriction.

                     . The last column of Table 3 indicates that the coverage probabilities of the 
                        p
                     -th order population quantile confidence intervals are reasonably close to the nominal value 0.95 when

                        n

                        15
                     . This indicates that constructing confidence intervals for the extreme quantiles requires a larger sample size.

The patterns similar to the ones that have been observed in Table 3 also appear in Tables 4 and 5 for the Student’s 
                        t
                     -distribution with three degrees of freedom and standard log-normal distributions, respectively. This suggests that the estimators and the confidence intervals are distribution free for sample sizes as small as 15.

                      is the simple random sample variance estimator. The values of 
                        R
                        E
                      greater than one indicate that the proposed estimator is more efficient than the simple random sample variance estimator. It is clear from Table 6
                      that the proposed variance estimator may be less efficient than a simple random sample estimator for small sample sizes and small 
                        ρ
                      values. When the sample size is small, the JPS samples are highly unbalanced producing many empty strata. Hence, the variance of the estimator is inflated. When the sample size increases, the JPS sample approaches to a balanced ranked set sample and the variance estimator becomes as efficient as or more efficient than a simple random sample variance estimator depending on the magnitude of the sample size. For example, for all four distributions in Table 6, the efficiency of the proposed estimator is less than one when 
                        n

                        30
                      and greater than one when

                     . Hence, it produces more unbalanced samples (and possibly empty strata), and reduces the efficiency. Another observation from Table 6 is that the efficiency increases with the quality of ranking information as expected.


                     MacEachern et al. (2004) introduced judgment post-stratified sample to stratify a simple random sample post experimentally based on available auxiliary information. Because of this additional structure, the JPS sample is usually more efficient than an SRS sample but less efficient than an RSS sample to develop inference for the population mean. This research shows that the similar result also holds for the quantile inference of an infinite population. For a finite sample, the efficiency of the quantile estimator of a JPS sample is in between the SRS and RSS sample quantile estimators. It is shown that as the sample size gets large the efficiency of the JPS sample quantile estimator approaches to the efficiency of an RSS sample quantile estimator.

JPS uses a ranking process, often subject to a ranking error, to create judgment strata. The main results of the paper do not rely on the perfect ranking assumption. It only requires a consistent ranking scheme. Hence, the results are applicable in a wide range of JPS sampling designs. This paper considers statistical inference for the population quantiles and variance. The results can be generalized to draw inference for other aspects of a population.
