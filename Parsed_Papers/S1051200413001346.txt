                  This paper focuses on some critical issues in a recently reported approach [V. Singh, Improved LMI-based criterion for global asymptotic stability of 2-D state-space digital filters described by Roesser model using twoʼs complement overflow arithmetic, Digital Signal Process. 22 (2012) 471–475] for the global asymptotic stability of two-dimensional (2-D) fixed-point state-space digital filters described by the Roesser model employing twoʼs complement overflow arithmetic. In particular, it is highlighted that the situation where Singhʼs approach can be applied to ensure the global asymptotic stability of digital filters in the presence of twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities is not conceivable.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the past few decades, a vast amount of research was devoted to the study of the system theoretic problems of two-dimensional (2-D) discrete dynamical systems. Such a study has predominantly been motivated by a wide variety of applications of 2-D discrete systems in many areas such as digital data filtering, image data processing and transmission, seismographic data processing, gas filtration, water stream heating, thermal processes in chemical reactors, 2-D digital control systems, river pollution modeling, grid based wireless sensor networks, modeling of partial differential equations, etc. [1–6].

In the implementation of stable and linear recursive digital filters using finite wordlength fixed-point processors, nonlinear effects are introduced owing to the overflow and quantization [7–9]. These nonlinear effects may result in the instability of the designed filter. Therefore, a major concern is to find the conditions under which the filter would be globally asymptotically stable. Many publications relating to the issue of stability of digital filters have appeared (see, for instance, [7–25] and the references cited therein). The common types of overflow nonlinearities are saturation, zeroing, triangular and twoʼs complement [9,24]. The twoʼs complement arithmetic adder is known to be the cheapest among all overflow arithmetic adders employed in practice. The effect of twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities on the stability of one-dimensional (1-D) digital filters has been investigated in [8,11–17]. The stability properties of 2-D digital filters have been studied in the presence of twoʼs complement overflow [18–22], various combinations of quantization and overflow [23], generalized overflow [24], and quantization [25].

This paper is directly inspired by a recent paper [22]. In [22], Singh has reported a criterion for the global asymptotic stability of zero-input 2-D digital filters described by the Roesser model [26] implemented with twoʼs complement arithmetic for the addition operation. Splitting the twoʼs complement nonlinearity sector [
                        −
                        1
                        ,
                        1
                     ] into two smaller sectors [
                        0
                        ,
                        1
                     ] and [
                        −
                        1
                        ,
                        0
                     ] together with making use of a certain ‘assumption’ is a key step in the approach of [22]. The approach in [22] appears to be quite distinct from other approaches [8,11–21,24].

The purpose of this paper is to highlight that, for the systems implemented with twoʼs complement overflow adders, the ‘assumption’ made in [22] is a major restriction in disguise and it is hard to conceive any situation where Singhʼs approach [22] can be applied to ensure the global asymptotic stability of digital filters in the presence of twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities. It will be demonstrated that all the examples considered in [22] fail to validate this ‘assumption’ and, consequently, the approach [22] is incapable of detecting the global asymptotic stability. Further, the implication of Singhʼs approach [22] is discussed in the context of 1-D digital filters with twoʼs complement overflow arithmetic.

                      We observe that twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities belong to (2). As in [22] (see [8,13–17,21,24] also), we assume that the effects of quantization are negligible. Such an assumption is based on a common approximation (i.e., ‘decoupling approximation’ [8,9]) where the effects of quantization and overflow are treated as mutually independent or decoupled. This ‘decoupling approximation’ can be justified if the signals are represented by a sufficiently large number of bits [8,9]. It is understood that system (1) has a finite set of initial conditions, i.e., there exist two positive integers K and L such that [18–21,23,24]

Eqs. (1)–(3) represent a class of 2-D discrete dynamical systems implemented in finite wordlength fixed-point processors using twoʼs complement signal representation. Examples of such systems are common in engineering and include 2-D digital filters with twoʼs complement overflow arithmetic, 2-D nonlinear digital control systems, models of various physical phenomena (e.g., compartmental systems, single carriageway traffic flow [25], etc.), various dynamical processes represented by the Darboux equation [3] and so on. An example of the system represented by (1)–(3) can be found in wireless sensor networks [5], where each node typically employs 16-bit fixed-point microprocessors for data processing. Thus, the nonlinearities due to finite wordlength are inherently present in such systems.

Recently, Singh [22] has studied the problem of global asymptotic stability of the 2-D system (1)–(3). In analyzing the stability of the equilibrium

                        0
                      of the 2-D system (1)–(3), [22] makes use of the following assumption. 
                        Assumption 1
                        (See Singh [22].) All nonlinearities (2) in the system (1) at a time either belong to (4) or to (5), but not to both (4) and (5).

It may be mentioned that, in the case of 1-D systems, a temporal variable (time) plays a central role. Ref. [22] deals with a class of nonlinear 2-D discrete systems in which time does not have a role. Indeed, the independent variables of interest are spatial variables. Therefore, in the context of 2-D discrete systems, Assumption 1 may be modified as follows.


                     
                        Assumption 2
                        For any set of initial conditions satisfying (3), all nonlinearities (2) in the system (1) along the line 
                              k
                              +
                              l
                              =
                              p
                            either belong to (4) or to (5) (but not to both (4) and (5)) for any nonnegative integer p.

Now, the main result of [22] may be stated as follows.

                        Remark 1
                        Observe that, in the approach of [22], condition (6) alone cannot ensure the global asymptotic stability of (1)–(3). If the system fails to confirm Assumption 2, the global asymptotic stability of the system cannot be established via the approach in [22]. In view of the characteristics of the twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities, it is not natural to expect that Assumption 2 is valid automatically for all kinds of systems given by (1)–(3). The state trajectories of the 2-D system (1)–(3) depend on the state matrix A for a given set of initial conditions. Thus, the validity of Assumption 2 is also dependent on the system parameters and initial conditions.

                            are in the sector [−1, 0]. Moreover, Assumption 2 demands that, along the progression of states of the system (1)–(3) over

                           ]) then operating sectors of all other nonlinearities must alter simultaneously. This demand is hardly fulfilled for any arbitrary set of initial conditions (3).

Summarizing the above, if overflow occurs, it is hard to conceive any situation where the approach in [22] can be applied to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the system (1)–(3).

According to El-Agizi and Fahmy [18] (see [19] also), the equilibrium

                      Ref. [22] presents several examples (see [22, Examples 1–3]) of 2-D systems which fail to satisfy (14). However, as shown in [22], these examples satisfy (6). Therefore, it is stated in [22] that, under Assumption 2, the systems considered in such examples are globally asymptotically stable. It may be pointed out that [22] does not investigate whether Assumption 2 is valid for [22, Examples 1–3]. In this section, it is demonstrated that Assumption 2 fails for these examples. By trajectory trace, it is shown that the 2-D systems considered in [22, Examples 1–3] are actually not globally asymptotically stable. Further, an example that satisfies El-Agizi and Fahmyʼs criterion [18] while violates Singhʼs criterion [22] is provided.

Using the same reasoning as above, it is easy to conclude that Theorem 1 is not applicable as a global asymptotic stability test for [22, Examples 2 and 3] also.

To discuss further, let us examine the behavior of the state trajectories of [22, Example 1]. Assuming

                              ,
                              l
                              )
                              =
                              0
                              ,
                           
                        
                      for system (15) for any set of initial conditions satisfying (3) 
                     [18,19,24]. The unstable behavior of (15) is clearly visible in Fig. 1. By computer simulation, the existence of limit cycles has been observed for other examples (i.e., [22, Examples 2 and 3]) also. Consequently, the 2-D systems considered in [22, Examples 1–3] are, in fact, not globally asymptotically stable. From this result, one can undoubtedly infer that Assumption 2 cannot be valid for [22, Examples 1–3].

Next, to illustrate the conservatism of Singhʼs criterion [22] relative to El-Agizi and Fahmyʼs criterion [18], consider an example of a 2-D digital filter represented by (1)–(3) with
                        
                           (23)
                           
                              A
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    
                                 
                              
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    
                                 
                              
                              ,
                              
                              m
                              =
                              2
                              ,
                              
                              n
                              =
                              1
                              .
                           
                        
                      Following the steps similar to (16)–(19), it is easy to show that this example fails to satisfy Assumption 2 and, therefore, falls outside the application scope of Theorem 1. On the other hand, using the Matlab LMI toolbox [27,28], one may obtain a number of choices of the unknown matrix 
                        D
                      to satisfy (14) for this example. The following is one of them:

                                          0
                                       
                                       
                                          1.2682
                                       
                                    
                                 
                                 ]
                              
                              .
                           
                        
                     
                  

Therefore, according to El-Agizi and Fahmyʼs criterion [18], the digital filter described by (1)–(3) and (23) is globally asymptotically stable.

                      Thus, the filter under consideration exhibits a limit cycle with period two, which implies that (28) is not globally asymptotically stable. On the other hand, using the Matlab LMI toolbox [27,28], it turns out that (27) is feasible for the following values of unknown parameters:

In other words, Assumption 3 is violated in this example, and hence, Theorem 2 cannot be applied to detect the global asymptotic stability.

                      Using similar arguments as above, it can be verified that Assumption 3 fails in this example. According to [11], the zero solution of a second-order digital filter described by (25) and (26) is globally asymptotically stable if 
                        A
                      is 1-D stable and

                        A
                      given by (32) is 1-D stable and satisfies (33). Therefore, [11] ensures the global asymptotic stability of the present system.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Some critical issues in Singhʼs approach [22] for the global asymptotic stability of 2-D digital filters described by the Roesser model employing twoʼs complement overflow arithmetic have been focused. Pertaining to the case of twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities, it has been illustrated that approach in [22] is not capable of detecting the global asymptotic stability of [22, Examples 1–3]. It has been shown that the 2-D systems considered in [22, Examples 1–3] are actually not globally asymptotically stable. An example that satisfies El-Agizi and Fahmyʼs criterion [18] while violates criterion in [22] has been provided. The implication of [22] has been discussed in the context of 1-D digital filters implemented with twoʼs complement overflow adder.

The major drawback of the approach in [22] is that it does not consider the situations where a number of nonlinearities operate in the sector [
                        0
                        ,
                        1
                     ] while other nonlinearities are in the sector [
                        −
                        1
                        ,
                        0
                     ]. Thus, it is hard to conceive any situation where the approach in [22] can be applied to ensure the global asymptotic stability of digital filters in the presence of twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities.
