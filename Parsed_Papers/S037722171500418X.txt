                  Theory of constraints has been commonly used in production systems to improve productivity. Since the improvement on an upstream workstation may have impact on its downstream servers, finding the true bottleneck is not trivial in a stochastic production line. Due to the analytical intractability of general tandem queues, we develop methods to quantify the dependence among stations through simulation. Dependence is defined by the contribution queue time at each station, and contribution factors are developed based on the insight from Friedman's reduction method and Jackson networks. In a tandem queue, the dependence among stations can be either diffusion or blocking, and their impact depends on the positions relative to the bottlenecks. Based on these results, we show that improving the performance of the system bottleneck may not be the most effective place to reduce system cycle time. Rather than making independence assumptions, the proposed method points out a promising direction and sheds light on the insights of the dependence in practical systems.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

To make an organization more profitable, production systems are often required by the management to have higher throughput rate under limited resource especially during peak seasons. To achieve this goal, Goldratt and Cox (1992) proposed the Theory of Constraints (TOC) based on the concept of bottlenecks, where a bottleneck is defined as the workstation whose required throughput rate is higher than its capacity. Through TOC, they explained how to achieve higher system throughput rate by relieving the bottleneck as well as how to reduce inventory by synchronizing production lines with the bottleneck. Rahman (1998) gave a comprehensive review on the Theory of Constraints.

Stochastic effects are inherent in production systems: a machine faces different types of preventive maintenances, product changeovers or breakdowns. They can be either time-based, or run-based and preemptive or non-preemptive (Wu, 2014a; Wu, McGinnis, & Zwart, 2011). A flexible machine can process different products with different service times under complicated dispatching policies. Jobs may encounter process and transfer batches (Wu, 2014b), and the transportation time may not be a constant between workstations. While service time variability can be small (Bitran & Tirupati, 1988; Inman, 1999), production environment is stochastic by nature.

In a stochastic system, the price of higher throughput rate is longer queue time. When the throughput rate approaches capacity, the queue time goes to infinity. Since no customer would accept infinite cycle time, a bottleneck defined by throughput rate cannot occur in a stochastic production line. On the other hand, the bottleneck in manufacturing is typically defined as the workstation with the highest level of utilization (see e.g. Lozinski and Classey, 1988; Hopp and Spearman, 1995). However, due to the dependence among workstations, the station with the highest utilization may not have the most impact on system cycle time. To overcome the shortcomings, Wu (2005) extended the definition of bottlenecks from throughput bottlenecks (TPBN) to cycle time bottlenecks (CTBN), where a cycle time bottleneck is the workstation which prevents a production system from achieving its mean cycle time target. Since system cycle time is contributed by all workstations, all workstations are cycle time bottlenecks with different levels of contribution. With the same mean cycle time target, reducing the mean queue time of any workstation would allow queue time increases of the others, and potentially lead to a higher throughput rate of the system under the same system capacity. By defining bottlenecks from the view point of cycle time, the concept of TOC has been extended from a deterministic system to a stochastic one. Although all workstations can be cycle time bottlenecks, there are still major and minor ones, where a major one has a higher impact on system mean cycle time. The question becomes which workstation is the major cycle time bottleneck and we should improve first?

For a workstation with independent and identically distributed (iid) interarrival time and service time, its mean queue time can be approximated by Kingman's G/G/1 heavy traffic approximation (Kingman, 1965):

                      is the SCV of service time, and QT is mean queue time. Cycle time is the sum of queue time and service time. In a queueing network, if all stations work independently, Kingman's approximation would give good evaluation of system performance. However, in practice, congestion at a workstation often implies later congestion at its downstream stations. Machine states are dependent and the internal arrival process is not renewal in general (Whitt, 1995). In this situation, the performance of a workstation will have impact on its downstream workstations. Simply improving the workstation with the highest utilization may not be the optimal choice. In terms of cycle time reduction, we call a workstation the first moment CTBN, if it is the most effective workstation to improve system cycle time when its service time is reduced, and we call a workstation the second moment CTBN if it is the most effective workstation to improve system cycle time when its variability (or variations) is reduced.

Dependence in queueing systems has been widely studied since 1960s. Dependence among service times in tandem queues has been studied by Mitchell, Paulson, and Beswick (1977), Pinedo and Wolff (1982), Sandmann (2012), Weber and Weiss (1994) and
Wolff (1982). Dependence between interarrivals and service time in queueing systems has been studied by Adan and Kulkarni (2003), Bhat (1969), Borst and Boxma (1993) and Boxma and Perry (2001). Prior literatures mainly focused on the dependence among successive service times, dependence between interarrival times and service times, as well as dependence among successive interarrival times (Fendick, Saksena, & Whitt, 1989). Only few of them studied the dependence among queue times. Reich (1963) proved that in single-server tandem queues with exponential service time and Poisson arrival process, the cycle times spent by a customer in successive stations are independent in steady state. On the other hand, Burke (1964) considered two single-server queueing systems in tandem with exponential service time and Poisson arrival process and proved that the queue times of a job between consecutive stations are mutually dependent in steady state. However, the above studies on queue time dependence are all derived under Markovian settings.

Although the existence of dependence among stations is well recognized, due to the non-renewal departure processes (Bitran & Dasu, 1992), the exact analysis of dependence in general queueing systems is analytically intractable. The current approaches to evaluate the performance of queueing networks are mainly based on independence assumptions directly (e.g. the stochastic independence assumption (Kleinrock, 1976)) or indirectly (e.g. the functional central limit theorem (Harrison & Nguyen, 1990)). Due to the independence assumptions, product-form and Brownian networks are not capable to fully capture the dependence among stations.

To have better understanding of practical queueing systems, we study the dependence of mean queue times among stations in general tandem queues through simulation. Dependence is defined by the contribution of a station in a tandem queue, and the contribution of a station is defined based on the insight from Friedman's reduction method (Friedman, 1965) and Jackson networks (Jackson, 1957). Two types of dependences are identified: blocking and diffusion effects. Their impact on system queue time depends on their positions relative to the bottlenecks. We start our investigation from a simple problem with the following assumptions: workstations are arranged in series without reentry, each workstation is a single server with infinite buffers, dispatching policy is first-come-first-server (FCFS), and the service times of each workstation and the external interarrival times are mutually independent and generally distributed.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the property of intrinsic ratios and defines the contribution queue times. Section 3 explains the dependence among single server queues in series. Section 4 introduces the second moment results on the theory of constraints, and conclusion is given in Section 5.

In this study we investigate the dependence of the mean queue times of a general tandem queue with N single server stations as shown in Fig. 1
                     . The external interarrival times and service times are mutually independent and generally distributed. Jobs arrive at the first station independently with arrival rate λ and squared coefficient of variation (SCV)

                     Wu and McGinnis (2013) studied tandem queues in Fig. 1 and introduced the concept of intrinsic ratio. They also proposed an approximate model for the system queue time of a general queueing network through intrinsic ratios (Wu & McGinnis, 2012). Here we give a brief review of the intrinsic ratio and system queue time approximation. It constitutes the fundamentals of the analysis in Section 3.

To compute the intrinsic ratio, bottlenecks of a tandem queue have to be determined first as follows.

                     Procedure 1 identifies the main system bottleneck first, and then identifies the next bottleneck within a subsystem, where a subsystem is composed of the servers from the first server to the newest identified bottleneck (not included). At first when no bottleneck has been identified, the subsystem is the entire system and BN1 is the system bottleneck. The subsystem then gradually becomes smaller until the subsystem is solely composed of the first station of the tandem queue.

To compute intrinsic ratios, Wu and McGinnis (2013) introduced ASIA and fully coupled systems. In an ASIA system, all servers see the initial arrivals (ASIA) directly. Therefore, if the tandem queue in Fig. 1 is an ASIA system, the station i of the tandem queue is a G/G/1 queue with the initial arrival process and service time Si

An ASIA system is motivated by the Jackson network (Jackson, 1957) and gives the exact result to a tandem queue (in Fig. 1) when all service times are exponentially distributed and the external arrival process is Poisson. In contrast with an ASIA system, motivated by Friedman's reduction method, a fully coupled system is defined as follows.

                      and the intrinsic ratio is one at all stations based on Eq. (4). In a tandem queue, when the service times of all stations are constant (or a Friedman's tandem queue), system mean queue time is solely determined by the main system bottleneck based on the reduction method (Friedman, 1965). Namely, the system mean queue time of the tandem queue is the same as the mean queue time of the main system bottleneck when it sees the initial external arrival process directly, i.e.,

                      in Eq. (3) and the intrinsic ratio is zero at all stations.

Because Eq. (2) reduces to an M/G/1 queue (and gives exact results) when the arrival process is Poisson, the computation of intrinsic ratio is accurate with Poisson arrivals. With other general arrival processes, in order to get the correct intrinsic ratio, the mean queue time in ASIA systems has to be obtained from simulation. Wu and McGinnis (2013) observed that the intrinsic ratio behaves approximately linear across traffic intensities. Based on this nice property, Wu and McGinnis (2012) derived Eq. (5) to approximate system mean queue time (QTf
                     ) of N servers in series

In a Jackson network (Jackson, 1957), since the intrinsic ratio is one for all stations, contribution factors equal one at all stations as well. In a Friedman's tandem queue, since all intrinsic ratios are zero, the contribution factor is zero at the non-bottleneck stations, and is one at the bottleneck based on Procedure 2.

According to Procedure 2, the value of CF is always one at the main system bottleneck, but can be other non-negative real numbers at the non-bottlenecks. An important observation is that the ASIA system plays a critical role in determining the contribution of a server to the entire system. In a Jackson network, all servers see the initial arrivals, which is a Poisson process (Burke, 1956). Hence, each station behaves as if it is a standalone station, which is also its counterpart in the ASIA system. In this situation, the ASIA system mean queue time of each station is the same as (or “contributes” to) the actual mean queue time of the original system.

In a tandem queue with constant service times at all stations, the system mean queue time is solely determined by the main system bottleneck according to the reduction method (Friedman, 1965). The main system bottleneck station behaves as if it is a standalone station, which sees the initial arrivals directly. In this situation, the ASIA system queue time of the bottleneck determines (or “contributes” to) the system queue time, but all the non-bottlenecks have no impact or contribution to the overall system queue time, despite that jobs do have appeared queue time at those non-bottleneck stations, where appeared queue time refers to the actual time a customer spends waiting at a particular station.

                      is the contribution from station i to the system mean queue time. Based on the above analysis, there can be two types of queue times associated with each station in a tandem queue: QT
                        i
                      and C
                     
                        N, i
                     . QT
                        i
                      is the actual or appeared queue time at station i, which measures its performance in appearance. C
                     
                        N, i
                      is the contribution queue time at station i, which measures its authentic contribution to the system. Based on Eq. (5), the total appeared queue time is the same as the total contribution queue time. When the service times of all stations in a tandem queue are constant, although jobs may have queue times at the non-bottleneck stations (i.e., positive appeared queue time), those non-bottleneck stations indeed have zero contribution to the system queue time, since the system queue time is solely determined by the main system bottleneck and those non-bottleneck stations play no role in determining system queue time (Friedman, 1965).

The contribution queue time coincides with the appeared queue time in a Jackson network, but they should be different in general. In contrast to the appeared queue time, although the contribution queue time is more abstract, it represents the true contribution of a station to the system. It plays the key role to analyze the dependence among the stations of a tandem queue.

In this section, we study the dependence from the viewpoint of ASIA systems, and show how to describe the dependence among stations through the concept of contribution queue time. In the following analysis, we use the single-point historical data approach (Wu & McGinnis, 2013), which assumes the historical queue time of each workstation is known at a specific traffic intensity. In our case, we get the historical data from simulations. ri
                      can be obtained through the simulation queue time and Eqs. (2)–(4).

The FCFS policy only considers local information and is a decentralized control policy. Under FCFS, in a tandem queue with infinite buffer capacity, the states of downstream stations have no impact on the dispatching decisions (and hence the arrival processes) of the upstream stations. When the service times of servers and the external interarrival times are mutually independent, the above observation implies the states of the downstream stations have no impact on the queue times of the upstream stations. On the other hand, since the arrival process of a downstream station is the departure process of its upstream stations, the queue time of a downstream station is dependent on the states of its upstream servers.

Since the actual (or appeared) queue time of an upstream station is not impacted by its downstream workstations (but the contribution queue time can be), dependence among stations is analyzed based on the changes of the contribution queue times from the first station to the last one by sequentially adding the stations back to the system (i.e., increasing the value of N in Eq. (5)). When

                      From Sections 3.1 to 3.4, we present four queueing systems to explain DoB, DoN, BoB and BoN, respectively. In Section 3.5, an integrated case with both diffusion and blocking effects is analyzed. All the following systems are composed of five single server queues in series. For each simulation experiment, thirty replications are conducted at the specified arrival rate. Each replication consists of 200,000 jobs after discarding the first 400,000 jobs for warm-up. The sample size is sufficiently large so that the half width of 95 perecnt confidence intervals of the mean simulation queue time is less than 2 perecnt.

The diffusion effect is explained by a system with five single servers in series. The arrival process is Poisson with mean 33 1/3 minutes. The mean service times from the first server to the last are 20, 23, 25, 28 and 30 minutes. The service time SCVs are 8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8 and 0.4, respectively. Since the service time SCV of the first station is high, the departure intervals of jobs from station 1 have large variations with negative impact on the performance of downstream stations. Based on the simulation, actual queue times of the five stations are

                        . Note that, although the actual queue time can be computed exactly in this special case, we use simulation rather than the M/G/1 queue to obtain the value of  QT1.

The next step is to add the second server to the subsystem, i.e.,

                        . Hence, the subsystem now includes the first two servers with mean service times 20 and 23. Note that both two servers are bottlenecks according to Procedure 1. Since

If the second server sees the initial arrivals (i.e., it is a standalone station), the mean queue time of the second server (i.e. the main system bottleneck in this subsystem) should be

The contributions of stations 1, 2, 3 and 4 increase 15.79, 3.40, 4.40 and 7.76, respectively, which are the diffused queue time at station 5 induced by stations 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The diffusion effect in the original tandem queue is shown in Fig. 6
                        .

In this tandem queue, the service time SCV of the first server is 8 which is much larger than the SCV of the external arrival process. Hence, the first server behaves like an amplifier, which generates large departure variations with negative impact on the performance of the subsequent stations. As a result, its contribution queue time (284.86) is much longer than its actual (or appeared) queue time (135.18). Namely, its contribution is much larger than its appearance in this tandem queue system.

Since the service time SCVs of station 2–4 are relatively lower (0.8) than the SCV of the first station, they can “regulate” the departure variations and the negative impact from the first station decreases as shown in Fig. 6 (i.e.,

                        ). The diffused queue time from the first station becomes less on the downstream stations when they are farther away from the first station in this examined case.

To explain the diffusion effects on non-bottlenecks, a case where the first station has the largest mean service time is studied. The system is composed of five single server queues in series. The arrival process is Poisson with mean 33 1/3 minutes. The mean service times from the first station to the last are 30, 20, 23, 25, and 28 minutes, and the service time SCVs are 2, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, respectively. Stations 2–5 are non-bottleneck according to Procedure 1.

Based on the simulation, actual queue times are

Similar to the analysis in Section 3.1, the dependence among stations can be analyzed by assuming 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              1
                           
                         in Eq. (5), and then gradually increasing N one by one. Information of each subsystem is listed in Table 1
                        . Unlike DoB, we can only obtain the total diffused queue time 
                           
                              X
                              (
                              
                                 1
                                 :
                                 k
                                 −
                                 1
                                 ,
                                 k
                              
                              )
                           
                         on each non-bottleneck induced by its upstream stations, 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              2
                              ,
                              …
                              ,
                              5
                           
                        . As shown in Table 1, the contribution factor of an upstream station is not affected by its downward stations, since all stations except the first one are non-bottlenecks. The diffusion effect in this tandem queue is depicted in Fig. 7.

To illustrate the blocking effects on bottlenecks, a case where the service time SCVs are smaller than the initial interarrival time SCV is investigated. The system is composed of five single server queues in series. The mean service time from the first server to the last is 20, 23, 25, 28 and 30 minutes. The service time SCVs are 0.25 for all servers. The arrival process is Poisson with mean 33 1/3 minutes.

Based on the simulation results, the actual queueing times are

                        .

In this tandem queue, the service time SCVs of all stations are 0.25, which are smaller than the SCV of the external arrival process. Hence, each station behaves like a breakwater, which lessens the departure variations from its upstream station. As a result, the actual queue time of the downstream station is shorter than its ASIA system queue time. The difference between the actual queue time and ASIA system queue time is “blocked” by the upstream stations, and the queue time contribution from an upstream station to the system becomes less due to its blocking effect. Note that the contribution queue time is always the same as the ASIA system queue time at the main system bottleneck according to Procedure 2. Hence, except for the last station (which is the main system bottleneck), the contribution queue times of all other stations are shorter than the actual (or appeared) queue times. That is, their contributions are smaller than the appearance in this tandem queue system due to the blocking effect.

As shown in Fig. 8, the blocked queue time caused by the first station becomes less on the downstream stations when they are farther away from the first station in this examined case, i.e.,

To demonstrate the blocking effects on the non-bottlenecks, a tandem queue where the first station has the longest mean service time is studied. The system is composed of five single server queues in series. The arrival process is Poisson with mean 33 1/3 minutes. The mean service times from the first station to the last are 30, 23, 25, 28, and 20 minutes. All the downstream stations are non-bottleneck according to Procedure 1. The service time SCV is 0.25 for all stations.

Based on simulation, actual queue times are

Similar to the previous analysis, blocking effect among stations can be analyzed by assuming 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              1
                           
                         in Eq. (5), and then gradually increasing N. Information of subsystems is listed in Table 3
                        . Unlike the BoB, we can only compute the overall blocked queue time at the non-bottleneck 
                           
                              X
                              (
                              
                                 1
                                 :
                                 k
                                 −
                                 1
                                 ,
                                 k
                              
                              )
                           
                         blocked by the upstream stations, 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              2
                              ,
                              …
                              ,
                              5
                           
                        . Since the authentic contribution from a non-bottleneck station is the difference between its ASIA system queue time and the blocked queue time, and the difference is also the actual queue time, the actual queue time is the same as the contribution queue time in the BoN case.

As shown in Table 3, the contribution factors of upstream stations are not affected by the downstream stations, since all stations except the first one are non-bottlenecks. The result of blocking effect in this tandem queue is shown in Fig. 9.

The above four ideal cases are designed to explain diffusion and blocking effects individually. However, they can exist jointly in general. In the following, a case with all four types of effects discussed in Sections 3.1–
3.4 is presented. The tandem queue is composed of five stations, and the mean service time from the first station to the last is 25, 23, 28, 20 and 30 minutes. Hence, stations 1, 3 and 5 are bottlenecks according to Procedure 1. The service time SCVs are 0.25, 0.5, 3, 0.8 and 0.25, respectively. The arrival process is Poisson with mean 33 1/3 minutes. Based on the simulation results, queue times of the five stations are

The dependence among stations is analyzed by assuming 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              1
                           
                         in Eq. (5), and then gradually increasing N. Information of subsystems is listed in Table 4
                        . The blocking and diffusion effects in the tandem queue are shown in Fig. 10
                        
                        . Since the service time SCV of station 1 is smaller than the interarrival time SCV, station 1 behaves like a breakwater and blocking effect occurs at stations 2 and 3. Specifically, the blocking effect at station 2 is BoN, and at station 3 is BoB. Since station 3 has relatively higher service time SCV, station 3 behaves like an amplifier and diffusion effect occurs at stations 4 and 5, where the blocking effect at station 4 is DoN and at station 5 is DoB.

In practical manufacturing systems, cycle time reduction is often achieved through improving job scheduling or reducing the mean or variance of service times. According to Delp, Si, and Fowler (2006), reducing service time variability is a cost-effective way to achieve shorter cycle time. Assuming the cost of reducing service time variability (in percentage) is the same for all stations, an important question to ask is how to identify the second moment CTBN, which is the most effective station to improve system cycle time if its variability is reduced.

The analysis of blocking and diffusion effects discussed in Section 3 presents a way to quantify the dependence among single server queues in series. When the variability of station i is reduced, the mean queue times at station i and its downstream stations are shortened. Denote the mean queue time of the original system by QT
                        f
                     (0, 0). If the service time SCV of station i is reduced by p (in percentage), the new system mean queue time is denoted by QT
                        f
                     (i, p), 1 ≤ i ≤ N, 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. If the mean service times of all stations are unchanged, the second moment CTBN is the station resulting in the shortest system mean queue time, i.e.,

Rather than improving the throughput bottleneck (with the highest utilization), we will show that it can be more effective to start with some other stations when one would like to reduce the system mean cycle time. Two examples are presented in the following. All the systems in Examples 1 and 2 are examined at 10 different utilizations (ρ ranges from 0.1 to 0.95). Thirty replications are conducted at each utilization. Each replication consists of 200,000 jobs after discarding the first 400,000 jobs for warm-up. The sample size is sufficiently large so that the half width of 95 perecnt confidence intervals of the mean simulation queue time is less than 2 perecnt. In the following examples, note that the external arrival processes are not Poisson and the service times are not exponential. As we mentioned in Section 2, in order to get the correct intrinsic ratio, the mean queue time in ASIA systems is obtained from simulation.


                     
                        Example 1
                        A tandem queue consists of five single-server stations in series. The SCV of the external arrival interval at the first station is 0.3. The mean service times from the first station to the last are 28, 26, 24, 22 and 30 minutes. The service time SCVs from the 1st station to the last is SCV(0) = [0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8]. Let system utilization 
                              
                                 ρ
                                 =
                                 λ
                                 /
                                 
                                    μ
                                    5
                                 
                                 
                              
                            and 
                              
                                 p
                                 =
                                 50
                                 percent
                              
                           . The second moment CTBN is identified by reducing the service time SCV of each station. Let SCV(1) = [0.4,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8], SCV(2) = [0.8,0.4,0.8,0.8,0.8], SCV(3) = [0.8,0.8,0.4,0.8,0.8], SCV(4) = [0.8,0.8,0.8,0.4,0.8] and SCV(5) = [0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.4]. The system mean queue times of the six tandem queues with SCV(i), i = 0, 1, …, 5 are compared.

The system mean queue times from simulation are presented in Table 5. Among the six different configurations, the shortest queue time at each utilization is underlined. Based on the discussion in Section 3, because the SCV of the external arrival intervals is less than the SCVs of service times, diffusion effects exist in Example 1. The main system bottleneck is station 5 as μ
                     5 is the least among the five stations. Simulation results show that when 0.1 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.9, the system mean queue time becomes the shortest if the variability of the first station (rather than the main system bottleneck) is reduced by 50 perecnt. The second moment CTBN is station 1.

To explore the reason, dependence among the tandem queues with SCV(1) and SCV(5) at 
                        
                           ρ
                           =
                           0.8
                        
                      is analyzed. For the system with SCV(1), due to the diffusion effects, the reduction of variability at the first station not only reduces the queue time at station 1, but also reduces queue times at the downstream stations. However, in the system with SCV(5), the reduction of variability at the fifth station only reduces the queue time at station 5. As shown in Figs. 11 and 12
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     , the diffusion effect is less in the system with SCV(1) , but is larger in the system with SCV(5). For example, the diffused queue time from stations 1 to 2 is 2.39 under SCV(1), but it is 9.63 under SCV(5).

However, at 
                        
                           ρ
                           =
                           0.95
                        
                     , the system mean queue time is the shortest if the variability of station 5 is reduced by 50 perecnt. This is because the queue time at station 5 is much longer than the others, and system queue time is dominated by the main system bottleneck in heavy traffic. Shortening system queue time by reducing the service time variability of station 5 becomes more effective in this situation.


                     
                        Example 2
                        A tandem queue consists of five single-server stations in series. The SCV of the external arrival interval at the first station is 0.6. The mean service times from the first station to the last are 28, 26, 24, 22 and 30 minutes. The service time SCVs from the 1st station to the last is SCV(0) = [0.5,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4]. Let system utilization 
                              
                                 ρ
                                 =
                                 λ
                                 /
                                 
                                    μ
                                    5
                                 
                                 
                              
                            and p = 50 perecnt. The second moment CTBN is identified by reducing the service time SCV of each station. Let SCV(1) = [0.25,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4], SCV(2) = [0.5,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4], SCV(3) = [0.5,0.4,0.2,0.4,0.4], SCV(4) = [0.5,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.4] and SCV(5) = [0.5,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2]. The system mean queue times of the six tandem queues with SCV(i), i = 0, 1, …, 5 are compared.

The system mean queue times from simulation are presented Table 6. Among the six different configurations, the shortest queue time at each utilization is underlined. Because the SCV of the external arrival intervals is greater than the SCVs of service times, blocking effects exist in Example 2. The main system bottleneck is station 5. Simulation results show that when 0.1 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.9, QTf
                     (1, 0.5) is the least. The second moment CTBN is station 1.

The dependence among the tandem queues with SCV(1) and SCV(5) at 
                        
                           ρ
                           =
                           0.8
                        
                      is analyzed. When the variability of the first station is reduced to 0.25, the mean queue times at station 1 and its downstream stations are reduced. However, if the variability of station 5 is reduced to 0.2, it can only reduce the queue time of itself. As shown in Figs. 13 and 14, the overall blocked queue time is greater in the system with SCV(1). However, at 
                        
                           ρ
                           =
                           0.95
                        
                     , the system mean queue time is the shortest if the variability of station 5 is reduced by 50 perecnt. This is because the queue time at station 5 is much longer than the others, and system queue time is dominated by the main system bottleneck in heavy traffic. Shortening system queue time by reducing the service time variability of station 5 becomes more effective in this situation.

For both Examples 1 and 2, each case of SCV(i) is examined by simulation at 10 different utilizations (ρ ranges from 0.1 to 0.95). To save simulation time, one can also adopt the double-point historical data approach (Wu & McGinnis, 2013), where only two utilizations are simulated and the mean cycle times at the rest of the utilizations can be extrapolated based on the two known intrinsic ratios.

Maintaining short cycle time plays a key role to achieve fast response to customer demand. To avoid long cycle time, machines are not favored to be operated in heavy traffic. In this situation, the most effective place to reduce system cycle time may not be the main system bottleneck as shown in the above two examples. Due to the dependence among stations, improving service time variability of a machine at the frontend of a process flow can be a better choice.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Although the existence of dependence among stations is well recognized, it is difficult to be modeled exactly in general and independence is commonly assumed directly or indirectly in queueing models. In order to improve the performance evaluation of queueing networks, accurately capturing the dependence into the mathematical model is of critical importance. This study can be viewed as a preliminary attempt towards this goal. Through contribution factors, the dependence among single server queues in series is analyzed. Due to the dependence among stations, productivity improvement should focus on not only the first moment CTBN, but also the second moment CTBN. While the first moment CTBN always dominates system queue time performance in heavy traffic, the second moment CTBN can play a more important role in the practical range of system utilizations.

Just like human beings, a server has its life in a queueing network. A person may perform well when he works alone (i.e., in an ASIA system), but may not be a good team player when working with others (i.e., in a tandem queue). The contribution of a basketball player in a team should not only be measured by the score he gets (i.e., actual queue time), but also should consider his interaction with the other players (i.e., contribution queue time). Comparing to the performance when he plays alone (i.e., ASIA system queue time), he may perform better (i.e., blocking) or worse (i.e., diffusion) depending on his characteristics (i.e., service time SCV) and his role in the team (i.e., position relative to the bottlenecks). Due to the independence assumptions, product-form and Brownian networks are not able to capture the dependence among stations. New approach should be developed to broaden the scope of conventional approaches in queueing networks. While our approach brings us profound insight into single server tandem queues, investigation on more general queueing systems are expected in the future.

In this study, we analyze the dependence among single server queues in series with decentralized work-conserving control policies. However, the dispatching policy can be more flexible in practice. For example, the dispatching policy at an upstream server may consider the queue lengths of its downstream servers. In this case, dependence among servers can be much more complicated. Our current model cannot be applied to this situation and the topic is left for future research.

The dependence analysis is based on the concepts of intrinsic ratios and contribution factors. Currently, the intrinsic ratios have been only studied for single station tandem queues, and the property of intrinsic ratios under more general settings, such as multiple server stations and reentrant lines, has not been rigorously examined. Hence, the dependence among the stations in general queueing networks cannot be analyzed yet. However, if we only want to identify the most effective place to improvement system cycle time without caring about the detailed dependence among stations, purely simulation approach should suffice. As we have shown in Section 4, since the throughput bottleneck may not be the most effective place to reduce system cycle time, a large number of simulation experiments have to be conducted by changing the service time variability of each station. Simulation optimization approaches, such as the optimal computing budget allocation scheme (Chen & Lee, 2010), can be a useful technique in this direction and are left for future research.

Through contribution factors and simulation results, we find the dependence among workstations can be either blocking or diffusion. However, the conditions for blocking and diffusion effects have not been fully understood. For example, it is not clear that if the service time SCV less than the interarrival time SCV is a sufficient condition for the blocking effect. To understand the dependence better, rather than relying on simulation, computing intrinsic ratios analytically is necessary and left for future research.
