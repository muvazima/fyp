Multinomial logit model

Linear reformulations

                  In the last decade several papers appeared on facility location problems that incorporate customer demand by the multinomial logit model. Three linear reformulations of the original non-linear model have been proposed so far. In this paper, we discuss these models in terms of solvability. We present empirical findings based on synthetic data.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

When customer choice behavior is considered in facility location planning we generally assume utility maximizing behavior. Probabilistic demand based on utility maximization implies that only the probability of a customer choosing a given facility is known. Traditionally, in facility location literature, gravity-type demand models are used to consider probabilistic demand (Serra, Eiselt, Laporte, & ReVelle, 1999). More recently, there is a growing body of literature that considers the multinomial logit model (MNL) in facility location models (see for example Aros-Vera, Marianov, & Mitchell, 2013; Benati & Hansen, 2002; Haase, 2009; Haase & Müller, 2013; Müller, Haase, & Kless, 2009; Zhang, Berman, & Verter, 2012). The MNL is a well-known discrete choice model (random utility model) to describe (spatial) customer choice behavior (Ben-Akiva et al., 2002; McFadden, 2001; Müller, Haase, & Seidel, 2012). Using MNL within a mathematical program for locational decision making probably yields a non-linear model formulation (see Benati, 1999; Marianov, Rfos, & Icaza, 2008, for example). If we consider only locational decisions, then there exist three different linear reformulations of the MNL yielding mixed-integer linear programs. Benati and Hansen (2002) where the first who proposed a linear reformulation based on variable substitution. Haase (2009) has proposed to employ the constant substitution pattern of the MNL in order to enable a linear integer formulation (see also Aros-Vera et al., 2013). Finally, Zhang et al. (2012) presented an alternative approach based on variable substitution.

As the three model formulations are discussed independently so far, we compare them in this contribution. Therefore, we first give a brief discussion of the MNL and its incorporation into the maximum capture problem (Section 2). Based on this, we discuss the three linear reformulations using a unified notation in order to make them more comparable (Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3). In Section 3 we compare the models in a numerical study using synthetic data. Our conclusions can be found in Section 4.

Consider a firm that wishes to enter a market where customers are located in zones denoted by nodes I. Potential facilities of the firm and facilities of competitors are located in nodes M. Now, the problem of the firm is to select r facilities from all potential facilities J with J
                     ⊂
                     M such that the patronage of the facilities of the firm is maximized. In order to determine the patronage of a located facility we assume the customers located in i
                     ∈
                     I to be homogeneous in their observable characteristics like income and so on. We further assume that the customers located in i
                     ∈
                     I maximize their utility

                     It has been discussed by Benati (1999) that (3)–(5) is NP-hard. In the following we present three different, exact linear reformulations to this problem known from literature (Aros-Vera et al., 2013; Benati & Hansen, 2002; Haase, 2009; Zhang et al., 2012). For comparison reasons we use a unified notation. Thus, the three models appear here in a different fashion compared to the original contributions. We provide the corresponding algebraic transformations in the Appendix. For a detailed discussion of the model formulations we refer to the corresponding references.

                        Of course, this parameter is only defined if {M⧹J}≠∅. This assumption is quite reasonable because customers usually face at least the choice alternative of “non-consumption” (i.e., the no-choice alternative). In all four references {M⧹J}≠∅. Further, let x

We compare the models using artificially generated data. Therefore, we have implemented the three models in GAMS (23.7) and use CPLEX 12 on a 64-bit Windows Server 2008 with 1 Intel Xeon 2.4gigahertz processor and 24gigabyte RAM to solve the problems. The Cartesian coordinates of the nodes I and M are randomly generated by a uniform distribution in the interval [0,30]. We consider the rectangular distances between i

                     I and j
                     ∈
                     M denoted by d
                     
                        ij
                     . The deterministic part of utility of (1) is defined as v
                     
                        ij

                     . Further, we consider ∣{M⧹J}∣=10 and r
                     =⌈ α∣J∣⌉ with 0<
                     α
                     <1. Table 1
                      in the appendix displays the computational results for different problem sizes (∣I∣×∣J∣) and α. For each problem set we have computed ten random instances. The maximal computational time is set to one hour. The table reports the average values of the objective function value F
                     ∗, the computational effort in seconds CPU and the gap reported by CPLEX (denoted by GAP) as well as the deviation from the optimal solution (denoted by DEV) over ten instances for each model. The objective function value of the model proposed by Zhang et al. (2012) is 20% below the optimal value for some instances. In contrast, using the model of Haase (2009) enables CPLEX to find the optimal solution for all instances within 30min. For the model by Benati and Hansen (2002) CPLEX usually finds the optimal solution within one hour. However, the computational effort is remarkably higher compared to the model of Haase (2009).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In the last decade three linear reformulations for MNL-based demand in facility location models have been proposed. All references appear to be independent from each other. In order to compare the model formulations in terms of solvability we first present the models using a unified notation. This is followed by a computational study using artificial data. We find that the approach proposed by Haase (2009) seems to be promising for solving large problems using GAMS/CPLEX. This finding has practical meaning, because real world problems can be solved without using tailored methods. Practitioners are enabled to use state-of-the-art commercial software to solve their problems. This finding has implications for researchers, too. One might be more interested to find tight bounds for the model of Haase (2009) to increase solvability rather than to simply rely on heuristics. Moreover, the reformulations are valid for gravity-type demand models as well.

However, one major issue remains unsolved so far: The MNL (and hence the models outlined in this paper) exhibits constant substitution patterns, i.e., each facility is an equal substitute to every other facility. It is very likely in applications that substitution is not constant. So far, only Haase and Müller (2013) and Müller et al. (2009) have proposed approximate approaches to deal with flexible substitution patterns.
