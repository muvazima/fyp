                  In this paper, a risk-based factorial probabilistic inference method is proposed to address the stochastic objective function and constraints as well as their interactions in a systematic manner. To tackle random uncertainties, decision makers’ risk preferences are taken into account in the decision process. Statistical significance for each of the linear, nonlinear, and interaction effects of risk parameters is uncovered through conducting a multi-factorial analysis. The proposed methodology is applied to a case study of flood control to demonstrate its validity and applicability. A number of decision alternatives are obtained under various combinations of risk levels associated with the objective function and chance constraints, facilitating an in-depth analysis of trade-offs between economic outcomes and associated risks. Dynamic complexities are addressed through a two-stage decision process as well as through capacity expansion planning for flood diversion within a multi-region, multi-flood-level, and multi-option context. Findings from the factorial experiment reveal the multi-level interactions between risk parameters and quantify their contributions to the variability of the total system cost. The proposed method is compared against the fractile criterion optimization model and the chance-constrained programming technique, respectively.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Flooding is the most frequent and expensive natural disaster in Canada, which is typically caused by heavy rainfall, rapid melting of a thick snow pack and ice jams. In June 2013, extensive rainfall brought massive flooding across Alberta located in western Canada, affecting tens of thousands of families throughout the region, resulting in the loss of four lives, and displacing over 100,000 people from their homes (WaterSMART, 2013). It is estimated that the total damage of Alberta's super flood will exceed $5 billion, which is the costliest disaster in Canadian history (Gandia, 2013). Recent accelerations in population growth, economic development, as well as changes in climate and land use patterns have been increasing risks and vulnerability to flood hazards.

Since losses cannot be avoided when a flood occurs, a sound flood mitigation plan is of vital importance for reducing flood damage. Optimization models play a crucial role in identifying effective flood mitigation strategies, which have been extensively used for flood management problems over the past decades (Braga & Barbosa, 2001; Labadie, 2004; Olsen, Beling, & Lambert, 2000; Unver & Mays, 1990; Wasimi & Kitanidis, 1983; Windsor, 1981). For instance, Needham, Watkins, Lund, and Nanda (2000) proposed a mixed-integer linear programming model to assist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ flood management studies on the Iowa and Des Moines rivers. Wei and Hsu (2008) proposed mixed-integer linear programming models to solve the problem of the real-time flood control for a multireservoir operation system. Ding and Wang (2012) developed a nonlinear optimization approach for identifying the optimal flood diversion discharge in order to mitigate flood water stages in the channel network of a watershed. Karamouz and Nazif (2013) developed a multicriteria optimization model to select best management practices for flood mitigation in urban watershed systems. Woodward, Gouldby, Kapelan, and Hames (2014) proposed a multiobjective optimization algorithm to determine an optimal flood risk mitigation strategy for a flood protection system. These methods were useful for identifying optimal flood mitigation schemes and reducing the risk of flood damage. Due to the inherent variability and unpredictability (randomness) of flood control systems, however, many parameters cannot be exactly identified; they are often modelled as random variables. As a result, conventional optimization methods would fail to cope with random variables appropriately.

In the past decade, a number of optimization techniques were proposed for addressing random uncertainties in water resources problems (Gaivoronski, Sechi, & Zuddas, 2012; Housh, Ostfeld, & Shamir, 2013; Pallottino, Sechi, & Zuddas, 2005; Wang & Huang, 2011, 2012, 2013; Zhou, Huang, & Yang, 2013). For instance, Bravo and Gonzalez (2009) developed a stochastic goal programming model for helping public water agencies allocate surface water among farmers and authorize the use of groundwater for irrigation under uncertainty. Chung, Lansey, and Bayraksan (2009) applied a robust optimization framework to design a reliable water supply system under parameter uncertainties. Wang and Huang (2014a) proposed a multi-level Taguchi-factorial two-stage stochastic programming method for supporting water resources management under interactive uncertainties. Among these methods, two-stage stochastic programming is recognized as a powerful method for tackling random variables with known probability distributions. In a typical two-stage stochastic programming, a decision is made in the first stage only when the distributional information on random variables is available. A second-stage decision or recourse decision can then be taken after a random event occurs. Such a method is suitable for dealing with the flood control problem in a two-stage fashion (Birge & Louveaux, 1988). For example, decision makers can determine an allowable flood diversion level according to the existing capacity of the floodplain before the flood season, and then they may want to carry out a corrective action when a flood occurs. Chance-constrained programming is another alternative for solving optimization problems that involve random uncertainties and supporting risk-based decision making (Charnes & Cooper, 1959). In chance-constrained programming, one or more sets of constraints are allowed to be violated with a specified probability since a solution that satisfies all possible outcomes can be prohibitively expensive. For the planning of flood control systems, allowing certain constraints to be violated with a low probability can be a reasonable and practical strategy for providing an in-depth analysis of trade-offs between economic outcomes and associated risks. Thus, an integration of two-stage stochastic programming and chance-constrained programming is necessary to support flood control planning and operations studies by taking into account randomness in different ways (Wang & Huang, 2014b).

In flood control problems, the related economic data, such as regular costs of flood diversion and capital costs of floodplain expansions, commonly act as the coefficients of the objective function in a cost minimization model. They are often given as probability distributions obtained from the estimates of a group of decision makers or stakeholders, which play a crucial role in the decision-making process. It is thus indispensable to address randomness in the coefficients of the objective function. The fractile criterion optimization model or Kataoka's model is then introduced to deal with random coefficients by using statistical features (Geoffrion, 1967; Kataoka, 1963). In fact, the probabilistic objective function interacts with chance constraints in the decision process, and their correlations may have significant effects on the model output. To conduct a systematic analysis of random uncertainties, it is also desired to explore potential interactions between the probabilistic objective function and chance constraints.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a risk-based factorial probabilistic inference method for addressing stochastic objective function and constraints as well as their interactions in a systematic manner. Statistical significance for each of the linear, nonlinear, and interaction effects of risk parameters involved in stochastic programming will be uncovered through performing a multi-level factorial analysis. The proposed methodology will be applied to a case study of flood control to demonstrate its validity and applicability, and will also be compared with the fractile criterion optimization model and the chance-constrained programming technique, respectively.

In a two-stage stochastic programming model, two types of decision variables can be distinguished: first-stage and second-stage variables. The first-stage decisions are made in the face of uncertainty. Once a random event occurs, the second-stage decisions or recourse actions can be taken in case of infeasibility caused by the first-stage decisions. A typical two-stage stochastic programming model can be formulated as (Birge & Louveaux, 1988):

In the flood control problem, the first-stage decision variable represents the amount of allowable flood flows diverted to each floodplain, while the second-stage decision variable represents the amount of excess flood diversion when a random flood event occurs with a given probability. The objective of this problem is to minimize the total system cost subject to several constraints that restrict the total amount of allowable and excess flood diversion within the existing diversion capacity for each floodplain.

Two-stage stochastic programming reflects the dynamic nature of decision problems through constructing a set of scenarios that represent the realizations of random variables. As an alternative method of stochastic optimization, chance-constrained programming is recognized as a powerful technique for dealing with probabilistic constraints. This method was first introduced by Charnes and Cooper (1959). The main feature of chance-constrained programming is that certain constraints are allowed to be violated with a specified probability and the resulting solutions ensure the probability of complying with constraints, which can thus be used to quantify the relationship between the objective-function value and the constraint-violation risk. A typical chance-constrained programming model can be formulated as:

                        where X is a vector of decision variables; A(ω) and b(ω) are matrices with random elements defined on a probability space Ω, ω ∈ Ω (Charnes, Cooper, & Kirby, 1971); α is a prescribed level of probability, α ∈ [0,1], imposing a condition that the corresponding constraint is satisfied with at least a probability of 1-α. Eq. (3b) is nonlinear, and the set of feasible constraints is convex only for some particular distributions and certain levels of α (Huang, 1998). When the left-hand-side coefficients A(ω) become deterministic [i.e. A(ω) → A], and the right-hand-side parameters b(ω) are random, Eq. (3b) becomes linear:

The fractile criterion optimization model or Kataoka's model, first introduced by Kataoka (1963), is capable of addressing the stochastic objective function based on a concept of aspiration levels. It is useful for establishing a relationship between the aspiration level for the stochastic objective and the minimum probability of reaching the aspiration level given by decision makers based on their risk preferences. Firstly, let us consider the following stochastic programming problem that involves random coefficients in the objective function:

                        where c(ω) is a random vector that represents the coefficients of the objective function. Since model (6) contains random coefficients, it can hardly be solved through solution methods for ordinary mathematical programming problems. The fractile criterion or Kataoka's criterion can thus be applied to transform the stochastic objective into its deterministic equivalent function (Kataoka, 1963).

The criterion consists of setting a probability for the stochastic objective, and minimizing the value (aspiration level) that the objective function can reach with, at least, the given probability (Muñoz & Ruiz, 2009). By using the fractile criterion to address the stochastic objective, model (6) can be rewritten as:

Factorial analysis, a multivariate inference method, is a powerful tool for examining the effects of factors with each having discrete values (or levels) and the effects of interactions among factors on a response variable. In a factorial experiment, all combinations of the levels of factors are taken into account through a factorial design. For instance, if there are a levels of factor A and b levels of factor B, a complete factorial experiment contains all ab treatment combinations. The effects model for such a factorial experiment can be expressed as:

                         denotes the grand total of all observations (Montgomery, 2000). These statistics are collected in analysis of variance that signifies a decomposition of the variance into contributing components. It is useful in testing differences between two or more means by analyzing variances from multiple sources.

Unlike the regular two-level factorial analysis, the multi-level factorial analysis is capable of studying the effects of independent variables (factors) with multiple levels on a dependent variable (response). It is particularly useful when there is a curvilinear relationship between the design factors and the response variable. The multi-level factorial design that consists of k factors with each having s (s > 2) levels has a sample size of sk
                        . The most important case of the multi-level factorial design is the 3
                           k
                         factorial design that involves k factors with each at three levels. The three levels of factors are represented as low, medium, and high; they are often denoted by −1, 0, and +1, respectively. For illustrative purposes, Table 1
                         shows a 32 factorial design that consists of factors A and B with each having three levels. Such a design requires 9 model runs for assessing the main and joint effects of two factors. Once results are obtained under 9 treatment combinations, the main and joint effects of factors A and B can then be computed by:

                         represents the model output under the ith treatment combination, and i = 1, 2, …, 9. The three-level factorial experiment is straightforward to implement; however, the computational cost will increase exponentially with the number of dimensions, posing a considerable challenge to large-scale stochastic optimization problems.

To address the probabilistic objective function and chance constraints as well as their interactions, a risk-based factorial probabilistic inference method is proposed through merging the strengths of two-stage stochastic programming with chance constraints, fractile criterion optimization technique, and multi-level factorial analysis. The risk-based probabilistic optimization model can be formulated as:

                        where 
                        c(ω), d(ω), and b(ω) are Gaussian random vectors defined on a probability space Ω, ω ∈ Ω; α and β denote the levels of probability for violating the constraints and satisfying the objective function, respectively. The levels of α and β are determined by decision makers based on their preferences towards risks related to the objective function and constraints. Thus, α and β are chosen as the investigated factors with each having discrete levels (three levels in this study). The multi-level factorial analysis can then be conducted to reveal the statistical significance of these factors and their interactions, as well as to quantify their contributions to the variability of the model output.

A framework of the proposed risk-based factorial probabilistic inference method is provided in Fig. 1. The steps that involved in the implementation of the proposed methodology can be summarized as follows: (1) formulation of the risk-based probabilistic optimization model; (2) acquisition of model parameters expressed as normally distributed random variables; (3) linearization of the probabilistic optimization model; (4) specification of design factors with each having discrete levels of interest; (5) construction of the multi-level factorial design; (6) execution of the factorial experiment through running the probabilistic optimization model; (7) generation of experimental results; (8) analysis of the statistical significance of investigated factors and their correlations; (9) detection of dominant factors and potential interactions between factors; and (10) identification of sound decision schemes.

A flood control system is composed of multiple interconnected components related to various socioeconomic and environmental concerns. For instance, a flood control system may involve several flood diversion regions for flood mitigation. These regions are interrelated to each other. Any changes (e.g., floodplain expansions) in one region would result in a series of consequences to the others. Such interrelationships may lead to various complexities such as uncertainties in parameters and their relations, as well as multi-region, multi-flood-level, and multi-option features.

Deterministic information about model parameters is often unavailable in many real-world problems. Thus rough estimates have to be made by decision makers or stakeholders. In a flood control system, inherent uncertainties exist in various factors related to socio-economic conditions, flood characteristics, and geographical conditions. They have to be addressed through uncertainty analysis methods. A typical example is capital costs of expansion in floodplains. Their values can hardly be known with certainty, and are often expressed as probability distributions generated from a large sample of expansion costs. This necessitates advanced methodologies for dealing with random uncertainties.

The complexities are further intensified due to potential interactions among multiple uncertainties. For instance, a number of uncertain parameters can be described in the format of probability distributions. These random parameters are correlated with each other, and their interactions may have significant effects on system performance. A flood control system should also be able to reflect potential interactions between various system objectives and constraints related to flood mitigation costs, flood diversion capacities, and capacity expansion options. It is thus essential to analyze interactive uncertainties, and to reveal valuable information hidden beneath these interactions.

In general, a flood control system is subject to effects of extensive complexities, particularly in terms of the existence of multiple uncertainties and their interdependences, as well as multi-region and dynamic features. It is thus indispensable to develop advanced modeling methodologies for dealing with such complexities.

The following flood control problem will be used to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed methodology. Consider a watershed system wherein floodwater needs to be diverted from a river channel to three flood diversion regions (i.e. flood retention areas) during a flood season. The river has a limited water conveyance capacity and may overflow when a flood occurs. According to the local flood management policy, a flood warning level of the river should be determined and several projected flood diversion regions should be assigned. If the water level in the river exceeds the warning level, water will be diverted to adjacent floodplains.

A flood control system should contain a specification of allowable levels of flood diversions and a decision scheme for efficiently utilizing flood diversion capacities. Developing effective policies for diverting flood under limited diversion capacities is critical for minimizing flooding to densely populated communities and industries located in the lower reach. Thus, an allowable flood diversion level can be predetermined according to the existing diversion capacity of each floodplain. If this allowance is not exceeded, a regular cost will be applied to flood diversion; otherwise, it will result in a surplus flood diversion along with economic penalties and/or expansion costs. Penalties can be expressed in terms of raised operating costs for flood diversion and/or destruction of land-based infrastructure. Expansions of floodplains will help increase the allowable flood diversion capacities and thus reduce the penalties. The total amount of flood diversion will be the sum of the allowable flood diversion level, the incremental quota, and the probabilistic excess flow. Consequently, it is desired to identify sound decision schemes for flood diversion and capacity expansion of floodplains.


                        Table 2 shows the existing diversion capacities, the capacity expansion options, and the related economic data for three floodplains. According to the flood management policy, regions 1 and 2 can be expanded once by any of the given expansion options, but no expansion is undertaken for region 3 due to intensive human activities within this region.

                         and 4
                         present the maximum diversion capacities for three floodplains under different risk levels and the flow levels with different probabilities of occurrence, respectively. To address random uncertainties and their interactions, the proposed methodology is considered to be an effective means for dealing with the stochastic optimization problem.

The flood control problem under consideration can be formulated as the following risk-based probabilistic optimization model:

In model (27), the objective function is to minimize the total system cost through flood diversion and capacity expansion of floodplains when a flood occurs. Constraint (27c) indicates that the amount of allowable flood diversion should not exceed the existing diversion capacity for each region; constraint (27d) represents the probability of the total amount of allowable and excess flood diversion being less than or equal to the existing maximum diversion capacity should be higher than a predefined value; constraint (27e) requires that the increased allowance to each region should not exceed its expanded capacity; constraint (27f) indicates the probability of the total flood flow diverted being less than or equal to the total diversion capacity should be higher than a predefined value; constraint (27g) implies that the total flood flow should be fully diverted to different regions; constraints (27h)–(27j) specify that all decision variables should be nonnegative; constraint (27k) presents binary decision variables for capacity expansion; and constraint (27l) indicates that the diversion capacity of each region can be expanded only once under each flow level.

In the optimization model for the planning of flood control systems, randomness exists in both the objective function and constraints. To address such a complexity, the stochastic objective function and constraints can be transformed into their respective deterministic equivalents with probabilistic information assuming that random variables follow normal distributions. Thus, a number of decision alternatives can be obtained under different probabilities that the objective function is satisfied and that the maximum flood diversion capacity constraints are violated, facilitating an in-depth analysis of tradeoffs between total system costs and associated risks. Table 5 shows the risk factors involved in the probabilistic optimization model, with each having three probability levels; they are denoted by β, α
                           1, α
                           2, and α
                           3. A change in factor β can cause a variation in the value of the objective function, while factors α
                           1, α
                           2, and α
                           3 that represent the probabilities of constraint violation may result in the infeasibility of the solution. All combinations of these factors with each at three levels were taken into account in this study to identify a desired compromise between economic outcomes and potential risks, which required 81 model runs. Fig. 2
                            presents the results obtained from the probabilistic optimization model under 81 scenarios. From the economic point of view, Table 6
                            shows optimal solutions with the minimized total cost of $2817.87 × 106 when the objective function is satisfied with a probability of 0.90 and the maximum flood diversion capacity constraints for regions 1–3 are violated with probabilities of 0.01, 0.10, and 0.10, respectively. The total system cost consists of the regular cost for allowable diversion, the penalty for excess diversion, and the capital cost for capacity expansion.

In flood control systems, floodplains can be expanded to convey and store excess floodwater after reaching its maximum capacity. The planning of capacity expansion can lead to a significant reduction in economic losses caused by severe floods. Fig. 3
                            presents the solutions of capacity expansion in order to obtain the minimized total cost. The results indicate that region 1 would be expanded with an incremental capacity of 3.50 × 106 cubic meter under medium-high and high flow levels, respectively. Region 2 would be expanded with an increment of 6.00 × 106 cubic meter under a high flow level. Expansions of regions 1 and 2 would lead to an increased flood conveyance capacity. In comparison, the capacity of flood diversion in region 3 would not be increased because no expansion plan is considered.


                           Fig. 4
                            shows the flood diversion patterns for three regions under different flow levels. Generally, the allowable flow is predetermined according to the existing flood diversion capacity, the increased allowance is related to the expanded capacity, and the excess flow is confined by the maximum capacity. When a flood event occurs, the allowable flows would be first diverted to the assigned regions. If the remaining floodwater in the river still exceeds the flood warning level, the flood flow would continue to spill over the river banks to adjacent regions, leading to excess flows and/or increased allowance. Therefore, the total diverted flow is a sum of the allowable flow, the incremental quota, and the probabilistic excess flow.

As shown in Fig. 4, the allowable flow diverted to region 1 would be 2.50 × 106 cubic meter. Region 1 would be expanded with an increment of 3.50 × 106 cubic meter under medium-high and high flow levels. There would be an excess flow of 0.02 × 106 cubic meter when the flow level is medium-high with a probability of 20%. For region 2, the allowable flow would be 3.50 × 106 cubic meter. Region 2 would be expanded with an increased capacity of 6.00 × 106 cubic meter only when the flow level is high with a probability of 10%. Thus, there would be much more surplus flows diverted to region 2 compared with those to region 1. This is because the capital cost of expansion for region 2 is higher than that for region 1; meanwhile, region 2 has the lower penalty cost for excess diversion. For region 3, the allowable flow would be 3.00 × 106 cubic meter. No expansion would be carried out for this region. The excess flows diverted to region 3 would be 1.26 × 106 cubic meter under the medium flow level, 3.24 × 106 cubic meter under the medium-high flow level, and 2.76 × 106 cubic meter under the high flow level. Generally, in the case of flood events, the excess flow would firstly be diverted to region 2, secondly to region 3, and lastly to region 1. This is because region 2 is subject to the largest expansion capacity and the lowest penalty for excess flow diversion. In comparison, region 1 is confined by the highest penalty for excess diversion, resulting in the smallest proportion of excess flows being diverted to region 1.

To explore latent interactions between the probabilistic objective function and chance constraints, a multi-level factorial analysis was also conducted to derive statistical estimates of the most sensitive risk factors and their interactions, providing quantitative information on the degree of complexity of the model input–output relationships. To perform the factorial analysis, risk factors of β, α
                           1, α
                           2, and α
                           3 were denoted by A–D, respectively. Based on the results obtained from the probabilistic optimization model under 81 combinations of factor levels, the three-level factorial analysis was thus conducted to assess the contributions of risk factors to the variability of the model output.


                           Fig. 5 presents the Pareto chart of standardized effects. The Pareto chart is a powerful tool for visualizing the main and joint effects of all factors on the model response. The rank is displayed by bars in the descending order, and factors that extend beyond the red line on the Pareto chart have statistically significant effects on the model output. The linear and quadratic main effects of factors A, C, and D as well as the A × C and A × D interaction effects are thus significant in this case, while the others have little influence on the response. Linear main effects represent the difference between the low and high levels for the respective factor, and quadratic main effects represent the difference between the respective medium level and the average of the low and high levels. The effect estimate for the interaction between two factors can be interpreted as half the difference between the linear effect of one factor at the low and high levels of the other factor. Among all the factors, factor A has the largest contribution to the output variability. This is because factor A represents the probability that the objective function is satisfied, which is directly related to the model output. Any change in the probability of satisfying the objective function would cause a considerable variation in the total system cost. The most significant interaction is between A and C, implying that the A × C interaction has a dramatic effect on the model response.


                           Fig. 6(
                           a) presents the main effects plot for the four factors. It helps to visualize the effects of the factors on the response and to compare the relative magnitude of the effects. This plot reveals that the response mean does not change depending on the levels of factor B because the line is horizontal (parallel to the x-axis), indicating that the constraint-violation risk for region 1 has little effect on the total system cost. Factor A has the largest main effect on the total system cost that would increase from $2820.61 × 106 to $2831.58 × 106 and then to $2852.16 × 106 across low, medium, and high levels of factor A, implying that there would be a potential trade-off between the total system cost and the objective-violation risk. In comparison, factors C and D have relatively small contributions to the variability of the total system cost.


                           Fig. 6(b) shows the fitted response surface with contour plot for the A × C interaction, which uncovers a second-order (quadratic) effect on the total system cost. This 3D surface reveals a strong upward bend toward the upper-right corner, indicating that the total system cost rises while simultaneously increasing the probability of satisfying the objective function and reducing the risk levels of constraint violation for region 2. The contour plot under the fitted response represents, in two dimensions, the functional relationship between the total system cost and the A × C interaction. It shows that the total system cost declines when moving from the upper right to the lower left corner of the plot, suggesting that the minimized total cost would be obtained with a low probability level of objective satisfaction and a high risk level of constraint violation for region 2.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The flood control problem was also solved through the well-known fractile criterion optimization model (Kataoka, 1963) and the chance-constrained programming technique (Charnes & Cooper, 1959), respectively. The fractile criterion optimization model or Kataoka's model is able to deal with the probabilistic objective function that needs to be satisfied with a given probability. Fig. 7(
                     a) presents a comparison of total system costs under different probabilities that the objective function is satisfied. The results indicate that the total systems costs would rise from $2828.33 to $2859.04 × 106 when the probability values increase from 0.90 to 0.99, implying a potential trade-off between the economic objective and the associated risk level. The expected value and the standard deviation of the probabilistic objective function are $2790.65 and $29.4 × 106, respectively.

The chance-constrained programming method can be used to tackle stochastic constraints with a prescribed level of risk tolerance in the decision-making process. Fig. 7(b) shows the total system costs under different risk levels of violating the constraints related to the maximum flood diversion capacity. As the risk of constraint violation rises, the total costs would correspondingly decrease. The minimum system cost of $2958.98 × 106 would thus be obtained with a maximum risk level of 0.10. The expected value and the standard deviation of the total system cost are $2920.90 and $29.7 × 106, respectively.

When dealing with probabilistic uncertainties, the fractile criterion optimization model and the chance-constrained programming method take into account the risks related to the objective function and constraints, respectively. In many practical problems, however, probabilistic objective function and constraints often coexist within an optimization framework, and they are correlated with each other. It is thus necessary to consider the risks associated with the objective function and constraints simultaneously, as well as to explore the potential interactions between these risks and their contributions to the variability of the model output.


                     Fig. 7(c) presents a comparison of total system costs under different risk levels associated with both the objective function and the maximum flood diversion capacity constraints. The results reveal that the total system cost with an expected value of $2778.83 × 106 and a standard deviation of $30.4 × 106 would decrease with a gradually increasing risk level, and the minimum total cost of $2817.87 × 106 would be obtained under the probability of 0.10. According to the factorial analysis, factor B that represents the constraint-violation risk for region 1 has little influence on the total system cost. Thus, the minimized total cost is insensitive to the variation in the probability of violating the maximum flood diversion capacity constraint for region 1.

In this study, the proposed methodology is capable of addressing probabilistic objective function, constraints, and their interactions simultaneously. It provides a number of decision alternatives under different risk levels prescribed by decision makers based on their preferences. For example, decision makers may be risk averse or risk prone depending on practical situations. Moreover, tests for statistical significance can be conducted to uncover interactions between the probabilistic objective function and constraints as well as their effects on the resulting solutions. The interaction detection is helpful for decision makers to explore valuable information hidden beneath the interrelationships of main components in an optimization framework, facilitating informed decision making. Dynamic complexities can also be addressed through a two-stage decision process and through capacity expansion planning for flood diversion within a multi-region, multi-flood-level, and multi-option context.

The proposal methodology is based on an assumption that all random variables are independent, and normally distributed with known means and variances. However, non-Gaussian random variables may exist in real-world problems. Future studies would thus be undertaken to transform the stochastic objective and constraints into the deterministic equivalence when random variables follow non-normal distributions. Besides, the factorial experiment was performed without replication in this study. To tackle the unreplicated factorial experiment with no “noise” or variability, the internal estimate of error can be achieved by pooling high-order interactions based on an assumption associated with the following sparsity-of-effects principle: a system is often dominated by main effects and two-factor interactions, and interactions involving three or more factors are rare and can thus be neglected (Montgomery, 2000).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this study, a risk-based factorial probabilistic inference method has been proposed to address the probabilistic objective function and chance constraints as well as their interactions in a systematic manner. To tackle random uncertainties, risks associated with the objective function and constraints were taken into account in the decision-making process. Statistical significance for each of the linear, nonlinear, and interaction effects of risk parameters was uncovered through performing a multi-level factorial analysis.

The proposed methodology was applied to a case study of flood control to demonstrate its applicability. A number of decision alternatives were obtained under various combinations of risk levels associated with the objective function and chance constraints, facilitating an in-depth analysis of trade-offs between economic outcomes and associated risks. These alternatives were helpful for decision makers to identify a desired flood control scheme based on their risk preferences. Multivariate inference was conducted by carrying out the factorial experiment. The results revealed the importance of risk parameters, as well as quantified their linear, quadratic, and interaction effects on the total system cost.

Compared with the well-known fractile criterion optimization model and the chance-constrained programming technique, the risk-based factorial probabilistic inference method had advantages of allowing for the simultaneous consideration of the probabilistic objective function and chance constraints associated with different risk levels, as well as of revealing parametric interactions and their contributions to the variability of the total system cost. The multi-level factorial analysis was useful for decision makers to explore valuable information hidden beneath the interrelationships of risk parameters, facilitating informed decision making. Dynamic complexities were also addressed through a two-stage decision process as well as through capacity expansion planning for flood diversion within a multi-region, multi-flood-level, and multi-option context. The proposed methodology is not restricted to the flood control problem considered in this study. It is also applicable to other stochastic optimization problems.
