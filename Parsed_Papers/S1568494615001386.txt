                  In modern manufacturing industry, developing automated tool condition monitoring system become more and more import in order to transform manufacturing systems from manually operated production machines to highly automated machining centres. This paper presents a nouvelle cutting tool wear assessment in high precision turning process using type-2 fuzzy uncertainty estimation on acoustic Emission. Without understanding the exact physics of the machining process, type-2 fuzzy logic system identifies acoustic emission signal during the process and its interval set of output assesses the uncertainty information in the signal. The experimental study shows that the development trend of uncertainty in acoustic emission signal corresponds to that of cutting tool wear. The estimation of uncertainties can be used for proving the conformance with specifications for products or auto-controlling of machine system, which has great meaning for continuously improvement in product quality, reliability and manufacturing efficiency in machining industry.
