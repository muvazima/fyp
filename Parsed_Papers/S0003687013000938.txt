                  Research has shown that sustained attention or vigilance declines over time on task. Sustained attention is necessary in many environments such as air traffic controllers, cyber operators, and imagery analysts. A lapse of attention in any one of these environments can have harmful consequences. The purpose of this study was to determine if eye blink metrics from an eye-tracker are related to changes in vigilance performance and cerebral blood flow velocities. Nineteen participants performed a vigilance task while wearing an eye-tracker on four separate days. Blink frequency and duration changed significantly over time during the task. Both blink frequency and duration increased as performance declined and right cerebral blood flow velocity declined. These results suggest that eye blink information may be an indicator of arousal levels. Using an eye-tracker to detect changes in eye blinks in an operational environment would allow preventative measures to be implemented, perhaps by providing perceptual warning signals or augmenting human cognition through non-invasive brain stimulation techniques.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Sustained attention is an important aspect of several professions involving public safety. Air traffic controllers, cyber operators, unmanned aerial systems operators, TSA inspectors, and satellite imagery analysts (among many other professions) can encounter lapses in sustained attention, possibly due to the monotonous and sometimes boring nature of these positions (Frankmann and Adams, 1962; Nachreiner and Hanecke, 1992). Alarmingly, lapses in attention in one of these environments can have severe or even deadly consequences (Hawley, 2006). To combat this issue, we investigated a device that might be useful for monitoring operator sustained attention or vigilance. Currently, there is no tool that can directly measure operator performance or cognitive state in these environments, and any lapse is typically only noticed after a mistake is made. In addition, there are currently no automated systems that can do the tasks associated with these positions as well as human operators. Therefore, it could be extremely beneficial to find a device that can effectively monitor vigilance performance in real-time within an operational environment.

Laboratory vigilance tasks have been extensively studied and show that during a task, operator performance tends to degrade over time, a phenomenon known as the “vigilance decrement” (Hitchcock et al., 2003). Vigilance tasks investigate the lapses of attention in these environments by examining the increasing number of critical signals missed over time (the decrement). This performance decrement has been repeatedly associated with decreased blood flow velocity in the right hemisphere (Hitchcock et al., 2003; Warm et al., 2009; Hollander et al., 2002; Schnittger et al., 1997). Deutsch et al. (1987) retrospectively examined 121 studies and found significant hemispheric differences for cerebral blood flow velocity in frontal regions, further indicating that the right hemisphere plays a role in attention and vigilance, especially in the most demanding sustained attention tasks. The theory as to why this occurs is that the right frontal cortex is involved with the sustained deployment of attention, and that decreases in cortical activity (resulting in performance lapses) are simultaneously associated with decreases in metabolic activity in these brain regions, thus performance decreases covary with decreases in right cerebral arterial blood flow velocities (Hitchcock et al., 2003; Warm et al., 2009; Hollander et al., 2002).

Blood flow velocity can be successfully monitored in real-time by a transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography. This is a non-invasive technique to monitor cerebral blood flow velocities in the middle, anterior, and posterior intracranial arteries by using ultrasound signals (Warm et al., 2009). Unfortunately, the TCD procedure has several major drawbacks that make it extremely difficult to use in many operational settings, except for medical settings. For example, the TCD cannot track blood flow for all ages and races, the signal can be too noisy if not in a quiet environment with little movement from the participant, and participants complain that the device is uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time (Knecht et al., 1998). Therefore, finding an alternative biofeedback device that can monitor operator vigilance in an operational setting is of interest.

To combat the drawbacks of the TCD procedure and to find a possible alternative biofeedback tool for vigilance tasks, we investigated the use of a portable and wearable eye-tracking device. Oculometric information from eye-trackers has been used in numerous studies that have observed oculomotor behavior changes that correlated to changes in visual task performance (e.g., Matessa, 2004; Salvucci, 2000; McIntire et al., 2011). Previous research indicates that these oculomotor changes occurred while participants performed a visual attention task similar to ours (Tsai et al., 2007). Specifically, Tsai et al. (2007) found that eye blink data (such as blink frequency and duration) corresponded with task performance, and they concluded that the changes in the blink metrics were due to operator workload and fatigue induced by the task. Van Orden et al. (2001) also found that eye blink frequency and duration strongly correlated with performance on a visual tracking task and the changes in blink behavior were again attributed to increasing levels of fatigue during the task. In fact Stern et al. (1994) concluded after an extensive review of the literature that blink rate metrics are a robust measure of time on task-induced fatigue. Similarly, Hardee et al. (1986) and Dingus et al. (1987) developed a method called PERCLOS (percent of eye closure), which is derived from eye blink metrics, to detect drowsiness levels in drivers. Other research expanded the use of PERCLOS to detect changes in cognitive workload and not just during fatigue (Kawashima et al., 1995; Marshall, 2007). Therefore, we hypothesize that eye blink metrics will be correlated with changes in performance during our vigilance task.

In our study we will use a wearable eye-tracking system that could be easily implemented into an operational environment. This particular wearable system may be beneficial compared to other on and off body eye-trackers because it requires very little if any calibration adjustments, which also lends itself to easily be instrumented by the user himself instead of with assistance (Nevalainen and Sajaniemi, 2004). The tracker also has no difficulty tracking different colors of pupils that is commonly found in other systems (Smith et al., 2000). Also, compared to other passive trackers, this tracking system allows users to get up and move around freely (Nevalainen and Sajaniemi, 2004), which may be another necessary feature for use in an operational environment. The wearable eye-tracker is also not physiologically invasive like some coil systems that must be placed in the eye and can only be worn for very short periods of time (Houben et al., 2006; Nevalainen and Sajaniemi, 2004). Thus, the tracker used in this study is not as invasive as many other eye-tracking systems and conceivably can be worn comfortably for substantially longer periods of time.

Our study will also compare the oculometrics of blink frequency and duration with that of the TCD device in terms of its ability to correspond to changes in vigilance performance. We hypothesize that if oculometrics can detect changes in vigilance performance, they should also correlate with changes in blood flow velocity because changes in blood flow velocity have been repeatedly associated with performance. Finding eye blink parameters like frequency and duration that correlate with vigilance performance using this wearable eye-tracking system could be the next step in allowing biofeedback information of operator attention to be implemented into operational settings. A device that monitors operator attention and cues, alerts, or otherwise assists the operators in their duties could lead to decreases in errors and accidents, and increases in public safety in these environments.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

A total of 19 civilian and active duty military personnel (16 males, 3 females) aged 19–41 years with a mean age of 26.89 years volunteered to participate in this experiment. Participants received $10/h of compensation for their time and travel. They were required to have normal utilization of both arms and legs and were excluded if they required eyeglasses for vision correction because the eye-tracker used in this study could not be worn with eyeglasses. However, people using contact lenses for vision correction were permitted to participate.

Each participant was required to wear the Eye-Com (Reno, NV) alertness monitoring device during the vigilance task. The device consisted of two infrared (IR)-sensitive cameras and a linear array of IR-illuminating light emitting diodes (LEDs) mounted on a set of eyeglass frames. The wavelength of the LEDs was 840 nm. The cameras were angled upward toward the eyes and extracted real-time pupil diameter, eyelid movement, and eye-ball movement. The sampling frequency of the device was 30 frames per second. The tracker monitored blink frequency and duration by tracking the occlusion of the pupil by the eyelid. When 85% of the pupil was occluded by the eyelid the eyes were considered closed for a particular frame. To be considered a “blink” for our analysis the pupil had to be occluded for 3 frames because median blink rates for alert individuals usually fall between 130 and 170 ms (Schleicher et al., 2008). If there were less than 3 frames in a row that indicated the eyes were closed it was just considered a bad data point caused by the tracker losing the pupil momentarily.

The Sonara/tek (Conshohocken, PA) transcranial Doppler (TCD) unit was used to measure blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral arteries in both left and right hemispheres for each participant. The Sonara device uses ultrasound waves to measure blood flow velocity. The Sonara system included an integrated 15″ touch screen color LCD display, integrated PC board, and hard disk for data management and display. The 4 MHz ultrasound probe frequency was selected for this experiment. The ultrasound probes were attached to a helmet and placed on the left and right side of the head at the participants' temporal window. The update rate for this system was 1.1013 Hz.

Participants performed a static simulated air traffic control task in which they monitored four jet fighters on a circular path divided into four quadrants, described by Funke et al. (2009). Each quadrant contained a triangular jet icon. The icons were presented randomly pointing either clockwise or counterclockwise along a circular “flight path.” The stimuli were presented on a standard desktop visual display from a comfortable viewing distance (approximately 1.5 feet) while the participant was seated in a non-adjustable computer chair.

The participant was required to look for critical signals, which were cases in which one of the jets was pointing in a conflicting direction with the others; so they appeared to be on a collision course. When presented with a critical signal, the participants were to indicate this by pressing the space bar on a computer keyboard. The stimulus was displayed for 1000 ms. Performance efficiency was assessed in terms of the percentage of correct signals detected (percent hits). This variable was averaged every 10 min over the continuous 40-min period. Averaging over 10-min epochs was conducted because the critical signals were designed to appear at random from one trial to the next, but at a specific rate within 10-min segments of trials (five percent of the trials within a 10-min epoch contained a critical signal).

It is important to note that laboratory vigilance tasks are very sensitive. Therefore, certain precautions must be taken to ensure the integrity of the data and to ensure tight control over any environmental stimuli that might unduly alter attention and possibly their performance. Participants were in a room isolated from any noise and participants were required to wear earplugs. Light levels were maintained to be consistent throughout the experiment (normal overhead office lighting) and glare from the lights onto the task screen was minimized as much as possible. Participants were kept away from any possible distractions including a view of the experimenters (separated with a half-wall), a clock or watch, or their cell phone. The experimenters were able to see the participant and what they were doing through the outward-facing nose camera of the eye-tracker, but the participant was not able to see the experimenters.

No study-specific procedures were performed without a written and signed informed consent. The rights of our participants were protected and they were treated in accordance with the institutional guidelines and in ethical accord with relevant professional standards. After the participants were consented and registered into the study, they received a verbal briefing and PowerPoint presentation that described the vigilance task followed by two 5-min practice sessions. After the practice sessions, the participant was instrumented with the eye-tracker, TCD, and earplugs and required to complete the first 40-min vigilance task session. Participants were asked to refrain from talking and making excessive movements as described by Tripp and Warm (2007). Afterwards, participants continued their normal duties for the day. For each of the next 3 data collection sessions, which occurred on different days with at least 24 h between sessions, the participants received the same instrumentation and completed the 40-min task but were not required to complete the training again. We ran participants the same time of day for all sessions when possible and all sessions were conducted during normal business hours. During the task, the participants' eye blinks were measured by the eye-tracker.

Upon completion of testing, eye blink frequency and duration, blood flow velocity, and vigilance task metrics were averaged in 10-min increments (10, 20, 30, 40 min) per individual and per session and used as dependent variables in univariate repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Factors were Day (1–4) and Time (10, 20, 30, 40 min). Statistical significance tests were based on an alpha level of 0.05. Some of the participants elected not to complete all 4 data collection sessions (days) and some of the TCD data on various days was too noisy and not usable due to poor signal strength. As a result, a participant's data was not included in analysis unless there were at least three sessions (days) of usable data. Proc Mixed in SAS was used to perform the repeated-measures ANOVAs. Satterthwaite-type degrees of freedom were used for all F-tests (SAS Version 9.2). To adjust for missing data Least squares means (LSMeans) were used since there were some instances where the TCD lost the signal once data collection was underway.

Next, each participant's days were categorized as either a Decrement or No Decrement day depending on the percent hits performance. If the linear best-fit slope on a participant's percent hits across the four temporal epochs on a given day was negative (i.e., performance decreased over time on task), the data day was considered as a Decrement. Days with positive slopes or zero ± 0.1 slopes (i.e., no performance decrease over time on task) were considered a No Decrement day. For each participant, variables were averaged across days at each time point, separately for Decrement and No Decrement days. Pearson partial correlations controlling for subject (same as ANOCOV with subject as a factor) were performed (separately for Decrement and No Decrement days) to relate percent hits performance and right and left cerebral blood flow velocities with the eye blink metrics.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Results are segregated into the two types of analysis. First, we present the results for the day and time ANOVAs. Next, we present the results of the correlations for eye blink duration and frequency in relation to percent hits and cerebral blood flow velocity, comparing the Decrement and No Decrement groups.

ANOVAs were used to compare the Day of testing and the Time on Task within each session, for each dependent variable. Table 1
                         shows percent hits, right and left cerebral blood flow velocity, right and left blink frequency, and right and left blink durations with the repeated-measures ANOVA results of factors Day (1, 2, 3, 4) and Time (10, 20, 30, 40 min). Significant F-tests have p-value cells grayed. All ANOVAs used 16 participants. Table 2
                         shows the LSMeans for the ANOVAs.

The Day of data collection had a significant main effect only for left and right blink duration. Left blink duration and right blink duration was shorter for Day 1 than for the other days. Specifically, blink durations in the left eye increased by 10% between Day 1 and Day 4 and increased by 11% in the right eye over the same time frame.

Time on task had a significant effect on all dependent variables. There was a main effect of Time on the percent hits (Fig. 1
                        ). For percent hits, the LSMean was 86% (SEM = 4%) averaged across days for the first 10 min of the task and 75% (SEM = 4%) for the final 10 min.

Left and right blood flow velocity decreased significantly with time on task (Fig. 2
                        ). The left hemisphere had and LSMean of 46.9 mL/min (SEM = 2.3 mL/min) across the four days for the first 10 min of the task and 44.9 mL/min (SEM = 2.3 mL/min) for the last 10 min. The LSMean for the right hemisphere was 46 mL/min (SEM = 2 mL/min) across the four days for the first 10 min of the experiment and 44 mL/min (SEM = 2 mL/min) for the last 10 min of the experiment. This equates to a 5% decrease in blood flow velocity for both the left and right hemispheres.

Left eye and right eye blink frequency increased as the task progressed (Fig. 3
                        ). The LSMean for the first 10 min of the task was 16 blinks per minute (bpm) (SEM = 2 bpm) for the left eye and 14 bpm (SEM = 2 bpm) for the right eye. The LSMean for the final 10 min of the task was 19 bpm (SEM = 2 bpm) for the left eye and 18 bpm (SEM = 2 bpm) for the right eye. This equates to a 19% increase in blinking rate for the left eye and a 29% increase in blinking rate for the right eye over the 40 min of the task. As the time on task progressed, left and right eye blink duration also significantly increased (Fig. 4
                        ). The LSMean for the left eye changed by 24 ms from the first 10 min of the task to the last 10 min, from 226 ms (SEM = 10 ms) to 250 ms (SEM = 10 ms). The right eye changed from 224 ms (SEM = 10 ms) in the first 10 min to 247 ms (SEM = 10 ms) in the final 10 min. This finding represents a 10% increase in blink duration over the 40-min task in the right eye and 11% in the left eye.

Finally, we also found an interaction effect for Day and Time that was statistically significant for right blood flow velocity (Table 1).

Pearson partial correlations controlling for subject were performed (separately for Decrement and No Decrement days) to relate percent hits (Table 3
                        ) and right (Table 4
                        ) and left (Table 5
                        ) cerebral blood flow velocities with right and left eye blink frequency and duration (significant correlations have the cells of their associated p-values grayed). Fig. 5
                         through 9
                        
                        
                        
                         displays the significant partial correlations. If either the Decrement or No Decrement group's correlation was significant for a given variable, the corresponding correlation is displayed for comparison.

In the No Decrement group, neither blood flow velocity, nor the eye blink measures of frequency or duration, correlated with performance (Table 3, right two data columns). In the Decrement group, right blood flow velocity and eye blink measures significantly correlated with percent hits (Table 3, left two data columns).

Right cerebral blood flow velocity positively correlated with percent hits (Tables 3 and 4). Blood flow velocity in the right hemisphere was observed to decline in a similar manner to the percent hits performance metric in the Decrement group (Fig. 5). This effect was not found for the left cerebral blood flow velocity.

Several of the eye blink metrics negatively correlated with percent hits but only in the Decrement group (Table 3). Right eye blink frequency (Fig. 6) negatively correlated with percent hits, again only for the Decrement group. Left eye blink frequency did not correlate with percent hits for either group.

Next, right and left eye blink duration correlated negatively with percent hits (Fig. 7) in the Decrement group only. In other words, as percentage of hits decreased on the task, the blink duration for both eyes increased.

The eye metrics of blink frequency and blink duration have significant negative correlations with right cerebral blood flow velocity (Figs. 8 and 9; also Table 4). In both the Decrement and No Decrement groups, blink frequency and duration have a significant negative relationship with right blood flow velocity, and this was true for both eyes. We observed decreases in right blood flow velocity across time that was coupled with an increase in blink duration and blink frequency.

Left cerebral blood flow velocities were not significantly correlated with any of the metrics in the Decrement group (Table 5). However, the correlations of left and right blink frequency and left blink duration were significant in the No Decrement group. Specifically, blink frequency increased in the No Decrement group as lCBFV decreased (Fig. 10
                        ). Blink duration in the left eye also increased as lCBFV decreased over time (Fig. 11
                        ).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Given the sometimes monotonous environment found in the jobs of air traffic controllers, cyber operators, TSA inspectors, unmanned aerial systems operators, and imagery analysts, finding a method to monitor the sustained attention of these individuals could be beneficial for reducing mishaps. One possible method lies in monitoring vigilance through an eye-tracking system. Employing a system that gives real-time oculometric feedback would allow preventative measures to be implemented when certain metrics reach a particular level that are likely to indicate vigilance lapses or subsequent performance decrements. The data suggests that information about individuals' eye blinks could be useful for monitoring vigilance.

Our results indicate that the specific metrics of blink frequency and duration could be indicators of vigilance performance. In fact, the results from blink frequency for one eye and blink duration for both eyes suggested that as performance declined, participants blinked more often, and the blinks were held for a longer period of time, presumably leading to more missed critical signals (either due to the eyelids literally being closed longer and missing the stimulus signals, or simply attentional lapses; or some combination of the two). Consistent with our findings, a previous vigilance study observed an increase of blink frequency as a function of time on task (Carpenter, 1984). Carpenter (1984) found an overall increase in blink rate of 43% over the course of the 2-h vigilance task (note that we found a roughly comparable 29% increase in right eye blink rates over a 40-min vigilance task). Also, Caffier et al. (2003) found that participants in their drowsy condition had an increase in blink duration compared to participants in their alert condition while staring for 20 min at a static picture. Similarly, Brookings et al. (1996) found that when their participants were concentrating, paying attention, and working hard on high-workload tasks their blink rates declined, but when workload levels decreased their blink rates were observed to increase. Finally, increased blink frequency and duration have been found in relationship to the vigilance decrement (Funke, 2011; Morris and Miller, 1996; Schroeder and Holland, 1968). Our findings confirm this previous work and suggest that blink rates are related to performance on sustained attention tasks. We also have similar findings to Van Orden et al. (2000) who found changes in blink duration and frequency correlates with changes in performance. The interesting part of this finding is that Van Orden et al. (2000) used a continuous activity vigilance task. This differs from our task because participants do not just sit passively and wait for something that might happen but, instead something is always happening that requires sustained attention even though it is a simple and boring task. These similar conclusions from a discrete event task (our study) versus a near continuous task (Van Orden et al., 2000) could indicate that blink frequency and duration are important measures to monitor in tasks requiring sustained attention.

Increases in blink frequency and duration are not only found during boring tasks similar to our vigilance task; this effect is also is similar to findings from the fatigue literature (Morris and Miller, 1996; Sirevaag and Stern, 2000). Clinical sleep deprivation research has found that significant deprivation leads to increases in eye blink frequency; researchers believe this may be due to the patients attempting to maintain wakefulness through increased oculomotor activity (Gray et al., 1995). These researchers also found that loss of attention without sleep deprivation caused an increase in blink rate, which could be more reflective of our findings (i.e., blink rate increases indicate lapses in attention, not strictly levels of sleep-related fatigue). If this theory is true, it is certainly possible that our participants blink more frequently during a boring task in an attempt to maintain alertness. In fact, some believe that eye blinks may provide useful information about overall central nervous system activation and fatigue levels (e.g., Sirevaag and Stern, 2000).

It is interesting to note that we only found the increase in blink frequency for the right eye. We still believe that an increase in blink rate may indicate that there is a higher tendency to miss critical signals even though this is only supported by data in the right eye. While we can offer no definitive interpretation of this finding that one eye appears to offer useful blink rate information over another, this may reflect asymmetries in facial motor nuclei and the associated motor neurons resulting in differences in blink initiation timing and magnitude of closure Interestingly, such ocular-related asymmetries appear to be unrelated to and independent of other motor, sensory, functional, and/or biological asymmetries of which the most well-known is handedness (Kassem and Evinger, 2006). While this explanation likely only applies to a few participants it is much more likely that there was some data misreads by the tracker causing the differences. Our particular eye-tracker records a zero if the eyes are closed and a one if the eyes are open. Therefore, it is impossible to ascertain whether the tracker misread an eye being closed when it was actually open. During data processing we only recorded a blink if it was physiologically possible to blink in the amount of time recorded to try to control for this recording error as best as possible. However, future research would need to address this issue.

We also observed an effect for day on blink rates. Specifically, left and right blink durations were shorter as days of participation progressed. We interpret this finding as a general practice effect because further examination of the data revealed that participants became slightly faster at identifying the critical signals as each day progressed, as is common in repeated-measures psychology experiments that collect data with many trials over extended periods of time (e.g., Bartels et al., 2010). Since performance got better over time (across days), and blink duration is conceivably related to performance (as an indicator of fatigue or arousal levels), it is not terribly surprising to have found this effect. In fact it indirectly supports our claim that blink rates are indicative of performance due to changes in cognitive arousal levels.

Vigilance performance is known to correspond with changes in right cerebral blood flow velocity (Hitchcock et al., 2003; Warm et al., 2009; Hollander et al., 2002); therefore, we hypothesized that if oculometrics can detect changes in vigilance performance, they should also be related to changes in blood flow velocities. The results supported this hypothesis, showing that right cerebral blood flow velocities (but not the left) significantly correlated with our measured blink oculometrics. All oculometrics negatively correlated with blood flow velocity in the right hemisphere, and for both Decrement and No Decrement groups. More specifically, as cerebral blood flow decreased to the right hemisphere, there was an observed increase in blink frequency and blink duration, suggesting that blink oculometrics and right cerebral blood flow velocity are in some sense overlapping measures of vigilance levels.

Another interesting finding regarding right cerebral blood flow velocity was a significant interaction between Day and Time. We can offer no definitive interpretation of these findings, although it appears that rCBFV changed very little over time on the first day, but dropped considerably over time on days two, three, and four, especially for day three (see Fig. 2). While no subjective questionnaires were given to verify our interpretation, we believe by day three, participants were very bored and tired of the task (due to its intrinsically repetitive and boring nature) and our results likely reflect this boredom occurring around the middle of the third session. The metrics are back to their normal averages by day four when compared to days one and two, probably because participants were excited they were nearing their last day of testing (a common finding in the arousal and fatigue literatures, in which participants sometimes “perk up” for sessions near or at the end of testing which causes a similar statistical interaction) (e.g., McKinley et al., 2011).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Changes in eye blink frequency and duration appear to correlate with changes in vigilance performance. These blink oculometrics also correlate with participants' right cerebral blood flow velocities, which provides support for these oculometrics as indirect measures of vigilance performance from a well-researched and confirmed measure of vigilance (e.g., Hitchcock, et al., 2003; Warm et al., 2009; Hollander et al., 2002). Future research will be needed to assess the real-time effects of these oculometrics during vigilance tasks. Such studies will also need to expand these results by using alternative and more real-world relevant tasks. However, our results do suggest that using an eye-tracker in an Air Force-relevant task environment to detect changes in sustained attention could be beneficial, and more research should explore this topic further. Employing an automated vigilance detection system in an operational setting could allow preventative measures to be employed, perhaps by implementing a perceptual warning system or augmenting human cognition through non-invasive brain stimulation techniques.
