@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  We construct a theoretical model to study the competition of call centers in the call center service supply chain. The market we study consists of multiple competing call centers and many clients searching for outsourcing partners to answer their customers’ phone calls. Through the perspective of operational efficiency, we create a single index that aggregates several contract parameters. The index can be used to segment the call center market as well as to estimate the contract prices at equilibrium. The results can help the call centers to locate and focus on their market niches. Clients can use the results to estimate the cost of their contracts and negotiate with the call centers for better deals. The results can also be used to explain the observed reshoring phenomenon in recent years from the perspective of operations management. In particular, our results suggest that call centers in low-wage locations have a competitive advantage on large contracts with very strict waiting time requirements. On the other hand, call centers in high-wage locations may still be attractive for contracts that have lower call volumes, shorter contract lengths, and/or less strict waiting time requirements. Finally, we present field studies from an international service provider with call centers in multiple locations. The results of the field studies suggest a strong match between our theoretical results and the empirical evidence.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Telephone call center service is a labor-intensive operation and an important part of customer service for many organizations. In recent years, many organizations have outsourced their call center services to independently-operated call centers and thus have built a service supply chain with call centers as service providers and organizations needing the service as clients. Notably, the call center service supply chain represents a significant slice of the overall business process outsourcing market (Akan, Ata, & Lariviere, 2011). Convergys Corporation (a US-based outsourcer) reported revenues of approximately $1.5 billion in 2008 for its customer management group with a base of 25,000 customer service representatives (CSRs) worldwide (convergys.com 2009). BMW Technology, a call center service provider based in India, reported that it handled millions of calls and emails each month by employing thousands of employees (Nathan, 2010, the exact number is not reported to protect confidentiality).

The call center service market, which consists of multiple call centers and many clients, is very competitive. Cost is the major reason why clients outsource their call center service (Allon & Federgruen, 2007). Human resource cost, which includes the CSRs’ training cost and salary, is the call centers’ major operational cost concern. The cost for CSRs to handle phone calls comprises 60–80 percent of the operating budget, not to mention the additional training cost and other costs in human resource management (Aksin, Armony, & Mehrotra, 2007). Comparing the average salary of $6,000 in India with $46,000 in the United States, it is easy to see the significant labor cost differences in the global market and understand the reason why offshore outsourcing presents an attraction to many companies (Robinson & Ravi, 2004).

However, in recent years, the reshoring of previously offshored operations back to the U.S. has become a popular trend (Gray, Skowronski, & Esenduran, 2013). The phenomenon is applicable in the call center service supply chain. The Communications Workers of America (CWA) estimates that approximately 500,000 call center jobs disappeared from the United States during the period 2006–2010 (Huffington Post, 2012). However, with the large number of call center jobs that have been reshored recently, the percentage of call center jobs for high-tech firms that are currently offshored has dropped from 30 percent at one point to 12 percent in 2012 (Zeitline, 2012).

The offshoring and reshoring phenomena in the call center industry have drawn a lot of attention both publicly and politically. U.S. senator Charles Schumer even introduced a bill to charge companies 25 cents per call to transfer calls to foreign countries. He suggested that the tax would “provide a reason for companies that have already outsourced jobs to bring them back” (Nearshore Americas, 2010). Meanwhile, the CWA has lobbied for a bill that would eliminate federal grants or guaranteed loans for companies that outsource call center service overseas. Critics argue that government intervention hinders free-market economics and that the situation should be well-understood before any intervention.

The offshoring and reshoring phenomena have inevitably drawn attention from scholars as well. While low overseas labor rates are generally cited as the primary driver of offshoring, multiple factors have been suggested to explain the recent reshoring phenomenon. Those factors include poor customer service, negative home-country publicity, high turnover leading to poor productivity, technology requirements, and the desire for geographic risk mitigation while enabling access to diverse labor pools (Aksin et al., 2007; Heizer & Render, 2014; Nearshore Americas, 2010). Among these factors, poor service quality at the offshore facilities is often cited as the leading cause of reshoring, as supported by cases such as Dell Inc. and Lehman Brothers (Luce & Merchant, 2003; Ren & Zhou, 2008). However, investigation also shows that call centers in low-wage locations often hire highly educated employees. Their employees receive regular training, and the centers are managed both professionally and efficiently. In fact, these centers often provide very good customer service (Bosco, 2012; Holman, Batt, & Holtgrewe, 2007). Clearly, service quality in general is not the only reason for the vast amount of reshoring. In fact, heretofore there have not been many scientifically-justified explanations of the call center reshoring phenomenon, and the necessary conditions for attracting call center jobs to high-wage countries have not been well-understood.

In this research, instead of trying to identify and justify all the possible factors that could explain the reshoring phenomenon, we seek to understand the market competition and market segmentation of the call center industry in general from a cost-analysis perspective. We introduce a stylized model to analyze the operational cost structure of call center service. Based on the cost structure analysis, we are able to segment a call center service market with multiple competing call centers whose relative competitive advantages make each of them able to serve contracts with particular requirements in the best possible way. We show that in a competitive market, the resulting market segmentation will provide both offshoring and reshoring opportunities. Our research does not favor either off-shoring or reshoring. We believe that clients should not blindly follow the tide, rather, they should conduct rational analyses in choosing their call center service providers. On the other hand, call center service providers both off-shore and on-shore should not fight aimlessly for service contracts either. They should understand their respective competitive advantage and market niche so that they can better allocate their resources to compete in the market. Additionally, our results recommend certain tactics, such as separating a large job into several smaller jobs, which managers can use to retain call center jobs in high-wage areas without the need to rely on government intervention.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The involvement of global partners in business process services is a trend that has expanded from conventional manufacturing and purchasing activities (Cachon & Zhang, 2006; Chen, Xu, & Whinston, 2010) to service activities such as information technology enabled services (Narayanan, Jayaraman, Luo, & Swaminathan, 2011; Rustagi, King, & Kirsch, 2008) and offshore call centers (Hasija, Pinker, & Shumsky, 2008; Ren & Zhou, 2008).

In recent years, call center research has attracted much interest (see Aksin et al., 2007; Gans, Koole, & Mandelbaum, 2003; Mandelbaum, 2004 for an extensive overview and background). Many call center papers focus on firm-level operational topics that include call arrival forecasting (Taylor, 2012), staffing and scheduling (Aktekin, 2014; Avramidisa, Chanc, Gendreaub, L'Ecuyerc, & Pisacaned, 2010; Baron & Milner, 2009; Green, Kolesar, & Whitt, 2007; Kolesar & Green, 1998; Whitt, 2006), call routing (Jouini, Dallery, & Nait-Abdallah, 2008), staffing with call routing (Tezcan & Behzad, 2012) or call resolution probability (Ren & Zhou, 2008), queuing analysis (Raik & Manitz, 2013; Whitt, 2004), contracting (Hasija et al., 2008; Milner & Olsen, 2008), outsourcing and customer satisfaction (Bharadwaj & Roggeveen, 2008), cross-selling (Örmeci & Akşin, 2010), pooling of employees (Mandelbaum & Reiman, 1998; van Dijk & van der Sluis, 2008), telemarketing efficiency (Bollapragada & Nair, 2010), six-sigma implementation (Laureani, Antony, & Douglas, 2010), and training (Murthy, Challagalla, Vincent, & Shervani, 2008). These research results have led to substantially more efficient operational practices in call center management, and they provide a strong basis to understand the call center service market and develop a cost analysis of call centers through an industry-level view.

Unlike the “total landed cost” concept that explains the reshoring phenomenon in product supply chains (Ellram, Tate, & Petersen, 2013; Gray at al., 2013), the call center service supply chain's cost structure analysis has not been well-established in the literature. This study contributes to the operations and supply chain literature by taking an industry-level view. We examine the market competition and segmentation among call centers via cost analysis and game theory. Studies examining market share among competing firms take many forms and appear in many different disciplines. As with this paper, some focus on a particular industry (e.g. Maksimovic, 1990; Sanjo, 2009; Usero & Fernández, 2009) or a particular selling mechanism (Anderson & Xie, 2014), while others invoke game theory to analyze general markets that are typically characterized as a duopoly (e.g. Griva & Vettas, 2011; Kim, El Ouardighi, & Park, 2012; Xia, 2011) or an oligopoly (e.g. Aiyoshi & Maki, 2009; Cabral, 2012; Ishida, Matsumura, & Matsushima, 2011; Prasad, Sethi, & Naik, 2012). Additionally, some papers examine market segmentation among suppliers in business-to-business markets. For example, Inderst and Shaffer (2010) explore the role that market-share contracts, which provide rebates to a buyer based on a guarantee of a percentage of that buyer's business, may play in supplier markets. Xia, Chen, and Kouvelis (2008) examine a single-product market and analyze the order-space segmentation among the suppliers based on the buyers’ respective profiles of order size and delivery frequency.

In this paper, we introduce some simplifying assumptions that allow us to generate analytical results for the call center market as a whole. In particular, in a market with many clients and multiple call centers, we find the conditions for a call center to dominate a market as well as conditions for several call centers to coexist in a market in competitive equilibrium. Furthermore, we develop conditions under which call centers in different wage-rate locations may flourish—providing a vehicle for clients to choose call center service providers at different locations.
                  

We consider a market consisting of m competing call centers and many potential clients searching for outsourcing partners to serve their customers’ phone calls. The call centers differ in terms of the skill level, cultural/language background, and associated wage cost of their respective CSRs. Each client is characterized by phone call volume, desired service performance, and intended duration of the outsourcing contract. We define a market by its type of service, e.g., the market for credit card billing issues, the market for airlines customer service, the market for computer repair service, and so on. In practice, a call center may provide different types of services and serve multiple contracts. Furthermore, many clients separate their required service processes across different contracts and make outsourcing decisions independently. In our exposition, we treat each contract as a separate client. We can subdivide the call centers and the clients by market.

As we have discussed earlier, the major cost of a call center lies in labor cost, which includes both staffing the call center and training the CSRs (Aksin et al., 2007; Gans et al., 2003). As stated in Murthy et al. (2008), training cost can differ significantly among call centers, and it accounts for more than $15 billion per year in the call center industry. Staffing and training costs are related to the call center's operational efficiency, which is determined by the number of phone calls its CSRs can answer and resolve, as represented by the average service rate μ of its CSRs. The service rate represents the CSRs’ capability to solve the customers’ problems in a timely manner. It reflects multiple factors of the CSRs, such as their education level, technical capability, language skills, cultural understanding, etc. The initial service rate for a given contract is denoted by μ
                        0; however, μ can be increased through training. Call centers with a higher service rate can staff fewer CSRs to serve a contract. In practice, due to cultural differences and language barriers, CSRs in an overseas low-wage call center may have a lower initial service rate μ
                        0, which implies a lower threshold to begin training (Bosco, 2012; Nathan, 2010). The situation is particularly prevalent for jobs that require cultural background knowledge and sophisticated language skills. On the other hand, for “simple” jobs, the initial service rates are likely to be similar across call center locations. For a call center, achieving a service rate higher than the initial service rate requires training. Our model identifies the optimal service rate that minimizes the total wage and training costs. As discussed later, call centers may not always be able to select the optimal service rate due to their CSR seat capacity.

We adopt a queuing model to describe how a call center staffs the CSRs to serve customers. The workload of a contract is designated by the average call arrival rate per hour λ. Service quality is evaluated by the average waiting time W. A call center must provide enough CSRs for a contract to satisfy the contract's performance requirement. For example, contracts often set a performance target of having x percent of all calls answered within y seconds. To determine the precise number of required CSRs to meet the performance requirement, we would need to know the exact proportion of customers that abandon calls and the exact conditional steady-state waiting time distribution given that a customer gets served. Since such accurate information can be nearly impossible to gather in practice (Green et al., 2007), call centers utilize two common approaches to estimate the appropriate number of CSRs. Both approaches generate estimation formulas that meet the square root safety staffing rule found in Borst, Mandelbaum, & Reiman (2004). The first approach, recognized as the Kolesar and Green model, is based on a normal approximation (Green et al., 2007; Kolesar & Green, 1998), and it suggests that the call center needs to staff

                         CSRs, ensuring that p percent of the calls will not experience any delay (Z = the number of standard deviations above the mean from the standard normal table). However, from a practical perspective, modeling the probability of delay is inconvenient because it is difficult to measure precisely (Green et al., 2007). An alternative approach utilizes the M/M/1 queuing model, which suggests that the call center needs to staff

                         CSRs so that the average waiting time for the callers is less than W (Chen & Henderson, 2001; Pegden & Rosenshine, 1982; Rothkopf & Rech, 1987). The M/M/n queuing model would accurately calculate the average customer waiting times at a typical call center (Whitt, 2004, 2006). However, in order to obtain analytical results, researches have applied the M/M/1 queuing model to meet the waiting time requirement (Mandelbaum & Reiman, 1998; Xue & Harker, 2012). Due to its analytical tractability, measurement ease in practice, and guarantee of an upper bound on average waiting time (Mandelbaum & Reiman, 1998; van Dijk & van der Sluis, 2008), we utilize the M/M/1 queuing model for call center staffing levels in this paper.

A call center may need to train its CSRs in order to attain service level μ. We define T(μ)  as the training cost of a contract, and we assume that T(μ) is an increasing function of μ. A traditional learning curve f would follow a non-decreasing concave function with

                        , i.e., the most improvement in learning occurs during early stages of training. A piecewise-linear learning curve satisfies these properties. Such a function allows us to obtain analytical results, and any other non-decreasing concave function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by adding more segments to the piecewise-linear function. In our cost analysis section, we first adopt a two-piece learning curve (Fig. 1a) with a linear learning efficiency rate δ and an efficiency cap μ
                        1 to capture the “plateau effect” suggested by Yelle (1979) and others; in Section 7, we extend the results into the multi-piece learning curve as shown in Fig. 1b. The investment required to reach μ
                        1 is denoted as T
                        1. We assume that μ
                        0 and δ may vary from call center to call center due to differences in education level, culture, language, job familiarity, etc., of the CSRs at each location. We assume that μ
                        1 is the same at each location to designate a general maximum rate that most humans could attain. Two-piece learning curves are commonly utilized in the literature (e.g., Cabral & Riordan, 1997; Gray, Tomlin, & Roth, 2009) due to their tractability. Note that a multi-piece learning curve (Fig. 1b) could describe learning even more accurately. The mathematics for the multi-piece learning curve is much more complex; however, similar analytical conclusions apply as with a two-piece learning curve.

In practice, many call centers in low-wage countries can hire highly educated CSRs. Our survey with BMW Technology, an international BPO provider, shows that most of their CSRs in Indian call centers hold at least a bachelor's degree. However, cultural differences and language barriers still influence both μ
                        0 and δ. The influence is more noticeable for jobs requiring more communication and coordination between callers and CSRs (Bosco, 2012). As stated in Gray et al. (2013), culture and/or language difference is a major factor that influences the operational efficiency of call centers at different locations. In fact, Dell Inc. and Lehman Brothers were both forced to drop their customer support contracts from India due to customer complaints about the language difficulties and prolonged service times (Larsen, Manning, & Pedersen, 2013; Luce & Merchant, 2003; Ren & Zhou, 2008). In this paper, we use service rate (the number of phone calls that are answered and resolved in a unit of time) to encapsulate the service performance of the call centers, which would include cultural and language differences as represented by μ
                        0 and δ. In practice, whether or not a phone call has been resolved can be classified and verified by asking the customers at the end of the phone call; in fact, verification has been required as a standard procedure at many call centers.

We begin our analysis with a single call center. We are interested in optimizing the service rate μ in order to minimize the overall operational cost, which consists of the wage cost and the training cost. Note that the results for the multi-piece learning curve are included in Section 7 of this paper. To simplify the presentation, here we start our discussion with the two-piece learning curve (Fig. 1(a)). The training cost as a function of μ is given by

Note that in most call centers, the bulk of the training cost is spent at the beginning of a contract via group instruction instead of individual instruction. Therefore, our model expresses training cost as an up-front expense, rather than a per-person expense multiplied by the number of CSRs. Industry practice discovered in our case study (Section 6) further supports the training cost function (1).

Next we derive the wage cost S(μ). Define n(μ) as the number of CSRs at the call center devoted to a contract, γ as the average CSR wage at the call center, and L as the length of the contract. With these components,

From (3), we observe that K is larger, i.e., the contract requirement is “higher,” when call volume is higher, average waiting time is shorter, and/or the contract duration is longer, and vice-versa.

Combining terms, the total operational cost of the call center over the duration of the contract becomes

                           This is a special case of Theorem 5 for the multi-piece learning curve. See Appendix (Supplementary material).

At the optimal service rate, the cost function C is a concave increasing function of K, as illustrated in Fig. 2
                         and formalized in Corollary 1. In particular, as intuition would suggest, the optimal cost will rise when call volume is higher, average waiting time is shorter, and/or the contract duration is longer. Note that Theorem 1 ignores CSR seat capacity. We incorporate capacity constraints in Section 7.

Due to the structure and complexity of the total operational cost function as stated in Corollary 1 (see also Fig. 1b), call centers in high-wage areas may hold a competitive advantage, especially when K is relatively small. In other words, call centers located in high-wage areas may be particularly attractive for contracts with lower volume, longer required average waiting time, and/or shorter duration because they may not need to train their CSRs while their low-wage competitors may need to.

To understand how multiple call centers compete within a particular BPO market, we start by analyzing the special case of two competing call centers. We apply the subscript index i to our notation from earlier sections to designate centers (i = {1, 2} in this section). To facilitate the direct comparison of call centers, it helps to express wages and service rates relative to how quickly employees improve from training. Specifically, for call center i we now introduce three new terms that are each a ratio of  δi

Note that a location with a low absolute wage but a high relative wage typically has CSRs that are very difficult to train and are generally not worth hiring, despite their low absolute wage rates. We rarely find call centers that locate in these areas (Holman et al., 2007). In practice, call centers seeking low overseas labor costs choose cities where the CSRs are typically college graduates who are fluent in English (Kondody, 2009). Therefore, in our market analysis we will assume that a call center with a lower absolute wage also has a lower relative wage, i.e., if γ
                     1 < γ
                     2, then θ
                     1 < θ
                     2.

In a competitive free market with accessible information about call center locations, education levels of CSRs, and wage rates, the call center that can satisfy all requirements at the lowest cost 
                        
                           
                           
                              C
                              i
                              *
                           
                           
                        
                      should win the bid. When all the above information cannot be collected or estimated, an auction mechanism, whereby a client submits a request for quotation on a specified contract bid, can still produce the equilibrium result (Xia et al., 2008). From Theorem 1, we are able to describe the BPO market along just one dimension: contract requirement K. Between the two competitive call centers, if one of them has a lower cost for all K, we say that this call center dominates the BPO market; otherwise, the centers coexist. Theorem 2 describes the market segmentation with two call centers.

                      widening as K increases. Fig. 3 illustrates Case (2) of Theorem 2, showing call centers 1 and 2 coexisting in the market. We have provided four different curves for call center 2 to illustrate the four realizations of K
                     1,2 in equation (5).

From Theorem 2, we observe that the call center with the lower wage will hold a cost efficiency advantage for at least some portion of the potential BPO market, i.e., when K is large enough. The other call center becomes attractive for the other end of the market (small K, i.e., lower traffic, shorter contract length, or less strict required waiting time) only if the center's wage premium is offset by a sufficiently higher initial service rate, if there is any. This situation is more likely to happen for more “high-end” service jobs requiring advanced levels of communication and cultural background. This helps explain why we observe that simple jobs and high volume jobs are often among the first types of call center jobs to be outsourced to low-wage areas.

For “high-end” service jobs with large K (higher traffic, longer contract duration, and/or shorter required average waiting time), it becomes worthwhile for the low-wage call center to invest in training to increase its service rate. This explains why the low-wage center always holds at least a portion of the potential market. In the banking industry, for example, large banks are more willing to outsource to low-wage areas because the call centers in those areas are more willing to invest in training to serve those high-traffic BPO jobs. On the other hand, many small banks maintain their call centers in their local high-wage areas. The amount of training that would be required overseas would not be justified by the relatively small traffic volume.

Even though CSRs in foreign countries are often highly educated and can properly speak the language of the home country, cultural differences, speaking accents, and language skills can still slow them down when communicating about complex issues with callers. Therefore, they may require more training for new contracts than home-country CSRs would require to reach similar service rates. This is particularly true for sophisticated jobs that require a high level of communication and coordination between callers and the CSRs. Thus, high-wage on-shore call centers can still maintain a market niche if they possess a sufficiently large productivity difference compared to their lower-wage off-shore competitors. In general, high-end jobs with lower traffic levels, shorter contract durations, and/or less strict required waiting times are good candidates for reshoring. In fact, it might be economically and politically worthwhile to divide a large job into several smaller sub-jobs and then separately reshore all of the sub-jobs. On the other hand, low-wage call centers always have a competitive advantage for very high-volume contracts with very short wait time requirements. Managers should rationally analyze the cost structure of call center contracts and follow the market's lead in making their decisions.

Both high-wage and low-wage call centers can adopt proper marketing schemes to attract more and better-fitting contracts. High-wage centers may be able to persuade clients to split one large contract (with large K) into several smaller contracts for which the call centers would be more competitive. On the other hand, low-wage centers may be able to pool several similar contracts into one call center to exploit their cost advantages.

If more than two call centers are competing in a BPO market, a center must have the lowest cost for some range of K in order to coexist. Therefore, the conditions from Theorem 2 can be checked initially to eliminate dominated centers. Lemma 1 formalizes this step as a straightforward extension of Theorem 2.

                         for K > 235,918. Therefore, there are no contracts for which call center 2 has the lowest cost. With center 2 eliminated, the final market segmentation allocates all contracts with K < 274,385 to center 1 and the rest to center 3. Theorem 3 provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for m call centers to coexist in a market.

Consider a BPO market with seven eligible call centers as described in Table 1
                        . The centers have been initially indexed (ordered in the table) according to the order of decreasing γi
                         (Step 1 of Algorithm 1). From Step 2, center G is eliminated. Even though its initial wage is the lowest, its learning rate is too slow compared to centers E and F to make up for the wage differential. Six centers remain. From Step 3, centers A and B are eliminated. Even though they initially have efficient CSRs, their productivity advantage does not offset the relatively high wage costs. Four centers remain. From Step 4, we need to calculate consecutive Ki
                        
                        ,
                        
                           j
                         values. Since δiγi
                         is decreasing as we move down Table 1, equation (5) provides the applicable Ki
                        
                        ,
                        
                           j
                         definitions in all cases. For KC,D
                        , the first two conditions of (5) are not satisfied, but the third one is. Thus, KC,D
                         = 4[30,000 – 12,500 – (30,000 – 18,750)]/(2250/30,000 − 1875/30,000) = 2,000,000. For KD,E
                        , the first condition of (5) is satisfied, so KD,E
                         = 4(12,500/1875)2 × {11251/2 + [1125 – 1875(7250)/12,500]1/2}2 = 279,696. For KE,F
                        , the first condition of (5) is not satisfied, but the second one is. Thus, KE,F
                         = [(7250 – 5000)/(11251/2 – 10001/2)]2 = 1,375,808. Since KC,D
                         > KD,E
                        , we eliminate center D and re-index the three remaining centers. Now we need to compute KC,E
                        . Since the first condition of (5) is not satisfied, but the second one is, KC,E
                         = [(18,750 – 7250)/(22501/2 – 11251/2)]2 = 685,164. Restarting Step 4, KC,E
                         < KE,F
                        , so centers C, E, and F survive. Step 5 directs us to (9), which allocates the market as follows: center C serves all contracts with K ≤ 685,164; center E serves all contracts with a K value between 685,165 and 1,375,808; and center F serves all contracts with a K value greater than 1,375,808.

We next extend the example of the previous subsection to include the analysis of 12 sample contracts. Table 2 provides data for 12 sample contracts in a market consisting of the three surviving call centers, call center C, E, and F, from the example in the previous subsection. Columns 2–5 represent the parameters of each respective contract. (Because not all businesses offer 24-hour customer service, the “Operating hours per day” column is needed to compute the daily salary cost.) Column 6 represents the value of K for each contract as computed in (3). Column 7 designates the winning call center for each contract, based on the market allocation cutoffs from Step 5 of Algorithm 1 (KC,E
                         and KE,F
                        ).

The sample contracts were chosen to illustrate conditions under which reshoring may be attractive. In particular, the winning call center moves from the lower-wage center F to the higher-wage center C as the contract requirements (represented by K) decrease through either (1) shorter operating time (contracts 1–3), (2) longer average waiting time (contracts 4–6), (3) shorter contract duration (contracts 7–9), or (4) lower traffic volume (contracts 10–12).

In this section, we analyze real business data collected from a multinational business process service provider, BMW Technologies Ltd. BMW is headquartered in Chennai, India. Its call centers are located in multiple cities in several countries, including the United States. BMW's 6000 employees provide call center support (both voice and non-voice) to clients in technology, marketing, and financial services areas. We collected information via questionnaires and interviews with multiple company managers. We focused on the three specific categories: the cost structure of the call centers, the contract requirements, and the contract allocations among the call centers. Company data regarding the first two issues support the assumptions and derivations of this research, while the firm's intra-company contract allocations coincide well with our market segmentation results.

Our
                      interviews revealed that call centers watch/regulate customer waiting time closely, as waiting time typically is the most important and enforced contract requirement. This business practice concurs with our use of the average waiting time requirement to conservatively determine the number of CSRs via the M/M/1 model. The managers of BMW indicated to us that equipment quality, maintenance costs, and management costs, while extant, do not differ significantly across centers. They allocate contracts based on two primary factors: cost of operating and quality of service. Aksin et al. (2007) suggest that the wage cost for CSRs to handle phone calls comprises 60–80 percent of the operating budget of a call center. Our survey results support this finding as well. The managers also emphasized that training cost is an important component of the operating cost, especially at the beginning of a contract. Although training sessions are organized regularly, the largest training cost for a certain contract occurs at the beginning of the service contract period, as CSRs need to be familiarized with the contract immediately. The CSRs are trained in a group format instead of individually. Call centers offer group training sessions and/or purchase computer training software for the CSRs to practice and improve. Thus, training cost really depends on the trainees’ initial status and learning rate; it is not determined by the number of the trainees. All the above findings support our model assumptions.

Upon winning a contract, the provider determines the best location among its call centers to service the contract. Given that the labor characteristics differ across our surveyed firm's call centers, we can observe its contract allocations as a proxy for the market as a whole to see how they compare to our model predictions.


                        Table 3 provides data for the nine BPO contracts coded “telecomm” that BMW services in India. Among the five call centers, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Mumbai pay the CSRs a higher wage, while the centers in Pune and Chennai pay a lower wage. Note that all data have been disguised by scaling. We have the following observations from Table 3:
                        
                           
                              •
                              Contracts with a smaller requirement K are generally allocated to the higher-wage call centers.

Contracts allocated to higher-wage call centers generally have lower training costs than those serviced in lower-wage cities.

Contracts allocated to lower-wage call centers tend to cover a higher call volume than those serviced in higher-wage cities.

The above observations hold, especially at the extremes, except for contract 3, which according to our theory, should be switched with contract 9. As both contracts 3 and 9 serve the same client that actually uses all five call centers, we suspect that the allocation between contracts 3 and 9 might be due to CSR capacity limitations at those two sites. From the formula

                         (Section 2), we determined that, based on an estimated average service time of 160 seconds for both contracts, contract 3 would require 17 more CSRs than contract 9 would require. It might also be possible that Airtel may have underestimated the traffic volume of contract 3 when soliciting bids.

Note that when we study market competition, we define a market by its type of service, and we assume that competition occurs within that service type. However, a call center may offer multiple types of service and compete in multiple markets. A call center possessing certain characteristics tends to succeed in types of services with similar contract requirements, which in turn supports our findings of market segmentation based on contract requirements.


                        Table 4 provides data for seven BPO contracts that BMW services in Dallas, USA, and Manila, Philippines. Note that the reported “Contract difficulty level” is independently evaluated by the call centers and has no direct relationship with the other parameters in the table. Clearly, the wage rates in Dallas are much higher than those in Manila. Both call centers use well-educated CSRs to handle less common BPO services than those that BMW allocates to India.

We have the following observations from Table 4:
                        
                           
                              •
                              The most difficult jobs are assigned to Dallas.

Contracts with a smaller requirement K are generally allocated to Dallas, the higher-wage call center.

Despite being highly difficult jobs, the contracts assigned to Dallas involve lower training costs than the higher-volume jobs assigned to Manila.

The highest call volume jobs in this set are allocated to Manila, the lower-wage call center.

Three very low call volume jobs are assigned to Manila that require three or four CSRs each. These jobs require little training in both locations and encompass little cultural/language difficulty.

The above observations share strong similarities with those from the intra-Indian allocation (Section 6.1), and all fit the theoretical development from earlier sections quite well. In particular, the relatively very expensive call center in Dallas remains a viable location by exploiting its three primary competitive advantages: (1) the ability to handle more difficult jobs with relatively little training, (2) a human resources and cost structure that supports jobs with a smaller K value, and (3) the familiarity of culture and language that plays an important role for the CSRs to serve the callers in a timely and efficient matter. The fact that an India-based BPO company establishes a call center in Dallas provides strong support that reshoring may bring economic benefit to companies. The fact that they allocate more difficult jobs and/or jobs with smaller K to the Dallas call center concurs with our market segmentation results.

In this section we extend the base model and results in three directions. First, we incorporate call center seat capacity into our model. Second, a more realistic multi-piece learning curve is introduced to replace the two-piece learning curve. Third, we derive the equilibrium prices for the coexisting call centers for each market segment. The computed prices can be used by both clients and call centers to estimate the appropriate actual contract price.

We define the seat capacity that a call center can allocate to a contract as 
                           
                              n

                         and the lowest service rate that the call center can choose to satisfy the contract requirement as

                           Theorem 5
                           
                              With a general piecewise-linear learning curve, the optimal service rate and the corresponding training cost and total operational cost for a call center to serve a contract with requirement K are summarized in the following table:

                           See Appendix (Supplementary material).

The range of K is comprised of 2J + 1 continuous segments as identified in the four sets of conditions of Theorem 5. In the first segment, (first condition), the call center need not invest in training. As K increases from there, the optimal service rate alternates between lying on the interior of one of the segments of the learning curve (second condition) and lying on a breakpoint of the learning curve (third condition). Finally, in the last segment (fourth condition), the call center should provide full training up to the plateau.

Note that the extensions from Sections 7.1 and 7.2 can be combined to simultaneously consider both the call center seat limit and the general piecewise-linear learning curve. Due to page limit considerations, we do not include the results in this paper. The results will be provided upon request.

Among the competing call centers who can meet the contract requirement, the client chooses the call center that offers the lowest price. The lowest price that a call center can offer for a contract K is its lowest cost to serve the contract, C(μ*
                        ). Thus, when call centers coexist in a market, the call center with lowest operating cost for a contract wins that client's contract. However, the winning call center need not price at its service cost. Instead, at the equilibrium of the price competition, it offers the client ε (with ɛ > 0 and arbitrarily small) less than the lowest price that its competitors can offer (the second lowest cost) to win the bid and at the same time generate profit.

Using the indexing from Lemma 1, for a coexisting call center i (i ≠ 1, m), the price equals

The proof of Theorem 6 is straightforward and therefore is omitted here.

Continuing with the example discussed in Section 5.3, using Theorem 6 we are able to find the equilibrium contract price by the winning call center in Table 5. This would represent the total cost to the client over the life of the contract. In practice, as call centers often charge clients based on a pay-per-time-period policy, the actual quoted rates might convert these contract prices to be expressed on an hourly basis.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper studies the competition of the call center supply chain from an operations management perspective. Based on the cost structure analysis, we are able to segment a call center service market with multiple competing call centers whose relative competitive advantages make each of them able to serve contracts with particular requirements in the best possible way. In other words, we find the market niches for call centers with different cost structures.

Our research results can be used by individual call centers to estimate their respective market niche and to build and exploit their competitive advantage. In fact, global service supply chains provide both offshoring and reshoring opportunities. Call center service providers, both off-shore and on-shore, should not fight aimlessly for service contracts. They should understand their own competitive advantage so that they can allocate their limited resources to clients that are within or close to their market niche. The results of this paper also hint at some competitive tactics for call centers, e.g., call centers at higher-cost locations may gain competitive advantage by persuading a client to separate a large service job into smaller ones. On the other hand, aggregating similar services into a big job may earn a contract for a call center in a low cost area.

Clients can benefit from understanding the market segmentation as well. The results of this paper can help them estimate the cost of their service contracts and negotiate with call centers for reasonable, quality, and economic deals. Knowing which call center can better serve their needs, clients would not blindly follow the tide of “off-shoring” or “reshoring”. They would be able to conduct rational analyses in choosing their call center service providers. In other words, they would make the decision of reshoring vs. offshoring on a case-by-case basis. To achieve the highest operational efficiency, “right-shoring,” which matches contracts with call centers at proper locations, is the key.

This paper provides a foundation for the understanding of competition in the call center service market. In doing so, we invoke a simplified model to describe and analyze the industry. Certainly in practice, call centers that are “dominated” in the model might still win contracts based on factors outside of the scope of the model, for example, proximity to customers, nepotism, experience, or strong recommendations from clients. Although we have conducted extensive case studies from a multinational business process service provider, with the limited information we were allowed to collect the case studies cannot fully demonstrate the applicability of the theory in practice. One possible extension of the paper would be to adopt more sophisticated models that, for example, consider M/M/N queues in call centers or include customer service satisfaction factors, phone dropping rates, etc. Another possible extension would be to expand the scope of the research. In particular, the approach in this research may be adapted to study competition and market segmentation in other industries. Finally, additional empirical studies could be conducted to further validate our theoretical results.
