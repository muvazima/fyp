                  Mutations in the SCN1A gene have commonly been associated with a wide range of mild to severe epileptic syndromes. They generate a wide spectrum of phenotypes ranging from the relatively mild generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) to other severe epileptic encephalopathies, including myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI), cryptogenic focal epilepsy (CFE), cryptogenic generalized epilepsy (CGE) and a distinctive subgroup termed as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy (SIMFE). The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential effects of a transition in the first nucleotide at the donor splice site of intron 15 of the SCN1A gene leading to CGES. Functional analyses using site-directed mutagenesis by PCR and subsequent ex-vivo splicing assays, revealed that the c.2946+1G>T mutation lead to a total skipping of exon 15. The exclusion of this exon did not alter the reading frame but induced the deletion of the amino acids (853 Leu −971 Val) which are a major part in the fourth, fifth and sixth transmembrane segments of the SCN1A protein. The theoretical implications of the splice site mutations predicted with the bioinformatic tool human splice finder were investigated and compared with the results obtained by the cellular assay.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Mutations that affect splicing have been shown to account for up to half of disease-causing gene alterations (Ars et al., 2000). Since longer proteins are more likely to be involved in genetic disorders than shorter proteins and disease genes have, on average, a longer coding sequence and a higher number of introns than genes not causing recognizable phenotypes, it was hypothesized that splicing mutations may represent the most frequent cause of hereditary disease (Lopez-Bigas et al., 2005). In addition, mutations elsewhere in the consensus sequences or in splicing enhancers or silencers, affect splicing with various degrees, it is now recognized that a wide range of mutations, which can be localized not only in introns but also in exons, may affect these signals either directly (disruption of constitutive splice sites) or indirectly (creation of cryptic splice sites). Many examples have been reported of nucleotide substitutions being a cause of aberrant splicing in human SCN1A gene (Harkin et al., 2007; Depienne et al., 2006; Gennaro et al., 2006). Several links have recently been made between epileptic phenotypes and mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel genes. Mutations in the SCN1A gene have, for instance, been associated with a wide spectrum of epileptic phenotypes ranging from relatively mild phenotypes such GEFS+ to more severe forms such as CGE.

Organized into 26 exons, the Nav1.1 co-exists in three isoforms, two of them differ by 33 or 84 base pairs in the 3′ end of exon 11, resulting in 11 or 28 amino acid difference compared to full-length isoform that encodes for a 2009 amino acid protein. The variance in length stems from alternative splice junctions at the end of exon 11 that produce a full-length isoform or two shortened versions based on the number of base pairs deleted referred to as Nav1.1[−33] and Nav1.1[−84] which omit residues 671–681 or 654–681, respectively (Lossin et al., 2002). The protein sequence published by Escayg et al. (2000) contains an additional 11 amino acids at the 3′ end of exon 11 in the larger isoform, which encode part of the cytoplasmatic loop between DI and DII. The relative expression of each isoform in neural tissue is not known. Recently, the complete cDNA and protein sequence of SCN1A was submitted to GenBank (accession numbers AF225985 and AAK00217). Splice variant 1 (GenBank accession number AB093548) refers to the full-length isoform encoding for a 2009 amino acid protein, and splice variant 2 (GenBank accession number NM_006920) refers to the shorter isoform encoding for a protein of 1998 amino acids. Different SCN1A mutations seem to alter sodium-channel kinetics in different ways (Sugawara et al., 2003). Recent studies, using human SCN1A mutant channels transfected into HEK293 cells, showed that the mutant sodium channels bearing SMEI missense or nonsense mutations were markedly deficient in passing sodium current, suggesting a loss of function in the aberrant channels. Whereas the pathogenic effect of a truncating mutation is clear, the postulated pathogenicity of splice-site mutations falling within these segments needs functional demonstration. This study aimed to use a site-directed mutagenesis by PCR and ex-vivo splicing assays to investigate the effect of the c.2946+1G>T mutation in the SCN1A gene previously associated with cryptogenic generalized epilepsy (Harkin et al., 2007).

The mutant SCN1A (exon 15) and its intron boundaries were constructed by PCR mutagenesis using a series of mutagenic primers under standard conditions. Sequence mismatches were introduced as to create BstEII and NheI restriction sites, respectively (underlined). Two non-mutagenic external primers, SCN1AE15F: 5′AGACGGTTACCGCAGATCAG3′ and SCN1AE15R: 5′ACTGCTAGCTTGCTGTGTTG3′, and two complementary internal primers containing the desired mutation, SCN1AMF15: 5′CCTAGTGTTATGTACCCACT3′, and the reverse primer, SCN1AMR15: 5′AGTGGGTACATAACACTAGG3′, were also constructed (the substitution nucleotides are underlined). For each mutation, two separate PCRs were performed and the resulting fragments were extracted separately. A third amplification was then carried out with a mixture containing those fragments in the presence of the external primers. The final PCR was performed in 50μl with 0.1μg DNA, 5μl of 10× buffer (50mM Tris–HCl, pH 9.2, 160mM (NH4)2SO4, 22.5mM MgCl2, 2% DMSO, and 1% Tween 20), 10mM dNTP, 20pmol of each primer and 0.5 unit of Go Taq DNA polymerase (Go Taq Promega). PCR conditions were as follows: 5min at 95°C followed by 35 cycles, each consisting of: 45s at 95°C, 45s at 58°C and 45s at 72°C, then a final elongation at 72°C for 10min was required. The final PCR product (715bp) was purified using a gel band purification kit (Promega). The presence of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

The PCR products were digested with BstEII and NheI restriction endonucleases, and inserted at the BstEII/NheI site of the splicing cassette p(13,17)/CMV, that has been designed to contain the 2 adjacent constitutive exons 13 and 17 of human 4.1R gene with their downstream and upstream flanking intron sequences, respectively (Deguillien et al., 2001). After the subcloning of the mutant and wild type constructs, transformation was performed with TOP 10 competent cells (Invitrogen). The cells were grown to an optical density of 0.8 at 37°C. The cassette and the WT and mutant inserts were fully sequenced to ensure the absence of additional mismatches resulting from PCR or cloning errors. The size of recombinant cassette was 1255bp, a feature that was used to distinguish the recombinant from the native plasmids.

Total RNA was extracted from the Hela cells using the same protocol previously described by Ben Mahmoud et al. (2013).

The effects of the c.2946+1G>T mutation on pre mRNA splicing was first assessed using the consensus score calculation method to quantify the influence of this mutation on the formation of splicing loops (Carmel et al., 2004) using the corresponding software available online at (http://www.umd.be/HSF/). The consensus sequences are (AG | 
                           GU
                        
                        RAGU and YAG
                         | RNNN for the donor splice site and the acceptor splice site, respectively, R=purine, Y=pyrimidine, N=nucleotide (Parent and Bisaillon, 2006). The mutation designations are based on SCN1A transcript ENST00000303395 from Ensembl. A in the ATG start codon is defined as c.1. The relative strength of the splice sites obtained from the bioinformatics tool is given as the consensus value (CV), which ranges from 0 to 100. Splice sites with CVs higher than 80 are strong splice sites; less strong sites have CVs that range from 70 to 80. Splice sites with CVs of 65 to 70 are weak, as only a few of these sites are active (Desmet et al., 2009). Hence, splice sites with CVs below 70 are herein considered non-functional. The CV-output from HSF only indicates the strength of the actual splice site and does not take the possible effect of (and on) other cis-acting elements into account. The effect of a splice site mutation does not solely depend on the CV value, but also on the relative change in Δcv emphasized that Δcv reductions of at least 10% for a mutation in any position, or of 7% for a mutation in position +4, are likely to affect splicing (Desmet et al., 2009).

@&#RESULTS@&#

Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to induce a single nucleotide change at c.2946+1G>T in SCN1A gene using mutated primers (Fig. 1
                        ). A minigene splicing system was used to investigate the effects of this mutation on RNA splicing. A genomic fragment containing exon 15, and 124bp and 235bp of flanking introns 14 and 15, respectively, was cloned into a splicing cassette. Control and mutated minigene constructs were transfected in Hela cells. The total RNA extracted from the cells transfected with the normal construct was submitted to RT-PCR analyses, which revealed a 642bp fragment corresponding to the expected splicing product containing the exon 15 of the SCN1A gene with the 2 adjacent constitutive exons 13 and 17 of human 4.1R gene. RT-PCR on RNA from cells transfected with the mutated construct displayed a shorter band of 285bp (Fig. 2
                        ). Direct sequencing of this PCR product revealed a total lack of exon 15 (Fig. 3
                        ). These results suggest that the c.2946+1G>T mutation at the highly invariable GU dinucleotide had completely abolished 5′ splicing site selection and resulted in the total skipping of exon 15.

The effect of exon 15 skipping was investigated in-silico to predict the effect of the c.2946+1G>T mutation on protein structure and function. The c.2946+1G>T was taken from the start codon with +1 is based on cDNA reference sequence AB093548.1 corresponding to the A of the ATG in the reference sequence of SCN1A isoform1, according to the recommendations of the human genome variation society. The findings revealed that the absence of exon 15 (357bp) did not induce a frameshift but caused a deletion of 119 amino acid residues (853 Leu – 971 Val). The translated protein contained only 1890 residues over a total of 2009. The 119 deleted amino acids included residues that are essential for both protein function and channel gating.

The c.2946+1G>T mutation is located in highly conserved S6 transmembrane segments of the channel of domain II (S6DII) that acts as a voltage sensor and is known to play an important role in channel gating and lead to impaired fast inactivation and predict enhanced neuronal excitation. In fact, it can be predicted that this mutation may have a deleterious effect on SCN1A and could lead to production of truncated mutant Na1.1 missing the region between D2S4 and D2S6 and the S5–S6 loop of domain II that forms part of the ion channel pore (Fig. 4
                        ).

Mammalian 5′ss vary considerably but generally conform to the consensus AG/GURAGU (R=purine). In silico analyses of the putative impact of the c.2946+1G>T mutation on the splicing event and the strength (% values) of the acceptor and donor splice sites of exon 15 were predicted by the HSF program version 2.4. The strength of the splice site was indicated by the consensus value and the CV variation Δcv. The numerical score calculated for the altered sequence GTG/ttatgt was 57, 85%, compared to 84, 69% recorded for the wild type. This mutation seemed to have a deleterious effect on the splice site, with Δcv=31, 69%. Thus confirming that this fact can inhibit the recruitment of spliceosomal components mediating splicing in this crucial position.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The present work is the first attempt to perform a functional study involving site-directed mutagenesis by PCR and ex-vivo splicing assays to investigate the potential effects of a c.2946+1G>T transition at the donor splice site of intron 15 of the SCN1A gene and associated with cryptogenic generalized epilepsy syndrome (CGES). Functional studies by ex-vivo splicing assays demonstrated that the c.2946+1G>T mutation lead to complete inactivation of the wild type splicing donor site and caused a total skipping of exon15 in SCN1A gene, The skipping of exon 15 caused a deletion of 119 amino acids (853 Leu −971 Val). These deleted amino acid residues included essential residues for the function of the SCN1A protein. In fact, it can be predicted that this mutation may have a deleterious effect on SCN1A and could lead to production of truncated mutant Na1.1 missing the region between D2S4 and D2S6 and the S5–S6 loop of domain II that forms part of the ion channel pore. In addition, an important region which plays a role to generate action potentials the part of extracellular loop which links S5 and S6 segments dips down into the membrane to form the ion pore. It was suggested that the highly conserved S4 segment acts as the channel’s voltage sensor. The voltage sensitivity of this channel is due to positive amino acids located at every fourth position (Chanda et al., 2004). When stimulated by a change in transmembrane voltage, this segment moves toward the extracellular side of the cell membrane, allowing the channel to become permeable to ions. The ions are conducted through a pore, which can be broken into two regions. The more external (i.e., more extracellular) portion of the pore is formed by the “P-loops” (the region between S5 and S6) of the four domains. This region is the most narrow part of the pore and is responsible for its ion selectivity. The inner portion (i.e., more cytoplasmic) of the pore is formed by the combined S5 and S6 segments of the four domains (Kuhn and Greeff, 1999; Ulbricht, 2005). The region linking domains II and III is also important for channel function.

The use of minigene ex-vivo assays turned to be a powerful tool to address this issue. Such an approach exemplifies the importance to determine the actual impact of a genomic mutation on mRNA metabolism to better understand the pathophysiology of disease. Generally, the GT and AG invariants in the 5′ss and the 3′ss, respectively, are conserved among all species undergoing splicing. We previously reported that splice site mutations result in splicing aberrance among which exon skipping is the more frequent outcome (Ben Mahmoud et al., 2013; Siala et al., 2007, 2008). In the present study, an ex-vivo approach was performed and RT-PCR analyses were carried out on mRNA isolated from Hela cells transfected with normal and mutant expression vectors. The results revealed that the G to T change at position +1 altered the donor splice site of exon 15, leading to the total skipping of this exon. Splice sites are key elements for exon recognition, and the mutations leading to the alteration of these signals have, therefore, strong impacts on mRNA maturation and protein synthesis. Both the 5′ and the 3′ splice sites are required for spliceosome complex formation wherein the 5′ is distinguished by U1SnRNA base pairing and associated with SR splicing factors. Moreover, the 5′ss is complementary to the 5′ end of the U1 snRNA, and the recognition of the 5′ss involves base pairing with the U1 snRNA. In fact, a compensatory base-substitution in U1snRNA was found to suppress the inactivation of the mutated 5′ss in several cases. Consistent with these observations, in vitro studies have shown that a minimal base pairing between the 5′ss and U1snRNA is sufficient for its proper recognition by U1snRNP (Lund and Kjems, 2002). In addition, all mutations affecting the nucleotides in canonical positions (−2, −1, +1 or +2) strongly influenced the CV value with an average reduction Δcv of 31%. Mutations affecting less conserved residues had a weaker effect with a Δcv of 7% for the residue in position +4 and 14% for nucleotides in position +3 or +5. These results together with data from other disease-causing mutations (Frederic et al., 2008, 2009) indicated that a Δcv reduction of at least 10% for a mutation in any position or of 7% for a mutation in position +4 in consensus sequence is likely to have a significant impact on splicing and should be further investigated. The association of a nucleotide change and exon skipping has been described in a variety of disease genes (Cooper et al., 2009; Tazi et al., 2009). Exon skipping is not a rare event and is usually caused by changes in the consensus sequences at splice sites or in branch-point regions. The resulting transcript may either be in-frame or out-of-frame. While the former transcript may lead to the production of a functional or partially functional protein, the latter are likely to cause the formation of a premature termination codon and a subsequent rapid nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Green et al., 2003). Skipping of exon 15 reported in the present study was, however, noted to rescue the reading frame and to result in a deletion of the amino acids (853 Leu – 971 Val) which are a major part in the fourth, fifth and sixth transmembrane segments of the SCN1A protein.
