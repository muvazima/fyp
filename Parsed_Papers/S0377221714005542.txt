                  We investigate two scheduling problems. The first is scheduling with agreements (SWA) that consists in scheduling a set of jobs non-preemptively on identical machines in a minimum time, subject to constraints that only some specific jobs can be scheduled concurrently. These constraints are represented by an agreement graph. We extend the NP-hardness of SWA with three distinct values of processing times to only two values and this definitely closes the complexity status of SWA on two machines with two fixed processing times. The second problem is the so-called resource-constrained scheduling. We prove that SWA is polynomially equivalent to a special case of the resource-constrained scheduling and deduce new complexity results of the latter.

                     . These jobs must be scheduled on a set of m identical machines. We assume that there is a graph 
                        
                           G
                           =
                           (
                           V
                           ,
                           E
                           )
                        
                      over the jobs, called the agreement graph. Each edge in E models a pair of agreeing jobs that can be scheduled concurrently on different machines. The agreement constraints are such that only agreeing jobs can be scheduled concurrently. A schedule is an assignment of jobs to the machines which specifies for each job the time interval and the machine on which this job is to be processed. A feasible schedule is a non-preemptive one which respects the agreement constraints. The aim is to find a feasible schedule that minimizes the makespan. Motivations and applications of this problem can be found in Bendraouche and Boudhar (2012), Baker and Coffman (1996), Halldorsson et al. (2003), Bodlaender and Jansen (1995), Gardi (2009) and Even, Halldorson, Kaplan, and Ron (2009).

                      this means that the number of resources is bounded by s, the resource availabilities is bounded by o and the resource requirements is bounded by r respectively. If an entry equals “·”, the corresponding amount is specified by the input.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the literature review. Section 3, presents new complexity results for the SWA problem in the case of two machines with at most two distinct values of processing times. In Section 4, the polynomial equivalence between SWA and resource-constrained problem is proved from which new complexity results of the latter are derived. Concluding remarks constitute Section 5.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The SWA problem with two machines and arbitrary processing times is NP-hard even if the agreement graph is complete (Garey & Johnson, 1979).

In the case of unit processing times, the SWA problem is equivalent to finding a partition of a given graph into a minimum number of cliques, each with size at most m. This problem is equivalent to the Mutual Exclusion Scheduling problem introduced by Baker and Coffman (1996). The SWA problem with two machines and unit processing times is polynomial since a maximum matching in the agreement graph yields an optimal schedule (see Baker & Coffman, 1996).


                     Even et al. (2009) have considered the SWA problem under the name Scheduling With Conflicts (SWC in short), by considering the complement of the agreement graph called the conflict graph. Thus, these two problems are equivalent.

Resource-constrained scheduling problems are largely considered in the literature. An overview and complexity classification of scheduling problems with additional renewable resources can be found in Blazewicz et al. (1983). Table 2
                      summarizes all the recent complexity results concerning this problem. Whereas, Table 3
                      reports some of the recent complexity results concerning multiprocessor scheduling with model “fix”.

In Bendraouche and Boudhar (2012), the authors proved that the SWA problem with two machines and

                      is strongly NP-hard even for arbitrary bipartite agreement graphs. In this section, we show that this result remains true even with two distinct values of processing times, and this will definitely close the complexity status for the SWA problem in the case of two machines. We shall denote the general problem, with two distinct processing times by

                         the SWA problem is strongly NP-hard even for arbitrary bipartite agreement graphs. The candidate used in the reduction process is the 3-Dimensional Matching Problem (3-DM), which is known to be NP-complete (see for e.g. Garey & Johnson, 1979). This problem is defined as follows.

By the same argument as in case 1, one can show that 3-DM has a solution if and only if the corresponding scheduling problem has a feasible schedule. Note that the analogous figure to Fig. 2 (case 1) is Fig. 5
                               and this achieves the proof of case 2.

                              . The first diagram concerns the schedule of the jobs corresponding to the matching along with their corresponding jobs. The second represents the schedule of the remaining jobs.

By construction of the agreement graph and taking into account the processing times of the jobs, with no ambiguity one can verify that 3-DM has a solution if and only if there is a feasible schedule, and this completes the proof of Theorem 1. □

The question associated with the scheduling decision problem is: does there exist a feasible schedule σ with makespan

As regards the necessary part of the proof, the schedule σ is constructed as represented by the Gantt diagrams of Figs. 10 and 11

By construction, the schedule of the remaining jobs must have been scheduled as in Fig. 10 and this proves the existence of the required matching. It is clear that the agreement graph is bipartite and this terminates the proof of Theorem 2. □

As a consequence of the two previous theorems, we obtain the following result.

                        Fig. 12
                         illustrates the complexity results of the SWA problem for two machines with two distinct values of processing times.

In this section, we present the polynomial equivalence between the SWA and the resource-constrained scheduling problems.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this work, we have considered two scheduling problems: SWA and resource-constrained scheduling. For two machines the SWA problem is known to be NP-hard in the strong sens with three distinct values of processing time values even for bipartite agreement graphs. We have extended this result to only two values and hereby have thoroughly closed the complexity status of two equivalent problems SWA and SWC in the case of two machines with at most two processing time values. Moreover, we have proved that SWA is polynomially equivalent to the problem
