                  The introduction of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) into a fishery is going to change not only the amount of catch a fleet can take, but often also changes the fleet structure, particularly if total allowable catches are decreased. This can have an impact on the economic, social and environmental outcomes of fisheries management. Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) modelling approaches are recognised as the most appropriate method for assessing impacts of management, but these require information as to how fleets may change under different management systems. In this study, we test the applicability of data envelopment analysis (DEA) based performance measures as predictors of how a fishing fleet might change under the introduction of ITQs and also at different levels of quota. In particular, we test the assumption that technical efficiency and capacity utilisation are suitable predictors of which boats are likely to exit the fishery. We also consider scale efficiency as an alternative predictor. We apply the analysis to the Torres Strait tropical rock lobster fishery that is transitioning to an ITQ-based management system for one sector of the fishery. The results indicate that capacity utilisation, technical efficiency and scale efficiency are reasonable indicators of who may remain in the fishery post ITQs. We find that the use of these measures to estimate the impacts of lower quota levels provides consistent fleet size estimates at the aggregate level, but which individual vessels are predicted to exit is dependent on the measure used.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Modelling the behaviour of fishing fleets following management change is becoming an increasingly important component of management strategy evaluation (MSE) (Fulton et al., 2010; Kell et al., 2007; Smith et al., 1999), itself an increasingly important tool for providing appropriate marine resource management advice. There is substantial evidence that the introduction of rights-based measures such as individual transferable quotas (ITQs) changes the incentives faced by fishers, particularly in relation to fleet size (Costello et al., 2008; Fina, 2011). Consequently, when modelling the introduction of ITQs into a fishery, some assumptions need to be made as to how the fleet might adjust.

Earlier models of exit behaviour in fisheries assumed that the decision to exit was a function of vessel profitability, included either explicitly (Mackinson et al., 1997; Pascoe and Revill, 2004; Ward and Sutinen, 1994) or implicitly as a function of prices, costs and catch rates (Pradhan and Leung, 2004; Tidd et al., 2011). Other studies have suggested that the decision to exit a fishery is a combination of monetary incentives and the socio-economic characteristics of the fisher (Muallil et al., 2011), and hence the decision to exit is largely individual and difficult to model even if complete information on the economic performance of individual fishers is available.

An approach that has been used in more data-limited circumstances to estimate fleet restructuring has involved the area of productivity analysis, particularly technical efficiency and capacity utilisation (Pascoe, 2007). Capacity utilisation represents the degree to which a vessel is achieving its full capacity output given its characteristics, while technical efficiency is a measure of how well a boat performs relative to its potential output given its characteristics and the level of effort it employs. The measures are derived through catch and effort data of the individual vessels, and hence represent individual performance. In terms of fisheries adjustment, the approach has been previously used to assess what a fleet operating at full capacity given current catch levels may look like (Tingley and Pascoe, 2005a), and the impact of ITQs on the level of excess capacity in fisheries (Dupont et al., 2002). The approach has also been modified to include the costs of quota purchase (Andersen and Bogetoft, 2007), and marginal benefits and costs of increased capacity utilisation (Pascoe and Tingley, 2006) when assessing fleet size changes.

Implicit in these analyses is the assumption that technical efficiency and/or capacity utilisation are appropriate predictors of which vessels are likely to exit or remain in a fishery, and this assumption is generally applied to the case of autonomous adjustment under ITQs also (Grafton, 1996). This assumption has not been empirically tested, although some recent studies have confirmed that the technical efficiency of those vessels that remain after a buyback are higher, on average, than those that left (Pascoe et al., 2012).

                        The study by Dupont et al. (2002) also suggested that the introduction of ITQs halted the ongoing decline in average capacity utilisation over time.
                     
                     
                        1
                      In this study, we further examine this assumption by comparing the relationship between these productivity measures and the decision to exit a fishery. We also consider scale efficiency, which is a measure of how close the vessel is to its optimal configuration. We apply the analysis to the Torres Strait Rock Lobster fishery, a sector in which is transitioning to ITQs in the near future. We use the method also to estimate how the fleet size may change under different quota allocation scenarios, for subsequent use in a MSE model being developed for the fishery. While the results relate to a particular case study, they illustrate the potential benefits of such a method for improving resource management policy advice.

The Tropical Rock Lobster (TRL) fishery based on the ornate rock lobster Panulirus ornatus is located in the Torres Strait (TS), which is geographically situated between Papua New Guinea (PNG) and northern Australia. In 2009, the total catch in the fishery was roughly 397 tonnes, of which Australian vessels caught 236tonnes with an estimated value of A$7.5million (Plagányi et al., 2010). Rock lobster is the major commercial fishery for Torres Strait islanders. The fishery is also culturally significant for the local indigenous population (Mulrennan and Scott, 2000; Scott, 2004).

Substantial management changes are being introduced into the Torres Strait tropical rock lobster fishery, and a MSE framework is being developed to assess the range of policy options (Plagányi et al., 2013). In 2005, an explicit allocation of the lobster resource was introduced between the Australian indigenous (the traditional inhabitant boat (TIB) sector) and the non-indigenous (the transferable vessel holder (TVH) sector) commercial fishers with an initial allocation 50:50 between the two fleets and the aim of increasing the indigenous commercial share over time to 70% (AFMA, 2011). In contrast, prior to this the TVH sector caught roughly 60–70% of the catch (Fogarty, 2010). Almost half the non-indigenous commercial fleet was removed in 2008 under a voluntary buy-back scheme to help the fleet transition to the lower quota share, resulting in a relative allocation of catch of 46.5:53.5 for the TVH and TIB sectors, respectively (AFMA, 2010). To facilitate future autonomous adjustment, the TVH fleet will be managed using individual transferable quotas (ITQs), while the TIB sector is likely to operate under one of three potential quota management systems: competitive, community, or a hybrid system involving an ITQ system for TIB fishers with high catches and a competitive or community based system for the remaining TIB fishers.

The introduction of ITQs and subsequent decreases in quota allocated to the TVH fleet will have implications for the fleet size, and hence the policy options simulated in the MSE model need to factor in these changes in order to ensure that the model-based advice is appropriate.

Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a linear programming method that estimates a production possibility frontier based on the observed production and input combinations in the data. The method is used for both estimation of technical efficiency and capacity utilisation, the difference being the treatment of variable inputs. DEA is well established in the economics literature for capacity assessment (Färe and Grosskopf, 2000; Färe et al., 2000; Färe et al., 1989), and in fisheries in particular (Herrero, 2005; Maravelias and Tsitsika, 2008; Pascoe and Tingley, 2006; Reid et al., 2003; Tingley et al., 2003; Tsitsika et al., 2008; Vestergaard et al., 2003; Walden et al., 2003).

                           “Returns to scale” describes the relationship between changes in fixed inputs and outputs. Variable returns to scale allows for increasing, constant and decreasing returns within the same fleet. Increasing returns occurs when output increases (decreases) more than proportional with an increase (decrease) in fixed input use (e.g. boat size), all else being equal. Decreasing returns to scale exists when output increases (decreases) at a lesser rate than fixed input use. Constant returns exists when the rate of output and input change are the same.

Using fixed inputs only in the model, capacity output based on observed outputs is defined as Φ
                        1 multiplied by observed output (u). Implicit in this value also is the assumption that all inputs are used efficiently as well as at their optimal capacity. Therefore, this measure represents the technically efficient capacity utilisation (TECU) based on observed output (u), and is given by:

The measure of TECU ranges from zero to 1, with 1 being full capacity utilisation (i.e. 100% of capacity). Values less than 1 indicate that the firm is operating at less than its full output potential given the set of fixed inputs.

In practice, this measure reflects both technical efficiency and capacity utilisation as part of the increase in output may be due to improved efficiency as well as improved capacity utilisation, and therefore is likely to be biased downwards (Färe et al., 1989). Hence, an adjustment is necessary to separate out the capacity utilisation component and correct for this bias. An adjusted or “unbiased” estimate of capacity utilisation is estimated by:

This “unbiased” measure also has other advantages. DEA is often criticised as a means of estimating efficiency as it does not account for random error. However, the ratio of Φ
                        2 to Φ
                        1 has been found to be relatively robust in the presence of random noise, particularly when variable returns to scale are imposed in the models (Holland and Lee, 2002).

A third measure of performance was also considered in the analysis, namely scale efficiency. Productivity, expresses as total output per unit input, is greatest at the point where returns to scale are equal to 1 (Coelli et al., 1998). A measure of scale efficiency is estimated as the ratio of technical efficiency with variable returns to scale (i.e.

                                    j
                                 
                              
                              =
                              1

                         compared with technical efficiency with constant returns to scale imposed (Coelli et al., 1998), which provides a measure as to how close a vessel is to the (technically) optimal scale (Orea, 2002).

The ability of the three efficiency measures to predict which vessels are most likely to exit a fishery was tested using a logit model, which estimates the probability that individual vessel i chooses a given alternative j (in this case, the decision to stay or leave) based on the characteristics of the alternative and a set of unknown parameters, given by:

                         is a vector of attributes of alternative j and individual i(in this case, the capacity utilisation, technical efficiency and scale efficiency), and β is a vector of the unknown parameters to be estimated. The parameters of the model are estimated through logistic regression analysis, where the observed choice (either a zero or a 1) is regressed against the attributes of the alternative and the individual making the choice.

Capacity output is an empirically derived estimate of what an optimal output might be for each vessel based on the observed output of other vessels in the fishery. Assuming profit maximising behaviour, in the absence of any individual output or input constraints, it might be assumed that those vessels operating on the frontier are operating at their economic optimal level (i.e. at the point where the marginal cost of fishing an additional day equals the marginal value of the additional day’s catch). In the presence of restrictions, it may still be assumed (although is not necessarily the case), that vessels on the frontier are operating at their constrained optimal level.

The introduction of ITQs allow the constraints on individual outputs to be relaxed (at least to some extent) by enabling fishers to buy or sell quota so that they may operate at their most effective level. The introduction of ITQs, when the total allowable catch is binding, is generally associated with a reduction in vessel numbers as more efficient vessels buy out the less efficient vessels (Fina, 2011; Grafton, 1996).

                         is the total allowable catch of species m, and dj is a 0–1 variable that indicates whether a vessel j remains in the fishery (1) or exits (0). In fisheries with many species, determining the appropriate combination of vessels is likely to require some additional modelling. For example, Tingley and Pascoe (2005a) developed an additional linear programming model with the objective of maximising total technical efficiency in the fishery subject to the constraints given in Eq. (7). Other studies have applied minimising total input use in order to achieve the set of production targets (Färe et al., 1992).

In this study, since we have just a single species and a single total allowable catch, the data were sorted by (unbiased) capacity utilisation, technical efficiency and scale efficiency, and the cumulative capacity output estimated. Evidence has been found elsewhere that the average technical efficiency of vessels that exit the fishery under buyback programs is lower than those that remain (Pascoe et al., 2012), and this assumption is generally applied to the case of autonomous adjustment under ITQs also (Grafton, 1996). We consider also two other assumptions: namely that vessels that have the lowest (unbiased) capacity utilisation leave first (on the basis that they need to buy the most quota to operate at full capacity so are more likely to sell); and that the vessels with the lowest scale efficiency leave first (on the basis that they are furthest from having an optimal level of capital in the fishery). The optimal fleet size under each assumption and TAC scenario was determined by the number of vessels that fell within the cut-off level.

Annual catch and effort information was available from logbooks for each vessel. For the purposes of the analysis, only the years 2007–2009 were considered–the period straddling the buyback program. While a longer period could have been considered, it was assumed that the decision to exit would be based on most recent performance. Over this period, 25 vessels operated in the fishery, although by 2009 (post-buyback), only 11 vessels remained. In total, 47 observations were used in the analysis, with most vessels operating in at least two of the three years considered.

Four inputs were considered: vessel length (in metres) was the main variable representing the physical capital in the fishery; while the average number of tenders
                        3
                        The main vessel operates as essentially a mothership to which are associated several smaller vessels (tenders) that take divers to the different fishing sites around the main vessel.
                     
                     
                        3
                      used and the number of days fished were the variable inputs. An index of stock abundance derived from fisheries independent data (Plagányi et al., 2010) was also used as a non-discretionary environmental variable to capture differences in conditions between years.
                        4
                        Use of stock measures as non-discretionary inputs in DEA analysis in fisheries is well established (Walden et al., 2012).

Vessels land catch as either whole (live) lobster or just the tails. The former attract substantially higher prices on the Asian export markets. If a lobster dies or is damaged in its capture, only the tail is retained, and is exported frozen, predominantly to the US. Landings of each product form were retained as separate outputs for the DEA, but aggregated into whole weight equivalent using a standard conversion factor (Dennis et al., 2008) in order to comply with the total allowable catch.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The data were pooled so that all boats were compared to each other across the three years. Two possibilities regarding decision making were considered, namely that fisheries make their decisions based on average performance over recent years, or that fishers are more optimistic and make their decisions based on their best performance over recent years (and hence attribute poor performance in any one year to bad luck). Hence, two types of measures were considered: the average and the maximum values over the three years of the capacity utilisation, technical efficiency and scale efficiency scores for each vessel.

A summary of the key results, averaged over those vessels that remained in the fishery in 2009 and those that left are presented in Table 1
                        . The average capacity utilisation, technical efficiency and scale efficiency of the vessels that left the fishery in the buyback was lower than for those that remained, supporting the assumptions used in the second stage of the analysis. From the results, there was substantial capacity underutilisation in the vessels that exited the fishery. Those that remained were also substantially closer to the optimal scale.

The productivity measures are also generally highly correlated, as might be expected (Table 2
                        ). Vessels that are close to their optimal scale also tend to operate closer to their technical efficient frontier and capacity output.

Because the correlation between the measures was too high to include all of them in the logit model at the same time, the model was run with each measure separately. The ability of the measure to adequately predict staying in the fishery was estimated assuming a cut-off probability of 0.5.

The results (Table 3
                        ) suggest that using the maximum observed measure over the time period provides a better indicator of who may stay than using average results over the time period. Although technical efficiency is often considered a key determinant of exit behaviour under ITQs (Grafton, 1996), this measure performed the worst. However, this may be an artefact of the DEA technique when estimating technical efficiency. Fishing is characterised by a high degree of stochasticity that will influence the technical efficiency measure, but less so the other measures (Holland and Lee, 2002). While the coefficients for the scale efficiency variable and constant were not significant both for the average and maximum measure based models, the models provided a higher proportion of correct “stay” predictions than the models based on technical efficiency.

The model based on maximum capacity utilisation had the lowest AIC, highest log likelihood value and highest McFadden 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          R

                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                        . It also had the greatest proportion of correct exit and stay predictions, with around 91–92% correct in each case. Based on this, it can be concluded that capacity utilisation is a good predictor of who is most likely to stay or exit a fishery given the appropriate incentives.

While the logit models provided a good indication as to which vessels were prepared to sell out to the buyback program, they cannot be used directly to assess which vessels may subsequently sell out under an ITQ scheme, as all remaining vessels post-buyback fell into the ‘stay” category. However, from the models, vessels with the lowest maximum capacity utilisation are the most likely to exit given appropriate incentives. Similarly, while the results were less robust, vessels with lower technical efficiency and scale efficiency scores are also more likely to exit the fishery under an ITQ scheme.

Given that these assumptions have been established as valid, the estimated number of vessels remaining in the fishery under each assumption is given in Table 4
                        . We assume the same current TAC and allocation to the TVH sector, but the introduction of ITQs enables vessels to adjust their quota holdings to increase their capacity utilisation. We also examine the impacts on reallocation of quota to the TIB fleet in line with current proposals (effectively reducing the quota available to the TVH fleet).

The results in Table 4 represent the number of vessels that can operate at full capacity given each quota scenario. The full capacity utilisation for each vessel was estimated, and vessels were sorted by maximum capacity utilisation, technical efficiency and scale efficiency. The cumulative capacity output was determined, and vessels were assigned a value of d
                        =1 (i.e. in Eq. (7)) if the cumulative capacity given that vessel was less than the TAC, or d
                        =0 if greater than the TAC.
                           5
                           This could also have been achieved using a simple linear programming model as by Tingley and Pascoe (2005a), although given the small number of vessels considered a manual sorting approach was undertaken.
                        
                        
                           5
                        
                     

The results (in terms of total number of vessels) were the same under each assumption, although which boats actually remained varied (Table 5
                        ). For example, based on capacity utilisation, boats 3 and 6 are likely to exit; based on technical efficiency boats 3 and 8; and based on scale efficiency boats 3 and 10 (Table 5). In all cases, however, two boats were found to leave the fishery. Similar results were found in the other TAC allocation scenarios. Hence, while there is uncertainty as to which boat may leave, there is considerable agreement as the number of vessels likely to leave.

From the results, the introduction of ITQs is expected to reduce the remaining fleet from 11 to 9, as 2 boats sell their quotas to the remaining fleet. A further reallocation of quota to the indigenous fleet is likely to result in around 6 or 7 vessels with a 40% share, or only 4 vessels with a 30% share.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS@&#

Changes in fisher behaviour following policy change has been considered a source of implementation error in much of the fisheries science and management literature (Fulton et al., 2010). While economics cannot perfectly predict fisher behaviour as individuals often respond to incentives differently (Richardson et al., 2005), there is growing evidence that exit behaviour of fishers under ITQs or buybacks is related to their relative efficiency (Branch et al., 2006; Pascoe et al., 2012; Pradhan and Leung, 2004).

The example used in this study represents a relatively small fleet operating in a single-species fishery. The DEA methodology, however, has also been applied to substantially larger and multispecies fisheries to estimate how fleet sizes may change under ITQs or what a fleet operating at full capacity may look like (Andersen and Bogetoft, 2007; Dupont et al., 2002; Pascoe and Tingley, 2006; Tingley and Pascoe, 2005a). These earlier studies, however, did not consider alternative quota levels, and at best considered only capacity utilisation or technical efficiency as the criterion for vessels to choose to stay or exit. These assumptions were not tested. Scale efficiency has also generally not been considered in such studies, but in this study was shown to be potentially influential in the decision to stay or leave in the earlier buyback in the fishery, although this influence was not as significant as capacity utilisation. For relatively small quota changes (or the initial move to ITQs), the assumption that vessels furthest from their optimal scale would exit first resulted in a different set, although not necessarily a different number, of vessels exiting the fishery. Consequently including this consideration into the analysis provides a greater range of possible behavioural characteristics to be captured.

A difficulty often encountered when modelling fleet exiting behaviour is the lack of alternative uses of vessel capital – the so-called capital non-malleability problem (Clark et al., 1979). Vessel owners may be reluctant to leave a fishery if there is nowhere else that their capital can be deployed. In the case of the Torres Strait rock lobster fishery, this is less of an issue as most vessels are dual endorsed, with a licence also to operate in the adjacent Queensland east coast rock lobster fishery. For many vessels, this fishery is closer to their home port so has lower costs of access. However, the east coast fishery also has lower productivity (i.e. catch rates) than Torres Straits, so vessels prefer to expend their effort in the Torres Strait fishery. As a consequence, the east coast fishery is relatively underexploited (Department of Employment Economic Development and Innovation (DEEDI), 2010). While the east coast fishery is also managed by ITQs, the quota is currently not binding and is relatively inexpensive to buy (relative to the expected value of the Torres Strait quota).

The existence of alternative opportunities may, to some extent, explain the differences in capacity utilisation between vessels (Tingley and Pascoe, 2005b), and may also help to explain why capacity utilisation may be a better indicator of willingness-to-exit than other productivity measures (e.g. technical and scale efficiency). Boats that are more active in alternative fisheries will, by construction, have a lower capacity utilisation than vessels fully engaged in a fishery, and may be more willing to transfer their activity fully into the alternative fishery. In addition, anecdotal evidence (based on discussions with skippers from a range of Australian and European fisheries) suggests that activity levels decrease with skipper age, which would also appear as lower capacity utilisation. These skippers, however, may be relatively efficient due to their experience in the fishery (Kirkley et al., 1995, 1998; Sharma and Leung, 1999). Many owner-operators consider their licence or quota as their superannuation or pension plan, although opportunities to realise the value of these assets is often limited. Offered an opportunity to exit the fishery with an appropriate compensation for their investment is likely to be attractive to fishers considering retiring.

The results of the analysis demonstrate that fleet size does not decrease linearly with decreases in quota. Within any fleet, there is considerable heterogeneity in the capacity of fishing vessels, with a high proportion of the potential catch often taken by relatively few individuals. In this case, a 40% reduction in quota (from a 50% share to a 30% share) resulted in over a 55% reduction in the estimated full capacity (post ITQ) fleet size, and a 63% reduction from the pre-ITQ fleet.

The results of this analysis were used in the development of policy scenarios under a MSE for the fishery (Plagányi et al., 2013), and the prime motivation of undertaking the analysis was in order to provide some science-based assumptions about fleet behaviour for these scenarios. In the absence of such analysis, some assumptions on fleet size would still be necessary, and the uncertainty around these assumptions could potentially undermine trust in the model results.

The major contribution of this work is validation of the assumption that capacity utilisation is a major predictor of behaviour in fleet restructuring. A number of factors drive capacity utilisation, including catch rates, economic conditions, and socio-economic characteristics of the individual fishers (Tingley and Pascoe, 2005b). Hence, the measure embodies many of the attributes assumed to drive adjustment behaviour in other modelling approaches.
