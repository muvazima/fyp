The article introduces a node-to-element integration for first order elements, but also discusses signed distances, partial updates, intermediate surfaces, mortar methods and higher order elements.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many simulations involve unilateral contact/impact analysis. In dynamic simulations, notably in explicit dynamics, the number of time steps may be very large. A fast collision response is, therefore, required. This includes three components: the contact search, the generation of discrete contact conditions (constraint equations or penalty forces) and the solution of the dynamic response. Beside the numerical efficiency, accuracy of the contact algorithm is very important. It involves the geometrical accuracy of the actually measured interpenetration, the accuracy of the measured penetration depth and depth gradient, and the order of the spatial and temporal discretization scheme. This article focuses on the contact search and on the evaluation of the penetration depth and its linearization.

State-of-the-art methods are often based on a (smooth) gap function or non-smooth surface features. The gap function is a measure for the distance between a given contactor point and the target boundary surface. Many gap function algorithms rely on direct closest point projection of the contactor point onto the target surface [1,2]. These methods may become quite complex to ensure robustness of the detection. Problems may appear during the Newton iteration of the projection, when multiple candidates of contact segments appear or if the contactor point falls into a ‘dead zone’ (associated problems are nodes getting caught at corners and negative sliding energies in friction). These problems were first tackled by the inside-outside algorithm [3] which associates a normal vector to each contactor point that is obtained by averaging the normals of the adjacent segments. The dead-zone problem at corners and edges on the boundary is eliminated and no iterations are required. It still needs the creation of a halo, i.e. an artificial bounding volume around a surface segment, during the global search phase.

The gap function assumes smoothness of the contact boundaries. Some complex geometries, however, include non-smooth surface feature, for example corners or edges. For such problems, non-smooth contact search algorithms were developed [4–6]. Within the family of gap function algorithms, non-smooth surface features can be approached for a certain degree by replacing the boundary of the finite element mesh by a smoothed surface representation which is at least 
                        
                           
                              
                                 C

                     -continuous and is typically based on splines, NURBS or NURBS-patches, see for example [7–15]. These formulations artificially smoothe the geometry of a corner such that a differentiable gap function is obtained. Further, instead of replacing the boundary of a FEM mesh by a smooth surface, one may use higher-continuous element formulations as found in isogeometric analysis [16–18] which explicitly define smooth boundaries. Boundary approximations are classified in [19] where one proposes the combination of point-to-point, point-to-edge and point-to-surface projections in order to treat 
                        
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                        
                     -continuous contact boundaries.

An alternative approach to contact detection utilizing a gap function relies on the evaluation of distance fields. Distance fields provide an implicit representation of the closest point projection, see Fig. 1
                        . The idea is that once the coordinate of a point is known, one does not compute the actual projection, but evaluates a scalar field to obtain the distance to a surface.

Algorithms regarding distance fields go back to the level set equation. The level set method was presented by Osher and Sethian [20] who described the temporal propagation of moving interfaces by numerical methods solving the Hamilton–Jacobi equation. This is performed by a finite difference scheme working on a rectangular grid in two or three dimensions. Information on normal vectors and curvature can be obtained. The fast marching method [21] provides an efficient numerical scheme of complexity 
                           
                              n
                              log
                              n
                           
                         to compute the support values on the grid. It is a reinterpretation of the propagation process, i.e. the time where the interface passes a certain grid point is influenced only by those neighboring grid points which are previously passed by the interface. An overview on the theory of level set and fast marching methods and their applications to problems of various areas are given in [22,23], for example shape offsetting, computing distances, photolithography development, seismic travel times, etc. Distance fields are a special case of the level set equation where the absolute value of the advection velocity is 1.

The concept of distance fields was introduced to contact problems in [24] using first order tetrahedral finite elements. The distance field is generated on a supplementary grid and evaluated at the finite element nodes. Simplicity and robustness compared with closest point projection is emphasized, in particular no longer required smoothness conditions on the shape of the boundary. Self-contact, large deformations and deep interpenetrations may be treated easily. Exact intersection polygons are determined on which contact forces are computed by the penalty method [24]. More details on the employment of the distance field are provided in [25]. It focuses on the pre-computation of the distance field by fast marching. A simple partial update strategy during a time integration is proposed for regions where intersections actually occur. More details of the approach are presented in [26].

A supplementary grid is not required if the distance field is interpolated on the finite element mesh. This is constricted by the lack of efficient level set methods on unstructured meshes. A fast marching method is adopted to acute triangle meshes in [27]. The basic problem are instabilities which arise by propagating approximate levels along arbitrarily changing directions. Instead of propagating the approximate distance, [28] computes accurate distances of grid points to the initial interface, but propagates a reference to the surface patches to which the closest point projection refers to. The idea was adopted to tetrahedral finite element meshes [29] with application to collision detection eliminating the supplementary grid. A partial distance field update strategy is provided for simplex meshes therein. Although not related to distance fields, a notable partial update strategy is presented by Heidelberger et al. [30] which improves the robustness of closest point projection approximation in two dimensions. By identifying the actually intersected boundary as initial interface, the distances will only be computed with respect to the selected surface patches and the partial update is restricted to the finite element nodes which are actually in contact. The approximate distances and normal vectors are propagated similar to the original fast marching approach.

The objectives behind this article are to adopt the ideas behind distance fields to collision detection on unstructured grids. No supplementary grid should be used. Instead, the distance field will be interpolated using the finite element mesh, i.e. no distances outside the bodies can be represented. The discretization should be suitable for arbitrary finite element types. Further, the distance field is to be expressed in terms of the gap function which in turn enables penalty and Lagrange multiplier formulations.

Section 2 presents the basic ideas behind Eulerian distance fields and level sets on a supplementary grid and after that introduces the discretization being used in this article. The distance field is interpolated on arbitrary finite element types following the presentation in [31]. The formulation is, however, unstable. A correct distance distribution can not be represented by the formulations used in [29,31] when applied to complex geometries. This is pointed out in Section 3. Therein, a novel interpolation scheme of the distances is proposed which resolves the instabilities. Furthermore, the assumed gradient formulation of [31] will be modified to match the novel distance interpolation and to eliminate inaccuracies of the gradient field on the boundary. The presentation continues by reformulating the closest point projection through the distance field in Section 4. A simple and robust approximation to the projection will be derived from a linear expansion of the distance. Section 5 introduces some fundamentals of contact mechanics and interprets the gap function in terms of discrete distances. Numerical examples are presented in Section 6. They utilize a ‘node-to-element’ integration scheme on the boundaries of first order tetrahedral and hexahedral finite elements. Finally, Section 7 summarizes important properties of the new collision detection.

The appendix provides supplementary information that is required to complete the distance field algorithm. A presents Closest Feature Front Marching (CFFM) which is adopted to compute the support values of the discrete distance field. B presents the local intersection test for tetrahedral and hexahedral elements. It further explains how global contact search algorithms can be incorporated. C presents how individual spatial discretization schemes can be employed, for example node-to-element, higher order mortar methods, intermediate surfaces. It further points out conceptual differences to closest point projection when using these discretization schemes.

The level set method is primarily used to implicitly describe propagating interfaces which are usually discretized on Cartesian grids, see [20,21]. The level set equation describes the evolution of a scalar field

                         becomes the contact boundary

                        . Instead of propagating the dynamics of the boundary in time, the distance field is usually recomputed for regions of interest. Eulerian distance fields provide the following properties when applied to contact:
                           
                              +
                              Eulerian distance fields provide a trivial strategy for inside–outside tests and can be used directly in collision tests.

The rectangular grid can be easily coupled with hierarchical or spatial partition collision detection procedures, for example octrees.

By interpolation on the grid, one obtains an approximation of the gap function

High sampling rates are required to represent objects with fine detail. Accuracy is limited due to the nature of the Cartesian grid.

In many applications, only some parts of given geometries require a fine resolution. In turn, distance fields may generate a lot of data slowing down data processing.

Let the distance field be described in terms of Lagrangian coordinates, i.e. the distance d is expressed with respect to the reference configuration

The interpolation returns reasonable values only in the case where the nodal values differ in at least one node of each element, i.e.

                                 . This case must be intercepted by the mesh generator. Particularly, at least one node must not be part of the surface what may be circumvented by subdividing elements. If all nodes are associated with zero distances, the discrete field returns zero distances in the finite elements interior which is wrong, see Section 3 for more details.

When using standard finite element shape functions, the representation of distances in the interior of elements may be erroneous. This happens whenever points of maximum distance are located in the considered element’s interior. The maximum in the interior can not be captured by the interpolation functions if low order finite element shape functions are used. Such situations always appear for elements which are located at a body’s skeleton, see Fig. 3
                         (let the body’s skeleton be the set of those points where the closest point projection returns multiple projection points with identical minimal distance). But these elements are often not crucial since one is generally not interested in measuring very deep distances in collision detection. They are important, however, if the skeleton is close to the boundary, for example if more than one element face is part of the boundary or if individual nodes are on the boundary, but not the element faces they are part of. Some critical situations are illustrated in Fig. 4
                         for two and in Fig. 5
                         for three dimensions.

Obviously, an enrichment of the interpolation may stabilize the distance approximation. As seen in Fig. 5, the function space must contain at least edge, face and bubble shape functions. For hexahedral elements, a quadratic tensor-product interpolation with 27 nodes seems sufficient. For tetrahedra one requires at least 15 support points, i.e. a 10-noded quadratic tetrahedron enriched by 1 bubble and 4 area functions with supports in the element center and on the element faces. The two-dimensional interpolation is illustrated in Fig. 6
                        .

An enrichment of the shape function space may stabilize the interpolation of the distance

                        , but the interpolation of the distance gradient

                         may still be insufficiently accurate. Consider, for example, a first order quadrilateral element where all element faces are on the boundary. The distance is interpolated by a 2nd order polynomial as in Fig. 6. Then, only the bubble shape function contributes nonzero terms to the distance field. The shape function gradient is zero at the interior support point (which is acceptable) and at the finite element nodes. The latter may lead to a wrong collision response because a zero gradient is measured in the vicinity of vertices and edges, see Fig. 7
                        . The matter of nearly zero gradients may be approached in the first step by normalizing the gradient to unit length. This strategy decreases accuracy due to round-off errors and possible ill-conditioning of the normalization. Another strategy would be to enrich the elements by piecewise linear polynomials (instead of higher order polynomials). This is equivalent to subdividing finite elements into linear tetrahedra. The distance gradient will be nonzero everywhere, but discontinuous, see Fig. 8
                        .

A stabilization of the gradient field can be realized through assumed gradients, see Fig. 8. The presented strategy extends ideas from [31]. Independent from the distance field, the distance gradient

The advantages of using the distance field for closest point projection compared with exact projections are
                        
                           1.
                           Once the material coordinate

                               is found, the distance function

                               can be easily evaluated by interpolation. The evaluation time is independent of the complexity of the body’s shape.

For small penetrations, the approximation is usually sufficiently accurate.

Directions are always feasible, independent from non-smooth geometries, non-convex surface features, neighborhood of corners and wedges, see Fig. 10
                              .

The discrete distance field is

                              -continuous. When used in conjunction with assumed gradients, it is 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          C
                                       
                                       
                                          1
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              -continuous.


                     Fig. 11 on the right is a case where the plain inside-outside test would detect a positive penetration distance of point X with reference point F. This case is an erroneously detected self-contact where the back side of the same body is chosen as reference. Using distance fields, however, the mentioned problems usually do not appear.

The dead-zone problem in Fig. 10 was eliminated in direct closest point projection by replacing the boundary by a smooth interpolation, for example in [9,12]. In fact, the representation of the gap function by smoothening and using a higher-order distance field are very similar, see Fig. 12
                     .

                         is not exactly enforced by the contact algorithm, the angular momentum is generally not preserved if the closest point projection is used, see Fig. 14
                         on the left. When using distance fields, the contact tractions are applied to material points with the same deformed coordinate. Therefore, balance of linear and angular momentum is satisfied even if the contact constraints are infeasible, i.e.

                        , see Fig. 14 on the right.

In this work, the distance field is precomputed in the reference configuration [24]. Not all finite element nodes are associated with a discrete distance. Starting from the bounding surface, the two top layers of finite elements are identified, see Fig. 15
                        . Only the nodes of these elements are considered during the distance field computation. This saves time and memory. Furthermore, it reduces the effort in collision detection. Since trial steps of a time stepping scheme should not exhibit deep penetrations, this assumption is feasible for many cases.

If the complete boundary of a body is used as reference surface 
                           
                              F
                           
                        , then the distance gradient is not perpendicular to the boundary when measured at points close to corners and edges. Depending on the interpolation functions, some kind of smoothing appears. There are applications, however, where smoothing is not desired. This can be approached by careful definition of the reference surface 
                           
                              F
                           
                        . In [30] a strategy for a safe partial distance field update is proposed which can be applied here. Therein, the boundary of one body (contactor) is intersected with the volume of the target. In the next step, all intersecting target surface patches are identified. These surface patches are used to define the initial set in CFFM, see A. The discrete distances of all nodes in the overlapping domain are recomputed at each deformed configuration. When evaluating the distance on the intersected contactor surface, it is measured with respect to the intersected target surface patches and the accuracy of the distance gradient can be improved, see Fig. 16
                        . Other approaches exist to partial distance field updating which are more efficient, but less robust [25,29].

By associating the discrete distances to points located on the finite element mesh one is able to measure non-negative distances only. Some situations may require the evaluation of a distance and its gradient of a point to the target’s boundary being located outside. Using the presented approach to distance fields, this is only possible by creating a supplementary mesh. Therein, for each surface segment one extracts the finite element nodes along the negative distance gradient, see Fig. 17
                        . For quadrilateral segments, one obtains a hexahedron; for triangles one obtains a prism. These elements are then used for distance field generation and for contact search.

The following tests are performed by a node-to-element integration where the finite element nodes on the contactor boundary are the numerical integration points of the contact integral. If not explicitly denoted, the FEM meshes were generated by GMSH [35] using linear tetrahedral elements. A general contact detection strategy is employed, i.e. no extra knowledge of the problem is used by the algorithm, such as individual contact pairs or maximum search distances.

A sphere with very rough discretization in the center and finer discretization at the boundary is shown in Fig. 18
                        . The radius is 5, the cell size is 
                           
                              1.5
                           
                        . The mesh contains 1041 nodes and 900 elements. To illustrate the interpolation of the distance field, the sphere is cut along a plane through its center point, see Fig. 19
                         on the left. The interpolation is continuous and of higher order due to the enhanced interpolation of the distance to the boundary. Hence the distance field appears smooth although the finite elements are presented by a piecewise linear geometry. The negative assumed gradient of the distance field points towards the boundary and is illustrated on the right hand side of the same figure. The interpolation of distance and gradient are sufficiently accurate even for large depths.

Another example is a rectangular block with an non-symmetric hole in its interior using a regular grid of first order hexahedral elements, see Fig. 20
                        . The width and depth are 10, the height is 4. The hole has a width of 3 and a depth of 5 within the horizontal plane. The interpolated distance field is illustrated in Fig. 21
                         on the left (GMSH plots triangles in the cutting plane, but the elements are hexahedra). Because the interpolation function is quadratic, the field appears rather smooth. In the vicinity of corners, a smoothing of the natural gradient is explicitly obtained, but there is no natural gradient at the outer vertices. A gradient field being continuous being defined everywhere in the domain is shown in Fig. 21 on the right using an interpolation of the negative assumed gradient. The interpolations are plausible near convex and non-convex surface features. Note, the three nodes which are not associated with a gradient in the figure are on a symmetry plane such that the closest surface patches are either on top or on the bottom of the structure.

The next example is a hollow sphere. It illustrates the distance interpolation for a thin-walled structure with non-convex geometrical features. The radius is 1. The wall thickness is 0.1. The average size of the tetrahedra is 0.6. There are 23,220 elements and 6983 nodes in the structure. The structure is subdivided into two parts. The lower and upper parts are connected by a clamp involving a unilateral contact. Fig. 22
                         illustrates the interpolation of the distance field and the finite element boundaries on a cutting plane through the center point of the sphere. The discretization is too rough for obtaining a reasonable mechanical response: Along the sphere wall 1–2 element layers are used. This is chosen to illustrate the stability of the distance interpolation. At the clamp, only one element layer is used with convex and concave corners, see Fig. 23
                        . As in the other examples, the discrete distance field covers the most important features of the geometry. The skeleton of the structure is clearly identified as the hyperface of maximum distance.

The collisions are resolved by the Decomposition Contact Response [6] that modifies the velocities discontinuously through a simple projection. The time step ratio related to the critical time step is

                         presents the horizontal displacements and velocities at the block’s bottom. A single value of the displacements is obtained by averaging the nodal values at the bottom surface. The results are in good agreement with the analytical solution of a rigid block sliding on a fixed obstacle: The displacements describe a parabola with end displacement

                         while the velocity decreases linearly until time

                        . The distance field is compared with direct node-to-segment projection [1] and the inside-outside algorithm [3]. The solutions of the node-to-segment algorithm and the distance field detection are in good agreement. When comparing the required cpu time, both are nearly identical (the search distance in node-to-segment projection is limited to 0.1).

The inside-outside algorithm does not converge. The reason is the averaging of the nodal normal vector on the boundary. The decisive error appears in the first time step. The nodal normal of the nodes at the bottom left corner of the block (as in Fig. 28) points downwards and to the left while the normal of the bottom right nodes shows downwards and to the right. When measuring the gap rate at the predictor step, the decomposition contact response measures an inactive contact at the bottom left nodes and an active contact for all other nodes. The friction force of the nodes in the bottom’s center is very small because it is limited by the normal force which is related to the gravity 
                           
                              F
                              =
                              -
                              1
                           
                        . The response of the bottom right corner nodes, however, depends on the initial velocity due to the inexact normal vector. Hence, the nodes obtain a rather large impulse which starts a rolling motion of the block. The true solution, however, is a sliding motion. Although the distance field, as tested herein, also implements an averaged gradient on the block’s boundary, it does not affect the convergence at least in this example.


                        Fig. 30
                         presents the energy balance. The energy dissipated by the friction grows until almost no energy is left in the system. The total energy is nearly preserved by the algorithm. Again, both solutions are nearly identical.

The balance of linear and angular momentum is presented in Fig. 31
                        . The angular momentum is computed with respect to the origin, i.e. 
                           
                              x
                              =
                              0
                           
                         at the block’s left side, 
                           
                              y
                              =
                              0
                           
                         at the block’s center and 
                           
                              z
                              =
                              0
                           
                         at the block’s bottom. As predicted, the linear momentum is preserved by both algorithms while the angular momentum is only preserved by the distance field. The magnitude of the error in angular momentum grows with the residual of the penetration. This is illustrated by application of the collision response every 5 time steps (instead of each time step). This leads to a larger drift in the angular momentum as illustrated in Fig. 31.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Distance fields on unstructured grids may help to improve collision detection algorithms that rely on a smooth gap function in several areas. The key features are summarized below:
                        
                           •
                           very simple local intersection search, see Appendix B,

safe and robust local search (no problems with dead zones, multiple segments as projection candidates, self contact, caught nodes, etc.),

no user specified input required (for example, a search depth that defines the halo size),

no generation of artificial volume elements around surface segments necessary,

simple computation of gap function and direction by interpolation,

suitable directions close to complex geometrical features,

exact conservation of linear and angular momentum without post-processing, even for infeasible contact in friction,

constraint and constraint gradient are continuous functions. This may improve convergence of iterative solution algorithms if an integration point moves from one target element to the other,

distances outside of bodies can not be measured unless a supplementary mesh is generated,

thin-walled structures can only be treated for penetrations 
                                 
                                    <
                                    0.5
                                    ×
                                 
                               tool size (in automatic contact),

thin-walled structures with deeper penetrations only by careful contact pair definition and outside meshing,

the global contact search must generally treat more finite elements than segment boundary volumes when using projection algorithms,

compared with natural gradients, the assumed gradient field may lead to improper treatment of friction at corners, but may improve the treatment of normal contact in few situations.

One key aspect of the distance field being utilized in this article is the enriched interpolation when using low-order finite elements. It should be noted that the proposed interpolation schemes for hexahedral and tetrahedral elements contain the minimal number of support points to ensure a stable interpolation in the vicinity of complex geometries. Hexahedral elements with tensor-product interpolation of at least second order and tetrahedral elements of at least third order can be used directly for distance interpolation. Quadratic tetrahedra need five additional support points, one in the element center and four in the face centers.

Possible future research may be
                        
                           •
                           to explore segment-to-element integration schemes like Mortar methods

to adopt the distance field to isogeometric analysis where usually a direct closest point projection is employed

to compare the numerical efficiency of the local search with direct closest point projection more deeply for distorted higher order elements. The convergence behavior of the direct closest point projection was already studied in [38].

The computation of a distance field may be a very expensive application. To be accurate, for each discrete point of the mesh the distance to all parts of the related surface must be computed and the smallest is chosen, yielding a complexity of 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           n
                           ·
                           m
                           )
                        
                      (number of nodes n, number of faces m). The complexity of this approach can be reduced by first identifying the closest discrete points on the related surface for each mesh point and then computing the distance to the adjacent faces of these closest points only. When interpreting distance fields as level sets, they may be efficiently computed using level set methods like Fast Marching [23].

The Fast Marching Method was originally developed for Cartesian grids, see Fig. A.32
                     . The idea is that distances of points lying on (or near) the reference surface are already known. Considering a point with an unknown value, its distance may be approximated if the distances of neighboring points are known. The level set value of an arbitrary point is, therefore, not the exact distance to the surface, but a good approximation while only the information of a few neighboring points is used, yielding an algorithm of complexity 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           n
                           ·
                           log
                           (
                           n
                           )
                           )
                        
                      
                     [23]. In [25] the distance field of a finite element structure was computed by creating a Cartesian grid occupying the same space as the finite element mesh. The actual distance values are then obtained by interpolating the values of the underlying Cartesian grid. The reason for this approach is, that although stable modifications of the Fast Marching Method for acute triangular meshes [27] exist, there is no stable version for arbitrary tetrahedral meshes in three dimensions. The nodal distance to be determined in each step depends on the discrete distances of the current marching front. As a result, an error is induced in each step which grows during the propagation.

Instead of propagating the distance through the body, one could remember the surface patch which is closest to a considered mesh point, obtaining the Closest Feature Fast Marching (CFFM) method. The approach was presented in [28] and first applied to arbitrary tetrahedral meshes in [29]. A closest feature denotes either the point, the edge or the surface patch of the elements defining the surface which is closest to the considered point. The algorithm requires a division of all spatial points into 3 mutually exclusive sets: ALIVE, ACTIVE and FAR. Additionally, each point stores two properties, the distance to the surface as well as a reference to the closest feature. At initialization, all points are marked FAR, except those being on the body’s surface and their neighbors. The points on the surface are marked ALIVE, their distance is set to zero and their closest feature becomes the set of surface patches they belong to. The adjacent points of the initial ALIVE points are set being ACTIVE; they form the so called narrow band. The narrow band is then propagated through the body, starting from its boundary and moving towards the interior skeleton until no FAR points exist. The procedure applied to finite continuum elements is summarized in Algorithm 1. The resulting method is of complexity 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           n
                           ·
                           log
                           (
                           n
                           )
                           )
                        
                     . It is more accurate than the original Fast Marching Method because it computes the accurate distances to the boundary instead of propagating approximate values. Errors may appear if a node stores the wrong closest feature it is referring to. Still, the nodal distance may be a good approximation of the exact value. Furthermore, the error can be corrected at deeper nodes during the propagation.

During a dynamic simulation, the contact conditions must be satisfied at discrete points in time. Depending on the temporal discretization of the contact constraints, this may require an iterative solution process involving the evaluation of the constraints at predictor configurations. For the solution algorithm one generally requires information on the activity of the constraints, the current residuum at the predictor configuration and eventually derivatives of the residuum. Given a predictor coordinate vector

                               which unnecessarily increases numerical complexity. Instead, a global collision phase is done before the actual contact detection. In this phase, the set of possible collision candidates is reduced to a reasonably small number by means of very fast methods. These are potential contact pairs consisting of a contactor point and a target element/face being sufficiently close to the other.

Local search: The local search performs an accurate inside–outside test for the specified contact pair and finds the local coordinates

Generation of constraint equations: For each positive detection, the discrete constraints are evaluated and temporarily stored (including discrete gradients, etc.).

Computation of response: Given the active set of constraints the response is computed.

If an iterative solution procedure is used, one repeats the process until the desired accuracy is obtained.


                     Global search
                  

Using closest point projection, one needs to create a bounding volume around each target face. The global collision detection then intersects the bounding volume with numerical integration points located on the contactor boundary. This is different for distance fields where one can use the target finite elements directly. Hence, one does not need to specify the size of the halo (for example, the search distance along the surface normal). Global collision detection algorithms can then be used without modification. These procedures are spatial partition schemes and hierarchical representations often used to localize the regions where the actual collision appears or to delimit the domain where the exact collision test must be performed. Such representations approximate the topology of an object at different levels of detail. These include bounding volume hierarchies like sphere trees [39,40], OBB-trees (Oriented Bounding Boxes) [41], AABB (axis-oriented bounding box) trees [42] and hierarchies of k-DOPs (Discrete Orientation Polytopes) [43], as well as spatial partitioning like octrees (octant trees) [44], kd-trees [45] and position code algorithms [46–48].

Tracking algorithms may support the global detection in time stepping schemes. Therein, one seeks the new position of a point within the neighboring elements of the target element being intersected by the same point at the last time step, see for example [3].

When comparing Eqs. (B.2) and (B.3), the latter is generally faster to solve by iterative methods. Consider, for example, distorted first order hexahedral elements or distorted second order elements. Then the degree of nonlinearity is higher in (B.2). Hence, one usually requires more iterations in order to obtain similar accuracy. Furthermore, one usually must check more faces being close to

                      Thereafter, the local finite element coordinate is used to evaluate the distance field gradient given by Eq. (10).

The integration domain C in Eq. (25) is defined as the intersection of the contactor boundary and the target elements, see Fig. C.33
                     . This is in contrast to direct closest point projection where the integration domains are the boundaries of both bodies. In feasible contact, however, C becomes the intersection of both boundaries.

Algorithms developed for node-to-segment and segment-to-segment integration can be applied directly, but the local coordinate of a numerical integration point on the target side does not refer to a target segment, but to the interior of a target element. Then one can chose from various integration schemes found in the literature, see for example Fig. C.34
                     .
