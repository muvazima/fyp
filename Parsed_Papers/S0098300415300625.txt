                  Spectral induced polarisation (SIP) measurements capture the low-frequency electrical properties of soils and rocks and provide a non-invasive means to access lithological, hydrogeological, and geochemical properties of the subsurface. The Debye decomposition (DD) approach is now increasingly being used to analyse SIP signatures in terms of relaxation time distributions due to its flexibility regarding the shape of the spectra. Imaging and time-lapse (monitoring) SIP measurements, capturing SIP variations in space and time, respectively, are now more and more conducted and lead to a drastic increase in the number of spectra considered, which prompts the need for robust and reliable DD tools to extract quantitative parameters from such data. We here present an implementation of the DD method for the analysis of a series of SIP data sets which are expected to only smoothly change in terms of spectral behaviour, such as encountered in many time-lapse applications where measurement geometry does not change. The routine is based on a non-linear least-squares inversion scheme with smoothness constraints on the spectral variation and in addition from one spectrum of the series to the next to deal with the inherent ill-posedness and non-uniqueness of the problem. By means of synthetic examples with typical SIP characteristics we elucidate the influence of the number and range of considered relaxation times on the inversion results. The source code of the presented routines is provided under an open source licence as a basis for further applications and developments.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Spectral induced polarisation (SIP) data consist of frequency dependent (typically 1mHz–10kHz) electrical impedances or admittances. These complex-valued data can either be represented in terms of real and imaginary parts, or as magnitude and phase values. Using the geometrical location of the electrodes, complex resistivities or complex conductivities can be inferred. These properties reflect electrical conduction and polarisation processes, for instance electrochemical polarisation at the interface between the pore fluid and minerals in soils and rocks or between different cells in living tissue, as of interest in geophysics and biophysics. SIP data are usually analysed and related to petro-, hydro-, or biogeophysical properties by means of empirical or mechanistic models (see, e.g., Slater, 2007; Kemna et al., 2012; Bücker and Hördt, 2013). While significant effort has been put into the development of mechanistic models over the last years (e.g., Revil and Florsch, 2010; Revil et al., 2012), most studies still address the formulation of parameter relationships using empirical models (e.g., Weller et al., 2013).

Two types of empirical model approaches can be distinguished: the first type describes SIP data using one or a few polarisation peaks (i.e., local maxima) in the absolute phase spectrum (or imaginary conductivity spectrum) with corresponding, distinct relaxation times. This includes the Debye model (Debye, 1929; Böttcher and Bordewijk, 1978) and the class of Cole–Cole-type models (Cole and Cole, 1941; Pelton et al., 1978, see Dias, 2000 for an overview). In general these models are overdetermined, containing far fewer model parameters than data points available. This, however, limits the flexibility regarding different shapes of the spectra and imposes strong data influence on fitting quality and robustness (Morgan and Lesmes, 1994).

The second approach describes the SIP response using a linear superposition of a large number of elementary Debye polarisation terms following a given distribution of relaxation times. The latter is commonly discretised in regular intervals. Thus, only the relative weights of the Debye contributions at discrete relaxation times are determined when fitting the observed polarisation response. This procedure of determining a relaxation time distribution (RTD) instead of a fixed number of relaxation times is referred to as Debye decomposition (DD). Contrary to the first type of models, the DD represents a strongly underdetermined inverse problem which requires some sort of regularisation to achieve a stable solution. A wide range of shapes of SIP spectra can be fitted using the DD approach, and more importantly, the approach does not require a certain number of polarisation peaks in the SIP data. However, representative (average or integral) parameters may be extracted from the RTD, also referred to as integrating parameters (Nordsiek and Weller, 2008) or characteristic integral parameters (Zisser et al., 2010b) in the literature.

The concept of the superposition of multiple polarisation terms goes back to Schweidler (1907), with the first proposition of a continuous RTD by Wagner (1913). One of the first published discrete decomposition procedures inverted the imaginary part of the complex permittivity (Uhlmann and Hakim, 1971), while later studies used the real part to fit permittivity spectra (Morgan and Lesmes, 1994; Lesmes and Morgan, 2001). It is noted here that because of the so-called Kramers–Kronig relationships (e.g., Macdonald, 1952) it is theoretically sufficient to only fit the real or imaginary part of the permittivity spectrum to infer the complete complex permittivity response (because both real and imaginary parts are related as a consequence of causality). Different implementations of the DD for time-domain data have been published (Tong et al., 2004; Tarasov and Titov, 2007), and likewise formulations for frequency-domain resistance and resistivity instead of permittivity or conductivity have been presented (Nordsiek and Weller, 2008; Zisser et al., 2010b; Florsch et al., 2012; Keery et al., 2012). Keery et al. (2012) investigated uncertainties of the inferred DD parameters using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo method. Recently, Florsch et al. (2014) proposed a decomposition approach based on relaxation models other than the Debye model, such as the Cole–Cole model or Warburg model. In an accompanying work, Revil et al. (2014) promote the use of the Warburg model, arguing that the elementary response in a rock is less dispersive than a Debye response. Following the same reasoning, already Tarasov et al. (2003) used a decomposition based on a Cole–Cole model in accordance with the response of a theoretical model for the polarisation of a single pore (Titov et al., 2002).

Based on numerous previous works on the linkage of SIP parameters with textural and hydraulic characteristics (for an overview see Kemna et al., 2012 and references therein), more recently also relationships of DD parameters to various petrophysical parameters have been established, such as to slag mass and grain size of slag–sand mixtures (Nordsiek and Weller, 2008), permeability of sandstones (e.g., Weller et al., 2010a), water saturation of sand–clay mixtures (Breede et al., 2012), specific surface area per unit pore volume of sandstones and sand–iron/clay mixtures (e.g., Weller et al., 2010b), and to changes in water salinity of sandstones (e.g., Weller et al., 2011). Attwa and Günther (2013) found correlations between DD relaxation time and hydraulic conductivity for samples taken from a Quaternary aquifer. One of the few published applications to field-imaging results investigated the relationship between DD-derived integral parameters and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) contamination (Flores Orozco et al., 2012).

Despite the growing number of studies incorporating time-lapse SIP data (e.g., Breede et al., 2012; Flores Orozco et al., 2013) for monitoring purposes, we are not aware of any DD approaches incorporating time-lapse data sets in a single inversion problem, for instance to apply regularisation with respect to temporal changes. In this work we present an open source implementation of a DD for complex resistance/resistivity SIP time-lapse (monitoring) data which is capable of imposing smoothness constraints with respect to spectral variations as well as changes over time. The inversion methodology is developed in detail, and integral parameters commonly extracted from DD results are briefly reviewed. Important aspects of the DD routine are examined, such as the choice of sampling (discretisation) of the relaxation time axis and the influence of regularisation strategies on the DD result. The source code (in the Python programming language) and corresponding documentation is available under an open source licence.

In this work, Eq. (4) is used to generate synthetic SIP data. Although in the literature the Debye decomposition has been mostly performed using the resistivity formulation (Eq.

From the RTD, different integral parameters can be derived, which provide information about the overall polarisation properties and relaxation time scales of the medium. We here consider the following parameters, which have been used in previous works:

                        . Our choice of using log-transformed chargeabilities in the parameterisation implies that relative changes in chargeability are equally weighted in the inversion, so that changes in the very low chargeability range still have importance in the inversion. Moreover, the log transform guarantees positive chargeability values. Ghorbani et al. (2007) suggest an alternative parameterisation of chargeability based on the logit function, which they argue is a mathematically more reasonable parameterisation also in the range towards the theoretical maximum value of chargeability (i.e., 1). However, since we are here not considering the total chargeability (like for instance represented by the Cole–Cole chargeability m
                        
                           cc

                           . The value of α is determined from a classical line search, explained further below, and the limitation

                            prevents from overshooting (at the cost of potentially increasing the number of iterations until convergence is reached).

The starting model for each spectrum is determined by testing a series of homogeneous RTDs for chargeability values between 10−12 and 1. The model yielding the minimal value of RMS
                           
                              Im
                            is then used as the starting model in the inversion.

The inversion is stopped when one or more of the following criteria are met:
                              
                                 •
                                 The RMS
                                    
                                       Im
                                     does not change significantly (smaller than predefined percentage) between subsequent iterations.

The RMS
                                    
                                       Im
                                     decrease lies below a certain threshold value. An exception is the first iteration, where an RMS
                                    
                                       Im
                                     increase of up to 100% is allowed to account for a possible tuning-in phase based on the starting model.

The update leads to a numerical error (e.g. overflow error).

At each iteration an optimal step length parameter α (Eq. (16)) is selected using a line search approach (e.g., Kemna, 2000; Günther, 2004): a parabola is fitted through three RMS
                           
                              Im
                            values corresponding to the α values 0, 0.5, and 1, and the minimum of the parabola determines the step length α
                           
                              min
                            for the model update. In case of a minimum above 1 the step length is set to 1. For 
                              
                                 
                                    α
                                 
                                 
                                    min

                              0
                           , the model update does not lead to an improvement of RMS
                           
                              Im

Two parameters determine the discrete relaxation times used for the decomposition: The number of relaxation times per frequency decade, N
                           
                              d
                           , and the min/max limits for the relaxation times. The N
                           
                              d
                            parameter must provide enough degrees of freedom to fit the data (Uhlmann and Hakim, 1971). Minimal and maximal τ values can be inferred from the frequency limits of the data using the inverse correlation of τ and ω (Uhlmann and Hakim, 1971). These limits can be extended by multiplicative constants, defaulting to an extension of one frequency decade to either side of the data frequency limits. Integral parameters are only computed for the τ range defined by the data frequency range, irrespective of the actual range set for the decomposition.

Three methods of selecting the regularisation parameter are implemented: a fixed value can be used for all iterations, the L-curve (e.g., Hansen, 1990; Florsch et al., 2014) can be used to infer an optimal regularisation parameter (Zisser et al., 2010a; Florsch et al., 2012), and a line search (simplified from the one used in Kemna, 2000) is implemented to automatically determine an optimal λ
                           
                              freq
                            value at each iteration. In the latter approach, the λ
                           
                              freq
                            value of the previous (qth) iteration is used as a starting point and multiple new values in the range between

                              Im
                            value is then used to actually compute the model update. For the first iteration, the λ
                           
                              freq
                            value is set to the number of model parameters. The inversion results presented in the following were computed using this last approach of selecting λ

Time-lapse data can be accounted for in the inversion scheme by extending the vectors and matrices to include all time steps. Based on the formulation for a single spectrum

                           ω
                           )
                         the new vectors sequentially contain the quantities for the different time steps, and the new matrices become block matrices with each block along the diagonal corresponding to a time step. In the following, the subscript d denotes the time index and N
                        
                           t

                        The scheme described above simplifies the implementation of the regularisation matrices, as only a base version (with variable size) has to be created for each regularisation type, which then can be applied to both frequency and time domains using the projection.

It is noted that so far the smoothing operators do not take the distance between adjacent parameters in the respective direction (frequency or time) into account. However, in particular for time-lapse measurements it is not uncommon to encounter irregular time intervals 
                           Δ
                           t
                        . These time intervals can be used to weight the regularisation matrices by means of a diagonal time-weighting matrix

However, in the future we plan to also extend it to second-order smoothing based on the implementation of the second-order derivative operator also for non-regularly sampled points.

In this section the optimal selection of the number and range of τ values is examined, followed by an investigation of the effect of the regularisation, both in frequency and time domain.

The choice of relaxation times is crucial for the decomposition process. Using an exemplary bimodal SIP response (Fig. 2

The response of even a single Debye term spreads significantly over a range of more than one frequency decade to both sides of its peak frequency (e.g., Florsch et al., 2014). Hence, τ values outside the data frequency range can influence the inverted RTD inside the data frequency range. To illustrate the effects of too narrow τ ranges, synthetic SIP data were generated in a frequency range between 10−3 Hz and

                           Hz
                         using a two-term Cole–Cole model (Fig. 3
                        a), and subsequently the DD was applied using three different τ ranges: (1) the range was determined from the data frequencies, (2) the data frequency range was symmetrically extended by one frequency decade, and (3) the data frequency range was symmetrically extended by two frequency decades. In all cases, N
                        
                           d
                         was set to 20, and the data could be adequately fitted. However, the obtained RTDs vary considerably (Fig. 3b–d). Without any extension of the τ range (Fig. 3b), two peaks can be observed in the RTD (Fig. 3c), of which only one can be related to a polarisation peak in the SIP data (compare detected peaks, i.e., solid and dashed lines in Fig. 3a and b). However, when the τ range is increased (Fig. 3c and d), only the polarisation peak indeed present in the data is recovered. The high-frequency peak (low relaxation times) in the RTD (Fig. 3b) corresponds to a large increase in S
                        
                           Im
                         (Fig. 3e), indicating an over-proportional influence of the small τ values in the case of the insufficiently broad τ ranges. Note that, irrespective of the τ range used, large values of S
                        
                           Im
                         can be observed for the not fully covered high-frequency peak, suggesting a strong influence of the corresponding chargeabilities if polarisation peaks are not fully covered by the data.

Based on the results (Figs. 2 and 3) we recommend to use a value of at least N
                        
                           d
                        =20 for the DD, and to extend the τ range at least by one frequency decade to each side of the data frequency limits.

The effect of too weak or too strong (first-order) frequency regularisation is demonstrated using synthetic SIP data contaminated by normally distributed noise (this type of noise is in the following also referred to as measurement noise). Three DDs were performed using regularisation parameter values 
                           λ
                           =

                                 3
                              
                           
                        , and 105. The corresponding fitting results are shown in Fig. 4
                        a, c, and e, with RTDs plotted in Fig. 4b, d, and f. For a λ value of 1, a relatively rough RTD is obtained, nonetheless adequately fitting the data. Due to the roughness of the RTD no clear peak relaxation time can be identified. The DDs performed with λ values of 103 and 105 show smooth RTD curves, each exhibiting a clear peak. However, the larger regularisation parameter leads to a flat polarisation response which does not fit the SIP data (Fig. 4e). Thus, the used regularisation parameters should be verified to avoid situations as presented in Fig. 4b and f.

Considering the analysis of time-lapse data, no inherent constraints (or preferences) regarding the time evolution of the DD parameters can be inferred from the method itself. All such constraints must be based on some sort of a-priori information (e.g., on the type of polarisation or the type of process being investigated with SIP measurements). Therefore, a variety of regularisation operators can be used for time regularisation. However, it should be kept in mind that different constraints reflect different a priori information, which can have considerable influence on the resulting RTD.

The influence of time regularisation operators on the decomposition process is illustrated on a synthetic time-lapse SIP data set which comprises spectra at 20 (irregular) time steps created using a single-term Cole-Cole model response (Fig. 5
                        ). The chargeability values of the SIP spectra decrease linearly with time, imitating a corresponding time-dependent polarisation process (Fig. 5a, increasing opacity indicates increasing time). A small, normally distributed measurement noise component with a standard deviation of 0.5 mrad was added to each spectrum. Additionally, a time dependent, normally distributed noise component with a standard deviation of 5% was added to the Cole–Cole chargeability values to simulate variations in the underlying polarisation process (in the following also referred to as process noise). This second noise component does not distort the SIP spectra, however, the spectra are vertically shifted. This is the primary type of noise that can be smoothened out using a time-regularisation approach. Measurement noise would have to be very large in order to influence integral parameters such as m

                         values inferred from the inverted RTDs for different time-regularisation approaches in the DD are plotted in Fig. 5b. For consistency, the DD without any time regularisation was performed with the same frequency regularisation parameter as the DD with time regularisation. The results show that time regularisation successfully smoothens the noise-induced roughness in the

                         evolution compared to the DD results without time regularisation. Due to the non-regular spacing of the time-steps (as often found in long-term experiments, e.g. due to equipment failures or miscellaneous delays), the time-weighted regularisation scheme creates smoother results in this example.

Time regularisation operates on the RTD, i.e., the chargeabilities at the discrete relaxation times. Smoothing of the chargeabilities thus directly influences the integral chargeability parameters m

                        , as shown above. Integral relaxation time parameters are only influenced implicitly due to the deformation of the RTD by the time regularisation. Nonetheless, time regularisation can improve the reconstruction quality of integral relaxation time parameters for noisy time-lapse SIP data. Here, measurement and process noise components are treated separately. Fig. 6
                        a presents 20 single-term Cole–Cole model responses whose relaxation time changes linearly with time on a logarithmic scale (the simulated time steps, again, are not regularly spaced). A normally distributed process noise level of 20 % was added to the log-values of the relaxation times before computing the responses. This large noise level is justified by the large possible dynamics that can be observed for relaxation times. Additionally, a small measurement noise level of 0.5mrad was added to the generated spectra. The time evolution of the integral parameters

                        , inferred from the obtained RTDs, is presented in Fig. 6b and d, respectively. Time regularisation greatly improves the quality of the τ

                         results, while the

                         results are only slightly improved. This can be explained by the nature of the data noise: process noise components in τ directly translate to changes in the peak position of the RTD, without affecting the smoothness of the spectrum and the RTD. Time regularisation strategies thus have to move the RTD peak in order to change

                         results, but only have to change the shape of the RTD in order to influence τ
                        
                           mean
                        . This is illustrated in Fig. 6c and e. Time regularisation changes the model response only slightly, but deforms the RTD enough to influence τ
                        
                           mean
                         (Fig. 6c, black curve).

However, 
                           
                              
                                 τ

                         results can be heavily improved by time regularisation schemes, if the data are primarily influenced by measurement noise. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 7
                        , which shows a simulation similar to the previous one (presented in Fig. 6). However, no process noise component was added to the Cole–Cole relaxation time, and the standard deviation of the measurement noise was increased to 2mrad. As can be observed in Fig. 7b, 
                           
                              
                                 τ
                              
                              
                                 1
                                 ,
                                 peak
                              
                           
                         is heavily influenced by these noise components, while τ
                        
                           mean
                         is only slightly affected. This result can be explained by the resulting RTDs (Fig. 7e), where the noise produces misdirecting peaks which get smoothed out by the time regularisation.

Note, again, that 
                           
                              
                                 τ
                              
                              
                                 1
                                 ,
                                 peak
                              
                           
                         is usually only interesting if multiple dominating polarisation responses are present in the SIP spectra, and only a subset is analysed. In other cases a more robust relaxation time parameter such as τ
                        
                           mean
                         should be preferred.

The presented results (Figs. 4–7) illustrate that care must be taken with respect to both adequately balancing regularisation versus data misfit and adequately balancing time versus frequency regularisation. The former issue can be addressed by, for example, performing a line search at each iteration of the DD to find the regularisation parameter value which locally minimises the data misfit, or by using the L-curve criterion. For the present inverse problem, however, it was found that the latter approach may yield varying results. To ensure a good balance between frequency and time regularisation, the involved regularisation parameters should be chosen such that the norms of the different regularisation terms in Eq. (26), i.e.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The presented Debye decomposition procedure is a robust and versatile tool to describe and analyse time-lapse SIP data. The implementation of the procedure available under an open source licence facilitates further development and an easy adaptation to specific data types and fields of application. Time-regularisation strategies yield improved results for a better interpretation of monitoring measurements, especially when peak relaxation times are considered. The number of relaxation times per frequency decade should be larger than 20, and the range of relaxation times should be extended by at least one frequency decade beyond the limits given by the data frequencies. In addition, as with all regularised inversion problems, the choice of regularisation type and strength can significantly influence the results of the Debye decomposition. Future developments of the DD implementation will include the incorporation of specific polarisation terms, for example to represent higher-frequency electromagnetic coupling responses, as well as the inclusion of spatial regularisation for an improved analysis of SIP imaging results.
