                  This paper proposes an agent-based simulation model to study and analyse the performance of various procurement and production policies in the recycled paper industry. The proposed model includes the recycled pulp production process, as well as the waste paper inventory and procurement processes. A detailed simulation model developed in partnership with a large recycled pulp producer in North America was developed in order to emulate the procurement manager's behaviour. Therefore, based on the observed behaviour of the procurement manager, a procurement behaviour model, which takes both market price and inventory requirement into account, is introduced. This paper also introduces a waste paper market model that simulates a market price and enables the control of price forecast accuracy. Two series of experiments were carried out in order to study the performance of procurement and production policies in several productions contexts. Results show that production Volume Flexibility has a negative impact on costs, inventory and quality. However, it is possible to partially reduce these issues with the introduction of contracts with Volume Flexibility, although only a limited effect has been observed in our experiments. A more significant strategy to improve costs consists in reducing production rate to the minimum level required to meet demand.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The recycled pulp and paper industry is a closed-loop supply chain (Fig. 1
                     ), which differs significantly from traditional supply chains (Carr & Appleton, 1990). Because closed-loop supply chains used to be considered as less valuable, their challenges are just beginning to be more widely addressed in the literature. Like other closed-loop industries, many fundamental issues of the recycled pulp and paper industry remain partially solved at best. This introduction section proposes an overview of some of these challenges, including the specific problem addressed in this paper.

In the recycled pulp and paper industry, raw material includes various types and quality of waste. Among many issues to be addressed, waster paper procurement is one of the most critical as it represents over 40 percent of total cost. Waste paper is an end-of-life material generated by the use of papers, virgin or recycled products, which are collected and partly sorted. The main finished product is recycled pulp. In order to be used in the paper production process, recycled pulp must meet several chemical constraints. However, to have high commercial value, important aesthetic constraints must be met, such as pulp brightness. The producers' objective is thus to produce a product with the right brightness for the specific use of their customers. To improve brightness, various chemical processes can be used with a fairly predictable, although limited, effect. Brightness is mainly a function of waste paper composition (e.g., type of fibre). The larger the content of ground wood fibre, the lower the brightness of the finished product.

Waste papers are industrial wastes, which contents and characteristics vary widely. There are two types of variations: inter-type (i.e., variations between different types of waste paper) and intra-type (i.e., variations within a specific type of waste paper). On the one hand, to reduce inter-type variability, the industry has developed segregation charts based on specific characteristics (e.g., physical, end-user type, location) to classify collected bales of waste paper. There are 52 standard grades of waste paper in North America. These charts allow recyclers to better understand the type of raw materials they purchased. Each grade has different properties, quality, brightness, and consequently, different price. Therefore, depending on the price of each grade and the pulp target brightness, a grade of waste paper can be more valuable than others. Unfortunately, these grades still contain much variability, because waste papers are poorly sorted when initially disposed of in office buildings and private homes. Perfect segregation at the point of generation is difficult, if even possible. Consequently, some form of testing and sorting is generally recommended. Procurement contracts with waste paper suppliers also include quality restrictions.

On the other hand, intra-type variability can lead to various pulp brightness due to fibre mix variations. Indeed, fibre mix can vary between two white sheets of waste paper considered identical. It is therefore difficult to reduce intra-type variability because it is physically impossible to sort industrial batches of waste paper based on fibre mix.

Waste paper procurement can be done through contracts or spot market. A pulp producer's capacity to take advantage of both approaches depends on the waste paper market, which has a complex structure. Several important buyers and suppliers influence the market. In addition, waste paper supply is not unlimited. Its availability depends on various factors including generation rate, recovery rate, and seasonality, which lead to volatile prices.

In this paper, we focus on a pulp producer and its relationships with waste paper collectors. In general, a pulp producer, also referred to as the recycler, has one production line (Fig. 2). Such a line can produce different pulp qualities from few grades of waste paper, according to several recipes. For instance, to produce pulp quality FP1, the producer uses recipe R1, which recommends a specific mix of each input grade of waste paper. The goal of the producer is to minimize procurement cost, subject to a constraint of minimum level of brightness. Therefore, production control deals with controlling the input mix, as well as the chemical whitening of the pulp.

This production process operates continuously since the cost of a shutdown and a restart is high. Temporary downtimes are planned over several days for maintenance. Furthermore, managers can adjust production rate and input mix (i.e., recipes/campaigns) according to demand, pulp market conditions and inventory levels. In this paper, this capacity to adjust production rate is referred to as Production Flexibility. It represents the ability of the production manager to increase or decrease total daily production volume, with little or no impact on profitability. Parker and Wirth (1999) defines this type of flexibility as Volume Flexibility.

In turn, the procurement strategy must be adapted in order to meet production input mix and consumption requirements. In practice, production efficiency is affected by procurement policies and vice versa. For instance, a high production rate improves operational performance, but creates waste paper scarcity problems. Along the same line, procurement policies, such as procurement contracts, reduce purchase cost, but can impact Production Flexibility by affecting available grade mix. Therefore, production and procurement policies must be analysed and optimized altogether.

This paper aims to study this coordination problem. More specifically, it aims to optimize procurement policies by assessing their value in the context of various production rates and flexibility levels. To do so, an agent-based simulation approach is used.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The coordination of procurement and production activities is an essential part of supply chain management (Bhatnagar, Chandra, & Goyal, 1993), which can be challenging in rapidly evolving and changing conditions. Recycled pulp producers face such a challenge. For instance, paper utilisation decreases worldwide, which reduces waste paper availability. Similarly, fibre content decreases in virgin paper, which has also a negative impact on recycled fibre availability. Consequently, recycled pulp producers must purchase more waste paper to maintain their production output. When combined with growing global competition, these challenges lead to increasing waste paper demand and to volatile market price and availability. Therefore, pulp producers need to assess and optimize their procurement strategies.

Supply chain management and procurement decisions are often supported by traditional optimization technics, such as mathematical programming, inventory theory, and other mathematical optimization tools, including robust and stochastic optimization. The interested reader is referred to Dekker, Bloemhof, and Mallidis (2012) for a recent review of OR application in the domain of green logistics. These ever improving tools are capable of identifying optimal decisions in specific, and even uncertain, conditions. However, although they are highly effective tools for optimizing decisions, their modelling paradigm cannot yet deal efficiently with complex situations with large amounts of concurrent events and decisions influencing each other with feedback loops and emerging phenomenon. These challenges are generally the domain of applications of simulation, which is the tool used in this study.

Simulation is used in stochastic and dynamic contexts in order to identify patterns and tendencies, which is often more essential than finding an optimal solution (Davidsson, Persson, & Holmgren, 2007; Lomi & Larsen, 1996; Moss & Edmonds, 2005). Cartier and Forgues (2006) identify the advantages of simulation in the context of applied management sciences and its role to better understand behaviours and interactions in complex systems. In addition, simulation allows managers and researchers to visualize a problem in terms of inter-related elements. The interested reader is referred to Gilbert and Troitzsch (2005) for an extensive presentation and review of simulation tools, such as cellular automata, multi-agent models and discrete event models.

In particular, agent-based simulation (i.e., ABS) is used in various disciplines, from ecology, social science, to engineering, in order to better understand dynamic and complex systems such as supply chains (Barbati, Bruno, & Genovese, 2012; Frayret, 2011; Siebers, Macal, Garnett, Buxton, & Pidd, 2010). More specifically, it focuses on the interactions of several heterogeneous agents, which have the ability to make their own decisions and act autonomously according to their environment and their interactions with other agents (Charles & Michael, 2006; Macal & North, 2010). ABS can reproduce emerging behaviours and supply chain patterns in order to study them (Albino, Carbonara, & Giannoccaro, 2007; Amini, Wakolbinger, Racer, & Nejad, 2012; Bahroun, Moalla, Baazaoui, & Campagne, 2010; Farnia, Frayret, LeBel, & Beaudry, 2013; Moyaux, Chaib-draa, & D'Amours, 2007). Bollinger, Davis, Nikolić, and Dijkema (2012) mention three advantages of ABS for supply chain optimization. First, ABS can individually simulate discrete entities with unique and heterogeneous properties and behaviours. Second, it enables explicit near real-world representations of systems. Third, ABS can emulate the behaviour of real-world actors.

Although, to our knowledge, ABS has never been directly applied to the recycled pulp and paper industry, it has been used in many contexts to optimize supply chain coordination problems. Barbati et al. (2012) identified no less than 66 academic contributions in six different families of supply chain applications. Pěchouček and Mařík (2008) reviewed some of these functionalities, which include demand forecasting (Liang & Huang, 2006), production and quality control (Castellini et al., 2011), inventory control (Kim, Kwon, & Kwak, 2010), supply chain coordination (Frayret, D'amours, Rousseau, Harvey, & Gaudreault, 2007; Gaudreault, Pesant, Frayret, & D'Amours, 2012; You & Kumar, 2006), scheduling (Lau, Huang, Mak, & Liang, 2006), supplier selection (Valluri & Croson, 2005), and supply chain decoupling point position (Cid Yañez, Frayret, Léger, & Rousseau, 2009). Concerning the procurement process, Jie and Li (2008) developed a generic procurement and inventory management process inside a discrete-event simulation. Although their model is rather simple, it reveals the basic components and attributes required. Along this line, Allwood and Lee (2005) proposed a competitive agent-based simulation model of a factory and its customers and suppliers in order to optimize strategic decisions and procurement strategies. Their study is based on a supply chain model that includes strategic inventory management and suppliers selection policies, and focuses on the comparison of competitive and non-competitive agents. Their model takes into account the adjustment of purchased quantities based on market price changes. However, it does not consider the possibility to adjust production strategies according to market price variations. In addition, these market price variations are randomly set between specific limits, and are not influenced by the production strategy, which is the case in the context of a large recycled pulp producer. Similarly, Uppin and Hebbal (2010) propose an ABS model that includes purchasing activities. However, there is no dynamic interaction between suppliers and the buyer. Furthermore, the market is not sensitive to the agents' decisions.

Similarly, some authors propose ABS applications in the context of closed-loop supply chains. For instance, Axtell, Andrews, and Small (2001) promote the use agent-based simulation in a context of industrial ecology and identify several potential advantages. Such a model was later developed in Cao, Feng, and Wan (2009) in order to study the evolution of eco-industrial parks. Similarly, Bollinger et al. (2012) developed an agent-based model of the mobile phone recycling industry, which has similarities with the recycled pulp industry. For instance, this sector includes the same constraints of raw material variations, collection and recovery rates, and secondary market. Their simulation model consists of a mobile phone closed-loop supply chain with manufacturers, recyclers, collectors, refurbishers and a global market. While this model aims to gain insights into the emerging patterns of material flows throughout the supply chain, our contribution focuses on the point of view of a single manufacturer and its procurement process, in order to optimize it. To our knowledge, there is no ABS model dedicated to the study of production-procurement coordination in the domain of recycled pulp production. The next section presents our agent-based simulation model.

This section first provides a general overview of the model. The next section gives a detailed description of each agent and their attributes.

This model deals with the upstream supply chain of a recycled pulp producer. It includes three types of actors: (1) the waste paper suppliers; (2) the waste paper market; and (3) a recycled pulp producer (Fig. 3
                        ). Physical materials (i.e., waste papers of various grades) converge from suppliers to the production line, through several processes, which includes sorting, storage and production. Recycled pulp sale is not included in this model because the objective of this study focuses on the coordination of procurement and production processes. This study does not focus of the coordination of production and sales processes. Recycled pulp producers generally use a push production strategy (i.e., make-to-stock), which assumes that pulp is sold without delay, although it is not the case in practice. Therefore, in this model, the objective of the recycled pulp producer is to meet the production plan, rather than meet specific orders.

The procurement process of the recycler consists in buying waste paper bales according to market conditions, inventories, production requirements and contractual agreements with suppliers. In this model, bales are modelled as aggregated lots with an extrinsic quality (i.e., the average quality of the tagged grades), and an intrinsic quality (i.e., the actual average quality of the bales). This latter is only used in the model in order to compute final pulp quality. This model also assumes that part of waste paper procurement is supplied through contractual agreements with suppliers signed before the start of the simulation. The rest is supplied directly from the spot market to take advantage of opportunities or meet unexpected needs.

Upon delivery at the mill, waste paper lots are controlled for quality inspection, and reclassified if needed. In the model, this process results in either an adjustment of quality, or a rejection of a proportion of the delivered waste papers according to the quality performance of the corresponding supplier. Next, the fabrication centre selects the required waste paper grades and transforms them into a finished product. Finally, because the waste paper brightness is a random variable (i.e., random intrinsic quality), the resulting pulp brightness is variable.

Concerning information (Fig. 4
                        ), it flows in the opposite path of material. At the beginning of the simulation, a production plan is generated for the next three months. This plan is updated every month, by adding at the end of the current schedule, a new month of production. A production plan consists of a list of batches of final products to be produced every day (i.e., production orders, PO). The operation manager uses this information to convert these PO into waste paper requirements according to specific recipes. Next, these requirements are sent to the warehouse manager. In turn, the warehouse sends the requested quantities to the fabrication centre and informs the operation manager about the inventory level. The procurement manager also receives information from the operation manager, including the Target Inventory. Finally, when a PO is completed, its final quality is computed according to its intrinsic quality as well as the production conditions, as described in Eqs. (1) and (2):

                         is the proportion of the waste paper grade j, Qj
                         is the intrinsic brightness of waste grade j, and U is the chemically induced increase of brightness.

This final quality if then sent to the operation manager who labels the final product.

A second information flow starts from the waste paper market (Fig. 4). The simulation model calculates a daily base price for each grade of waste paper, which is sent to the suppliers and the procurement manager. According to daily availability of waste paper, which is represented by the US waste paper inventory level (i.e., historical data), the market sends available quantity level to the procurement manager. In practice, suppliers inform individually the procurement manager of their available quantity of waste paper to purchase. Next, based on inventory levels, available waste paper quantities on spot market, and Target Inventory levels (defined as a function of the production plan), the procurement manager decides how much (if any) to buy from the spot market. In the model proposed in this paper, this procurement process is defined as a bulk process, in which the procurement manager agent buys a portion of all available quantities according to a decision process described in Section 3.2.4. Next, the market and the suppliers deliver the agreed quantities to the sorting centre. Upon delivery, the delivered lots of waste paper are partially sorted by the sorting centre, which controls the quality and updates the quantity and extrinsic quality information of these lots. This information is sent to the warehouse to update inventory information and to the procurement manager to add accordingly a rebate to incorrect invoices in case of unmet quality agreements.

This section describes the different components (passive entities) and agents (reactive and proactive entities), as introduced in the previous section.

The lots of waste paper are described by their average intrinsic and extrinsic quality, and their cost per ton. The recycle pulp characteristics include its type, its minimum brightness, its recipe, its intrinsic brightness and its total cost.

The waste paper market agent represents, in an aggregated manner, all suppliers from which the recycler can purchase waste paper on the spot market. Its main role is to define a standard price for every simulated day, which is used to compute the price of each grade. In practice, the waste paper market is a complex system that is influenced by many factors.

                            provide in-depth information about the waste paper market. In order to develop a market agent, we used Statistica (StatSoft) and Forecast Pro (Business Forecast Systems, Inc.) to analyse this information, as well as procurement reports from our industrial partner. Using regression analysis, we identified 7 factors from which we were capable of estimating the market price within an acceptable margin of error (see Section 5.2). These factors include 6 external factors, the US virgin pulp price, the US recovery volume, the US waste paper inventory, the US gross Domestic Product, the US and non-US demand, the US paper production, as well as one internal factor, the volume of waste papers purchased by the recycler in the last 30 days, which is large enough to influence market price. A multiple linear regression equation model reproducing the waste paper market behaviour was built with these factors. Based on historical data, the 6 external factors were defined a priori for each day of the entire simulation horizon in order to reproduce the actual external factors of the market conditions over the horizon. However, the agents in the simulation are informed of their value at the end of each simulated day. As explained in Section 3.2.4, these values are used during the simulation in order to affect the market price and its forecast, which are both necessary to make procurement decisions.

The waste paper market in North America is made up of a few major companies responsible for collecting and distributing waste papers in most American cities. In this model, suppliers are rather simple reactive agents, with different characteristics in terms of logistics and quality performance, and cost. These include service quality indicators (i.e., ability to deliver the required quantity and quality, both in percent), lead-time (in days), and a supply capacity (i.e., maximum waste paper available). These characteristics also include a delivery cost per ton and a price index, which represent an adjustment with respect to market price (in +/− percent). In this study, three suppliers with different attribute were created based on actual data. In the simulation, every day, supplier agents use the market price to adjust their own price according to their price index. Then, they deliver specific quantities of waste paper, as well as their corresponding invoice, as stated in the contractual agreement with the recycler. The sorting centre assesses the quality of these deliveries by simply accepting, downgrading or rejecting, and, if needed, adjusting their invoice accordingly.

The procurement manager agent is responsible for purchasing waste papers on the spot market. These purchase decisions are modelled as an aggregate decision process that defines the daily waste paper quantity purchased by the agent. One of the contributions of this model is to emulate the actual behaviour of the procurement manager. Therefore, in order to do that, we introduce mathematical functions that emulate the behaviour observed through interviews with the actual procurement manager.

In this industry, inventory management is generally a continuous review system with a reorder point calculated as the quantity of material required for a given number of production days. However, because waste paper is a commodity with a volatile price, the purchase manager can delay, or conversely, anticipate the purchase of waste paper according to his own forecast of market conditions. Therefore, this model proposes a procurement manager agent capable of not only reacting to inventory level variations with respect to an inventory target, but also capable of adjusting its procurement decision according to market conditions. In other words, this procurement manager agent uses a decision process in order to make aggregate purchase decision according to the inventory level and by assessing whether the market price of the day is advantageous compared to its forecast. Consequently, the procurement manager agent may buy unrequired waste papers on the spot market because of good market conditions, or conversely, not buy needed waste papers in poor market conditions.

As mentioned earlier, waste paper is also delivered through contractual agreements. However, unless characterized as flexible, these agreements involve standard deliveries of waste papers. A flexible procurement contract is a supply contract with quantity flexibility (Lian & Deshmukh, 2009). In the present study, the type of flexible supply contracts that is evaluated aims to cope with Production Flexibility (i.e., standard deviation of monthly production volume). In this type of flexible supply contract, the contractual volume of waste paper to deliver is adjusted according to the production volume level (and offset by the average delivery time). With or without flexible supply contract, the price paid is the market price. The only aim of this type of contract is to secure a daily supply volume of waste paper. In the simulation, these deliveries (considered as fixed w.r.t. quantity and delivery time, with a random noise according to suppliers’ logistic and quality performance) only influence procurement decisions through inventory level variations.

In brief, the procurement manager agent uses a decision process that emulates an aggregate discretionary process of buying a portion of bulk offers on the spot market. This discretionary process is based on two factors. The first factor aims to achieve a specific inventory level target, regardless of the grade of paper, which is calculated by the operation manager agent. In other words, the general behaviour of the procurement manager agent is to buy less on the spot market if the inventory level is above the inventory target, and conversely if the inventory level is below the target. This simple behaviour is influenced by two parameters. First, we define α to describe the propensity to purchase. A higher value of α means a higher probability of accepting an opportunity from the spot market. When the current inventory level matches the inventory target, α represents a standard purchasing probability. Next, we define β to describe the behaviour of the procurement manager agent with respect to the risk of shortage. For instance, an experienced buyer might accept some level of risk of shortage because his market forecast is advantageous (i.e., market might go down). In contrast, another buyer might always aim to achieve inventory target whatever market conditions. These behaviours only differ by different capacity to deal with risk. A risk-seeker agent has a higherβ than a risk-averse agent. Therefore, we define the portion F of bulk offers to purchase with respect to inventory as:

The second factor influencing the procurement manager agent concerns market conditions. It is based on a similar process. In other words, we define a second variable describing the portion of bulk offers to buy with respect to market conditions. In practice, the procurement manager receives daily the current market price, and forecasts this price for the next few months with a certain degree of error. Because the procured quantities bought by the procurement manager influence market conditions, we developed a method of emulating this forecast process that takes into account future purchase order of waste paper. This information can easily be computed based on the production plan sent by the operation manager and the production recipes. However, in order to emulate and control the forecasting error of the procurement agent, we introduced a random noise factor that emulates his more or less accurate ability to forecast the external factors influencing the market price. In other words, we used the a priori defined values of these factors, and introduced a random variation around these values within a specified range, and input these forecasted values directly into the multi-linear regression model of the market price defined earlier. Because, the values of the variables used to calculate the market price and its forecast are different, they are also different, thus leading to controlled forecast errors. This difference also stems from the use of different purchase quantity values. Indeed, to forecast the market price, the procurement manager agent uses future purchase quantities based on the production plan, while the market price model used the past 30 days of purchase. Using historical data from our industrial partners' ERP, we computed the actual forecasting error and reproduced it by fine-tuning the noise factor.

Next, in order to emulate the ability of the procurement manager to take advantage of a good market condition forecast, we introduced two parameters, ρ and τ, in order to model, respectively, the standard acceptance level and risk level, and defined in Eq. (5). These parameters directly influence the portion G of bulk offers to buy with respect to market conditions.

Next, in order to take both F and G into account, we experimented with different approaches. In order to emulate the observed behaviour of the procurement manager, who gives more importance to avoiding shortage situations, the portion P of bulk offers to buy with respect to market conditions is defined as the maximum between F and G, as illustrated in Eq. (7). Furthermore, we defined a safety stock level below which, the procurement manager agent purchases all available waste paper volumes.

                                       P
                                       =

                                          (
                                          
                                             F
                                             ,
                                             G
                                          
                                          )
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        

This aggregation function leads systematically to a larger spot market procurement volume in shortage situations, even if market conditions are poor. However, it leads to over buying in situation of good market condition, which is observed in practice. In order to avoid such situations, the operation manager has the authority to limit the purchasing process until the inventory goes down to the target level. Unfortunately, in practice, this authority is not systematically exercised, which leads sometimes to high inventory. Therefore, in order to take this aspect of the general decision process into account, we develop an optional process model in which any purchase decision is systematically overruled if the warehouse cost associated with the aggregate purchase of the day is higher than the savings it generates (based on the market price forecast). In the experiments described later, both options (with or without the purchase control policy) have been evaluated.

Finally, the last part of the decision model aims at determining the specific quantities of waste paper to buy from the spot market. Like many other industries, supplies of waste paper are limited. Scarcity affects daily availability. In order to approximate waste paper availability, we assume that the procurement manager agent can buy everywhere in the United States, which was confirmed by domain experts. Therefore, we assume that the US national waste paper inventory (i.e., historical external factor) represents the quantity offered to the procurement manager at a given time. Therefore, the daily purchased quantity O is defined by Eq. (8):

Concerning the grade of paper, the procurement manager agent purchases a proportion of each grade available according to the corresponding production requirements. The operation manager agent is responsible for calculating this grade mix. For simplification purposes, it was assumed that the same grade mix is purchased from every supplier.

According to what was bought by the procurement manager agent, lots of bales are delivered to and processed by the sorting centre agent. This simulates the behaviour of the sorting centre by adjusting, if required, the quality and the quantity of these lots. In other words, every simulated day, the sorting centre agent sorts each lot, and partially revaluates its quality. During sorting, two actions are carried out. First, the sorting agent can downgrade the grade of a proportion of the delivered lots if quality is found below a given level. The sorting agent can also reject a portion of these lots if it is unusable. The downgrade and rejection rates are specific to each supplier. However, both rates include a random noise factor in order to emulate observed data. Next, controlled lots are sent to the warehouse.

The warehouse agent is a simple reactive agent. It receives lots of waste paper from the sorting agent and forwards them to the fabrication centre when asked to do so by the operation manager agent. In practice, the warehouse consists of different storage spaces with specific logistics and cost characteristics. For example, the first storage space is in front of the first machine. Its cost is low and its capacity is very small. Other spaces are available at different handling, delivery and storage costs depending on their location and efficiency. In practice, our partner occasionally uses external warehouses at a higher cost. We define the warehouse cost of a given storage space by Eq. (9), and the total warehouse cost by Eq. (10):

The operation manager agent is responsible for computing and distributing certain information between agents. First, it computes the optimal recipe in order to produce the planned production batches. In other words, recipes can change according to market price. In order to find the optimal recipe, a small mathematical programming problem was developed in order to minimize purchasing costs with respect to quality, inventory and production constraints (e.g., a maximum level of specific grades). However, because the optimal recipe is not constant, it creates different waste paper requirements through time. In order to take this variability into account, the operation manager keeps a list of the last 30 days of production requirements. Every simulated day, the operation manager agent updates this list by adding the new requirements of that day. Then, it forecasts the next requirement for each grade by averaging the requirements of the last 30 days (i.e., moving average). Finally, it sends the adjusted requirements per grade to the procurement manager. This process aligns procurement with the changing needs of production while taking into account the impact of market price variations on recipes.

Once the recipe is computed, the operation manager agent computes the quantities of each grade of waste paper to be delivered to the fabrication centre, and sends these quantities to the warehouse. Inventory levels are adjusted accordingly. This information is also used to compute the Target Inventory and sent to the procurement manager agent. Next, the operation manager agent receives information about daily waste paper deliveries, and updates the inventory levels of each grade according to the quality information sent by the sorting centre agent.

Finally, the operation manager agent evaluates the quality of the finish product and labels it according to the actual brightness computed using the average intrinsic quality level of the lots of bales used in the fabrication process. In practice, brightness is measured automatically at the end of the fabrication process.

The fabrication centre agent is a reactive agent that simulates the production processes that transform lots of waste paper into tons of recycled pulp. For simplification purpose, the production is considered to be a single machine with a variable effectiveness and a single input (i.e., a mix of grades of waste paper). This agent simulates the transformation in a bulk process. This process first consists in computing the weighted average brightness of these lots. Next, this brightness value is increased (by a fixed number) in order to simulate the bleaching process. Therefore, the agent's ability to meet the minimum brightness of the finished product depends only on the intrinsic quality of the specific lots of waste paper used. Also, the agent is characterized by a set of attributes, which includes a variable cost (i.e., dollars per ton), a fixed cost (i.e., dollars per day), a yield (i.e., quantity of raw material needed to produce a ton of finished product, percent), and effectiveness indicators with respect to quantity (i.e., ability to produce the planned quantity, percent) and quality (i.e., ability to produce the planned quality, percent).

This section first discusses the implementation of the agent-based simulation model. Next, the method used to setup and validate the model is presented. Finally, the various experiments carried out with the simulation model are presented.

Several agent-based simulation platforms are available to implement such a model (Frayret, 2011). These platforms can be classified according to their required programming expertise and their modelling flexibility. In this model, all agent interactions are simple, and agents' behaviour is either reactive or relatively simple. In addition, researchers involved in the project have various backgrounds and expertise. For these reasons, Netlogo was selected because it has an intuitive interface, and a simple, yet powerful, programming language.

The model was setup and validated in collaboration with our industrial partner. Inputs values were based on data and information gathered from interviews, domain experts, confidential reports as well as data from various management systems and industry statistics. During the model setup, the only parameters to identify were linked to the behaviour of the procurement manager agent, which include the standard acceptance parameters α and ρ and the risk level parameters β and τ. These parameters were set in order to emulate as accurately as possible the actual buyer's behaviour. During this setup, we arbitrarily set these parameters values and simulated a standard production schedule. Then, we compared the output inventory level with the actual values. Output results were analysed with the prediction module of Statistica and the parameters were adjusted iteratively in order to obtain realistic inventory values. The best combination of parameters has an average difference of −4 percent with respect to actual numbers. This purchase behaviour was used for all experiments. Then, validation experiments were carried out to validate other performance indicators. To do so, we carried out 30 repetitions of simulation and compared the results with actual figures from 2012 for most indicators, and between 2009 and 2012 for the inventory level and inventory variation. Both options (i.e., with and without the purchase control policy) were simulated and used to validate the model.

The main objective of this project is to identify cost efficient waste paper procurement and production policies. In order to do this, we carried out two series of experiments. First, in order to evaluate production policies, we introduce three design factors related to Planned Capacity (PC), Production Flexibility (PF), and Target Inventory (TI) as defined in Table 1
                        . Planned Capacity is defined as the average production capacity planned by the production manager agent. Production Flexibility is defined as the standard deviation of the monthly variations of production volume.




This first series of experiments was carried out with and without the purchase control policy. The resulting experimental design is a 3321 full factorial design (3 factors at 3 modalities and 1 factor at 2 modalities). This complete plan was repeated 35 times for a total of 1890 simulation runs. Some parameters had a fixed value for the entire experiment (purchase control policy, forecast accuracy, recipe optimization, sorting accuracy, portion of purchase under contract, recipe robustness). These values were set within observed values. Finally, each simulation run consisted in simulating every production day between 2001 and 2012, using historical data as external parameters. Warm up time is therefore negligible.

Next, in order to analyse the impacts of flexible contracts, we carried out a second series of experiments. However, because the purchase control policy has a direct impact on the procurement process performance, flexible contracts were tested without the use of the purchase control policy. Therefore, the same plan of experiment was replicated 40 times without the purchase control policy for a total of an additional 2160 simulation runs. Results are analysed in the next section.

This section first presents the key performance indicators (i.e., KPI) used to analyse the performance of the studied procurement and production policies. Next, the validation results are presented. Finally, the general results are analysed.

In order to have a representative view of the performance of the studied policies, we developed, with our industrial partner, several KPI. Confidential management reports were also analysed in order to identify the current indicators used to make decisions. Along the same line, interviews with domain experts were conducted to validate their relevance.

The first KPI used is the total cost, and includes purchasing cost, warehousing cost, fixed and semi-fixed costs, and variable cost, as shown in Eq. (11). Note that warehousing cost is already defined in Eq. (10).

The first aspect validated was the market price model. To do this, the model output values were compared to historical market prices. In order to ensure the validity of this model, the internal factor of the market equation (i.e., volume of waste papers purchased by the recycler) was replaced by actual historical data concerning waste paper delivery, which is comparable to waste papers purchased over a long period (Fig. 7
                        ). An average difference of 16 percent (R
                        2 = 0.78) between both prices was recorded between 2001 and 2012, which is acceptable.

Next, the validation of the entire model was carried out (Table 2
                        ). All variations were shown to domain experts and validated. More specifically, all indicators, except one, are within a ±6 percent range with actual data. However, inventory variation is smaller in the simulated results. This result can easily be explained by the systematic use of the purchase control policy that is only partially applied in practice. Therefore, we also validated the model without the use of the purchase control policy.


                        Table 3
                         shows that the purchase control policy has a major impact on inventory indicators. More specifically, the purchase control policy decreases inventory variation by almost 30 percent, and the average inventory level by 6 percent. Without purchase control policy, inventory variation increases by 6 percent, and the average inventory level increases by 5 percent. Both options represent a lower and upper bound of the inventory performance observed in practice.




As mentioned earlier, in the remainder of this analysis, all results involve simulations carried out with the purchase control policy. This choice was made because the model without purchase control policy has inconsistencies with respect to inventory level over a long period. More specifically, if the procurement manager agent buys a large quantity of waste paper because of good market conditions, this situation can impact procurement decisions over a long period. This affects artificially the results of the entire simulation run. The systematic use of the purchase control policy does not affect the validity of the model, although it represents a lower bound with respect to inventory indicators.

The first experiment focused on the study of the impact of different inventory and production policies on cost, inventory level and quality. Next, we studied the use of flexible contracts without the purchase control policy. This section presents and analyses these results.

Waste paper procurement represents more than 40 percent of total cost. The other costs are either fixed or semi-fixed. In practice, they represent between 15 percent and 25 percent of total cost. Similarly, warehouse cost usually represent between 0 percent and 15 percent of total cost. In the experiments, the factor that has the most impact on total cost is Production Flexibility (t-value = 31.35), followed by Target Inventory (t-value = −21.43), and Planned Capacity (t-value = 13.80), However, Planned Capacity has the most impact on purchase cost alone (t-value = 110.28). Indeed, planned production capacity (i.e., the planned production quantity) affects directly waste paper requirements, which in turn, influence positively market price.




As shown in Table 4, reducing production capacity temporarily in order to match demand significantly decreases waste paper consumption, which in turn reduces the price paid per ton of waste paper. Therefore, it is better to adjust capacity utilisation to its minimum level, with respect to demand satisfaction, than systematically producing at maximum capacity. This strategy allows the producer to save on fixed and semi-fixed costs. However, these savings are only slightly smaller than the procurement cost saving, because this latter represents a significantly larger proportion of total cost. In addition, reducing planned production capacity provides the procurement manager with leverage with respect to supplier selection, which is more difficult to quantify and model.

Concerning Target Inventory (TI), as shown
                            in Fig. 8
                           , a high Target Inventory tends to decrease purchase cost (t-value = −63.65). This can be explained by the fact that the ratio (i.e., Eq. (4)), which is used to compute the portion of waste paper availability to buy on the spot market, increases or decreases at a lower rate (for a given inventory variation) for a higher Target Inventory. In other word, a given inventory variation will lead to a larger ratio variation if the Target Inventory is small. Therefore, for an inventory variation below the Target Inventory, the procured volume is larger if the Target Inventory is small. The practical consequence is that the procurement manager agent reacts faster (i.e., buy more) with a lower Target Inventory, which is a rational behaviour to avoid waste paper shortage. The result of this behaviour with a high Target Inventory is that the procurement manager agent is allowed to have a larger inventory variation below the Target Inventory before it reacts and buys, whatever the market condition. Therefore, the probability to purchase in the context of a good market forecast is higher, resulting in a small decrease of purchase cost.

This behaviour is intensified with a lower Production Flexibility. In other words, a lower Production Flexibility leads to a lower purchase cost (t-value = 29.91). This can similarly be explained because Production Flexibility directly affects the Target Inventory. Therefore, smaller variations of the Target Inventory reduce purchase cost by reducing spot market procurement due to a lower inventory ratio. Along the same line (see Table 5), reducing Target Inventory leads to a much lower warehouse cost for obvious reasons (i.e., less inventory to maintain). However, the effect of Target Inventory on both purchase and warehouse costs illustrates the importance of purchase cost compared to warehouse cost. Similarly, results presented in Table 6 reveal that Production Flexibility has generally a negative impact on costs. This trend appears slightly more important when Target Inventory is higher, as shown in Fig. 8.

As presented previously, two performance indicators related to inventory were analysed: average inventory level and inventory variation (i.e., standard deviation of inventory level). As expected, the factor that has the most impact on inventory level is Target Inventory, as shown in Fig. 9
                           . The higher the Target Inventory is, the higher the inventory level. Similarly, Planned Capacity has a positive impact on inventory level, because the Target Inventory level is a function of the planned production volume.

Concerning inventory variation (Fig. 10
                           
                           ), it decreases when Target Inventory increases. During complementary experiments without purchase control policy, the effect was actually the opposite. This phenomenon is a consequence of the behaviour of the procurement manager agent, who reacts and buys larger volume to avoid shortage with a lower Target Inventory (i.e., spot market procurement volume is larger for any given volume below the Target Inventory, if this latter is lower). However, with a higher Target Inventory, the inventory cost becomes higher than the benefits of purchasing waste papers due to good market conditions. Therefore, the use of the purchase control policy tends to decrease inventory variation with a higher Target Inventory, because it prevents the procurement manager agent to purchase unnecessary waste paper in good market conditions.

However, this phenomenon is mitigated by Planned Capacity, which slightly increases with inventory variation (Fig. 10). This can also be explained by the same behaviour of the procurement agent. In other words, target inventory increases with Planned Capacity. Therefore, when this latter increases, the procurement agent increases the spot market procurement volume as well. As mentioned before, this gives the agent more flexibility to purchase waste paper because of a good market condition, which in turn, leads to a higher inventory variation.

Concerning the impact of Production Flexibility (Fig. 11
                           ), it positively affects, although slightly, both the average inventory level and the inventory variation. A higher Production Flexibility involved larger increments or decrements of production level from one month to the next, which directly affects Target Inventory. Therefore, because Target Inventory varies within a larger range for a higher Production Flexibility, the inventory variation also increases. Concerning the inventory level, if the production level is increased, spot market procurement is used to meet production requirements. However, if the production level is decreased, because the volume of waste paper delivered daily through supply contracts is fixed, the inventory level tends to remains slightly higher. Therefore, overall, a higher Production Flexibility implies a slightly higher inventory level, as seen in Fig. 11.

The two most significant factors that affect quality are Target Inventory and Planned Capacity. Because both factors affect positively the inventory level, they both improve the likelihood of having the right product in stock for any recipe to produce. Consequently, because the right mix of waste paper is available, the probability of having quality issues is lower, as seen in Fig. 12
                           . Most quality issues are linked to low inventory level, when there is not enough volume of the required grades, which forces the production manager to select a lower grade, thereby increasing the risk of producing a lower brightness than required.
                        

However, this specific effect of Planned Capacity on quality does not represent what the industrial partner observes in reality. Thus, it is a limitation of this simulation model. Indeed, this model does not include the fact that a lower production level tends to improve quality control in general, and so, at every step of production including picking the right waste paper grade. Therefore, in practice, a lower Planned Capacity tends to improve quality.

As far as Production Flexibility is concerned, the higher it is, the higher the chance to run out of a specific grade of waste paper. Therefore, it also increases the chances to have quality issues, as seen in Fig. 13
                           .

The second experiment aims to assess the impact of flexible contracts. First, flexible contracts have no observed impact on purchase cost, because contract prices are aligned with market prices. Furthermore, because waste paper deliveries adapt automatically to production level, flexible contracts reduce the purchasing freedom of the procurement manager agent. Thus, in case of bad market conditions, the procurement manager agent cannot reduce deliveries, which, in turn, can increase total purchase costs. However, flexible contracts tend to reduce warehousing cost when Production Flexibility increases (see Fig. 14
                        ). More specifically, warehousing cost is reduced when production level decreases. In neutral market conditions, fixed contracts maintain artificially a higher than required level of inventory, while a flexible contract automatically decreases inventory level.

The inventory indicators presented in Table 7 corroborates this result. These indicators are expressed as variations with respect to the average corresponding values obtained with no contract flexibility.




First, flexible contract tends to reduce the inventory level as Production Flexibility increases, which is consistent with the explanation provided earlier. As far as inventory variation is concerned, flexible contracts have a similar effect. This can be explained because, with flexible contracts, a smaller portion of deliveries is actually controlled by the procurement manager agent, which can therefore make less discretionary purchase decisions.

Overall, although they do not seem to have an impact of purchase cost, as mentioned earlier, flexible contracts tend to stabilize inventory indicators, by reducing the negative impacts of Production Flexibility. This leads, in turn, to decreased warehouse cost.

Consequently, flexible contract policy seems to not be advantageous when running at a steady production capacity. However, if Production Flexibility is necessary to meet varying demand, then flexible contract should be considered.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

This paper proposed an agent-based simulation to study and optimize various procurement and manufacturing policies in the waste paper industry. To do so, instead of developing a theoretical model with many simplifying assumptions, a detailed simulation model based on a practical case was developed so as to emulate as accurately as possible production and procurement processes, as well as the procurement manager's behaviour. A set of experiments was carried out to validate the model and confirm that the simulation model reproduces accurately most performance indicators.

Next, different production and procurement policies were tested in order to analyse their performance. More specifically, factors including planned production level, Production Flexibility, Target Inventory as well as contract flexibility were studied.

The main conclusion of this study is that Production Flexibility has a negative impact on costs, inventory and quality, which is why in practice, pulp production plants usually try to operate at a steady production level. However, it is possible to partially reduce these issues with the introduction of flexible contracts, although only a limited effect has been observed in our experiments.

A more significant strategy to improve costs is to reduce production level to the minimum required to meet demand, without necessarily adjusting constantly Planned Capacity. Along the same line, in practice, the reduction of production level has a positive impact of quality, which our simulation model fails to capture. This is an improvement to be made in future research.

Finally, a higher Target Inventory leads to a small cost improvement by giving the procurement manager more freedom to take advantage of good market conditions. However, this overall cost performance depends on the importance of warehousing costs.

As far as future work is concerned, these results represent a rather small part of all possible analysis. Factors including forecast accuracy, smart grade mixing, sorting process, percentage of purchase under contracts, suppliers’ breakdown, and recipe robustness were fixed a priori and could be analysed as well.

For example, sorting technology and recipe robustness could be studied in order to evaluate, and ultimately improve quality variability. Suppliers’ breakdown, flexible contracts and fixed quantities under contracts could also be studied to further improve procurement.

Finally, the simulation model includes many processes from procurement to pulp production. However, only a few of all processes were actually modelled in an aggregated manner. Other processes, such as transport management, inventory management and handling, pulp sales, finished product warehousing and other raw materials procurement and storage, could be included in the model in order to be more accurate.
