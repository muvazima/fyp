In stage 2, heart sound segmentation points and peaks are first automatically located based on a novel method STMHT, and then S1 and S2 are automatically extracted according to the relationship between the systolic time interval and the diastolic time interval. In stage 3, in the frequency domain, a novel method is first proposed to generate the secondary envelopes

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Heart disease is the most common overall cause of death for people worldwide. According to the World Health Organization [47], heart diseases were the top major killers from 2000 to 2011. Thus, using a modern information processing method to diagnose heart disease is one of the most important medical research areas [44]. Currently, methods for the diagnosis of heart valve disorders include non-invasive techniques (electrocardiograms, chest X-rays, heart sound analysis and ultrasound imaging and Doppler techniques) and invasive techniques (angiography, transozefagial and echocardio-graph). Of these methods, heart sound analysis is a noninvasive, economical, easy and efficient method widely used to diagnose heart disease and evaluate heart functions during medical check-ups for adults and children, such as ventricular septal defects (VSD) diagnosis [40], fetal heart rate extraction algorithm testing [5], fetal examination [18], valvular heart disease diagnosis [8], heart valve disease identification [24] and children’s congenital heart disease screening [36]. Heart sounds are generated by vibrations induced by valve closure, abnormal valve opening, vibrations in the ventricular chambers, tensing of the chordae tendineae, and by turbulent or abnormal blood flow across valves or between cardiac chambers [17]. Basic heart sound signals are primarily composed of four sound types, including S1, S2 and two weak sounds, called the third sound (S3) and the fourth sound (S4). S1 is produced by the closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves at the beginning of isovolumetric ventricular contraction. S2 is produced by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves at the beginning of isovolumetric ventricular relaxation. S3, when audible, occurs early in ventricular filling and may represent tensing of the chordae tendineae and the atrioventricular ring, which is the connective tissue supporting the tricuspid and mitral valves valve leaflets. S4, when audible, is caused by vibration of the ventricular wall during atrial contraction and is usually associated with a stiffened ventricle and is therefore heard in patients with ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial ischemia, or in older adults. Although these four sounds may be audible by the auscultation of the heart and occur in the frequency range of 20–2000Hz, unitary murmurs such as a systolic ejection murmur (e.g., aortic stenosis) and a pan systolic murmur (e.g.,mitral regurgitation) mostly appear between S1 and S2 with different noise patterns [14]. However, S3 and S4 appear at extremely low amplitudes with low frequency components and are difficult to detect during normal auscultation. Therefore, the analysis of S1 and S2 plays an important role in heart sound analysis. To obtain more information on heart sounds to diagnose heart sounds with higher accuracy, heart sound segmentation used to extract S1 and S2 is first conducted, and then the efficient features are extracted from S1 and S2. Finally, a classification method is used to diagnose heart diseases.

In recent years, the reported studies on heart sound segmentation can be summarized into three categories. In the first category, the performance of heart sound segmentation is quite good with reference electrocardiography [25,11]. However, in children with left or right hypertrophic ventricles, the axis deviation of the heart causes an abnormality on the electrocardiograph signal, which complicates heart sound segmentation [35]. Another category makes use of the frequency domain-based segmentation algorithms, which were proposed with tracking heart sound spectra [20,19,12,29]. However, the selection of the threshold and the filtering of the unexpected noise remain difficult problems with this method type, and few studies mention this issue. The third category is the envelope-based segmentation method, which has been studied by many researchers [48,14,32]. However, the selection of the threshold and filtering of unexpected noise remain difficult problems in this method. Furthermore, the study [48] revealed that locating the local peaks of S1 and S2 remains extremely difficult with this method. Fortunately, the novel 
                        
                           STMHT
                        
                     -based method of automatic heart sound segmentation and peak location proposed by the study [39] has been reported to provide sufficient performance compared with a published algorithm [48] that was demonstrated to be better than other segmentation methods.

As an efficient feature defined in the frequency domain, the frequency width of the envelope over a given threshold value (
                        
                           Thv
                        
                     ) has been verified to be useful for detecting heart diseases [6] and for diagnosing VSD [40]. However, for many types of heart diseases, it is difficult to extract frequency widths with a smaller

                      (Fig. 4(b)). Moreover, to achieve higher classification accuracy for diagnosing different types of heart disease, different

                      values must be considered. For example, the study [6] indicated that the highest classification accuracy is 96.88% for diagnosing MR at

                      proposed by the study [38] was evaluated and found to be efficient at diagnosing many types of heart diseases, such as aortic regurgitation (AR), aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR). However, using FFM for features to diagnose heart diseases involves complicated computation. Therefore, to reduce the computation of the proposed diagnostic system, principal components analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique for finding new principal components in high-dimension data and is used to make a diagnostic system more simple and effective in many studies, such as those involving heart disease diagnosis [3], thyroid disease diagnosis [9], cardiac death diagnosis [16], coronary artery disease diagnosis [10], data clustering [22], cardiovascular diseases diagnosis [37] and electrocardiogram arrhythmias diagnosis [50].

Recently, as a classification method, support vector machines (SVMs) have been proposed as an effective statistical learning method for the classification of different data classes using classification curves [45] and have been successfully used for the solution of many problems, such as handwritten digital recognition [27], cancer diagnosis [2], and heart murmur classification [40,6]. In the study [40], an SVM-based efficient calculation procedure for generating a classification curve was proposed that can successfully diagnose VSD.

In this study, an innovative intelligent system for diagnosing heart disease is proposed. To achieve this intelligent diagnostic system, this study is arranged into four stages. In stage 1, an envelope

                      is extracted from the heart sound signal

Many researchers have used the Daubechies wavelet DB10 as the mother wavelet for filtering heart sound signals [28,6,7]. Therefore, the DB10 is used as the mother wavelet in this study.

The envelope CSCW, which was proposed by our studies [14,32], was reported to provide sufficient performance compared with the conventional Shannon envelope and Hilbert envelope algorithms, which were used as the empirical or manual methods and the automatic selection method to estimate heart sound segmentation, respectively. However, unexpected noise remains a difficult problem in this method. To overcome this problem, another envelope

In the frequency domain, the frequency width of the envelope over a given threshold value has been verified as useful for detecting heart murmurs [6] and diagnosing ventricular septal defects [40]. However, for many other heart diseases, it is difficult to extract frequency widths with a smaller

                           . Moreover, it is also difficult to automatically extract the frequency width. To automatically extract the frequency width around frequency components, according to the general frequency bandwidth definition [46], the frequency widths defined in Fig. 4(c) and (g) correspond to their frequency components (

To reduce the computation involved in using FFM features to diagnose heart diseases and simply the diagnostic system, dimension reduction was implemented to investigate its effects on classification. The principle components analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique for finding new principal components in high-dimension data and is used to make a diagnostic system more simple and effective in many studies, such as heart disease detection [3], thyroid disease diagnosis [9], cardiac death diagnosis [16], coronary artery disease diagnosis [10], data clustering [22], cardiovascular disease diagnosis [37] and electrocardiogram arrhythmia diagnosis [50]. The PCA feature reduction method involves the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix, sorting eigenvectors in descending order of eigenvalue and finally projecting the actual data into the directions of sorted eigenvectors.

The Pareto chart provides a tool for visualizing the Pareto principle, which states that a small set of problems affecting a common outcome tend to occur much more frequently than the remainder and has been used to present the percent variability explained by each principal component (Fig. 7
                                    ). The Pareto chart of a typical PCA in Fig. 7 shows the explained variance (blue

As a classification method, support vector machines (SVMs) have been proposed as an effective statistical learning method for the classification of different data classes by classification curves [45] and have been successfully used to determine the solutions of many problems, including heart murmur classification [40,6], cancer diagnosis [2], and handwritten digital recognition [27]. In the study [40], an efficient calculation procedure for generating a classification curve surrounding the given datasets was proposed and successfully diagnosed ventricular septal defects (VSDs).

To evaluate the performance of this intelligent system for diagnosis of common heart diseases (AF, AR, MR, NM and PS), the proposed method is compared to the multi-support vector machine (M-SVM) method proposed in a previous study [6], which achieved very high classification accuracies: 96.88% for diagnosing AF at threshold value (

                        . The PCA-DHMM approach proposed by a study [33] yielded more successful diagnosing results for detecting PS with an accuracy of 98.3% than other studies [30,41], and the multi-level basis selection (MLBS) method proposed in another study [31], which achieved a higher specificity of 98.31% for diagnosing MR than other selection methods. The comparison results of the diagnosis of total sounds summarized in Table 7
                         are shown in Table 8
                        . In Table 8:

                              The accuracy results obtained from the M-SVM method are the highest classification accuracies of detection for AF, AR, MR, NM and PS at

The accuracy results obtained from the PCA-DHMM method are the highest classification accuracies of detection of AF, AR, MR, NM and PS by setting the p parameters at 5, 8,3, 8 and 5, respectively.

The comparative results shown in Table 8 tell us the following:

                              As for the AF case, the 91.2% Sp achieved by PCA-DHMM is higher than that achieved by other methods, but the 90.6% Se is less than the Se of other methods. However, our method achieved the highest classification accuracy

Moreover, the 90.6% Sp achieved by our method tells us that other diseases are easily diagnosed as AF, which is due to the fact that classification curves

The efficiency of our proposed method for diagnosing AF, AR, MR and PS diseases is evaluated via comparison with the other efficient methods mentioned in Table 8.

An efficient procedure proposed in our previous study [40] has been evaluated and can successfully diagnose clinical heart disease VSD, as re-summarized in Table 9

                         in detecting total sounds, including learning sounds used to generate classification curves and new sounds. To evaluate the performance of this intelligent system for diagnosis of VSD, the intelligent system proposed in the present study is compared to the method in the previous study [40] for diagnosis of VSD in Table 9.

                        ). Based on the boundary curves plotted in Fig. 10, the diagnostic results for the total sounds summarized in Table 9 were achieved and are shown in Table 10. Because this study extracts more features than our previous study [40], the comparative diagnostic results in Table 10 indicate that the results of using our method in this study are all better than our previously proposed method [40]. Moreover, this system has S1 and S2 automatic location functionality, which can reduce diagnosis error because the frequency components are usually different between S1 and S2. The features are automatically extracted, which can also reduce manual error because the feature extraction does not require artificially set auxiliary parameter such as the

This study proposed an innovative intelligent system for diagnosing heart diseases. The innovation of this study is primarily reflected in the automatic S1 and S2 extraction, automatic 2-dimensional feature

                      generation and classification curve generation. To accomplish this intelligent diagnosis system, the procedure for the diagnostic system implementation was arranged as the following four stages. Stage 1 described an envelope 
                        
                           
                              
                                 E
                              
                              
                                 T
                              
                           
                        
                      for heart sound signal 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 T
                              
                           
                        
                      filtered using the wavelet decomposition method. In stage 2, heart sound segmentation points and peaks were first automatically located based on a novel method, 
                        
                           STMHT
                        
                     , and then S1 and S2 were automatically extracted according to the diastole time interval, which is generally greater than the systole time interval in one period heart sound. In stage 3, in the frequency domain, a novel method was first proposed to generate the secondary envelopes

                      were first generated for disease sounds, and then, based on the classification curves, the diagnostic method was defined to diagnose detected sounds. To evaluate the performance of this automatic system, the total sound data (188-period AF sounds from 14 patients, 181-period AR sounds from 17 patients, 257-period MR sounds from 25 patients, 325-period NM sounds from 25 individuals, 150-period PS sounds from seven patients, 129-period SVSD sounds from 21 patients, 128-period MVSD sounds from 21 patients and 93-period LVSD sounds from 15 patients) were validated and classified with higher classification accuracies. Therefore, this proposed intelligent diagnosis system provides an efficient way to diagnose these types of heart diseases. In addition, further studies concerning methods to manage the sounds where S1 cannot be segmented from S2 using the STMHT method, to characterize the physical meaning by the frequency components and to build the models for the boundary curves proposed will be considered in the future.
