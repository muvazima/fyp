                  It is well known that two-dimensional (2D) filter bank is far removed from a straightforward extension of one-dimensional (1D) filter bank. There are many challenging problems on the theory and design methods for the 2D filter bank. Among these problems, the perfect-reconstruction (PR) theory of the 2D DFT modulated filter bank with arbitrary modulation and decimation matrices remains an unsolved difficulty, which is the focus of this paper. The necessary and sufficient condition for perfect reconstruction (PR) is derived by using the polyphase decomposition of the analysis and synthesis filters, as well as the fast implementation structure of the filter bank. Then, the PR condition in frequency domain is transformed into a set of quadratic equations with respect to the prototype filter (PF), which is utilized to formulate the design problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Numerical examples are included to verify the validity of the PR condition and the effectiveness of the design method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Among general two-dimensional (2D) filter banks, 2D modulated filter banks are of particular interest due to their ease of design and implementation (see [1] for fundamentals on 2D filter bank). Furthermore, 2D modulated filter banks can provide 2D fine frequency tiling and good directional selectivity. Generally, 2D modulated filter banks can be categorized into two classes: 2D cosine modulated filter banks (CMFBs) [2–9] and 2D DFT modulated filter banks (DMFBs) [10–15]. During the past two decades, the attention has to a large extent been paid to the theory and design of 2D CMFBs. The support permissibility and perfect reconstruction (PR) condition of the 2D two-parallelogram CMFBs were investigated in [2]. Nevertheless, the 2D two-parallelogram paraunitary CMFBs cannot provide high stopband attenuation due to lack of vertex permissibility. A numerically efficient algorithm was proposed for the design of the two-parallelogram CMFBs [8], which improves the stopband attenuation by relaxing the PR property. In [3], theory and design of 2D four-parallelogram CMFBs were exploited. In [6], 2D PR modulated filter banks with triangular supports were designed from a 2D complex prototype filter (PF) whose passband support is a triangle that is just half of a parallelepiped-shaped passband support defined by the sampling matrix. 2D oversampled PR CMFBs were considered in [7].

On the other hand, there has been increasing interest in the 2D DMFBs. 2D critically sampled DMFBs were preliminarily constructed from one-dimensional (1D) filters [1]. However, 2D critically sampled DMFBs with PR cannot behave high stopband attenuation due to the non-permissible configuration [2]. In [10], 2D oversampled separable DMFBs were constructed by tensors of 1D DMFBs and provided good directional selectivity. However, for 2D separable filter banks, the degrees of design freedom are heavily restricted and the frequency tiling is limited to be rectangular. Compared with separable counterparts, 2D non-separable filter banks offer more flexibility and usually provide better overall performance [5]. Therefore, subsequent research mainly concentrates on 2D non-separable DMFBs. In [11], the permissibility of the 2D DMFBs was analyzed from a pictorial viewpoint. It was shown that the 2D DMFBs can have good PR property and high stopband attenuation only if the filter banks are fully oversampled, a necessary condition for the filter bank to possess good overall performance. Also, the bi-iterative second-order cone program (BI-SOCP) was utilized to design the filter banks with nearly PR (NPR) therein. In [13], the modified Newton's method was presented to design the 2D DMFBs with single-prototype. The necessary and sufficient condition was derived for the 2D 2× oversampled DMFBs and 2D critically sampled modified DFTDFBs (MDMFBs) to be PR [12]. The equivalence between these two types of filter banks was established in the single-prototype case. A lifting-based method was proposed for designing the 2D 2× oversampled DMFBs with structurally PR and a numerical algorithm was presented to design the 2D critically sampled MDFTDFBs with NPR. In [14], the 2D critically-sampled MDFTDFBs were redesigned by an iterative algorithm, which suppressed the numerical algorithm both in performance and computational efficiency. However, the necessary and sufficient condition for PR remains an unsolved problem for the 2D DMFBs with arbitrary modulation and decimation matrices, which heavily restricts the development of the filter bank.

In this paper, we investigate the theory and design of the 2D DMFBs with arbitrary modulation and decimation matrices. A necessary and sufficient condition for the PR of the filter banks is derived from the polyphase decomposition of the analysis and synthesis filters. Also, the fast implementation structure of the filter banks is constructed. To the best of our knowledge, the PR condition and fast structure have not been derived for the 2D DMFBs with arbitrary modulation and decimation matrices before. Then, the PR condition in frequency domain is converted into a set of quadratic equations with the PF (termed as spatial domain condition), which leads us to formulate the design of the filter banks into an unconstrained optimization problem whose objective function consists of the PR condition and frequency selectivity of the PF. By setting the gradient vector of the objective function to be zero, the PF is iteratively optimized with closed-form formula. The validity of the PR condition and the effectiveness of the design algorithm are verified by the numerical examples.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the general structure of 2D DMFBs is reviewed, the PR condition is derived and fast implementation structure is constructed. In Section 3, the PR condition is transformed into quadratic equations with the PFs and the design algorithm is presented. In Section 4, several numerical examples are given. Finally, conclusion is presented in Section 5.

                        , the filter bank is fully oversampled. It is shown in [11] that only 2D fully oversampled DMFBs are permissible, that is, the filter banks can simultaneously possess small reconstruction error and high stopband attenuation. Nevertheless, the permissibility is just the necessary condition for the filter banks to possess good overall performance. In what follows, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the PR of the filter bank using the polyphase decomposition.

In this subsection, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the PR of the 2D DMFBs with arbitrary modulation and decimation matrices.

One of the key features of modulated filter bank is that they can be implemented with very efficient structure, which makes them very popular in practical applications. For instance, 1D 2M-channel DFT modulated filter bank with the decimation factor M allows the fast decomposition and reconstruction of signals via the M-point DFT and inverse DFT [19]. In terms of the polyphase representations in (19), 2D DMFBs also allow fast signal decomposition and reconstruction via the 2D

As we know, design of 2D filter banks is a highly challenging work, even when it is modulated one. In this section, we present an iterative approach to design 2D DFT modulated filter banks with arbitrary modulation and decimation matrices (under fundamental restriction shown in Section 2.1). The good overall performance of the designed filter bank can be assured by careful formulation of the design problem and efficient algorithm. In view of this point, a spatial domain PR condition is derived for the 2D DMFBs. Based on the condition, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to design the filter banks. In this paper, we concentrate on the design of 2D single-prototype DMFBs.

With the frequency domain condition (19), PR filter bank can be designed by means of some parametric structures of the polyphase matrices

                        , for instance, the lattice structure [20]. However, due to the highly nonlinear relationship between the performance of the filter bank and the structure parameters, it is difficult to design filter bank with fine performance. Similar to the design of 1D CMFBs [21], the PR condition in (21) is formulized into quadratic equations with respect to the analysis PF, termed as the spatial domain PR condition, shown as follows.

The PR condition in (21) contains

                              Up to now, the PR condition in spatial domain has been derived, which is a set of finite quadratic equations with respect to the coefficients vector of the PF. This condition will be used in the design of the filter banks in the next subsection.
                           

Generally, design of 2D DFT modulated filter banks involves several performance measures, including reconstruction error, stopband attenuation, and passband flatness. Since linear phase is an important property in several applications [22], the PF is assumed to be linear phase. Without loss of generality, the PF is assumed to be symmetric with

Similar to that in [14], good overall performance can be assured by small reconstruction error and high stopband attenuation. Accordingly, the design problem is formulated into the following unconstrained optimization problem

                            It took 8 iterations for the proposed algorithm to converge. The impulse and magnitude responses of the resultant PF are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)
                           , respectively. Table 1
                            lists the design results of the bi-iterative second-order cone program (BI-SOCP) method in [11] and proposed algorithm for comparison, where there are two values in SA column for the BI-SOCP method due to the double-prototype. From Table 1, it is observed that the filter bank designed by the BI-SOCP method achieves better overall performance than that by the proposed one owing to the fact that the double-prototype filter bank in [11] possesses double degrees of design freedom as that in proposed method.

In optimization problem (43), α serves to achieve trade-off between the reconstruction error and stopband attenuation. In order to verify this viewpoint, the filter bank is redesigned by the proposed algorithm with 
                              α
                              =
                              0.1
                           . The performance measures of the generated filter bank are illustrated in Table 1. The impulse and magnitude responses of the obtained PF are plotted in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), respectively. As can be seen from Table 1, the reconstruction error gets worse with increased α, while stopband attenuation is improved. Generally, parameter α can be adjusted according to desired trade-off between the reconstruction property and stopband characteristic. Besides, parameter β serves to seek compromise between the stopband attenuation and passband flatness. Although there is no rigorous rule to determine the parameter, quite a number of examples suggest that 
                              β
                              ∈
                              [

                              ]
                            is appropriate range.

                            It took 11 iterations for the proposed algorithm to converge. The magnitude responses of the PF and analysis filters are illustrated in Fig. 4
                           . The design results of the modified Newton's method [13] and proposed algorithm are contrasted in Table 2
                           . It is observed that compared with the method [13], the proposed algorithm can lead to filter bank with much smaller reconstruction error at a slightly degradation of stopband attenuation. The reason is straightforward, reconstruction error is directly minimized in the proposed algorithm while that in [13] is restricted by the attainable stopband attenuation.

                            The filter bank is with low redundancy ratio 9/4. It took 20 iterations for the algorithm to terminate. The impulse and magnitude responses of the generated PFs are depicted in Fig. 5

                            presents the design results of the BI-SOCP method in [11], the modified Newton's method in [13] and proposed algorithm for contrast. From Table 3, it is observed that the filter bank generated by the proposed algorithm possesses remarkable smaller reconstruction error than Newton's method. The reason is similar to that of Example 2. Therefore, when requiring 2D single-prototype DMFBs with low redundancy ratio, the proposed algorithm is a better choice compared with the modified Newton's method. Besides, the proposed algorithm also achieves smaller reconstruction error than the BI-SOCP method while maintains comparable stopband attenuation.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The main contribution of this paper is to derive the necessary and sufficient PR condition for 2D DFT modulated filter banks with arbitrary modulation and decimation matrices. Meanwhile, as another important result, we have derived the spatial domain condition of PR, which facilitates us to propose an efficient iterative algorithm. Several numerical examples have verified the validity of the PR condition and also demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can yield filter banks with good overall performance.
