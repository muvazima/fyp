                  The eigenvector method (EM) is well-known to derive information from pairwise comparison matrices in decision making processes. However, this method is logically incomplete since its actual numerical error is unknown and its reliability is doubted by such phenomena as “right–left asymmetry”, “rank reversal”, and reversal of “order of intensity of preference”.
                  In this paper, we associate EM with some standard measuring procedure, analyze this procedure from the viewpoint of measurement theory, and find the actual EM error. We show that the above phenomena have the same cause and are eliminated when the EM errors are taken into account.
                  The full decision support tool, which has all components of a standard measuring tool, is composed of pairwise comparisons as an initial measuring procedure, EM as a data processor, and the obtained formulas for EM errors as an error indicator. We consider two versions of this tool based on the right and the left principal eigenvectors of a pairwise comparison matrix. Both versions are equally suitable to measure and rank any comparable elements with positive numerical values, and have the same mean relative errors equal to the square root of the double Saaty’s Consistency Index.
                  Using the mean relative error, we find the simple upper estimate for maximum permissible errors not impeding the reliable ranking. This estimate imposes tight restrictions on inconsistency of expert judgements in decision making processes with a large number of alternatives. These restrictions are much stronger than previously thought.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Pairwise comparison matrices are handy to represent the preferences of experts in decision making processes. Different methods are applied to derive finished information from these matrices (e.g., see Barzilai, 1997; Choo & Wedley, 2004; Cook & Kress, 1988; Hovanov, Kolari, & Sokolov, 2008; Jones & Mardle, 2004; Kou & Lin, 2014; Saaty, 1977). One of them is the eigenvector method (EM) proposed by Saaty (1977) for the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). EM derives values (priorities) ω
                     1, …, ω
                     
                        n
                      of comparable elements Ω
                     1, …, Ω
                     
                        n
                      as the solution of the right eigenvector problem

                                                      n
                                                   
                                                
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     for the corresponding pairwise comparison matrix A with the largest real eigenvalue λ
                     max. This elegant method is widely applied to analysis of different practical problems (see Vaidya & Agarwal, 2006; Ishizaka & Labib, 2011). However, EM has significant drawbacks.

Firstly, the actual numerical error of the derived values ω
                     1, …, ω
                     
                        n
                      is unknown. The values are exact only when the pairwise comparison matrix A
                     =∥a
                     
                        ik
                     ∥ is perfectly consistent, i.e., the transitivity rule a
                     
                        ik
                     
                     a
                     
                        kr
                     
                     =
                     a
                     
                        ir
                      holds for all comparisons (Saaty, 1977). Any inconsistency entails errors. EM uses the Consistency Ratio (CR) (Saaty, 1980) and Saaty’s criterion of CR
                     ⩽0.1 to accept or reject an inconsistent pairwise comparison matrix. The eligibility of this criterion has been much debated (Bana e Costa & Vansnick, 2008; Bózoki & Rapcsák, 2008; Kwiesielewicz & van Uden, 2004; Karapetrovic & Rosenbloom, 1999; Monsuur, 1997). Regardless of the opinions, the Consistency Ratio is only a heuristic criterion, which does not purpose to detect actual numerical errors of the derived values ω
                     1, …, ω
                     
                        n
                     .

Secondly, only two years later after the publication of the original EM, Johnson, Beine, and Wang (1979) show a rank reversal problem for scale inversion with EM: the right eigenvector ranking of elements Ω
                     1, …, Ω
                     
                        n
                      is not necessarily the same as the left one. The ranking depends on the formulation of the problem. This fundamental problem of EM has been discussed in the literature, from several perspectives (e.g., see Saaty, 1980; Saaty & Vargas, 1984; Dodd, Donegan, & McMaster, 1995; Barzilai, 1997; Bózoki & Rapcsák, 2008; Deturck, 1987).

Thirdly, one of the more controversial aspects of EM and AHP is the rank reversal phenomenon caused by the addition or deletion of an element under consideration. In relation to AHP as a whole, this phenomenon has been considered by numerous authors (e.g., see Belton & Grear, 1985; Saaty, 1987; Dyer, 1990; Barzilai, 1997; Maleki & Zahir, 2013). The examples of rank reversal in EM were observed by Hochbaum and Levin (2006) and Raharjo and Endah (2005).

Fourthly, Bana e Costa and Vansnick (2008) show the undesirable ability of EM to reverse expert’s “order of intensity of preferences”. According to their opinion, it is “a serious fundamental weakness that makes the use of AHP as a decision support tool very problematic”. Although Wang, Chin, and Luo (2009) express an opposite opinion, the problem remains.

In this paper, we use a correspondence between EM and some “matrix” measuring procedure, analyze this procedure from the viewpoint of measurement theory, and find actual numerical errors Δω
                     1, …, Δω
                     
                        n
                      of the EM values ω
                     1, …, ω
                     
                        n
                     . We show that “right–left asymmetry”, “rank reversal”, and reversal of “order of intensity of preference” have the same cause: the invalid use of only the values ω
                     1, …, ω
                     
                        n
                      for a ranking. We demonstrate that these phenomena are self-eliminated when the errors Δω
                     1, …, Δω
                     
                        n
                      are taken into account, and show that EM can be considered as a full decision support tool.

Let Ω
                     1, Ω
                     2, …, Ω
                     
                        n
                      be comparable elements with positive numerical values. Suppose we have a measuring procedure

It means that Saaty’s EM is one of the possible versions of the matrix measuring tool (11). The formulas (8) and (9) indicate errors in the case of inconsistent pairwise comparison matrices.

In addition, it is usually assumed in AHP that a pairwise comparison matrix is reciprocally symmetric, i.e.,

This imposes restrictions on maximum permissible errors. It is easy to get the following simple approximate upper estimate of permissible errors:

                        (this result is correct when the 9-point Saaty ratio scale is used for the pairwise comparisons). The fulfillment of (17) does not guarantee the reliable ranking. But if (17) does not hold then the reliable ranking of all elements is problematic or impossible and a revision of the pairwise comparisons is advisable. The inequality (17) imposes tight restrictions on inconsistency of expert judgements in decision making processes with a large number of alternatives. These restrictions are much stronger than previously thought (see Section 5.1).

According to Proposition, pairwise comparisons of elements Ω
                        1, …, Ω
                        
                           n
                         are equivalent to the multiply measuring procedure (1). If pairwise comparisons (=entries of a pairwise comparison matrix) are independent then all measurements are statistically independent. The use of reciprocally symmetric pairwise comparison matrices (13) decreases the actual number of statistically independent measurements and the accuracy of data on Ω

                           n
                         (especially for small n). For example, in the case n
                        =2 any reciprocally symmetric pairwise comparison matrix is automatically consistent as if any pairwise comparison of two elements is logically absolutely precise. The last is not correct in general. Therefore, it is more desirable not to use reciprocally symmetric matrices and to get a

                      without taking account their errors, leads to the so called “rank reversal problem for scale inversion”. This and other similar problematic questions are discussed in the next section.

Different phenomena, which suggest that the EM ranking is not reliable, have been discussed in the literature (see Introduction). These phenomena are connected with three concomitant facts. Firstly, the pairwise comparisons of elements under consideration are not consistent. Secondly, the Saaty criterion of CR
                     ⩽0.1 (Saaty, 1980) is used to accept or reject an inconsistent pairwise comparison matrix. Thirdly, only the ranking of the mean values ω
                     1, …, ω
                     
                        n
                      (=principle eigenvector entries) is used for the ranking of elements Ω
                     1, …, Ω
                     
                        n
                     .

The last statement is especially important because the inequality ω
                     
                        i

We show below that the Saaty criterion enables to accept inconsistent pairwise comparison matrices corresponding to strong violations of the inequality (20). Also we show that the problem phenomena correspond to the case (21). It means that these phenomena (based only on the ranking of the mean values ω

Saaty claimed that if CR
                        ⩽0.1 then the pairwise comparison matrix is acceptable (i.e., the EM error is admissible). We can test the CR criterion.

According to (17), the threshold CR
                        =0.1 corresponds to adverse errors for all n
                        >3. More recently, Saaty’s threshold is 0.05 for 3×3 and 0.08 for 4×4 matrices (Saaty, 1994). However this modification does not improve the situation. Moreover, as we will see below, unacceptable errors can occur even in the case CR
                        ≪0.1. It means that the Consistency Ratio is not an acceptable EM error indicator.

The right and the left eigenvector methods are two equivalent versions of the matrix measuring tool (see Section 4) and can be used equally to rank elements. However, a ranking, which uses only the mean values ω

                         called “right and left eigenvector inconsistency” or “rank reversal problem for scale inversion”. This phenomenon is inseparably linked with inconsistencies of pairwise comparisons (see (19)). Our testing shows that all rank reversal examples (Johnson et al., 1979; Saaty, 1980; Dodd et al., 1995; Barzilai, 1997) correspond to such strong violation of the inequality (20) that the ranking loses sense.

For illustration, we test the typical example (Dodd et al., 1995) with the reciprocal pairwise comparison matrix

                        ) does not contain any information on the ranking of the corresponding elements. Moreover, in this case the ranking loses any sense in principle. The “rank reversal problem” is not valid.

EM has been criticized due to the possibility of rank reversal when the ranking of the initial elements is changed by the addition (or deletion) of some element. Hochbaum and Levin (2006) demonstrate the famous example with adding an inconsequential element. This example is based on two reciprocal pairwise comparison matrices

                         do not contain any information on the ranking of the elements (see (21)). Therefore this “rank reversal problem” is eliminated.

Another example of rank reversal with adding a copy of the best existing element is demonstrated by Raharjo and Endah (2005). Their “rank reversal problem” has the same cause: the invalid use of only the means ω
                        1, …, ω
                        
                           n
                         for the ranking.

In the paper (Bana e Costa & Vansnick, 2008), the condition of order preservation is formulated: “For all alternatives x
                        1, x
                        2, x
                        3, x
                        4 such that x
                        1 dominates x
                        2 and x
                        3 dominates x
                        4, if the evaluator’s judgements indicate the extent to which x
                        1 dominates x
                        2 is greater that the extent to which x
                        3 dominates x
                        4, then the vector of priorities w should be such that, not only w(x
                        1)>
                        w(x
                        2) and w(x
                        3)>
                        w(x
                        4) (preservation of order of preference) but also that w(x
                        1)/w(x
                        2)>
                        w(x
                        3)/w(x
                        4) (preservation of order of intensity of preference)”. The authors present the examples in which the corresponding right eigenvector reversals the “order of intensity of preference”, and regard that it is a serious fundamental weakness of the EM.
                           2
                           These examples are also discussed by Wang et al. (2009), which transform original pairwise comparisons (direct judgments) to some “overall judgments” and obtain that “the priorities derived by the EM do preserve the order of intensity of preference, but in the sense of overall judgments rather than direct judgments”. They regard that their approach shows the invalidity of Bana e Costa and Vansnick’s criticisms. However, their arguments are only heuristic.

We regard that reversal of “order of intensity of preference”, “right–left asymmetry”, and “rank reversal” have the same cause: the invalid use of only principle eigenvector entries ω
                        1, …, ω
                        
                           n
                         for ranking. Our testing shows that the problem is eliminated when we take into account the EM errors and use the actual values w(x

                        3)=4.6±2.4 (see (22)). We see that the quotients w(x
                        3)/w(x
                        4) and w(x
                        1)/w(x
                        3) cannot be ranked. The violation of the “order of intensity of preference” is self-eliminated.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this article, we generalized EM and obtained the formulas (8), (9) and (15) for the EM errors. We showed that the problematic phenomena, which suggest that the EM ranking is not reliable, are self-eliminated when we take into account numerical values of the EM errors. Also we showed that the comparison procedure, EM, and the formulas for the errors compose the full measuring tool (11) for comparable elements with positive numerical values, and considered the “right” and the “left” versions of this tool with comparison matrices (12) and (18). The unique source of the measuring errors is the comparison procedure, which generates an inconsistent pairwise comparison matrix. Therefore, in the case of decision making processes, the numerical value of the errors entirely depends on inaccuracy of a measuring scale and inconsistent expert’s judgements.
