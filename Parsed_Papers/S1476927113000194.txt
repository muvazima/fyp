                  We have developed a computer program, named PDBETA, that performs normal mode analysis (NMA) based on an elastic network model that uses dihedral angles as independent variables. Taking advantage of the relatively small number of degrees of freedom required to describe a molecular structure in dihedral angle space and a simple potential-energy function independent of atom types, we aimed to develop a program applicable to a full-atom system of any molecule in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The algorithm for NMA used in PDBETA is the same as the computer program FEDER/2, developed previously. Therefore, the main challenge in developing PDBETA was to find a method that can automatically convert PDB data into molecular structure information in dihedral angle space. Here, we illustrate the performance of PDBETA with a protein–DNA complex, a protein–tRNA complex, and some non-protein small molecules, and show that the atomic fluctuations calculated by PDBETA reproduce the temperature factor data of these molecules in the PDB. A comparison was also made with elastic-network-model based NMA in a Cartesian-coordinate system.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Genetic information is expressed by translating a sequence into a functional protein structure. Protein function involves interactions with other proteins and molecules. In this paradigm, it has been emphasized that protein structure should be discussed from a dynamic, rather than a static, perspective. Information regarding protein dynamics is required to understand the structure–function relationship. Recently, normal mode analysis (NMA) has been recognized as a powerful method for elucidating the dynamics of biomolecules, particularly those listed in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), as data exist primarily of static structures. Although NMA has been used for over 3 decades to study the intrinsic flexibility of proteins (Brooks and Karplus, 1983; Gō and Noguchi, 1983; Levitt et al., 1985), interest in this approach increased after the development of NMA that was based on the elastic network model (ENM-based NMA), which proved to be accurate and robust in spite of its simplified model and the force field used (Bahar et al., 1997; Hinsen, 1998; Tirion, 1996). Its value in structural biology has been exploited through the observation that the collective motions of lower-frequency normal modes predicted by NMA bear functional significance (Alexandrov et al., 2005; Bahar et al., 2010; Dobbins et al., 2008; Krebs et al., 2002; Skjærven et al., 2011; Tama and Sanejouand, 2001; Tobi and Bahar, 2005; Wako and Endo, 2011).

ENM-based NMA replaces standard potentials that are used in orthodox NMA, such as van der Waals and Coulombic ones, by a simple pairwise Hookean potential. Although precise energy minimization of a PDB structure is required in orthodox NMA, the PDB structure can be used as the energy-minimum conformation in ENM-based NMA. Consequently, NMA is free from not only the most time-consuming process of energy minimization, but also the side effects of energy minimization, including significant deviation of the energy-minimum conformation from the PDB structure. Although NMA has many intrinsic limitations that include the use of a harmonic approximation, neglect of solvent damping, and an inability to model multiple minima, many studies have shown that ENM-based NMA, using a coarse-grained model, can predict global conformational changes associated with the biological functions of proteins (Bahar and Rader, 2005; Ma, 2005). On the basis of these findings, NMA can be applied to a flexible docking problem (e.g., the three-dimensional structure prediction of a protein bound to another molecule, from its unbound conformation) (Cavasotto et al., 2005; Dietzen et al., 2012; Krüger et al., 2012; Mashiach et al., 2010).

In this study, we have developed a computer program of ENM-based NMA in which dihedral angles are used as independent variables. The program was named PDBETA (normal mode analysis program for PDB data based on Elastic network model in Torsional Angle space). Most ENM-based NMA programs use Cartesian coordinates as independent variables and model a protein molecule with Cα atoms to represent individual amino acid residues. In contrast, we aimed to use a full-atom model for any molecule with PDB data, including non-protein molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and various ligands, to take advantage of the smaller number of variables required in dihedral angle space to describe molecular structures.

In developing an ENM-based NMA program in dihedral angle space for PDB data, 3 key points were to be considered: (i) automatic conversion of molecular structure information from PDB data into a suitable form for performing NMA in dihedral angle space, (ii) potential energy functions, and (iii) the NMA algorithm in dihedral angle space. A potential energy function in ENM-based NMA in (ii) is simple, and the qualitative results are relatively independent of the function form and parameter values used. The NMA algorithm in dihedral angle space (iii) has already been established (Wako and Gō, 1987; Wako et al., 1995). Alternatively, point (i) requires algorithmic complexity in dihedral angle space if we aim to apply it to any molecule besides a protein. Accordingly, we describe in this paper the method for ENM-based NMA in dihedral angle space focused primarily on point (i).

Here, we demonstrate the performance of PDBETA by applying it to 3 model systems: a protein–DNA complex, a protein–tRNA complex, and several non-protein small molecules. A comparison was also made with ENM-based NMA in a Cartesian-coordinate system.

In this study, we used a molecular structure model with fixed bond-length and bond-angle geometry. An independent variable is a dihedral angle. If more than 1 molecule exists in a system, 6 additional variables (i.e., translational and rotational variables) are necessary for each additional molecule. In the NMA algorithm we used (Wako and Gō, 1987; Wako et al., 1995), representation of a molecule as a tree composed of vertices and edges is required in a graph theory sense (Fig. 1
                        ). A rigid-body portion of the molecule, which comprises 1 or more atoms, and a rotatable covalent bond connecting them correspond to a vertex and an edge, respectively. In our previous work (Wako and Gō, 1987; Wako et al., 1995), the vertex and edge are referred to as a unit and bond, respectively.

A critical feature of the tree representation of a molecule is that the tree has no loop. More precisely, a loop containing any rotatable covalent bond is not allowed in the NMA algorithm we used. Although various ring structures exist in the PDB, they are not problematic as long as they can be regarded as a rigid body. However, if, for example, a disulfide bond is formed in a protein, a loop containing rotatable covalent bonds is formed. The same result is possible if a ligand molecule binds to a protein with more than 1 covalent bond. In this case, we have avoided the loop problem by assuming that one of the covalent bonds in the loop is non-bonded in order to break the loop. A strong force is imposed on the distances between the atoms to maintain the original bond length and bond angles by incorporating a pseudo-potential energy for loop closing of the form,

                        , into the conformational energy. This problem is described further, with an example, below.

In practice, the program PDBETA converts PDB data to molecular structure information in a form suitable for performing NMA in dihedral angle space through several steps. In this explanation, we consider only a system consisting of a single chain. Although 6 variables are necessary for each additional chain in a system, these variables can be treated like dihedral angles in a pseudo-chain connecting 2 chains (Higo et al., 1985; Wako et al., 1995). Therefore, this explanation can be easily extended to a system consisting of more than 1 chain.

Step 1: All covalent bonds in the PDB data are identified using covalent radii tables of atoms.

The molecule is currently represented as a graph composed of vertices of atoms and edges of covalent bonds. This graph is referred to as a molecular graph.

Step 2: All loops are identified in the molecular graph.

The loop identification is easy if we consider only a protein, because ring structures in several amino acids (Phe, His, Pro, Trp, and Tyr) and loops formed by disulfide bonds are the only cases that must be considered. However, a complicated problem occurs if we consider any molecule in the PDB, but we were able to solve this problem, as described below.

In PDB data, each atom belongs to a “residue” that is specified by residue name, chain identifier, and residue number described in the ATOM and HETATM lines. Although the term “residue” is not standard for some molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and some ligands, we conveniently utilize this term for any molecule; in other words,
                           Definition 1
                           A residue is defined as a set of atoms with identical residue name, chain identifier, and residue number in the ATOM and HETATM lines of PDB data.

Then, Step 2 is modified as follows:

Step 2a: All loops within each residue are identified. Any loop structure within the residue is treated as a rigid body, except for some specific cases described below.

Step 2b: Two atoms in different residues forming a covalent bond are regarded as non-bonded, unless it is a bond connecting neighboring residues in the PDB sequence data. Instead, a loop-closing potential is applied to the atom pairs relevant to this bond.

For example, Step 2a is applied to the rings α and β in Fig. 1. If the bond F–G in Fig. 1 is originally a covalent one and Parts 1 and 2 are composed of different residues, Step 2b is applied to this bond. It should be noted that in some cases, a covalent bond between atoms in different residues does not contribute to loop formation. If Parts 1 and 2 in Fig. 1 are in different chains, and F–G is the only covalent bond between the chains, no loop is formed. Even in these cases, Step 2b is applied to keep the loop-detecting algorithm simple. Step 2b also contributes to making the tree representation of a molecule simple and, thus, making it possible to output results in a comprehensible manner; otherwise, the output is not reader-friendly for some PDB data, as the residue sequence based on a branching scheme of the molecular graph is rather different from that in the PDB data.

Step 3: All of the covalent bonds are classified into either a rotatable or a non-rotatable bond.
                           Definition 2
                           The central bond of 3 consecutive bonds is rotatable, unless it is in the loop.

A terminal bond is non-rotatable. Any bonds in a loop are also non-rotatable.

For example, if 4 atoms, A, B, C, and D, are connected as A–B–C–D (as shown in Fig. 1), the central bond, B–C, is rotatable and its dihedral angle is defined by these 4 atoms. Because atom A is at the terminus, bond A–B is non-rotatable.

Now, we are ready to represent a molecular structure as a tree, containing a unit as a vertex and a rotatable bond as an edge. In a molecular graph, any 2 atoms in the same chain are connected with 1 or more bonds. These bonds construct a path from one atom to another. For example, atoms A and D in Fig. 1 have a path A–B–C–D. Then, a unit is defined as follows:
                           Definition 4
                           A unit is a maximum set of atoms and non-rotatable bonds in which no paths between any 2 atoms contain a rotatable bond. If an atom has only rotatable bonds connected to neighboring atoms, this atom composes a unit by itself.

Step 4: All units are identified.

All atoms and any non-rotatable bonds are included in some units, but rotatable bonds are not. Eventually, a molecule is represented by a tree of units and rotatable bonds, as shown in Fig. 1.

The options in the above procedure can be adjusted. For example, we introduced flexibility in the sugar ring of nucleotides (i.e., sugar puckering) by applying Step 2b instead of Step 2a to the sugar ring. More specifically, an O4′–C1′ bond in the sugar is regarded as non-bonded, and the loop-closing potential is applied to the 4 atom pairs (O4′, C1′), (C4′, C1′), (O4′, C2′), and (O4′, N1), as shown in Fig. 2
                        . The first atom pair is necessary for maintaining the bond length of O4′–C1′, and the remaining 3 atom pairs for the bond angles C4′–O4′–C1′, O4–C1′–C2′, and O4′–C1′–N1, respectively. The effectiveness of this treatment will be discussed in Section 3.1.

Conversely, some rotatable bonds can also be fixed. For example, a main-chain dihedral angle of a polypeptide chain, ω, can be fixed to reduce the number of independent variables. All dihedral angles in an α-helix can be fixed to assume it as a rigid body; however, PDBETA does not have such functions currently.

In a system consisting of more than 1 chain, ingenuity is required in dihedral angle space. Even for a monomeric protein, if some residues are missing in the PDB data resulting in a broken polypeptide chain, it must be regarded as a system consisting of more than 1 chain. The formulation for such a system (i.e., the system with translational and rotational variables for each additional chain) has been given elsewhere (Higo et al., 1985; Wako et al., 1995).

In ENM-based NMA, a potential energy function for a non-bonded interaction between atoms is given in a simple form using the harmonic potential approximation (Hinsen, 1998):

                         are the same as in Eq. (1). This potential function is applied to all atom pairs contributing to bond length and bond angles. For example, atom pairs F and G, E and G, and F and H in Fig. 1 are objects of this potential. The force constant, k
                        loop, should be sufficiently large to maintain the bond length and bond angles. We arbitrarily set k
                        loop
                        =100 and 50 for retaining the bond length and the bond angle, respectively.

                        Obviously, any conformation in the PDB data is at the energy-minimum of E.

Although it might be preferable to determine the optimum values of the parameters a, k
                        NB, k
                        loop, and k
                        
                           θ
                        , assessing these parameters would be difficult. We examined various sets of parameter values by comparing the calculated fluctuations with temperature factors in PDB data for various PDB entries, but determination of the optimum set for all PDB data was not possible. Fortunately, for the practical use of PDBETA, the qualitative results are not very sensitive to these parameters. PDBETA is best used to check the consistency between calculated and experimental results.

In ENM-based NMA, the temperature cannot be defined because the energy value estimated by the above potential function is unrealistic. Intrinsically, temperature determines fluctuation amplitude in NMA. Therefore, a user can easily specify the fluctuation amplitude in PDBETA, rather than the temperature. Usually, the amplitude is determined in order to fit the calculated fluctuations of atoms to those obtained from the temperature factor in PDB data, to assess the validity of the calculation. It should be noted, however, that the fluctuations calculated from the temperature factor are much larger than those calculated at ordinary temperature in the orthodox NMA, which is relevant to the actual temperature. In other words, users must be careful because physical properties calculated in this manner may be much larger than actual ones at ordinary temperature.

Such exaggerated fluctuation is necessary to display on a molecular viewer, because the fluctuation at ordinary temperature is too small for a user to recognize them. The amplitudes of fluctuations are determined to fit the B-factor data from the PDB or to clarify the displacement vectors drawn on the three-dimensional structure of molecules below; therefore, readers should understand that the fluctuation size does not have a significant meaning.

The algorithm for rapidly calculating the derivatives of the potential functions with respect to the dihedral angles is the same as that published by Wako et al. (1987, 1995). This algorithm can be applied to a system containing any molecule, as long as it is represented as a tree of units and rotatable covalent bonds.

Although atom types are not considered in the potential functions defined above, a proper atomic weight is assigned to each atom depending on its type in the NMA calculation.

Three notes are given for the development of PDBETA.
                           
                              (i)
                              Water molecules are omitted in PDBETA, because the number of independent variables increases significantly (6 variables per water molecule). From an algorithmic point of view, there is no problem in taking them into computation.

Hydrogen atoms are also omitted in PDBETA, even if they exist in the PDB data. We aimed to introduce a united atom approximation to PDBETA to take into account the hydrogen atoms. In this approximation, the hydrogen atoms were not considered explicitly; instead, the weight of the atom to which hydrogen atoms are bound was increased by the atomic weight of the hydrogen atoms. Furthermore, a hydrogen bond can be considered by introducing a hydrogen atom explicitly and a small value can be assigned in place of k
                                 loop in Eq. (2) to the relevant atom pair to form the hydrogen bond. These can be carried out with relatively small increases in degrees of freedom, and the results of our tentative calculations were positive. However, incorporating such functions for many kinds of molecules in the PDB would be highly complicated; therefore, PDBETA currently does not consider hydrogen atoms.

In performing PDBETA for various PDB data, we observed that a side chain projecting from the protein surface toward the solvent and interacting with few other atoms has extraordinarily large fluctuations and, thus, could possibly disturb the analysis. Hence, such side-chain atoms were discarded in advance. The atoms in long side chains of amino acids, such as Arg, Lys, and Met, are usually subject to this exclusion criterion when they are on the protein surface. In practice, an atom is discarded if the number of neighboring atoms is less than some threshold value.

In reality, the molecule is in the solvent and, thus, the movement of a side chain exposed to the solvent is more repressed than in vacuo. On the other hand, if the calculated atomic fluctuations are compared with those calculated from the B-factors given in the PDB, naturally, the former would be much larger than the latter for the side chain on the surface because their movements in the crystal are more repressed than in vacuo or in the solvent. Consequently, what could be a reasonable fluctuation of the side chain on the surface is unknown. Although challenging, several approaches could be used to address this problem, and we are currently examining them.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The performance of PDBETA is illustrated with 3 examples: a protein–DNA complex, a protein–tRNA complex, and non-protein small molecules. The atomic fluctuations calculated by PDBETA are compared to those calculated from B-factors given in the PDB data, which are simply referred to as experimental data. For this comparison, the magnitudes of the calculated atomic fluctuations were determined to best fit the experimental data.

The vibrational motions of the various modes are not discussed in this paper; however, they are provided in Supplementary data.

The first example is type II restriction endonuclease EcoRV complexed with DNA (PDB code: 1RVA) (Kostrewa and Winkler, 1995). EcoRV is a homodimer of a 244-amino-acid promoter, and its substrate is a double-stranded undecameric DNA sequence (Fig. 3A). With this example, we wanted to illustrate the following 3 points: (i) the extent to which PDBETA can reproduce the atomic fluctuations of the protein and DNA, (ii) a comparison between fluctuations in forming a complex with DNA and in protein without DNA, and (iii) the effect of an opened sugar ring in a nucleotide introduced for its flexibility associated with ring puckering (Fig. 2B).


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the root-mean-square (RMS) atomic fluctuations averaged by residue for the protein and by nucleotide for DNA for 3 cases of NMA calculations: (i) EcoRV bound to DNA with an opened sugar ring, (ii) EcoRV bound to DNA with a fixed sugar ring (i.e., treated as a rigid body), and (iii) EcoRV not bound to DNA. These RMS fluctuations are compared to the experimental data in Fig. 4.


                        Fig. 4 shows that atomic fluctuations calculated by PDBETA reproduce the experimental data for both protein and DNA. The effect of DNA binding clearly emerges around residues 180–188 and 221–226, which interact with DNA. The fluctuations of these residues are much greater than the experimental data when they are not bound to DNA; in contrast, they are repressed by DNA binding to fit to the experimental data.

The comparison between opened and fixed sugar rings is shown in the inset in Fig. 4, and indicates that the opened sugar ring provides better quantitative results than the fixed sugar ring. It should be noted that it is difficult to assess the effect of an opened sugar ring by performing NMA of the system consisting of only DNA, because the magnitude of fluctuations in cases of opened and fixed sugar rings cannot be determined properly. On the contrary, in the NMA of the complex containing protein and DNA, the magnitude of fluctuations of DNA can be assessed in relation to those of the protein. In fact, the inset in Fig. 4 shows the atomic fluctuation of DNA when the fluctuations of the protein are held constant, and shows that the fluctuations of DNA with the opened sugar ring are larger (more flexible) and more consistent with the experimental data than those with the fixed sugar ring. This suggests that the flexibility introduced by the opened sugar ring can better reproduce the fluctuations of DNA.

The vibrational motions of the first and second lowest-frequency normal modes of the complex are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. The 2 subunits show shear and hinge-bending motions in the first and second lowest-frequency normal modes, respectively. The 2 subunits move parallel and perpendicular to their interface in the shear and hinge-bending motions, respectively. These 2 motions are typical in the mutual motion of domains.

The second example is a protein–tRNA complex, MnmA thiouridylase–tRNA complex (PDB code: 2DER) (Numata et al., 2006), for which we considered the A chain (thiouridylase: 348 amino acid residues consisting of residues 5–188 and 205–368; residues 1–4 and 189–204 are missing) and the C chain (tRNA: 74 nucleotides) in the NMA calculation (Fig. 3B). The protein–tRNA complex was selected because we had observed that RNA is quite flexible by itself, and hence, its atomic fluctuations are considerably different from those calculated from the PDB B-factor. We aimed to show that PDBETA could properly reproduce the atomic fluctuations of RNA if other molecules that affect motions of the relevant RNA are considered in the NMA calculation.


                        Fig. 5
                         shows the atomic fluctuations of the tRNA averaged by nucleotide for both cases (i.e., bound and not bound to thiouridylase). Supplementary Figure S2 shows the atomic fluctuations of the protein averaged by residue for both cases (i.e., bound and not bound to tRNA). Fig. 5 shows that the calculated fluctuations of tRNA not bound to the protein coincide with the experimental data, except for the anticodon loop (32–38; anticodon is 34–36). However, the fluctuations around the anticodon loop change remarkably in the calculation for tRNA bound to the protein. The large fluctuation in free tRNA is reduced significantly and fits well to the experimental data.

Supplementary Figure S2 also shows that the atomic fluctuations of residues 239–260, which interact with tRNA, are largely reduced from those in the free thiouridylase and fit well to the experimental data. Supplementary Figure S2 shows that the entire profile of fluctuations is adequately reproduced by the NMA calculation.

The fluctuations of the 5′- and 3′-ends in the NMA calculation are significantly larger than those of the experimental data. However, these ends interact with the 5′- and 3′-ends of another tRNA (D chain) in the PDB data and, thus, their fluctuations are repressed. In fact, we observed large fluctuations of the 5′- and 3′-ends for tRNA in other PDB data in which tRNA is not bound to protein (PDB code: 1EZH) (Supplementary Figure S3). In this calculation, the fluctuations of the 5′- and 3′-ends coincide with the experimental data, whereas the fluctuations around the anticodon loop differ significantly, as in the above calculation.

The vibrational motions of the lowest-frequency normal modes of the complex and free tRNA are shown in Supplementary Figure S4. In these figures, larger and smaller fluctuations can be clearly seen around the anticodon loop for free tRNA and tRNA bound to thiouridylase, respectively.

The third example is non-protein small molecules. PDBETA was applied to non-protein small molecules, as they are considered good examples for checking whether such programs can automatically generate complex molecular structures from the PDB data (Fig. 6
                        ). The results for the following 7 non-protein small molecules from 5 PDB data are shown in this paper (Table 1
                        ):
                           
                              (A)
                              Retinal (RET) bound to bacteriorhodopsin (Lanyi and Schobert, 2007).

Protoporphyrin (HEM) bound to myoglobin (Brucker et al., 1998).

Folic acid (FOL) and nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NAP) bound to dihydrofolate reductase (Bystroff et al., 1990).

Fusicoccin (FSC) bound to a fungal toxin (Würtele et al., 2003).

Vancomycin (Loll et al., 1997). This molecule has 2 chains, A and B (referred to as VAN-A and VAN-B in this paper), each of which consists of 101 atoms. There is no protein in this data.


                        Fig. 7
                         shows the atomic fluctuations of the seven small molecules from the above PDB data. The fluctuations calculated from B-factors are plotted against those calculated by NMA of each constituent atom. The amplitudes of the normal modes were determined for each molecule so that mean fluctuations calculated by NMA coincide with the mean experimental data. Fig. 7 suggests that the calculated fluctuations correlate with the experimental ones (the correlation coefficients are shown in Table 1). However, the slopes of the regression lines are much smaller than 1 (Table 1), indicating that the prediction ability of the calculations is qualitatively reasonable but quantitatively insufficient. It is impossible to expect the elastic network model to calculate the fluctuation of every atom with a high degree of accuracy.

In Supplementary Figure S5, the atomic fluctuations calculated for the above 4 proteins, (A)–(D), are shown together with their experimental data. Their similarity to the experimental data is the highest for bacteriorhodopsin, followed by myoglobin, and lowest for dihydrofolate reductase and fungal toxin, according to our data. Contrary to our expectation, however, the correlation coefficient of fungal toxin in Table 1 is rather high. These results correlate with the crystallographic resolution (Table 1); the lower the resolution, the lower is the similarity between the calculated and experimental fluctuation.

The vibrational motions of the above molecules for the lowest-frequency normal mode are also shown in Supplementary Figure S6. In the membrane protein, bacteriorhodopsin, the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions make rotational motions in opposing directions. In myoglobin, the entire molecular motion occurs in a concerted manner, but the mutual motions of α-helices around heme are rather complex. Dihydrofolate reductase shows a typical hinge-bending motion of 2 domains. The fungal toxin structure is constructed by antiparallel α-helices. The 2 extremely long antiparallel α-helices move in the opposite direction to the other α-helices. The vibrational motions of individual normal modes of small molecules, such as vancomycin, should be assessed using molecular mechanical methods showing greater precision.

A study on the ligand-induced conformational change of a protein by the PDBETA program was published prior to submission of this paper (Wako and Endo, 2011). In that study, the authors demonstrated that conformational change vectors of atoms from the apo to the holo form of a protein can be reproduced by using a linear combination of the displacement vectors of atoms in the apo form, calculated for low-frequency normal modes. These results also suggest that PDBETA is useful in the dynamic study of PDB data.

For comparison of PDBETA with ENM-based NMA in a Cartesian-coordinate system we submitted the 4 protein data examined in Section 3.3 to a web server, WEBnm@ (Hollup et al., 2005). This server performs ENM-based NMA in a Cartesian-coordinate system using only the Cα atoms of the protein, which are assigned the masses of the whole residues they represent. The calculated fluctuations of Cα atoms are shown for 2NTU in Fig. 8
                         and for 1HJT, 7DFR, and 1O9F in Supplementary Figure S5 together with the atomic fluctuations averaged by residue from PDBETA. In Table 2
                         correlation coefficients between the calculated and experimental atomic fluctuations for PDBETA and WEBnm@ and those between PDBETA and WEBnm@ are given.

The atomic fluctuations obtained by PDBETA and WEBnm@ are well correlated with each other as their higher correlation coefficients larger than 0.77 indicate. The correlation coefficients of PDBETA with experimental atomic fluctuations are significantly higher than those of WEBnm@. It is notable that WEBnm@ has wider fluctuations than PDBETA and the experimental data.

The computation times of the both methods could not be compared. In ENM-based NMA the most time-consuming part is calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Because it depends on the number of variables, PDBETA may be of advantage to the computation time if ENM-based NMA in a Cartesian coordinate system also consider a full-atom system of protein as PDBETA does.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have developed PDBETA to perform normal mode analysis based on the utilization of an elastic network model that uses dihedral angles as independent variables. Taking advantage of the relatively small number of degrees of freedom required to describe a molecular structure in dihedral angle space and a simple potential-energy function independent of atom types, PDBETA is applicable to a full-atom system of any molecule within the PDB. The performance of PDBETA is illustrated with a protein–DNA complex, a protein–tRNA complex, and some non-protein small molecules, and the atomic fluctuations calculated by PDBETA were shown to adequately reproduce the temperature factor data for these molecules in the PDB.
