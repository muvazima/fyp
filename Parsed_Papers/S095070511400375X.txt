                  Knowledge reduction is a basic issue in knowledge representation and data mining. Although various methods have been developed to reduce the size of classical formal contexts, the reduction of formal fuzzy contexts based on fuzzy lattices remains a difficult problem owing to its complicated derivation operators. To address this problem, we propose a general method of knowledge reduction by reducing attributes and objects in formal fuzzy contexts based on the variable threshold concept lattices. Employing the proposed approaches, we remove attributes and objects which are non-essential to the structure of a variable threshold concept lattice, i.e., with a given threshold level, the concept lattice constructed from a reduced formal context is made identical to that constructed from the original formal context. Discernibility matrices and Boolean functions are, respectively, employed to compute the attribute reducts and object reducts of the formal fuzzy contexts, by which all the attribute reducts and object reducts of the formal fuzzy contexts are determined without changing the structure of the lattice.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The theory of formal concept analysis (FCA), proposed by Wille [11,32], stimulates mathematical approach to conceptual data analysis and knowledge processing. The main concern of FCA is the lattice structure, called a concept lattice, induced by a binary relation between a pair of sets constructed by the formal concepts embedded in a concept hierarchy. A formal concept is an (objects, attributes) pair, the set of objects is referred to as the extent of the concept consisting of all objects belong to the concept, and the set of attributes is called the intent of the concept that include all attributes shared by the objects. In the last two decades, FCA has been successfully applied to information retrieval, knowledge discovery, data mining, machine learning, software engineering, etc. [5,6,8,10,15,16,18,21,22,24,30,39].

FCA is formulated on the basis of a formal context, which is a binary relation between a set of objects and a set of attributes. Numerous theoretical investigations and practical applications of FCA have been made over the years. Extensions of FCA theory via fuzzy logic reasoning or fuzzy set theory also have been attempted in recent years. In real-life problems, formal fuzzy contexts are more common than their crisp counterparts. Binary fuzzy relations have been used to analyze relations between objects and attributes, and several generalizations to formal fuzzy concept have been made. For instance, Belohlavek [1–3] proposed fuzzy concepts in formal fuzzy contexts based on a residuated lattice, and the proposed fuzzy concept lattice hold almost all properties that in a classical concept lattice. Georgescu and Popescu [12,27] generalized Belohlavek’s definition of fuzzy concepts and discussed a general approach to fuzzy FCA. Medina and Ojeda-Aciego [25] developed so-called t-concept lattice as a set of triples associated to graded tabular information interpreted in a non-commutative fuzzy logic. Jaoua and Elloumi [14] extended the binary fuzzy relation to a real-set binary relation and introduced the corresponding Galois lattices. On the other hand, Krajči [16], Yahia and Jaoua [36] independently proposed a “one-sided fuzzy concept”, one advantage of their definitions is that the number of generated formal concepts is greatly reduced. Zhang et al. [40] further constructed the “variable threshold concept lattices”, i.e. crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concepts and fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concepts, in which the “one-sided fuzzy concept” becomes a special case (threshold being equal to 1).

One of the main directions in the study of FCA is knowledge reduction achieved by reducing attributes and objects in formal contexts while keeping the lattice structures unchanged. Knowledge reduction is an important issue in knowledge representation and data mining [7,13,19,28,34,37,38]. Many types of knowledge reduction along the line of reducing attributes have been proposed for the analysis of information tables and decision tables. Since a formal context can be regarded as an information table, it is natural to consider knowledge reduction in FCA. In formal contexts, knowledge reduction is the search for a subset of attributes which can provide the same structure of the original concept lattice. In recent years, there have been a rapid growth of interests in knowledge reduction in classical formal contexts (object set and attribute set are crisp sets) [9,11,17,20,23,26,29,31,33,35,41].

As we know, the number of formal concepts in a formal fuzzy context increases dramatically than that in a classical formal context. Hence, the structure of a concept lattice derived from a formal fuzzy context is more complicated than the one in a classical formal context. Thus the study of knowledge reduction in a formal fuzzy context becomes even more meaningful. By reduction, the concepts in a reduced fuzzy context have a simpler form, making the lattice a better representation of knowledge.

Unfortunately, the methods of knowledge reduction for classical formal contexts are not applicable in the reduction of formal fuzzy contexts. The issues of knowledge reduction in formal fuzzy contexts has recently attracted attention in the research community. Belohlavek et al. [4], for instance, proposed a method to reduce the number of formal fuzzy concepts by only keeping the so-called crisply generated fuzzy concepts which are generated from some crisp subset of attributes, leaving out non-crisply generated fuzzy concepts. In Belohlavek et al. reduction method [4], the number of fuzzy concepts and the hierarchy of the lattice are changed, resulting in a possible loss of knowledge. Based on the Lukasiewicz implication, Elloumi et al. [9] gave a multi-level conceptual data reduction approach via the reduction of the object sets by keeping the minimal rows in a formal context. However, we have noticed that some of the attributes are still redundant in the row reduced formal context, and Elloumi et al. did not consider eliminating the reducible attributes. Furthermore, based on the multi-level formal concepts (which do not form a lattice) proposed by Elloumi et al. [9], Li and Zhang [20] discussed the attribute characteristics by restricting them to the regular implication operators which satisfy the transitivity condition, and they presented a deletion algorithm to obtain a δ-reduct (not all δ-reducts).

Compared to the classical formal contexts, very little research has been done on knowledge reduction in formal fuzzy contexts. We are in lack of a general method for calculating knowledge reduction in formal fuzzy contexts parallel to that proposed by Zhang and Wei [41] for classical formal contexts. Based on the idea of variable threshold concept lattices, we propose in this paper a more general method to reduce the size of a formal fuzzy context without changing the structure of the lattice. Specifically, we construct appropriate discernibility matrices and discernibility functions to calculate the attribute (object) reducts in a formal fuzzy context by which all the attribute (object) reducts in the formal fuzzy context are determined. When δ
                     =1, the proposed reduction approaches can be adapted to the “one-sided fuzzy concept”.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review some basic notions of FCA and fuzzy logic relevant to the discussion throughout the paper. We also recall the variable threshold concepts introduced by Zhang et al. [40]. Section 3 proposes the approaches to attribute reducts and object reducts in formal fuzzy contexts. In Section 4, we define the discernibility matrices and Boolean functions to determine all reducts of a formal fuzzy context. We then conclude the paper with a summary and outline some future direction of research in Section 5.

To facilitate our discussion, we first briefly recall some relevant notions of FCA and fuzzy logic, and then discuss some properties of the variable threshold concept lattices. Detailed information can be found in [11,1,40].

The introduction of the parameter δ allows us to introduce different levels to the generated fuzzy concepts. It plays the role of a threshold which enables us to reduce the number of formal concepts in a given formal fuzzy context, i.e., when δ varies from 1 to 0 we obtain a reduction of the number of the fuzzy concepts. In fact, when δ decreases, some fuzzy concepts will not be considered since they will be included in some larger concepts.

By exchanging objects and attributes in the definition of a crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept, one can define the following corresponding adjoint pair of derivation operators and fuzzy concepts.

When δ

It follows immediately from Theorem 3.□

According to the significance of the attributes, the attribute set A is divided into two parts, i.e. dispensable attribute set and indispensable attribute set, and the two sets are complementary. By Theorems 3 and 4 we can determine all the dispensable attributes and all the indispensable attributes, respectively. One can also use Theorem 3 to determine all the indispensable attributes and use Theorem 4 to determine all the dispensable attributes. In a sense, Theorems 3 and 4 can be seen as complementary.

                           Therefore, D is an attribute consistent set with threshold δ.□


                     Theorem 5 presents an approach to judge whether or not an attribute set is consistent.

In duality, one can consider object reduction of formal fuzzy contexts based on fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattices, and the corresponding theorems and proposition can be obtained likewise. Since there are some differences, we just present some important conclusions.

                     Theorem 9 presents an approach to judge whether or not an object set is a consistent set.

As we know, discernibility matrices and discernibility functions are useful tools in the calculation of all reducts of an information system in rough set theory. In the literature [41], the discernibility matrix and discernibility function are employed to compute attribute reduction in classical concept lattices. In order to determine all attribute reducts and all object reducts, we construct in this section appropriate discernibility matrices and discernibility functions of formal fuzzy contexts based on crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept lattices and fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattices.

It follows directly from Theorem 11 and the definition of minimal disjunctive normal form of the discernibility function.□

It should be noted that discernibility functions are monotonic Boolean functions and their prime implications uniquely determine the reducts.


                     Theorem 13 provides a practical approach to determine all attribute reducts of a formal fuzzy context.

The number of crisp-fuzzy concepts derived from the reduced formal fuzzy context is identical to that derived from the original formal fuzzy context. For example, from Table 14 we obtain all the crisp-fuzzy concepts with threshold 
                              
                                 δ
                                 =
                                 0.8
                              
                            and represent them by Table 17
                           . Compared with the crisp-fuzzy concepts in Table 4, the crisp-fuzzy concepts in Table 17 have a simpler form, making it a better representation of knowledge.

Similarly, one can consider the object discernibility matrix and discernibility function based on the fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattices. The corresponding theorems and proposition can be analogously obtained and we therefore just present some important conclusions.

By Theorem 16, the corresponding algorithms for computing all object reducts and all relative reducts can be obtained likewise.

The above reduction approaches of formal fuzzy contexts based on crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept lattice and fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattice can also be applied to attribute reduction and object reduction of formal fuzzy contexts based on crisp-fuzzy concept lattice and fuzzy-crisp concept lattice introduced by Krajči [16], Yahia and Jaoua [36].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Fuzzy concept analysis is an important tool which can be employed to deal with uncertainty in conceptual fuzzy data analysis and knowledge processing. In this paper, we have presented some notions and properties of crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept lattices and fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattices. Based on the crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept lattices and fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattices, we have discussed the problems of attribute reducts and object reducts in formal fuzzy contexts. We have shown how to remove redundant attributes and redundant objects from a formal fuzzy context without changing the structure of the lattice. By the proposed approach, the attributes and objects which are redundant to the structure of the variable threshold concept lattice are deleted, and thus the size of the formal context can be greatly reduced. More specifically, we have defined the discernibility matrices and discernibility functions to calculate the attribute (object) reducts in a formal fuzzy context, by which all the attribute (object) reducts in the formal fuzzy context are determined. Since concepts and structure of the lattice in a formal fuzzy context are more complicated than those in a classical formal context, studies on knowledge reduction in formal fuzzy contexts become more meaningful. By reduction, the concepts in a reduced fuzzy context have a simpler form, making the lattice a better representation of knowledge. The proposed reduction approaches can be adapted to the “one-sided fuzzy concept lattice”. There still remain some interesting problems worthy of further research. The attribute characteristics of variable threshold concept lattice and the corresponding reduction algorithms should be further investigated.
