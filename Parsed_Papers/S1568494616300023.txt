                  Power quality may degrade owing to increasing harmonics from nonlinear loads in a power system. Harmonics are time-varying and non-stationary power quality problems in the power system. This article addresses that the passive filter planning considers multiple scenarios, including different load levels and harmonic currents in a factory distribution system. Based on the above factors and use of the Markov model, this work attempts to gain multiple scenarios, each with its own probability and duration. A novel method based on probabilistic Sugeno fuzzy reasoning is also developed by using individual optimal solutions of all scenarios. Moreover, the final optimal solution is obtained using the center-of-gravity approach. The proposed method is validated using simulation results of a 2-busbar factory distribution system and an 18-busbar factory distribution system.
