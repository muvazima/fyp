                  This paper defines and models time-to-profit for the first time for credit acceptance decisions within the context of revolving credit. This requires the definition of a time-related event: A customer is profitable when monthly cumulative return is at least one (i.e. cumulative profits cover the outstanding balance). Time-to-profit scorecards were produced for a data set of revolving credit from a Colombian lending institution which included socio-demographic and first purchase individual characteristics. Results show that it is possible to obtain good classification accuracy and improve portfolio returns which are continuous by definition through the use of survival models for binary events (i.e. either being profitable or not). It is also shown how predicting time-to-profit can be used for investment planning purposes of credit programmes. It is possible to identify the earliest point in time in which a customer is profitable and hence, generates internal (organic) funds for a credit programme to continue growing and become sustainable. For survival models the effect of segmentation on loan duration was explored. Results were similar in terms of classification accuracy and identifying organic growth opportunities. In particular, loan duration and credit limit usage have a significant economic impact on time-to-profit. This paper confirms that high risk credit programmes can be profitable at different points in time depending on loan duration. Furthermore, existing customers may provide internal funds for the credit programme to continue growing.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Granting consumer credit is traditionally based on modelling the probability that a potential borrower will default within a specified period of time. Since the late 1990s, however, modelling profit has come to the fore (Lucas, 2001; Narain, 1992). So credit applicants are ranked according to their attractiveness to a lender based on scores representing profit profiles in contrast or in addition to default probabilities. Previous studies have presented various profit measures that can be used as scores for credit granting and management purposes. Sánchez Barrios, Andreeva, and Ansell (2014) presented for the first time relative profit measures as an alternative to traditional monetary profits in the context of credit granting. In that study, ROACUMt
                      is the cumulative profit received from a customer since the beginning of the observation period, EBITACUMt
                     , relative to the outstanding balance at time t. ROACUMt
                      can also be interpreted as a customer's coverage against default (i.e. it is the proportion of a customer’s outstanding debt that is already covered with the accumulated profit at time t). It was shown in that study that portfolio profitability differs when customers are ranked according to either monetary or relative profit measures. Ultimately, the use of relative profit scorecards (or credit scoring models) instead of monetary profits scorecards depends on the lender´s standpoint in terms of coverage against default considering context conditions and corporate aims.

This study develops time-to-profit models for use in credit scoring. The idea of time-to-profit has been raised before (Finlay, 2008) but has not been attempted until now. This study builds on previous work (Sánchez Barrios et al., 2014) by using ROACUMt
                     , the customer's return, to define a profit-related event and hence, time-to-profit. Application scorecards based on when a customer will be profitable rather than on monetary profits such as EBITACUMt
                      rank customers based on the time required to be covered against default. This is particularly useful for unsecured consumer loans, where no collateral backups the outstanding debt.

Designing time-to-profit scorecards contributes to the ongoing debate of scoring customers under two different approaches: either using predictions of continuous profit measures or the probabilities of occurrence of a binary event based on default or profits (Finlay, 2008). An additional aim of this paper is hence to compare the usefulness of using either type of scorecards in terms of their impact on portfolio profits and returns.

This paper also investigates how predicted time-to-profit can be used for investment planning. Once a customer is profitable, the lender can decide to grant further credit to that customer or alternatively to new customers. Thus predicting when a customer will be profitable provides information on the availability of funds for the growth of credit programmes, ensuring sustainability.

In accordance with the research aims presented above, this paper is organised as follows. Initially the paper will review the literature on profit scoring and the definition of time-to-profit in Section 2. This is followed by Section 3 with data description and the modelling rationale. A range of potential models were explored to identify the most appropriate approach to assessing time-to-profit. Section 4 covers results and their statistical significance and their implications. Proportional odds models with different specifications for time component were compared using three measures: Akaike's information criterion (AIC – overall fit), variance inflation factor (VIF – multi-collinearity) and area under the curve (AUC – accuracy of prediction). The best time-to-profit model was then used as a scorecard and compared with an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model in terms of impact on portfolio results. Time-to-profit models were then used for investment planning with exploration of the effect of segmentation. Section 5 presents concluding remarks (i.e. conclusions, managerial implications, limitations and further research).

The concept of profit scoring is based on the recognition that non-defaulting credit holders may not generate enough revenues to off-set the costs associated with maintaining their accounts, whilst defaulters can be profitable given they use the facility actively and repay major part of it (Hopper & Lewis, 1992; Leonard, 1997; Lucas, 2001). This made the time/duration aspect of credit important, so early work on profit scoring concentrated on applications of survival analysis in credit scoring (Andreeva, Ansell, & Crook, 2005; 
                        Andreeva, Ansell, & Crook, 2007; Banasik, Crook, & Thomas, 1999; Hand & Kelly, 2001; Narain, 1992; Stepanova & Thomas, 2001; Stepanova & Thomas, 2002). These papers investigated estimation of survival probabilities of different events (default, attrition and 2nd purchase) in application and behavioural scoring and for different credit products. Estimated survival probabilities were used as inputs in profit calculations.

It should be noted that not all of the papers listed above have provided a formal definition of profit or explicitly demonstrated how the profit could be estimated, therefore, the rest of this section (as well as Table 1
                        ) will concentrate on papers where this analysis was provided. Similarly, this literature review omits a related body of work on estimation of parameters for calculating capital allocation under Basel II and III, i.e. Loss Given Default (LGD), Exposure at Default (EAD), since they only cover one aspect of profitability – default losses.

The most commonly used profit measures are similar to the concept of customer lifetime value (CLV), widely used in marketing (see e.g., Pfeifer, Haskins, & Conroy, 2005). CLV can be defined as the net present value of the cash flows (anticipated or actual) per customer over time, and is expressed in monetary units.

Given the potential of losses due to default various authors have suggested estimation of profit at application time by the difference between the cumulative discounted repayment instalments weighted by the survival probability at time t and the initial loan amount, e.g. see Stepanova and Thomas (2001) for fixed term loans. Similarly for revolving credit, Bellotti (2013) following from Thomas (2009) defines profit as the difference between gain and loss over observation period and the estimated profit. Alternatively, Banasik and Crook (2010) suggested separately estimating expected losses from default and early repayment and deduct them from potential receipts from the loan. One can further disaggregate income sources as in Ma, Crook, and Ansell (2010), where the conditional expected profit for a fixed term loan has been quantified as a result of four components/scenarios.

An alternative to anticipated cash flows is to use actual observed payments in constructing the dependent variable that can then be predicted. Andreeva et al. (2007) in their analysis of a revolving German store card calculated the net revenue as the difference between the net present value of the actual discounted total payments and the amount written off from defaulted accounts. Another approach that avoids discounting would be to consider accrued costs rather than cash outflows (Pfeifer et al., 2005). Similarly Finlay (2008) used ‘customer worth’, the profit per customer net of bad debt provisions (only for accounts in arrears) and average fixed costs of managing each account. Later work (Finlay, 2010) considered a similar measure contribution per customer. Finally, some proxies can be used, as in Stewart (2011), where a two-year spend and charge-offs for the credit card were used to proxy revenues and costs.

It should be noted that measures presented above are monetary (usually cumulative) ones. Whilst they are useful in assessing customers as profit centres accountable for generating revenues and covering costs, it can be argued that relative measures (ratios) should be preferred when the objective is maximise profits in relation to the initial investment (Sánchez Barrios et al., 2014). Quirini and Vannucci (2009) suggested a cash-flow based ratio for application credit scoring. Yet this study is solely based on simulated data. Besides, their measure compares actual and expected cash flows, so is different from return ratios (i.e. scaled profits) considered in Sánchez Barrios et al. (2014). Table 1 presents papers that give either formal definition of profit or explicitly demonstrate how the profit could be estimated. None of these papers estimated time-to-profit. This paper extends the findings of Sánchez Barrios et al. (2014) to time-to-profit modelling with profit being measured as a return ratio.


                        Finlay (2008) used a number of predictors directly to predict profit using a variety of techniques, including regression. One can use models for either continuous (e.g. OLS) or binary outcomes (e.g. logistic). Finlay (2008) compared continuous models with logistic regression applied to two different binary outcomes: a traditional one (defaulters/non-defaulters) and another one where good customers were those with a positive “worth”. Unsurprisingly binary models demonstrated better classification accuracy, whilst continuous models (OLS) produced more accurate profit estimates. Yet Somers and Whittaker (2007) demonstrated that OLS may not be the best model for continuous revenue, when the outcome variable is non-normal.

Others employed indirect approach which estimates intermediate variables (e.g. probability of default and probability of re-purchase) and uses them as inputs in the second stage to estimate profit. For example, Andreeva et al. (2007) obtain profit scores (or “survival combination scores”) by regressing on the probabilities of default and second purchase and amount borrowed. “Survival combination scores” outperformed a typical logistic regression model to predict default in terms of net revenue, yet this came at a cost of increased risk of bad debt. Indirect methods may suffer from correlation between intermediate variables used in the final stage of profit estimation. Finlay (2010) compared (1) traditional default-predicting logistic regression to (2) indirect two-stage estimation of default probability and then for expected defaulters and non-defaulters profits and losses through OLS and neural networks; and to (3) direct estimation of the expected profit per customer through OLS and neural networks. Approach 2 was shown to be superior. Sánchez Barrios et al. (2014) produced profit scorecards using direct and indirect methods. Under the former, profit was predicted directly using OLS whereas the latter used probabilities of default and repurchase as predictors. Direct models were superior in terms of their impact on portfolio profits and returns. Finlay (2008) stressed the need for further research on the use of either continuous or binary classification modelling for profit scoring, and the current paper continues this investigation.


                        Time-to-profit can be calculated using the cumulative profit per customer, EBITAcumt
                         (Sánchez Barrios et al., 2014). Customers took their first loan in 14 different cohorts: y = 0–14. Each customer was observed during t = 1–30 months or until they were time-censored. EBITAz
                         was calculated per customer per z = t + y month: z = 1–44, and after deflation and discounting (to account for customers joining at different starting periods) accumulated profit measure is given by

The cumulative return per customer, ROAcumt
                        , is the profit per customer scaled by the outstanding debt. As a cash flow-based measure, it is a proxy of the return per customer excluding the effect of bad debt provisions and other non-cash flow expenses. It can also be interpreted as the coverage against default resulting from the cumulative payments made by a customer until time t (Sánchez Barrios et al., 2014):

                         = final balance (outstanding debt) at time t. As a measure ROAcumt
                         ensures that not only the principal but also interests and other charges in cash are included in the final balance. By definition, revolving credit is dynamic as repurchase may occur and hence the outstanding balance is to some extent open-ended. Hence, ROAcumt
                         is used to define time-to-profit for revolving credit.


                        Time-to-profit, T, is the time that it takes a customer to be profitable or completely covered against default, that is, when the following event occurs:

The standpoint taken in this paper is that a customer is considered profitable once the outstanding balance is fully covered by the cumulative profits obtained until time T. Yet depending on the context, other thresholds can be investigated.

The data set consists of holders of revolving credit granted by a lending institution that mostly serves customers that would be otherwise excluded by other financial institutions. Since the majority of these customers are unbanked, the current practice is to grant credit based on their utility payment behaviour during the previous two years. Not being in arrears is the main criterion to grant credit, given the high risk associated with these segments.

The adopted threshold (ROAcumt
                         ≥ 1) is similar to those used in a micro lending context (Sinha, 2011). The rationale is that the outstanding debt of customers with returns less than 1 have not been fully recovered and hence may be lost given the high risk nature of the credit programme, which is not guaranteed by any collateral. An additional argument to justify such threshold is that micro-lending institutions are assessed in terms of their sustainability (CGAP, 2009). Furthermore, profits generated by existing customers should provide internal funds to grant further credit to new customers for the programme to be sustainable. This can be interpreted as the moment when ROAcumt of existing customers exceeds 1. ‘Goods’ (status = 1) were defined as those that achieved threshold within the observation period t = 30, whereas ‘Bads’ (status = 0) were those below threshold or time-censored. Obviously one could suggest alternative values for the threshold. The chosen threshold was agreed with the company; at this stage, though, values different from 1 would seem more arbitrary. One could define different thresholds throughout the loan duration in terms of anticipated returns during specific points in time and then compare actual returns against such values; this might indicate whether a customer is on track to become profitable at some specified future time. However, the increased uncertainty may potentially create over-optimistic estimates of returns. The danger also would be the inequity of comparison between different segments which might be hard to justify.

Unlike the previous study (Sánchez Barrios et al., 2014) which excluded censored observations from the sample at t = 12, 24 and 30 months, the complete data set (n = 35,530 customers) was considered to produce time-to-profit scorecards including censored observations. Survival analysis techniques can deal with censored observations in contrast with OLS regression that was used in Sánchez Barrios et al. (2014). Customers were observed until they were actually profitable or time censored; for customers who did not achieve profitability by the end of the study's observation period, the common censoring time was t = 30 months.


                        Time-to-profit is discrete for the case under analysis. Payments may occur at any point in time during the observation period; however income and expenses are reconciled at the end of month, together with the outstanding balance. Since customers are deemed profitable only at specific points of time, discrete survival models were used instead of continuous time models such as accelerated failure time or Cox proportional hazard models (Allison, 2010; Kleinbaum & Klein, 2012). This is similar to the approach taken by McDonald, Matuszyk, and Thomas (2010) who considered default for mortgage products.

Only the first instance of becoming profitable was considered in this study. This is the first point where capital can be released for further loans. Using first time-to-profit allows one to apply the model to ‘new’ potential customers. The methodology can be generalised as a process to every time the customer becomes profitable subsequently. To ensure robustness of results, 5-fold cross-validation was used (Demsar, 2006), with n = 35,530 customers (C) in overallC
                         sample being randomly split 5 times in 80/20 training/holdout (T/H) folds. The model was repeatedly estimated on training samples and tested on a corresponding holdout.

Regarding the hazard of being profitable, it started to increase from the second year of observation onwards, with a sharp increase by month 30. As time goes on, hazard of being profitable increases. This justifies exploring different baseline hazard alternatives. A proportional odds model was used to predict a customer´s probability of being profitable at different points of time. A customer-month (CM) observation was generated per month until censoring from the sample occurred (Allison, 1982; Allison, 2010) (see Table 2). This process was applied to each training/holdout fold. Table 3
                         shows socio-demographic and first purchase characteristics that were also used in Sánchez Barrios et al. (2014). The proportional odds model was:

                         is the hazard of being profitable. Various alternatives were considered to account for the unknown nature of such hazard, based on previous applications of discrete hazard model for credit cards (Bellotti & Crook, 2013) and in bankruptcy prediction (Nam, Kim, Park, & Lee, 2008):

The constant hazard in (5) is the most parsimonious alternative. Despite of it being unrealistic, it allows comparison for potential time effects under the following alternatives:

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#


                        Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 present the results of using different alternatives to decide on the best survival model, S1, (Section 4.1.3) for analysis of time-to-profit (i.e. predict when profitability is likely to arise). The aim was to provide a ranking based on probability of achieving profitable status by time t. Models 5–11 refer to different specifications (Eqs. (5)–(11)) of baseline hazard in proportional odds model (Eq. (4)). Section 4.1.4 presents a comparison of the chosen survival model, S2, against OLS models presented in Sánchez Barrios et al. (2014) in terms of their impact on portfolio profits and returns at different acceptance levels.

Models were initially compared in terms of their fit according to AIC; models with lower values were preferred (Panik, 2009). Multicollinearity results were also considered for model assessment; the maximum acceptable value for VIF was 5, since the aim was to identify the separate effects of attributes (Panik, 2009).

As shown in Table 4
                           , models (6)–(11) outperformed model (5) in terms of fit; average AIC of 5 folds for model (5) exceeded those for models (6)–(11). This further confirms that time does have an effect on the hazard of being covered against default. Consequently, the constant hazard model (5) will not be considered further. Models that accounted for time through quadratic, cubic terms, monthly and quarterly dummy variables present high multicollinearity values; with VIF for these models reaching 275. One possible explanation is the treatment of time through highly correlated variables (i.e. powers in the quadratic and cubic models and categorical variables in models that used dummy variables).

Predicted probabilities of a customer being profitable were used as scores. The criterion used to assess predictive ability of models was AUC which is a standard measure in credit scoring (Thomas, 2009) with higher values indicating better models.

Three approaches were used to calculate AUC. Under approach 1, classification accuracy was assessed at t
                           1 = month in which customers were actually profitable or time-censored, where censoring may or may not occur at 30 months. So inputs into AUC calculation included a predicted probability for each customer of being profitable at t
                           1 = actual time-to-profit or censoring time (which varies for different customers) against the actual status of each customer at t
                           1. Under approach 2, classification accuracy was assessed at t
                           2 = 30 months for all customers, assuming at application time it is unknown when a customer will be profitable, yet there is an interest to rank order the customers by probability of becoming profitable by a specific point in time, in this case 30 months. Inputs into AUC calculation include a predicted probability for each customer of being profitable by t
                           2 = 30 months against the actual status at that point in time. Approaches 1 and 2 were applied to Overall
                           M/T sample in Table 2; they only differ in terms of the probability used to score customers resulting from using actual time-to-profit or censoring time (approach 1) and 30 months (approach 2). Approach 3 followed a similar rationale to that of approach 1; however, classification accuracy was assessed until t
                           1 = actual month when customers became profitable or time-censored; therefore, Overall
                           CM/T sample in Table 2 was used to assess the scorecard. This resulted in customer-months with status = 0 until a customer was profitable (status = 1); otherwise, status = 0 throughout the observation period. In contrast with approaches 1 and 2, a predicted probability was produced for every single customer-month until customers became profitable or time-censored and compared against the actual status at each customer-month. Table 4 shows results under approaches 1, 2 and 3 (AUC1, AUC2 and AUC3 respectively). Average AUC of 5 folds was very similar across time-dependent models (6)–(11). Moreover, AUC varied between 0.83 and 0.97. AUC under approach 1 is lower than those for the other two approaches because it assesses scorecards until actual censoring time; this is more conservative than approach 2, which assumes survival until actual median censoring time (t = 30). Under approach 3, more “bads” (status = 0) result from using customer-months, which consequently increases AUC. In terms of AUC across models under the same approach, results were very similar; standard deviation of AUC varied between 0 and 0.012 for training folds and between 0 and 0.011 for holdout folds. Therefore, there is no difference between the time-dependent models in terms of classification accuracy. Results were also similar in terms of significant parameters; this makes sense as time, t, was the only variable that was treated differently in each model. Given the desire to produce stable models and understand the contribution of each variable, multicollinearity should be taken into consideration. This is particularly relevant for revolving credit, which is a long-term product. Consequently, models (6) and (9) should be preferred as they do not present multicollinearity issues. Given the slightly better fit of linear model (6), this was the alternative used to model the baseline hazard in the proportional odds model in the remainder of the paper; difference in models is a result of the set of subjects chosen to work with. Hence the final choice of a survival time-to-profit model was based on model fit and classification accuracy.

Model S1 is the proportional odds model with linear baseline hazard obtained by applying (6) in (4) to Overall
                           CM/T sample in Table 2. Model S1 included only variables significant at 1% level in at least three folds. AUC results were tested in overall
                           CM/H sample. Results were similar to those presented in 4.1.2. Figures in Table 5
                            are standardised values by the intercept for confidentiality reasons.

Customers with longer term loan durations are less likely to be profitable as monthly payments are lower compared with those that took shorter term loans and hence they require longer periods of time to accumulate enough profits that cover their outstanding balance (see results for variables loan3637 to loan6061). Customers that use more their credit limit in their first purchase are less likely to repurchase than those that did the opposite. These customers are also less likely to default in the short term; this increases cumulative profits (Sánchez Barrios et al., 2014). These features increase their likelihood of being profitable (see results for variables loanpr2 and loanpr310). Those that belong to wealthier socioeconomic stratums (strat35), have any type of contract (contcon), live in urban areas (citur) or purchase products different to those usually offered by the lending institution (prod1, prod2) are more likely to be profitable than those in poor stratums, are not formally contracted, live in rural areas or purchase traditional products, respectively. This was expected as customers in the former categories are expected to have more disposable income than those in the latter categories. The effect of time on hazard, confirms that time does increase the hazard of a customer being profitable.

Since a number of previous profit scoring studies (Andreeva et al., 2007; Finlay, 2008
                           , 2010; Sánchez Barrios et al., 2014) used OLS, it was selected as a benchmark for comparison. Specifically, direct profit (P1) and return (R1) scorecards produced through OLS in Sánchez Barrios et al. (2014) were the benchmark models. Model S2 was produced to compare survival with OLS models; it is the proportional odds model with linear baseline hazard obtained by applying (6) in (4) to Trimmed
                           CM/T sample in Table 2. Such sample was derived from the data set (n = 33,964 customers) used in a previous study (Sánchez Barrios et al., 2014). This was done to ensure comparability of results. Results of model S2 were similar to those of model S1 in terms of significant variables.

Survival and OLS models were compared according to their impact on portfolio profits and returns for different acceptance rates (i.e. the percentage of total applicants a lender would be willing to accept). Figs. 1
                            and 2
                            depict cumulative portfolio profits and returns per acceptance rate, respectively as a result of using profit (P1), return (R1) and time-to-profit (S2) scorecards in trimmed
                           C/H sample. Figures were scaled by results for acceptance rate = 100 for confidentiality reasons. Consistent with the results expected from using profit scorecards, portfolio profits improve if P1 scorecard is used instead of R1 and S2. Likewise, if a return-based scorecard (R1, S2) is used, portfolio returns improve accordingly (i.e. P1 was dominated by R1 and S2 in terms of portfolio returns). It is important to note that S2 outperformed R1 in trimmed
                           C/H sample. This is because time-to-profit survival scorecards focus on customers that outperform the rest earlier in terms of being profitable and hence, on outperforming returns. Therefore, it is possible to improve portfolio returns, which is a continuous measure, by using scorecards based on the occurrence of a binary event (survival models).

A second use of predicting time-to-profit is that once a customer is profitable, further credit can be granted to other customers. This is based on the rationale that regardless of future payments, when a customer is covered against default the outstanding balance (i.e. receivables) has already been recovered and hence working capital has been liberated. Thus, time-to-profit is the earliest point in time in which the credit programme can expand once current customers break even, assuming that the working capital associated with them has already been funded since the credit programme launch. The aim is therefore to identify when internal funds are generated and hence to design funding strategies aligned with time-to-profit predictions.

This section presents the models produced to predict time-to-profit for specific segments. In contrast with Section 4.1, the aim was to predict time-to-profit to identify investment opportunities. All models presented in this section (S3 to S6) are based on linear baseline hazard (Eq. (6)) in proportional odds model (Eq. (4)), applied to different samples, depending on the chosen segment.

Given that loan duration for model S1 impacts a customer's likelihood of being profitable and customers with shorter term loans were classified in the top 4 deciles, segmentation on loan duration may be plausible. This was also confirmed by decision tree analysis. Six segments were considered: [12, 25], [30, 31], [36, 37], [42, 43], [48, 61] and “missing”. The gaps between categories correspond to loan durations that did not occur in the data set. These results show that there are distinctive segments of customers, which justifies exploring specific models according to loan duration. Only the first three segments were considered, given that data were only available for t = 30 months and hence longer term segments would require longer observation periods to produce survival models. Segment1C,CM/T,H, Segment2C,CM/T,H and Segment3C,CM/T,H samples correspond to segments [12, 25], [30, 31] and [36, 37] respectively (Table 2). Observations from the three segments were pooled in a single dataset to produce a generic model. The aim was to produce specific models (S3, S4 and S5) for segments [12, 25], [30, 31] and [36, 37] respectively and a generic model (S6) to compare models per segment. Such comparison was done in terms of the identification of investment opportunities, based on predicted time-to-profit.

Cross-validation was conducted as explained in Section 3.2. This was done separately using the pooled dataset and the datasets corresponding to each segment. Generic and segmented models were obtained for each fold. Segmented models S3, S4 and S5 were obtained by using Segment1,2,3,CM/T samples and considering only variables that were significant in at least three folds. Generic model S6 was obtained following the same process but using the dataset pooled from Segment1,2,3,CM/T samples.

Figures in Table 5 are standardised values by the intercept for confidentiality reasons. Once again it was confirmed that customers who use more their credit limit for their first purchase are more likely to be profitable than customers who do the opposite. This is understandable, as default is less likely in the short term. It is remarkable that the impact of credit limit usage on probability of being profitable increases as customers take longer term loans; as time goes on, customers are more likely to be profitable. Belonging to a higher socioeconomic stratum increases the likelihood of being profitable in segments [12, 25] and [36, 37]. Those in segment [30, 31] in age group 5 are more likely to be profitable compared with younger customers because they have more disposable income. Customers in segment [36, 37] that bought product type 3 are less likely to be profitable than those that bought traditional products. Results in generic model S6 were similar to those of model S1 in terms of significant variables. This makes sense given that even though samples are different, the majority of events occurred to customers in segments [12, 25], [30, 31] and [36, 37].

Optimal percentiles under specific models S3, S4 and S5 were 9, 16 and 26 in Segment1C/T, Segment2C/T and Segment3C/T respectively. Optimal percentiles under generic model S6 were 9, 15 and 20 respectively. These results were similar to average optimalp across folds. Similarity in values reflect the general nature of model S6, which only accounts for differences in loan durations through dummy variables compared with specific models per segment. Optimal percentiles of models S3 to S6 were then used to obtain estimates of time-to-profit,

                                 30
                              
                            then the model correctly identifies non-organic growth opportunities within the control period (category 4).

Control periods were mutually exclusive and were defined as: C = 12, 24 and 30. This choice of control periods took into account loan duration and median time-to-profit or censoring, which is not affected by extreme values. From a practitioner´s perspective, this is based on the fact that investment activities are usually conducted over a specific planning horizon with clearly defined control periods. The categories presented above were used to assess model classification accuracy through the use of confusion matrices (Thomas, 2009). Profitable customers were identified as “goods”, whereas “bads” were referred as customers that did not experience the event defined in (3). The aim was to select models with high classification accuracy (i.e. those that identify customers in categories 1 and 4). Total classification accuracy was calculated as the ratio between correctly predicted (actual “goods” and “bads” in categories 1 and 4 respectively) versus total customers. This was done for each control period, accumulating results from previous periods.


                           Table 6
                            shows that in all cases, classification accuracy of models is very low when control period C is less than tmedian
                            for a customer to be profitable (tmedian
                            = 23, 25 and 29 for segments [12, 25], [30, 31] and [36, 37] respectively). This is understandable, as in that case, loans have not matured for a customer to be profitable. This is also justifies the lower classification accuracy of model S4 compared with that of models S3 and S5; for C > tmedian
                           , there is a greater time difference between tmedian
                            and C for segment [30, 31]. This suggests that as the control period C is farther from median time-to-profit, behavioural variables might be more useful to predict time-to-profit than application variables. Results for generic model S6 and segmented models S3 to S5 are very similar in terms of classification accuracy. However, generic model S6 is slightly better than specific models S3 and S4. Similar results were observed in previous studies and can be explained by absence of strong interactions (Bijak & Thomas, 2012).

The classification accuracy results presented in Section 4.2.3 can be related to monetary figures in order to quantify the impact of time-to-profit models on investment planning. The aim is to measure the impact of using such models in monetary terms. This requires identifying the value of the first loan taken by customers from categories 1 to 4 explained in Section 4.2.3. Such value corresponds to the potential of fund generation per customer once time-to-profit event presented in (3) occurs. Such potential may exist (“goods”) or not (“bads”) during a specific control period C. One would expect that models with high classification accuracy result in organic growth opportunities. Consequently, models were assessed in terms of their ability to identify organic growth opportunities. This required calculating a funding potential ratio per customer category. The objective is to identify the proportion of recovered funds (i.e. first loan value) identified by the model per category at t = 12, 24 and 30 (if applicable). This ratio facilitates model comparison across segments and categories:

                           Table 6 compares the impact on investment planning of using each segmented model, S3, S4 and S5, with generic model S6, for segment1,2,3 C/H
                            samples. Results are consistent with those explained before for classification accuracy; specific and generic models perform similarly in terms of organic growth identification. A slightly better performance of model S6 for segments [12, 25] and [30, 31] would justify using generic rather than specific models. Longitudinal analysis of funding potential1 captured by generic model S6 shows that segment [12, 25] cannot grow organically by C = 12; funding potential1 = 53% by C = 24. Residual opportunities of organic growth (5%) are identified by C = 24 for segment [30, 31], whereas the earliest control period in which organic funding occurs for segment [36, 37] is C = 30, with funding potential1 = 72%. These results show that the credit programmes can be self-sustainable, allowing for time-to-profit to occur. Alternative funding sources different to the credit programme itself should be explored if the aim is to expand it using internal sources, that is, before time-to-profit occurs.

Cross-sectional analysis of models per segment sheds light on their usefulness once tmedian time-to-profit is exceeded. Models for segments [12, 25] and [36, 37] could be used to expand the credit programme by 35% (C = 24) and 47% (C = 30) respectively (see NOF results for model S6 in Table 6). This is a positive feature of using time-to-profit models to offer loans to customers that otherwise use informal lending sources which are more costly to them (Solo & Manroth, 2006) and are commonly used in Colombia (Econometria, 2008). In contrast, models for segment [30, 31] identify residual growth opportunities by C = 30 (5%); this follows from high proportions of customers classified in categories 2 and 3 (see funding potential2,3 for segment [30,31] in Table 6, which are related with delaying and anticipating time-to-profit respectively). Proportions of customers in categories 2 and 3 in segments [12, 25] and [36, 37] show that models in the former are more conservative than the latter. It is important to note the ability of models for segment [36, 37] to identify funds that will not be available for internal growth (funding potential4); this provides managers with useful information regarding alternative funding sources such as cross-subsidisation between segments and further capital required from shareholders.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This is the first study that formally defines and models time-to-profit for scoring consumer revolving credit. Time-to-profit refers to the period of time it takes a customer to be profitable for the first time since the first purchase (i.e. when cumulative payments are sufficient to cover the outstanding debt, regardless of additional payments or regulatory debt provisions). Defining the event of a customer being profitable and hence time-to-profit requires a threshold for a customer´s cumulative return, ROAcumt
                        . The threshold taken in this study is when ROAcumt
                         ≥ 1.

Survival techniques for profit scoring demonstrate positive impact on portfolio results through the use of models based on the probability of occurrence of a binary event (i.e. time-to-profit) instead of using models that predict continuous measures (i.e. OLS return scorecards). It is possible then to obtain good results in terms of classification accuracy and impact on portfolio returns when using time-to-profit scorecards. This has not been achieved before through the use of OLS and traditional logistic regression. It is important to note, however, that the dilemma of maximising both portfolio profits and returns simultaneously through the use of either profit or return scorecards still holds. Ultimately, profit, return and time-to-profit scorecards were designed to improve the same measures at the portfolio level.

In terms of significant variables, two attributes had the highest economic significance in time-to-profit scorecards: loan duration and credit limit usage. Customers with longer term loan durations pay lower instalment during longer periods of time, which increases the time required for a customer to be profitable; this shows that time-to-profit survival scorecards are conservative, as customers with shorter loan durations are hence ranked in top deciles. Credit limit usage is related to lower probabilities of repurchase and default.

For investment planning, the relevance of loan duration for revolving credit with an agreed payment period as the case under consideration was further confirmed. Again, the economic significance of credit limit usage was remarkable, in particular as segments reflected longer term loans. High risk credit programmes can be profitable and furthermore, internal funding can foster their growth. This requires, however, identifying when customers are profitable.

Using time-to-profit has several managerial implications. First, it can be readily implemented through the use of ROAcumt
                        , a return-based measure per customer; the data required for calculating such measure is usually gathered for profit scoring and regulatory purposes. Regarding the specificity of the product, revolving credit is more dynamic than fixed term loans; this is because default and repurchase may occur simultaneously and hence balances are more subject to change; a return-based measure can reflect such change throughout time. Time-to-profit can be equally applied to fixed term loans or any interest-bearing product. Second, as a return measure, it can be used to design scorecards to target customers that contribute to achieve company results according to industry performance and shareholders’ expectations. Hence, time-to-profit scorecards enhance coordination between strategic and operational levels with the aim of enhancing portfolio returns. Third, as an investment planning tool, predicting time-to-profit is useful to schedule investment planning activities of credit programmes. Knowing when customers are profitable is crucial to plan ordered growth strategies of credit programmes through internal (organic) and/or external sources. This enhances the sustainability of credit programmes that are profitable but might not be supported because of their high risk nature. Furthermore, it enables managers to allocate cash surpluses in risky but profitable segments. Fourth, survival scorecards are the most conservative compared with OLS profits and returns scorecards. This is from a coverage-against-default perspective, which provides reassurance to managers that customers with the best profile in terms of time-to-profit are ranked in the top deciles. This provides managers with further reasons additional to profitability to serve unexplored segments such as unbanked customers and other high risk segments. Finally, time-to-profit scorecards justify the use of actual cash flow-based measures per customer instead of those based on accrued profits; this is useful to adequately reflect the continuity potential of a credit programme. Ultimately, cash is the actual source of funds the lender can use to expand the scope of credit programmes.

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

The main limitation of this study was that data was only available for 30 months since the launch of the credit programme. This observation period implies a long term perspective usually associated with profit scoring, in contrast with default scoring. However, most of the durations of the first loans were at least 55 months; a longer observation period would have been useful for those loans to perform and hence to develop specific models for that segment. A second limitation was that this study only considered time-to-profit for the first time and not the repetition of such event in the longer term. A longer observation period would have allowed modelling repeated events and associated changes in hazard. Therefore, the scorecards developed in this study are useful to rank customers based on their contribution to customer profitability during the observation period rather than over their lifetime. Yet this study provides a framework to embark on the analysis of time-to-profit in other cases in which data for longer performance periods are available.

In this study we only considered time-to-profit using a cumulative return measure. Alternative ratios such as margin and/or turnover that underlie customer profitability (Palepu, Healy, & Peek, 2013) could be used to design scorecards. Such approach would build on this and previous studies that identified repurchase as a profit (return) driver of revolving credit. Return on equity could alternatively be used if emphasis is made on results reported to shareholders instead. Time-to-profit scorecards designed in this study were based on a customer being profitable, that is, when ROAcumt
                         ≥ 1. Further avenues of research could focus on the impact of using different opportunity costs and profitability thresholds at a customer level; at a portfolio level, different thresholds on acceptance rates and coverage against default can also be explored. Choice will depend on risk appetite of lenders and industry regulations. This rationale could also be adopted for margin and turnover ratios, depending on the industry under analysis. Finally, time-to-profit behavioural scorecards could be designed to further enhance the usefulness of survival techniques.
