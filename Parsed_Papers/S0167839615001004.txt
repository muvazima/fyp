                  The Laplace–Beltrami operator is the foundation of describing geometric partial differential equations, and it also plays an important role in the fields of computational geometry, computer graphics and image processing, such as surface parameterization, shape analysis, matching and interpolation. However, constructing the discretized Laplace–Beltrami operator with convergent property has been an open problem. In this paper we propose a new discretization scheme of the Laplace–Beltrami operator over triangulated surfaces. We prove that our discretization of the Laplace–Beltrami operator converges to the Laplace–Beltrami operator at every point of an arbitrary smooth surface as the size of the triangular mesh over the surface tends to zero. Numerical experiments are conducted, which support the theoretical analysis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Laplace–Beltrami operator (LBO) is a generalization of the Laplace operator from flat spaces to manifolds. It plays a central role in many areas, such as image processing (Bertalmio et al., 2000; Kimmel et al., 1997; Sapiro, 2006; Weickert, 1998), surface processing (Bajaj and Xu, 2003; Clarenz et al., 2000; Desbrun et al., 1999; Meyer et al., 2003; Schneider and Kobbelt, 2000, 2001), and the study of geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) (Bertalmio et al., 2000; Mayer, 2001; Sapiro, 2006; ter Haar Romeny, 1994). In these applications, the objective surfaces to be processed are usually represented as discrete meshes. Hence, it is necessary in practice to discretize the LBO.

The classical Laplace operator on flat spaces is generally approximated by a finite difference method. However, due to the complexity and diversity of the discretized manifold surfaces, the discretization of the LBO is much more complicated than the Laplacian over flat spaces. In the literature, several discretizations have been proposed over triangular meshes (Pinkall and Polthier, 1993; Taubin, 1995; Desbrun et al., 1999; Mayer, 2001; Xu, 2004; Demanet, 2006). Most of them are variants of the cotangent scheme (Pinkall and Polthier, 1993), which is a form of the finite element method, applied to the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a surface. Given a surface with a fine mesh, we expect the discretization computed from such a mesh provides an accurate representation of the underlying surface Laplacian. However, a detailed theoretical analysis of existing discretizations in Xu (2004) shows that while point-wise convergence can be established for special classes of meshes, such as certain meshes with valence-6, or for linear functions over a sphere in 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              3
                           
                        
                     , none of these methods is convergent for surface meshes in general. Wardetzky (2008) also provided an overview over convergence properties of weak versions of the LBO for embedded polyhedral surfaces from a functional-analytic viewpoint.

For the quadrilateral or even general polygonal meshes there are far fewer results. Liu et al. (2008) described a discretization of the LBO on quadrilateral meshes based on a bilinear interpolation of the quadrilateral. They achieved consistency under some special, but not too restrictive conditions. Xiong et al. (2011) obtained a discrete LBO on quadrilateral meshes by averaging the cotangent scheme over all possible triangulations of the given mesh, and Alexa and Wardetzky (2011) extended the cotangent scheme to the case of general polygonal meshes. Recently, Carl (2015) derived a Laplace operator on semi-discrete surface, which is represented by a mapping into 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              3
                           
                        
                      possessing one discrete and one continuous variable. He proved consistency of the semi-discrete Laplacian, meaning that it converges point-wise to the Laplace–Beltrami operator when the semi-discrete surface converges to a smooth one, and also showed convergence of the discretization of LBO on quadrilateral meshes defined in Alexa and Wardetzky (2011).

In Belkin et al. (2008), the authors introduced a point-wise convergent discretization of the LBO on the triangular mesh, called the mesh Laplacian. The construction is based on a discretization of the heat kernel defined on the flat space 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     . The convergent properties have been generalized by Belkin et al. (2009) to point clouds in 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              d
                           
                        
                     , and they constructed the PCD Laplacian. Sun et al. (2009) applied the mesh Laplacian to the computation of the heat kernel signature, which is obtained by restricting the heat kernel to the time domain, and derived a concise and provably informative multi-scale point signature based on the heat diffusion process. A notable recent work (Liu et al., 2012) built a new point-wisely symmetrizable discrete LBO over the point-sampled surface which is also based on the same discretization of the heat kernel. The authors also indicated that their discretization can provide orthogonal bases for further spectral geometric analysis and processing tasks. In Hildebrandt and Polthier (2011), the authors proposed a principle for constructing strongly consistent discrete LBO based on the cotangent weights.

In this paper, we present a new discretization scheme that guarantees convergence at each point, which is 
                        
                           
                              L
                           
                           
                              ∞
                           
                        
                      convergence, and it is applicable to arbitrary triangulated surfaces. We summarize our main contributions as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           Our discretization scheme is based on a discretization of the heat kernel defined on the curved surface embedded in 
                                 
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                    
                                       3
                                    
                                 
                              . It is much more accurate than the scheme based on the discretization of the heat kernel defined on the plane, especially for waved surfaces with insufficient dense triangulations;

Our discretization scheme is applicable to arbitrary triangulated surfaces without the limitation on the quality of the triangular mesh. We study how the surface and its triangulation influence the integral approximation over a surface;

Combining the integral approximation results with the idea of approximating the heat flow on a triangular mesh, we present a local and adaptive algorithm for approximating the LBO on an arbitrary surface with a point-wise convergence guarantee for triangular meshes;

We propose a method to estimate the parameters involved in the algorithm adaptively; and

We provide experimental results showing that our method outperforms other discretization schemes in terms of 
                                 
                                    
                                       L
                                    
                                    
                                       ∞
                                    
                                 
                               convergence.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the LBO and its approximation. In Section 3, we describe a quantitative measure of how well a triangular mesh approximates the underlying surface. In Section 4, we present and analyze our method for approximating the LBO with a point-wise convergence guarantee for arbitrary triangulated surfaces. Some numerical results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper. Some proofs of the theoretical results are presented in Appendix A.

                            denotes the Euclidean distance between two points x and y on surface 
                              S
                           . But we believe that the geodesic distance is a better choice, especially for the steep surfaces. Numerical experiments in Section 5 will illustrate our statement.

From (5), we can observe that

                      is global in the sense that computing the Laplacian of a function at some points requires the integral over the whole surface. Now we localize the approximation

                        Results like this lemma have been proposed in Lemma 3.3 in Belkin et al. (2008). We put the proof of this lemma into Appendix A of the paper.

In this section, we present our local algorithm for approximating the LBO on an arbitrary surface by constructing the discretized version of the integral (7).

First, we construct a discretized version of the integral

                        △
                        )
                      denotes the area of the triangle △. That is, each triangle of the mesh contributes to

                     Lemma 5 implies that the triangular mesh K is close to the underlying surface 
                        S
                      both geometrically and topologically. Intuitively, quantities defined on 
                        S
                      are closely related to their analogs defined on K. Indeed, consider an arbitrary but fixed triangle 
                        △
                        ∈

                     , note that although the map ξ is not differentiable on the entire domain K, it is differentiable for the interior of △. We now present a result on bounding the Jacobian of the map ξ.

                        Results like this theorem have been proposed in Theorem 2.1 in Belkin et al. (2008). We put the proof of this theorem into Appendix A of the paper.

By now, we have proven that, as the approximating mesh of the surface becomes denser, our discretization of LBO on K converges to the Laplace–Beltrami operator on

                     , we compute the mean curvature using (4). Let d denote the maximal edge length of the triangular mesh K, which is called the mesh size of K.

Since our algorithm is based on a no-boundary condition and it holds for interior points of a surface, we consider six two-variable functions over the region

To measure the error between our discretization of the LBO and the surface Laplacian, we consider the maximal error between the approximated mean curvature computed by our proposed approximate operator

                      for the regular and unstructured meshes respectively. It is easy to see that the approximation errors of all six surfaces by our method always approach to zero as 
                        d

                      norm.

                      show the distributions of the absolute errors between the exact mean curvatures and the approximated mean curvatures, which are computed by our method on surfaces defined by (18) with regular and unstructured meshes respectively. We can observe that our method achieves pretty good approximations in flat regions, but the absolute errors are relatively large at sharp edges or spikes. This makes sense since the approximated geodesic distance between any two points on triangular mesh K is closely related to the geodesic distance on the original surface 
                        S
                      in gently changed regions, while it may result in relatively larger error in sharp regions.

To better analyze the convergence property of our discretization of the LBO, we compare the behaviours of our method with those of the cotangent scheme (Xu, 2004), mesh Laplacian (Belkin et al., 2008) and PCD Laplacian (Belkin et al., 2009) as the mesh becomes denser and denser. Similar to the computation of our method, we also compute the maximal errors between the exact mean curvature computed from the continuous surfaces defined by (18) and the approximated mean curvatures computed by the above three methods for the regular and unstructured meshes shown in Fig. 2. The numerical results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. We can observe that the maximal absolute errors of all six surfaces using our method always approach to zero as the mesh sizes tend to zero. In contrast, finer mesh does not lead to lower approximation errors by the cotangent scheme, mesh Laplacian and PCD Laplacian. We can see that our discretization provides better approximation than the mesh Laplacian and cotangent scheme, and the PCD Laplacian also provides better approximation except the unstructured mesh defined by 
                        
                           
                              F

                      which has a waterfall shape. The reason why the PCD Laplacian works badly for these meshes is that this method projects the neighbour dataset of the point of interest onto its tangent plane, which introduces significant errors. It is easy to see that the PCD Laplacian achieves better approximation than our discretization on the surfaces defined by 
                        
                           
                              F

                      and 
                        
                           
                              F

                      which have single peaks, when the point cloud is dense enough.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have developed an adaptive algorithm for approximating the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a triangular mesh with point-wise convergence guarantee. Such convergence is required in many applications, where quantities, such as mean curvature, need to be estimated at each node of the mesh. The convergence result does not require the aspect ratio of mesh elements to be bounded. Experimental results show that our algorithm indeed exhibits convergence empirically, and outperforms current popular methods in accuracy. Especially, our method provides quite good approximation of the LBO for surfaces with sharp features. In the future, we will investigate symmetrizable discrete LBO based on our method and then build a set of orthogonal bases for spectral analysis over triangulated manifold surfaces.
