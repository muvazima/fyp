                  The starting point for this paper is a nonlinear, two-point boundary value ordinary differential equation (BVODE) that defines corneal curvature according to a static force balance. A numerical solution to the BVODE is computed by first converting the BVODE to a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) by adding an initial value (t, pseudo-time) derivative to the BVODE. A numerical solution to the PDE is then computed by the method of lines (MOL) with the calculation proceeding to a sufficiently large value of t such that the derivative in t reduces to essentially zero. The PDE solution at this point is also the solution for the BVODE. This procedure is implemented in R (an open source scientific programming system) and the programming is discussed in some detail. A series approximation to the solution is derived from which an estimate for the rate of convergence is obtained. This is compared to a fitted exponential model. Also, two linear approximations are derived, one of which leads to a closed form solution. Both provide solutions very close to that obtained from the full nonlinear model. An estimate for the cornea radius of curvature is also derived. The paper concludes with a discussion of the features of the solution to the ODE/PDE system.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Mathematical modeling in biological and medical sciences is currently receiving wide attention. Qualitative and quantitative models can provide a major advantage in the diagnosis and prediction of the outcome of therapies for different diseases and related health issues. In the case of vision, ophthalmologists and optometrists generally consider the cornea as one of the most important components of the eye that is crucial for normal vision [1]. For diagnostic purposes, a detailed knowledge of corneal topography and curvature is essential. To understand these features, a sufficient level of detail is achieved only by accurate measurements and correct mathematical models [2].

For corneal topography modeling, models based on various conical sections such as ellipsoids and paraboloids [3] are well established and confirmed as accurate. This approach goes back to Helmholtz [4] who proposed ellipses as descriptions of corneal profiles. Presently, this description along with its many variations is the main basis for the mathematical modeling of corneal topography (for a survey see [5] and references therein; [6] presents some generalizations). Additionally, models and associated numerical simulations of the biomechanical shell that constitutes the cornea are now widely studied (see e.g., [7,8]). These structural models are invaluable for understanding the fine details of many corneal features such as their age-dependent evolution [9] and apex displacement caused by intra-ocular pressure [10]. The greater complexity of biomechanical models provides enhanced insight of the model accuracy and physical interpretations.

This paper considers the numerical analysis of an intermediate (in accuracy and complexity) model between the conical sectional and structural mechanical approaches. The starting point for the analysis of corneal curvature is [11] a static force balance (see also its generalization [12])

                     Eq. (2a) reflects the symmetry of the corneal curvature h(x) around x=0. Eq. (2b) indicates that the height h(x) is defined relative to the height at x=1. Eqs. (1) and (2) constitute the BVODE to be integrated numerically as explained next. For more formal and theoretical developments of the considered problem see [13].

A variety of methods exists for the solution of BVODEs. For example, the derivatives in Eq. (1) could be replaced by finite differences. The resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations could be solved with a variant of Newton׳s method. Here we consider an approach that offers significant advantages, that is, conversion of Eq. (1) to a partial differential equation (PDE).

This is accomplished by appending a derivative to Eq. (1) in a second independent variable t

                     Eqs. (4) follow from Eqs. (2). Eqs. (3)–(5) constitute the PDE MOL formulation of interest.

As an incidental note, t in Eq. (3) is not part of the original BVODE problem, Eqs. (1) and (2). The solution of Eqs. (3)–(5) is termed the method of false transients as it takes its name from the introduction of the pseudo-time variable t. t can also be considered as a continuation parameter that takes (continues) the solution from t=0 to the desired solution of Eq. (1) as 
                        h
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        t
                        →
                        ∞
                        )
                     .

The principal advantage of this approach is that we can use well established methods for PDEs, in this case, the method of lines (MOL) considered next.

The MOL is based on the replacement of the PDE boundary value (spatial) partial derivatives, e.g., 
                        
                           
                              ∂
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                        h
                        /
                        ∂
                        
                           
                              x
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      in Eq. (3), with algebraic approximations. In the present case, the approximations are finite differences (FDs), although other possibilities include finite volumes, finite elements, spectral and least squares approximations. The algebraic replacement of the boundary value derivatives leaves only one independent variable, the initial value variable (time, t) so that a system of approximating ODEs results. This system of initial value ODEs can then be integrated by a library routine.

These steps in the MOL solution of Eqs. (3)–(5) are illustrated with the ODE/MOL routines corneal_2.R in Appendix A1 and the main program is Appendix A2. Some features of these two R routines are considered next (for more information see [14]).

The ODE/MOL R routine for Eqs. (3) and (4) is listed in Appendix A1. We can note a few particular points about this routine.

                           A grid in x is defined with nx=21 points in the main program discussed next, which is the basis for 21 ODEs approximating Eq. (3). The dependent variable vector for the 21 ODEs is u (in accordance with the usual convention for PDE numerical analysis, u rather than h is used for the dependent variable of Eq. (3)). Then, corneal_2 computes 21 ODE derivatives in t which are placed in the array ut. To start, BC (4b) is programmed as

This description of the MOL solution of Eqs. (3)–(5) is abbreviated to conserve space. A more complete description is given in [15], Chapter 8. A discussion of the method applied to 2D problems is given in [16], Chapter 10.

The composite 3×2 plot is in Fig. 1.

We can note the following particular details of Fig. 1

                              All six plots start at t=0 with a constant value from the IC u0[i]=0 discussed previously (note the horizontal line in each plot).

The curves in all six plots appear to be approaching a final steady state through the six successive values

                                  plot (top left corner), 
                                    u

                                 . This is confirmed with the following numerical output from Listing 2 with u(0,t)=0.35188 for t=1 (Table 2
                                 ). Also, u(xl,t)=0.00000 in accordance with BC (4b). The number of calls to corneal_2, 131, is quite modest indicating lsodes efficiently integrated the 21 ODEs.

As the solution approaches a steady state,

                                    u

                                    t
                                    ≈
                                    0
                                  in the 
                                    (
                                    3

                                    2
                                    )
                                  plot (lower right corner) as expected.

The contributions of the three RHS terms of Eq. (3) are clear in the 
                                    (
                                    2

                                    2
                                    )
                                    ,

                                  plots. In this way, the properties of a PDE solution can be explained in detail.

The approach to a steady state is further confirmed in Table 3
                                  for 
                                    0

                         as a surface plot that illustrates how the solution evolves in space and pseudo-time. It is clear that the solution quickly and smoothly approaches a steady state. It is particularly interesting to observe how the solution at x=0 evolves, as this location is subject to the Neumann boundary condition

A simple analytical demonstration of the method of false transients follows from a linearization of the nonlinear equation (1). According to the Gullstrand eye model, the typical cornea has the radii of curvature ρ equal to 7.7mm for anterior and 6.8mm for posterior surfaces respectively [17]. Moreover, since the typical diameter d of the cornea is equal to 11.5mm, by the formula for circular segment

                     . We see that increasing parameter a increases the rate of decay of the solution. This shows a major advantage of the false transient method: exponential decay forces the solution of parabolic problem (3)–(5) to quickly reach the steady-state (equilibrium solution).

A check on the rate of decay can be made by fitting an exponential model to the evolution of h. As an example, let us focus on the case of 
                        a
                        =
                        b

                     obtained from the full non-linear model of Eq. (1) and BC (2a). Ophthalmologists measure the curvature of cornea in almost every eye examination and can diagnose some corneal problems (like astigmatism) from it. Having an accurate approximation to this radius is very valuable to assist in a diagnosis.

In conclusion, the solution of BVODE (1) by integration of the parabolic PDE (3) is straightforward by the MOL. An important advantage of this approach is the use of a quality library ODE integrator, lsodes from the R package deSolve 
                     [18], which computed the solution to the 21 MOL/ODEs accurately and efficiently. This conclusion reflects our general experience with the numerical MOL integration of PDE systems. An estimate for the rate of convergence to the solution for

                        )
                      is given by Eq. (17) in the form of a truncated series solution. This compares very well to the fitted exponential model of Eq. (18), as illustrated in Fig. 4.

Finally, we have demonstrated two approximations that can be used to linearize the model. The first uses a simple average value for the gradient of

                      from Eq. (6) that is substituted into Eq. (1) and solved by MOL. The second is a more accurate gradient approximation given by Eq. (19) that leads to the closed-form approximate solution of Eq. (21). Both these approximations give very good predictions for corneal surface height h(x), the required solution to Eq. (1), as illustrated in Fig. 5. The closed form solution also leads to a simple estimate for the cornea radius of curvature.
