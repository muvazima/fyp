                  Several modification algorithms that alter natural or synthetic speech with the goal of improving intelligibility in noise have been proposed recently. A key requirement of many modification techniques is the ability to predict intelligibility, both offline during algorithm development, and online, in order to determine the optimal modification for the current noise context. While existing objective intelligibility metrics (OIMs) have good predictive power for unmodified natural speech in stationary and fluctuating noise, little is known about their effectiveness for other forms of speech. The current study evaluated how well seven OIMs predict listener responses in three large datasets of modified and synthetic speech which together represent 396 combinations of speech modification, masker type and signal-to-noise ratio. The chief finding is a clear reduction in predictive power for most OIMs when faced with modified and synthetic speech. Modifications introducing durational changes are particularly harmful to intelligibility predictors. OIMs that measure masked audibility tend to over-estimate intelligibility in the presence of fluctuating maskers relative to stationary maskers, while OIMs that estimate the distortion caused by the masker to a clean speech prototype exhibit the reverse pattern.

                        We use the term ‘natural’ to signify speech produced by a human talker as opposed to speech which is natural-sounding.
                      or synthetic speech can be made more robust through algorithmic speech modification. Unlike traditional speech enhancement techniques (e.g., Hu and Loizou, 2004; Martin, 2005; Chen et al., 2006; Srinivasan et al., 2007) which focus on the noise-corrupted speech signal, the speech modification approach (e.g., Sauert and Vary, 2006; Bonardo and Zovato, 2007; Yoo et al., 2007; Brouckxon et al., 2008; Tang and Cooke, 2010) alters the clean speech signal prior to output or transmission. A recent evaluation (Cooke et al., 2013b) demonstrated that speech modification can result in intelligibility gains in noise equivalent to increases of more than 5dB in output level.

A key ingredient in the design of effective modification strategies is the estimation of listener performance at frequent intervals during the development cycle. However, while subjective intelligibility scores remain the ultimate reference, continuous behavioural testing during algorithm design is usually infeasible. An alternative is to use objective intelligibility metrics (OIMs) to predict listener scores. OIMs not only avoid the need for extensive subjective testing, but can also be used at the core of the algorithm optimisation process. A number of speech modification algorithms (e.g., Sauert and Vary, 2010a; Tang and Cooke, 2011; Taal et al., 2013; Valentini-Botinhao et al., 2014) have been developed and optimised based on maximising intelligibility predictions made by OIMs such as the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII; ANSI, 1997) or the glimpse proportion metric (GP; Cooke, 2006).

OIMs have been motivated by two distinct approaches to account for the effect of noise on speech. In addition to the aforementioned SII and GP metrics, the Articulation Index (AI; French and Steinberg, 1947; Fletcher and Galt, 1950; Kryter, 1962a,b), and the extended Speech Intelligibility Index (ESII; Rhebergen and Versfeld, 2005) focus on quantifying the masked audibility of speech in the presence of noise. On the other hand, techniques such as the Normalised-Covariance Measure (NCM; Holube and Kollmeier, 1996; Ma et al., 2009), the Christiansen–Pedersen–Dau metric (henceforth referred to as CPD for brevity; Christiansen et al., 2010) and the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility metric (STOI; Taal et al., 2010) correlate representations of the clean reference speech and the speech-plus-noise signal in an attempt to measure the distortion caused by the masker. Another distortion-based approach is the Coherence Speech Intelligibility Index (CSII) proposed by Kates and Arehart (2005). The CSII measures the similarity between clean and noisy speech using magnitude-square coherence (Carter et al., 1973; Kates, 1992) which quantifies the degree to which the output of a system is linearly related to its input.

Both audibility- and distortion-based approaches target spectro-temporal regions least affected by the noise, but differ in their assumptions. While techniques based on audibility require separated estimates of speech and noise in order to estimate masking, distortion-based OIMs assume that human listeners possess a template of the clean speech which is compared to the incoming noisy speech.

When an OIM is employed as the objective function to be maximised, the predictive accuracy of the OIM is critical in determining the validity and effectiveness of the optimisation process. Most of the OIMs mentioned above have been evaluated with recorded natural speech or speech processed by noise reduction techniques. Relatively few studies have investigated their predictive power for modified natural speech or synthetic speech in noise: most OIMs were originally proposed to predict the intelligibility of distorted natural speech, for distortions caused by additive noise together with artefacts introduced by suppression algorithms applied to the noisy speech signal.

Predicting the intelligibility impact of modification algorithms is likely to be challenging since the most successful methods (in terms of improving masked intelligibility) modify the signal in diverse domains – durational and spectral/formant – and possibly through non-linear operations. While the alterations benefit intelligibility, they may also introduce artefacts to the speech signal, leading to degraded speech quality. Nevertheless, the relation between speech intelligibility and quality is complex, and factors such as listening effort and loudness interact. Intelligibility and quality are not simply negatively or positively correlated, especially across listeners (Preminger and Tasell, 1995). For synthetic speech it might be expected that the OIMs’ task is even more challenging because the natural speech reference signal is not available, i.e., distortions introduced by the text-to-speech (TTS) system cannot be taken into account. Consequently, predicting the intelligibility of poor quality synthetic speech may be even more difficult.

In two initial studies, which concerned solely the ability of OIMs to predict the masked intelligibility of modified and synthetic speech regardless of the perceptual speech quality, we observed a large reduction in the predictive accuracy of several OIMs on modified and synthetic speech relative to unmodified speech (Tang and Cooke, 2011; Valentini-Botinhao et al., 2011). The current study extends these pilots to a larger range of objective intelligibility metrics and includes behavioural data from recent extensive evaluations of 30 forms of modified and synthetic speech (Cooke et al., 2013a,b). Specifically, we evaluate the performance of one standard (SII) and six recent objective intelligibility metrics (ESII, GP, NCM, CSII, CPD, STOI) in predicting subjective intelligibility scores for both modified and synthetic speech in additive noise. The evaluation makes use of three datasets which together contain 396 combinations of speech modification, masker type and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The seven metrics are introduced in Section 2 while Section 3 describes the evaluation datasets. The outcome of a comparison of model predictions against behavioural data from large-scale listening tests is presented in Section 4.

SII and AI share a common underlying idea: speech intelligibility is dependent on the audibility of the signal in each frequency band. The AI can be expressed as a function of the masking level represented by the SNR (

ESII is an extension of SII designed to better predict intelligibility in the face of fluctuating maskers (Rhebergen and Versfeld, 2005). ESII computes the SII for each time frame (SII
                        local). Frame durations range from 35ms for the lowest frequency critical band to 9.4ms for the highest. The ESII model prediction is then based on the average SII across all frames:

                        Simpson and Cooke (2005) compared the masking effectiveness of N-talker babble noise on speech intelligibility for a range of N, showing that a single competing speaker or amplitude-modulated noise is much less effective as a masker than multi-talker babble or speech-shaped noise. These basic findings motivated the glimpsing model of speech perception in noise (Cooke, 2006) in which not only temporal but also spectro-temporal modulations play a role in defining those parts of the speech signal that escape masking. The glimpse proportion is intended to reflect the local audibility of speech in noise and is defined as the percentage of spectro-temporal regions in modelled auditory excitation patterns whose local SNR exceeds a threshold α

                         is the Heaviside unit step function counting the number of ‘glimpses’ which meet the local masked audibility criterion α. The STEP is derived by a gammatone filterbank (Patterson et al., 1988) using an implementation introduced by Cooke (1993). The Hilbert envelope of each filter output is computed and smoothed by a leaky integrator with a 8ms time constant (Moore et al., 1988), downsampled and log-compressed.

Glimpse proportion itself was not proposed originally as a dedicated intelligibility predictor but as an intermediate representation prior to a recognition component. However, with a number of simple extensions, GP has the potential to serve as an easily computed proxy for the amount of speech that survives energetic masking. The new metric (Eq. (7)) takes into account (i) the audibility of speech in quiet, (ii) the impact of durational changes, and (iii) ceiling performance, as detailed below:

                           orig
                         denotes the number of time frames in the unmodified speech STEP. The function 
                           v
                         compresses GP scores to reflect the finding that subjective performance reaches a ceiling for GP values significantly lower than unity.

Here, a 34-channel gammatone filterbank with filter centre frequencies covering the range 100–7500Hz linearly spaced on the equivalent rectangle bandwidth scale (Moore and Glasberg, 1983) was used to derive the STEPs. The local masked audibility threshold α was set to 3dB, a value which produced a high listener-model correlation (ρ
                        =0.96) in Cooke (2006).

Within the framework of the AI metric, the normalised-covariance measure (NCM) was motivated by the idea that noise both reduces and interferes with the temporal modulations of speech. Instead of measuring the SNR level, which is a relationship between speech and noise alone, the signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) is used to quantify the degree of distortion. In frequency channel f the correlation coefficient r

                        =0.90).

CSII replaces the correlation coefficient between the frequency-dependent Hilbert envelopes of the clean and noisy speech in Eq. (9) with the magnitude-square coherence γ
                        2 to quantify the degree to which the noisy speech is linearly related to the clean speech

                        The weights shown minimise the mean-squared error between model predictions and listener scores, based on an unconstrained nonlinear minimisation method introduced by Nelder and Mead (1965). It can be seen that CSII only uses the information from the mid and low-level frames to make intelligibility predictions. In Kates and Arehart (2005), CSII showed good intelligibility prediction (ρ
                        =0.94) for speech in additive noise and speech with peak-clipping and centre-clipping distortions.

CPD uses a psychoacoustically validated model of auditory processing (Dau et al., 1996) to generate an internal representation of a signal. The signal is passed through 32 gammatone filters followed by half-wave rectification and five non-linear loops to model auditory nerve fibre adaptation. Denoting the internal representations of the reference speech signal and speech-noise mixture as s and y, a frame-based cross-correlation r(t) between s and y is then computed every 20ms with a 50% overlap:

                         denote the average across time and frequency of the internal representation of the reference signal s and corrupted signal y at frame t, respectively. F and I are the number of frequency bands and samples in a frame. Simultaneously, the frames are classified into three levels (low, mid, high) following the frame classification introduced in CSII. The overall intelligibility of each level (r

                        ). The intelligibility prediction by the CPD metric was reported in Christiansen et al. (2010) to have high correlation with subjective data in speech-shaped noise (ρ
                        =0.96), cafe noise (ρ
                        =0.94), car noise (ρ
                        =0.97) and bottle noise (ρ
                        =0.88) for enhanced speech processed by ideal time-frequency segregation (ITFS) techniques (Cooke et al., 2001; Wang, 2005).

The STOI metric was initially designed to predict the intelligibility of speech processed by enhancement algorithms such as ITFS, and a high correlation (ρ
                        =0.95) with subjective data was reported for this type of enhanced speech in noise (Taal et al., 2010). Both the corrupted speech signal and the reference signal are represented with time-frequency excitation spectra in 15 third-octave bands and 384-ms frames using the discrete Fourier transform. In order to de-emphasise the impact of regions in which noise dominates the spectrum, excitation spectra of the corrupted speech Y are further clipped by a normalisation procedure expressed in Eq. (18), where S is the excitation spectrum of the reference signal:

The OIMs described above were evaluated based on listeners’ responses to speech from three datasets (Table 1
                     ). One – natural – consists of unmodified and modified natural speech. A second dataset, tts, contains speech generated by an HMM-based synthesiser. The third dataset, hurricane, is made up of both natural and synthetic speech. Further details of the listening tests are provided in the articles mentioned in Table 1.

The natural dataset (Tang and Cooke, 2011) was created to investigate modifications to sentences drawn from the GRID corpus (Cooke et al., 2006) with a sampling frequency of 25kHz. Twenty-four native British English speakers identified the spoken letter (‘A–Z’, except ‘W’) and digit (0–9) keywords in sentences such as ‘Place blue at C 3 now’. Listeners listened to the sentences embedded in noise over headphones, and chose letter and digit options from an on-screen keyboard. The percentage of keywords recognised correctly was taken as the measure of intelligibility.

Six speech conditions were compared: unmodified speech+five modification strategies. In Tang and Cooke (2011) a sixth modification approach was also evaluated, but led to low subjective scores for the SNRs employed, and is not included in the current evaluation. Two techniques equalised SNR in each frame or frequency channel; a third approach transferred energy to time-frequency bins just below the threshold of audibility; another introduced a pause placed to avoid epochs of intense noise, while the final technique combined the latter two approaches. The unmodified and modified utterances were mixed with speech-shaped noise (SSN) and speech-modulated noise (SMN) at two global SNRs of −9 and −6dB, leading to a total of 24 listening conditions (unmodified+5 modifications×2 masker types×2 SNR levels). The SSN noise has the long-term spectrum of the corpus; the SMN noise is generated from the SSN by modulating with the envelope of a randomly concatenated utterance from the same corpus.

The tts dataset, described in Valentini-Botinhao et al. (2011), is based on the responses of 88 listeners to text-to-speech (TTS) utterances presented to listeners in various noise conditions over headphones. After each sentence listeners typed the words they heard in the sentence. The subjective intelligibility in each condition was computed as the percentage of correctly identified words.

TTS samples with a sampling frequency of 20kHz were generated using a HMM-based speech synthesis system (Zen et al., 2009), which was trained with 4000 sentences uttered by a male British English speaker in the ‘rjs’ corpus from the University of Edinburgh. The synthetic voice has a similar quality to that generated by the HTS2005 system in the Blizzard Challenge 2010 (King and Karaiskos, 2010), with a mean opinion score (MOS) of 2.5. Synthetic speech was further processed using four different approaches to simulate the acoustic properties of natural Lombard speech; each process had three parameter settings. These processes and accompanying settings are: spectral peak enhancement (no enhancement and two enhancement levels), fundamental frequency change (one decreasing and two increasing), shifts in the line spectral pairs domain (three different shifts amounts, always towards the high frequency region) and speech rate changes (one faster and two slower). Processed synthetic speech was then added to four maskers at four different SNRs chosen to produce word accuracies of approximately 20, 40, 60, and 80%: speech-shaped noise (SSN: −11.8, −8.8, −6.2 and −3.1dB), cafeteria babble noise (BAB: −9.5, −6.8, −4.6 and −1.9dB), car noise (CAR: −31.9, −28.4, −25.5 and −22.0dB) and high frequency noise (HiFQ: −43.5, −37.6, −32.7 and −26.8dB). Consequently, the tts dataset contains speech material for 192 listening conditions (4 processes×3 parameter settings×4 maskers×4 SNRs).

The third dataset is based on the 2012 and 2013 Hurricane Challenges, the results of which are presented in Cooke et al. (2013b) and Cooke et al. (2013a), respectively. The subjective data was from 314 native British English speakers listening to the Harvard sentences (Rothauser et al., 1969) uttered by a male British English speaker over headphones. Each sentence contains five to six keywords such as ‘the juice of lemons makes fine punch’; as above, listener performance was assessed using the keyword identification rate.

The speech type in this dataset consists of both natural (plain and Lombard) speech, modified speech and synthetic speech, at a sampling frequency of 16kHz. The synthetic speech has a MOS of 3.0 in terms of speech quality (Chen et al., 2014). In all, 30 types of speech were evaluated in two maskers: competing speech (CS) spoken by a female speaker, and SSN, both at three SNR levels chosen to produce recognition scores of about 25, 50 and 75% in each noise masker; specific SNRs are −21, −14, −7dB for CS and −9, −4, 1dB for SSN. The hurricane dataset thus represents 180 listening conditions (30 modifications×2 maskers×3 SNRs). Appendix A provides a brief summary of the 30 modification techniques.

Long term average spectra (LTAS) of the maskers used in the three datasets are shown in Fig. 1
                        . In the three experiments, the subjective intelligibility of each test condition was calculated as the mean word recognition rate across all listeners.

All OIMs were evaluated by inspecting both the Pearson correlation coefficient ρ between mean listener scores and the raw output of the metric, and the standard deviation of the error σ

                         across all modifications and noise maskers for each of the three datasets. Since distortion-based OIMs require a reference signal – normally clean speech – as input to the metric, a choice must be made between using the clean unmodified or clean modified speech as the reference. For modified speech whose duration is altered by modification algorithm, the modified clean speech itself always has to be used as reference because the distortion-based OIMs require the reference signal to have the same duration as the tested signal. Outcomes using clean unmodified and clean modified speech as the reference signal are shown in the table. Since most OIMs make better predictions using modified clean speech as a reference, this is used in subsequent comparisons.

For the natural and tts datasets, most of the chosen models performed significantly less well with modified natural speech and TTS speech than reported in previous studies for unmodified natural speech or noisy speech processed by noise reduction algorithms. The performance of the models varied significantly in the natural case [χ
                        2(6)=64.895, p
                        <0.001]: while GP, CPD, SII and ESII performed similarly [Z
                        =0.731, p
                        =0.465], audibility-based OIMs (i.e., GP, SII and ESII) outperformed those based on distortion (i.e., NCM, CSII and STOI) [Z
                        =6.568, p
                        <0.001], with the exception of CPD. For the tts dataset, the models also performed differently [χ
                        2(6)=57.573, p
                        <0.001]: the quality of predictions made by NCM, ESII, GP and CPD were statistically equivalent [Z
                        =0.778, p
                        =0.437] and superior to those of the remaining OIMs [Z
                        =−9.109, p
                        <0.001]. The performance of the metrics also differed for the hurricane dataset [χ
                        2(6)=76.155, p
                        <0.001]. Here, CSII and CPD were equivalent [Z
                        =1.777, p
                        =0.076] and superior to the other metrics [Z
                        =6.422, p
                        <0.001].

                         present individual data points for each condition in the three datasets, coded by masker type. The CPD metric shows the most uniform performance across the datasets, but even this model lacks predictive power, especially for the tts dataset. For the hurricane dataset, all OIMs apart from CPD fare badly when predicting the intelligibility for both maskers combined: while ESII and GP predict higher-than-actual intelligibility for the competing speech masker, SII, NCM, STOI and to a lesser extent CSII show the converse pattern.


                           Fig. 5
                            shows the breakdown by noise type for the natural dataset, and reveals that the GP metric is most correlated with listeners (ρ
                           >0.90) for both maskers, followed by ESII and CPD. Many of the metrics make reasonable (ρ
                           >0.80) intelligibility predictions for speech in the presence of stationary maskers. Apart from GP, predictions were less good for the modulated masker than for stationary maskers, especially for NCM, CSII and STOI. Except for CPD, distortion-based OIMs produced lower correlations for the modulated maskers [Z
                           =−6.701, p
                           <0.001]. The poor performance of these three OIMs for this dataset may be due to them being unable to deal with the modification which introduced pauses into the speech signal.

Correlations split by masker type in the tts dataset are shown in Fig. 6
                           . As expected, correlations are generally higher for individual maskers than overall, suggesting a high degree of masker-specificity in the ability of metrics to predict intelligibility. Most metrics made reasonable predictions (ρ
                           >0.85) for the high frequency noise masker. For the remaining maskers the pattern of correlation showed significant variation across metrics [for all maskers χ
                           2(6)≥25.062, p
                           <0.001].


                           Table 3
                            provides a more detailed look at correlations for the different processes applied during synthesis, relative to a synthetic speech baseline. The performance of most OIMs decreased as a result of processing. Apart from SII, all OIMs struggled to predict the effect of LSP shift. Other than GP, the performance of all OIMs degraded drastically in the face of linear expansion and contraction of duration.

All metrics produced higher correlations in stationary noise than in the fluctuating competing speaker condition in the hurricane dataset (Fig. 7
                           ). OIMs were further evaluated for three groupings of conditions: natural speech only, synthetic speech only and for conditions that changed speech duration (Tab. 4
                           ). Except for CSII in for synthetic speech [Z
                           =1.009, p
                           =0.313] and modifications resulting in temporal change [Z
                           =0.908, p
                           =0.364], CPD demonstrated more robust predictive power [for remaining conditions Z
                           ≥2.477, p
                           <0.05]. It is perhaps surprising to see that, in general, the subset of synthetic speech is better predicted than the natural speech subset. One possible explanation is that the degree of processing applied in the tts dataset was more extreme than seen in the hurricane dataset. Modifications involving temporal changes also appear less harmful in the hurricane dataset than in tts, particularly for those metrics – ESII, CSII, CPD and STOI – that suffered most. Again, this is likely to be due to the scale of temporal changes involved in the two datasets. In the hurricane dataset, speech duration was expanded by a smaller factor than in the tts data, and in no condition was duration decreased.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Compared to model-listener correlations reported in the literature for unmodified natural speech or speech processed by noise reduction techniques, the current study highlights a clear reduction in the performance of a representative range of OIMs for modified and synthetic speech. One contributing factor for most OIMs is their inability to predicting intelligibility across different maskers, especially for stationary versus highly fluctuating maskers. Additionally, many OIMs were adversely affected by modifications involving temporal changes such as pause insertion and duration alteration. The following sections explore these two issues further.

To be considered robust, an intelligibility metric ought to cope with different masking conditions. In the current study, short-term audibility-based metrics (i.e., GP and ESII) tended to over-predict intelligibility in fluctuating maskers and under-predict in stationary noise, while the converse was the case for SII and the distortion-based metrics. Both GP and ESII use short-term information to quantify the degree to which spectro-temporal regions of the speech dominate those from the masker in terms of energy. An interesting question is whether all such target-dominant regions contribute equally to intelligibility in the face of different maskers. Fluctuating noise provides more opportunities for glimpsing spectro-temporal regions of the target signal due to masker envelope modulations than stationary masker. However, neither GP nor ESII take the effects of non-simultaneous (e.g., forward masking) and informational masking into account, and as a consequence may overestimate intelligibility for fluctuating noise maskers.

Since speech is more tolerant of energetic masking in fluctuating noise than in stationary noise at the same SNR level, it is necessary to present speech in a fluctuating masker at a lower SNR to obtain the same intelligibility level as that of speech presented in a stationary masker with the same long-term spectrum. Given that SII predictions are based on the long-term spectral SNR, SII is sensitive to any change in global SNR, which may explain why SII scores are lower in the CS than in the SSN condition. The same considerations apply to NCM and CSII which inherit the SII framework. Further, NCM, CSII and STOI compute correlation across time only and hence do not account for across-frequency distortion. Based on the findings here, it appears that measuring distortion solely in the time domain exaggerates the negative impact of a fluctuating noise masker on intelligibility.

CPD was the only distortion-based metric which predicted intelligibility across masker types reasonably well. This may be due to the use of cross-correlation in both time and frequency domains, as well as the adoption of a sophisticated auditory representation. To explore these hypotheses further, we isolated the components in the auditory model (Dau et al., 1996) which generates the internal representation used in CPD. Fig. 8
                         presents a performance breakdown using the output of the auditory model with different component combinations.

After gammatone filtering (GT in Fig. 8), the auditory model has two major components: the non-linear adaptation loops which model non-simultaneous masking (Loop), followed by the low-pass filter which extracts their envelope (LPass); the CPD metric finally makes the prediction with 3-level criteria (3L; Eq. (14)) as shown in the top row of Fig. 8. If intelligibility predictions are made using only the output of the gammatone filterbank, the method of computing correlations (Eq. (16)) seems to matter, since cross-correlating time and frequency leads to similar predictions for different maskers (column 1, middle row), whereas correlating across only time in each frequency independently (column 1, lower row) results in under-estimation for CS and over-estimation for SSN as seen in other distortion-based OIMs such as STOI and NCM. The synergy of the non-linear adaptation loops (column 2) and low-pass filter (column 3) is strong; neither of the two components alone is able to achieve a similar performance to that of their combination (column 4). The additional impact of the 3-level criterion (column 4, upper row) is rather small, perhaps because only a limited number of noise conditions were used to demonstrate the effects here in comparison to the evaluation conducted by Christiansen et al. (2010). Nevertheless, the use of 3-level criteria is not harmful.

Few OIMs were capable of predicting the intelligibility of speech processed by temporal modifications in the tts dataset. An assumption is implied in the GP metric (Eq. (7)) that listeners benefit from a slow speech rate, presumably because it allows listeners longer to process the received information, or increases the likelihood of glimpsing, particularly in fluctuating maskers. Applying a single temporal change factor to model this assumption helps improve the predictive accuracy of the GP metric in this study. It is natural to ask whether the performance of other OIMs also be improved by weighting their output by a temporal change factor d (Eq. (21)):

                         are the durations of the modified and original speech signals. Table 5
                         shows correlations before and after applying the durational factor. It is clear that all the OIMs evaluated here do indeed benefit – substantially in most cases – from this simple assumption.

There is some evidence that clear and slow speech is beneficial to speech intelligibility in noise (Picheny et al., 1985; Payton et al., 1994; Uchanski et al., 1996). However, simple linear or non-linear time-scale modifications on the speech signal seem not to be able to improve speech in noise performance compared to non-processed speech (Schmitt, 1983; Nejime and Moore, 1998). It has been argued that this is because simple changes in speaking rate on their own may not be able to provide novel contributions on which to base intelligibility improvements; these may come instead from other acoustic changes in clear speech compared with normal speech (Smiljanić and Bradlow, 2009), such as vowel space expansion (Picheny et al., 1986), increased F0 (Bradlow et al., 2003) and a change in spectral tilt (Krause and Braida, 2004) for example.


                        Valentini-Botinhao et al. (2011) tested the intelligibility of synthetic speech at three speech rates: 0.6, 1.4 and 2.0 (calculated as the ratio presented in Eq. (21)) relative to a normal speech rate of 1.0. A rate=0.6 indicates a faster speech rate, whereas rate=1.4 and rate=2.0 lead to slower speech. As expected, increasing speech rate harmed the intelligibility of synthetic speech. This could be because some harmful acoustic changes (e.g., a decrease in the quality of transitions between syllables) were inevitably induced when the signals were synthesised according to the demands of speech rate. The results presented in Valentini-Botinhao et al. (2011) also suggest that decreasing speech rate may to some extent help listeners understand synthetic speech better in noise. When the speech rate decreased too much, the benefit to speech intelligibility ceased. We are not aware of any studies which suggest the point at which a decrease in speech rate starts to compromise the positive contributions to intelligibility from other factors. One possibility is that a listener's perception is negatively affected by changes in coarticulation and the artefacts that might have been introduced by over-long durations, as well as the unfamiliar speaking style. It is thus not clear whether applying the simple durational correction factor of Eq. (21) will always improve OIM performance.

Several studies have shown a correlation between subjective and objective measures for quality and intelligibility prediction. Early studies concerned quality prediction for speech coders (Barnwell, 1980; Quackenbush et al., 1988; Kubichek et al., 1991). More recently introduced measures and evaluation methods are designed to measure the quality and intelligibility of noise-corrupted speech processed using noise reduction algorithms (Hu and Loizou, 2006, 2008; Ma et al., 2009; Taal et al., 2009; Ma and Loizou, 2011; Gomez et al., 2012) and dereverberation algorithms (Kokkinakis and Loizou, 2011). An issue for the future is to determine how well metrics are able to account for any changes to the quality of both modified and synthetic speech in noise.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the current study state-of-the-art OIMs that provide good predictions of natural speech performed less well for modified and synthetic speech, especially for those modifications introducing temporal changes. While many OIMs produced reasonable estimates for modified speech in the presence of single masker types, across-noise predictions were generally poor. Methods motivated by masked audibility tended to over-estimate intelligibility for fluctuating maskers and under-estimate intelligibility for stationary maskers, while for many metrics that computed the distorting effect of noise on clean speech the reverse pattern was evident. These findings suggest that further development of OIMs is required to enable their use in applications such as the offline development and online deployment of speech modification algorithms.
