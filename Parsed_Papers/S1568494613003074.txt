               Abstract
               
                  In this article, grey based theory is used to grasp the ambiguity exists in the utilized information and the fuzziness appears in the human judgments and preferences. Grey theory can produce satisfactory results, and hence stimulates creativity and the invention for developing new methods and alternative approaches. This article is a very useful source of information for fuzzy grey and decision making using more than one decision makers in fuzzy environment. A case study on system selection comprised of 12 attributes and 7 alternatives is constructed and solved by the proposed method and the results are compared with the results obtained from QSPM, TOPSIS and SAW approaches for analysis purposes.
