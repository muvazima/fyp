                  We propose the application of a phase-field framework for three-dimensional volume reconstruction using slice data. The proposed method is based on the Allen–Cahn and Cahn–Hilliard equations, and the algorithm consists of two steps. First, we perform image segmentation on the given raw data using a modified Allen–Cahn equation. Second, we reconstruct a three-dimensional volume using a modified Cahn–Hilliard equation. In the modified Cahn–Hilliard equation, a fidelity term is introduced to keep the solution close to the slice data. The numerical methods use a hybrid method and an unconditionally stable nonlinear splitting scheme. The resulting discrete equations are solved using a multigrid method. The experiments on synthetic and real medical images are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Developing reconstruction algorithms attracts a significant amount of attention because the three-dimensional (3D) volume reconstruction from a sequence of medical images has numerous applications such as medical diagnostic, plastic and artificial limb surgery, virtual surgery system, anatomy teaching, and treatment planning [2,3]. Various algorithms have been proposed to reconstruct a surface or volume from a set of planar cross-sections. A method which combines the elastic interpolation algorithm, spline theory, and surface consistency theorem was proposed for reconstructing a smooth 3D object from serial cross sections [4]. Guo et al. presented a morphology-based mathematical method to implement the interpolation by means of a combined operation of weighted dilation and erosion [5]. Jones and Chen constructed surfaces from cross sections using a field function in each slice and the marching cubes algorithm to generate a surface consisting of polygonal facets [6]. In shape-based interpolation method, the signed distance value of a voxel to the edges of a cross section is calculated. After each slice has been assigned the distance values, distances for other slices are defined using an interpolation. Then, the volume is obtained by the zero isosurface [7]. For other approaches to 3D reconstruction, refer to [8–11].

In this paper, we present a phase-field framework for 3D volume reconstruction using slice data. The proposed algorithm has two steps: image segmentation and 3D reconstruction using two partial differential equations, which are the modified Allen–Cahn and Cahn–Hilliard equations. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the governing equations for the image segmentation and volume reconstruction. Section 3 describes a practically stabilized nonlinear splitting scheme for the volume reconstruction and presents a multigrid method. In Section 4, we perform numerical experiments with synthetic and real medical images. Finally, our conclusion is given in Section 5.

In this section, we propose a numerical algorithm for 3D volume reconstruction from slice data. We start with an illustration of the process of the proposed algorithm when we have a set of cross-sectional slice data (Fig. 1
                     (a)).

For the first stage, by using a modified Allen–Cahn equation, the image segmentation algorithm is applied for the given slice data f to obtain the phase-field function ψ (segmented image). Fig. 1(b) shows the filled contour plots of segmented slice data ψ. For the second stage, by using a modified Cahn–Hilliard equation and the segmented slice data, we reconstruct the volume (Fig. 1(c)).

Since the original image may have noises (Fig. 2
                        (a) and (b)), to prepare the numerical slice data ψ (Fig. 2(c)) before applying the proposed method for volume reconstruction, we use an image segmentation algorithm [12–18]. The method we use for image segmentation is based on the Allen–Cahn equation and it enforces the diffuse interface to be the hyperbolic tangent profile. The geometric active contour model based on the mean curvature motion is given by the following evolution equation [14]:

                         otherwise (see Fig. 2(d)). In Fig. 2(e) and (f), the initial contour evolves until it reaches the boundary of the image through the motion created by the mean curvature (the first term) and the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (1). The term βg(f
                        0(x))F(ψ(x, t)) evolves the contour beyond the non-convex and disconnected regions.

(4) and (5) become the Cahn–Hilliard equation [20], which has been widely employed as a useful mathematical model in order to understand the phase separation phenomena observed when binary alloys are quenched at critical temperatures. For physical, mathematical, and numerical derivations of the binary Cahn–Hilliard equation, see [21] and the references therein.

Eqs. (4) and (5) have also been used in image inpainting problem, which is the process of filling in missing parts of damaged images based on information from the surrounding areas [19]. The basic mechanism of the inpainting model is illustrated in Fig. 4. The gray region in Fig. 4(a) denotes the inpainting region. Let ψ(x) be the image data from Fig. 4(a).

We use a nearly identical governing equation to those used for image inpainting, which is two-dimensional. However, we use the equation in a different context, meaning we reconstruct a 3D volume from a set of slice data. Our approach involves the salient application of the partial differential equation used in image inpainting.

Because this is an example in 2D, we assume that the given slice data has the hyperbolic tangent profile. However, in the 3D case, we need an image segmentation algorithm as a preprocess before the volume reconstruction. We guess the initial state using the liner interpolation (see Fig. 5(c)), and the filled contour at level zero is shown in Fig. 5(d). Fig. 5(e) displays the reconstructed image obtained by our proposed method.

In this section, we show several numerical results of image segmentation step on real medical images of a bone in Fig. 9. From left to right columns, they are given medical images with contours obtained by the image segmentation, mesh plots of the given images, and mesh plots of the final results. As can be seen, even though the original images are with noises, the image segmentation step produces visually clear results. We will use the image segmentation afterward, unless otherwise mentioned.

We reconstruct the 3D volume using the three set of more complicated synthetic slice data, consisting a spiral, two linked tori, and three branching. In this section, we use

Third, we employ a similar test to that used in [4], where a more complex case of branching from one to three contours was tested using synthetic contours. Twelve slice data are used (Fig. 12(a)) and there are two slices between any two consecutive slice data sets. This simulation is performed on the domain

In this section, we simulate several volume reconstructions by using real slice data. Fig. 13 shows the reconstructed volumes such as a human head, brain, and terra-cotta bunny, whose slice data are obtained from [26]. Each column in Fig. 13 shows the result of the volume reconstruction using different interslice dimensions. The detail information of the data we used is displayed in Table 2. This simulation is performed on the domain

                         mesh grid. We can see that our proposed method successfully manages this complex topology and the reconstructed surface is very smooth. Furthermore, our method is working well with small set of slice data. And, Table 2 shows that the iteration number for convergence slightly increase when the number of slice data decrease.

Next, we consider a human vertebra with a twenty-six slice data from [27] (Fig. 14(a)). There are two slices between any two given successive slice data sets, except for the first and last sets, between which we use only one slice.

Our last test examines the volume reconstruction from medical images of a human bone (tibia and fibula). We have a set of bone slice images with an image size of

                         (Fig. 15(a)). The number of slices is 128 and there are seven slices between any two consecutive slices. Note that, because our method can reconstruct the volume with fewer slice data, we remove some similar slices (the empty boxes in Fig. 15(a)) and use 63 slices. We perform the resolution on the domain

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We presented a fast, robust, and accurate numerical method for creating a mathematical model that produces 3D volume reconstruction using slice data. The governing equations are based on the Allen–Cahn and Cahn–Hilliard equations with a fidelity term. This term keeps the solutions close to the given slice data. The proposed algorithm has two steps: image segmentation for the raw given slice data and 3D volume reconstruction using the segmented images. We applied a hybrid method and an unconditionally stable nonlinear splitting scheme, and then we solved the resulting system of discrete equations using a multigrid method. We demonstrated the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the method on both synthetic and real medical images, such as a spiral, two linked tori, three branching, head, brain, bunny, vertebra, tibia, and fibula. The reconstructed volumes had smooth surfaces, fitting the given original slice data. As a future work, it would be of interest to investigate automatic criterions about how many interslices are needed and what is an optimal tolerance for the iterations.
