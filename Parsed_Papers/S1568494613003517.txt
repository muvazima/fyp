               Abstract
               
                  We demonstrate the use of Ant Colony System (ACS) to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem associated with collection of recycling waste from households, treated as nodes in a spatial network. For networks where the nodes are concentrated in separate clusters, the use of k-means clustering can greatly improve the efficiency of the solution. The ACS algorithm is extended to model the use of multi-compartment vehicles with kerbside sorting of waste into separate compartments for glass, paper, etc. The algorithm produces high-quality solutions for two-compartment test problems.
