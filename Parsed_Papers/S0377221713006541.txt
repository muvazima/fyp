                  This paper defines and analyzes a generalization of the classical minimum vertex cover problem to the case of two-layer interdependent networks with cascading node failures that can be caused by two common types of interdependence. Previous studies on interdependent networks mainly addressed the issues of cascading failures from a numerical simulations perspective, whereas this paper proposes an exact optimization-based approach for identifying a minimum-cardinality set of nodes, whose deletion would effectively disable both network layers through cascading failure mechanisms. We analyze the computational complexity and linear 0–1 formulations of the defined problems, as well as prove an LP approximation ratio result that generalizes the well-known 2-approximation for the classical minimum vertex cover problem. In addition, we introduce the concept of a “depth of cascade” (i.e., the maximum possible length of a sequence of cascading failures for a given interdependent network) and show that for any problem instance this parameter can be explicitly derived via a polynomial-time procedure.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Modern infrastructures consist of heterogeneous networked systems, such as electricity, telecommunication, and transportation; moreover, these systems interact with each other (i.e., interdependent systems). The functionality of the whole interdependent system is ensured only if each of the underlying network layers is operational. A common example of such a situation is the operation of a network that depends on electricity as an essential source of power provided to its nodes (i.e., telecommunication or computing devices), whereas nodes in an underlying electricity network may in turn be controlled by nodes in a computer/communication (i.e., SCADA) network.

In general, the patterns of interdependence between infrastructure systems can be rather complex, with different types of commodities or information being sent via interdependent links. Virtually all modern infrastructures depend on each other in a variety of ways; therefore, it is important to study the interactions within this heterogeneous large-scale infrastructure system. Rigorous quantitative analysis of this entire complex system is challenging; however, recent studies have started to analyze its subsystems containing two interconnected (coupled) networks, such as electric power and telecommunication networks.

Clearly, electric power is an essential component of modern infrastructures. The overwhelming dependence on electricity presents the challenge of determining strategies for reliable and secure energy supply. With infrastructures operating near their physical limits, the reliability of the systems may decrease. The recent power outage caused by a short-circuit in North Gila, Arizona affected millions of people in California, Arizona, and Mexico on September 8th, 2011. The transportation infrastructure was dramatically affected in urban areas due to the lack of power. Energy systems appear to be very vulnerable due to mutual dependencies with other infrastructures. One of the recent examples of cascading failures in interdependent infrastructures occurred in Italy on September 28th, 2003, where a shutdown of a power station led to failures of communication (SCADA) network nodes, which were used for controlling the electricity network, which in turn led to further failures in the power network, thus creating a sequence of catastrophic cascading failures (Buldyrev, Parshani, Paul, Stanley, & Havlin, 2010). A similar illustrative example of such coupled interdependent networks is given in Fig. 1
                     . The power grid network is depicted using the well-known IEEE 118-bus test case, which represents a portion of the U.S. power grid in the Midwestern states in 1960s. For illustrative purposes, the SCADA network was randomly generated assuming the power-law degree distribution and placed separately in the picture. Interdependent links connect the nodes between the networks (only a few of such links are shown for illustrative purposes). Note that in general, multiple interdependent links may be outgoing from or incoming to a node, thus creating the possibility of “one-to-many” and “many-to-one” relationships between nodes in different networks, which generalizes the “one-to-one” relationships in the model of Buldyrev et al. (2010). The corresponding types of interdependencies, which may cause cascading failures, will be formalized in subsequent sections, and computational experiments on this illustrative example in the context of the defined problems will be presented.

Although quantitative analysis of network robustness can be addressed from a variety of perspectives, an intuitive and classical measure of robustness is the minimum number of nodes (absolute, or relative to the size of the whole network) that need to be disabled in order to disrupt the functionality of the entire network. Obviously, if this number is small compared to the overall number of nodes in a network, then one can conclude that a network is vulnerable to attacks, whereas if this number is comparable with the size of the whole network, then such a network is more robust with respect to random or targeted disruptions. From an optimization perspective, if an adversary possesses complete information about the topology of a given network, he can solve an optimization problem of identifying a minimum-cardinality set of nodes that need to be disabled in order to limit the operational capabilities of the residual network. For instance, if the requirement is to limit the size of the remaining connected components by a pre-defined threshold L, such a problem is referred to as the cardinality-constrained critical node detection problem (Arulselvan, Commander, Shylo, & Pardalos, 2011; Veremyev, Boginski, & Pasiliao, 2013). In the special case of L
                     =1, this problem is reduced to the classical minimum vertex cover problem, which identifies a minimum-cardinality set of nodes that “touches” every edge in a network, thus resulting in a residual network with no edges after all nodes in the minimum vertex cover are disabled.

In this paper, we define and analyze the generalization of the minimum vertex cover problem to the case of two-layer interdependent networks, taking into account the possibility of cascading failures that may be caused by two common types of interdependence. To our knowledge, this is the first study that extends this classical optimization problem to the interdependent network framework. Identifying the minimum-cardinality set of nodes whose deletion would effectively destroy the network is useful from both attack and defense perspectives. In the former setup, the attacker identifies an optimal set of nodes that need to be disabled, whereas in the latter setup, the defender has an opportunity to protect an identified set of nodes and potentially interfere with the propagation of cascading failures.

There has been substantial body of recent work on analyzing robustness of interdependent networks, including general concepts and challenges (Rinaldi, Peerenboom, & Kelly, 2001; Amin, 2002; Little, 2002; Rinaldi, 2004), performance of interdependent networks under vertex or edge removals and related risk assessment issues (Dueñas-Osorio, Craig, & Goodno, 2004, 2007a, 2007b; Newman et al., 2005; Ouyang, Hong, Mao, Yu, & Qi, 2009; Reed, Kapur, & Christie, 2009), as well as analytical and simulation approaches to studying cascading failures in interdependent networks (Simonsen, Buzna, Peters, Bornholdt, & Helbing, 2008; Luiijf, Nieuwenhuijs, Klaver, van Eeten, & Cruz, 2009; Buldyrev, Shere, & Cwilich, 2011; Gao, Buldyrev, Havlin, & Stanley, 2011; Barrett et al., 2010; Parshani, Rozenblat, Ietri, Ducruet, & Havlin, 2010; Shao, Buldyrev, Havlin, & Stanley, 2011). However, most of the previous quantitative studies of interdependent networks primarily focus on simulation and lack an exact optimization-based approach. This article attempts to explore this research direction.


                     Organization. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes basic definitions used in this study. Section 3 proposes mathematical programming formulations and proves related analytical results for the considered problems. Section 4 proves NP-completeness of the decision versions of all the considered problems. Section 5 presents the results of computational experiments. Section 6 concludes the discussion and identifies potential directions of future work.

We model a coupled interconnected infrastructure as a two-layer interdependent network with graphs G
                     1
                     =(V
                     1,
                     E
                     1), G
                     2
                     =(V
                     2,
                     E
                     2) being its layers with sets of nodes V
                     1
                     ={1,…,
                     n
                     1}, V
                     2
                     ={1,…,
                     n
                     2} (n
                     1
                     +
                     n
                     2
                     =
                     n), and edges E
                     1, E
                     2. We assume that some nodes in one layer depend on nodes in the other layer, and denote by E
                     12, E
                     21 the sets of interdependent links, meaning that if (i,
                     j)∈
                     E
                     12, then node j
                     ∈
                     V
                     2 depends on node i
                     ∈
                     V
                     1. For example, in the network depicted in Fig. 2
                     : E
                     12
                     ={(2,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,3)} and E
                     21
                     ={(4,4),(3,2)}. For simplicity, we denote the entire coupled interdependent network as G
                     (2)
                     =((V
                     1,
                     E
                     1),(V
                     2,
                     E
                     2),
                     E
                     12,
                     E
                     21). We assume that the set of initially failed/attacked nodes causes subsequent failures of other nodes stage-by-stage due to interdependence (sets E
                     12,
                     E
                     21), similar to the assumptions of Buldyrev et al. (2011). The motivation for this assumption is the fact that in many cases cascading failures do not spread instantaneously, but rather with some delay between cascade stages (Bienstock, 2011). We assume that the number of cascading stages is bounded by a fixed pre-specifined parameter S.

In this paper we consider two common types of interdependence: Type 1 (“one-to-many”) and Type 2 (“many-to-one”).
                        Definition 1
                        An interdependent network has Type 1 failure causality if the failure of one node causes the failure of all of its dependent nodes.

An interdependent network has Type 2 failure causality if the failure of one node is caused only by the failures of all nodes it depends on.

For any given interdependent network G
                     (2), type of interdependence and the number of cascading stages S, the stages of cascade and the vertex cover are defined as follows.
                        Definition 3
                        Cascade Stage


                        Let the initial set of failed/attacked nodes belong to stage 0. Then for any s
                           ∈{1,…,
                           S}, stage s contains nodes that either belong to stage (s
                           −
                           1), or have been failed due to the dependence on nodes in stage (s
                           −
                           1).

A vertex cover of G
                           (2) is a set of nodes in V
                           1
                           ∪
                           V
                           2 whose failure causes the failure of vertex cover sets in graphs G
                           1 and G
                           2 at stage S through the corresponding cascading failure mechanisms.

For the given interdependent network G
                     (2), type of interdependence and the number of cascading stages S the minimum vertex cover problem asks for the minimum cardinality vertex cover in G
                     (2).


                     Fig. 3
                      illustrates stage-by-stage node failures caused by disabling two nodes at stage 0 (hatched, Fig. 3(b)), assuming Type 1 interdependence and S
                     =2. At stage 2, every edge in both layers is “touched” by failed nodes, thus the initially failed nodes represent a vertex cover of this interdependent network (Fig. 3(a)). Fig. 4
                      illustrates the same situation assuming Type 2 interdependence. Due to a different nature of interdependence, the number of nodes in the vertex cover is three, which means that more nodes need to be disabled at stage 0 in order to achieve the same result by stage 2.

Note that if both sets E
                     12, E
                     21 are empty, then no failure propagation occurs, and the considered problem becomes the classical minimum vertex cover problem on a simple undirected graph G
                     1
                     ∪
                     G
                     2.

Constraints (2) ensure that the nodes failed by stage S form a vertex cover in the entire two-layer network. Constraints (3) and (4) recursively model stage-by-stage node failures (in both layers) caused by the failures of nodes belonging to stage 0. Constraints (5) and (6) reflect the condition that the nodes that have not yet been affected by cascading failures by stage s remain operational at stage s.

The formulation (1)–(7) contains (S
                           +1)n binary variables and ∣E
                           1∣+∣E
                           2∣+2Sn constraints. The next section describes a slightly more compact formulation for the same problem utilizing the nature of Type 1 interdependence, which contains n binary variables and ∣E
                           1∣+∣E
                           2∣ constraints (i.e., the number of entities does not depend on S).

Moreover, for the tighter LP relaxation, constraint (3) can have

It is a well-known fact that an LP relaxation of the minimum vertex cover problem provides a 2-approximation algorithm (Vazirani, 2001). In this section we analyze an approximation algorithm for the minimum vertex cover problem in interdependent networks based on the LP relaxation of formulation (9)–(11).

Note that if there are no interdependent links between the layers (E

                           =∅), then Δ=2, and the problem (9)–(11) reduces to the standard minimum vertex cover problem. Therefore, Proposition 1 contains the classical 2-approximation result for the standard minimum vertex cover problem as a special case.

As mentioned above, the total number of stages in a cascading failure process cannot exceed S
                           =
                           n
                           −1 (“the longest possible cascade”), since at every stage the cascade either stops or causes at least one more node failure. Therefore, if one wants to solve the considered problem with “unconstrained” number of failure stages, then S
                           =
                           n
                           −1 should be used in the aforementioned problem formulations (F1, F1c). However, for computational reasons, it might not be efficient to use the largest possible S, since it may require a lot of unnecessary calculations and usage of redundant variables. We show how to find such a number of failure stages S
                           ∗
                           ⩽
                           n
                           −1, that the problem formulations F1(S) and F1c (S) have the same optimal solution for all S
                           ⩾
                           S
                           ∗. In the notations F1(S) and F1c (S), we use the argument S to refer to the problem formulations F1, F1c with a specified parameter S.

                                 (2).

The next proposition shows that in the case of Type 1 interdependence, the depth of cascade can be identified explicitly for any given problem instance.

The proof is straightforward and follows from the definition of S
                                 ∗.□

As demonstrated by the computational experiments presented further in the paper, the depth of cascade S
                           ∗ is typically much smaller than n
                           −1, which significantly reduces the size of the problem and the corresponding CPU time.

Similarly to Type 1 interdependence, one can consider the concept of failure stages s
                        =0,…,
                        S introduced in Section 2 in the context of Type 2 interdependence. The corresponding linear 0–1 problem formulation is obtained using the same notations as in formulation (1)–(7) by changing the constraints on stage-by-stage node failures to incorporate this type of interdependence.

Note that the theoretical results proven for the problem with Type 1 interdependence do not necessarily extend automatically for Type 2 interdependence due to the substantially different structure of failure mechanisms, which makes it challenging to address from analytical and computational perspectives.

In addition to the two aforementioned baseline models, where the same type of interdependence (e.g., Type 1 or Type 2) is characteristic for both network layers (and every individual node in these layers), it is easy to extend the minimum vertex cover problem to a more general case, where network layers are characterized by different types of interdependence, for instance, Type 1 interdependence for layer G

                        2 on layer G
                        1. In this case, the linear 0–1 programming formulation is obtained straightforwardly from formulation F2 by substituting constraints (22) and (24), which correspond to the failure of nodes in layer G

                        E

The classical Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem, which is NP-hard (Garey & Johnson, 1979), is a special case of the Minimum Vertex Cover problem in Interdependent Networks (MVCIN) for S
                     =0. However, it does not necessarily imply that the MVCIN problem is NP-hard for any fixed S and S

                     ∗. Following the standard approach (Garey & Johnson, 1979), we define the recognition version of the problem, Vertex Cover in Interdependent Networks (VCIN), as follows: given fixed positive integers k, S, S

                           ={1,…,
                           n}) we will construct a two-layer interdependent network G

                                                .
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           The depth of cascade of this interdependent network is, obviously, S
                           ∗, and the network construction can be done in a polynomial time. Fig. 5
                            illustrates how the interdependent network G
                           (2) is constructed from G
                           =(V,
                           E) for S
                           =5, S
                           ∗
                           =7. Observe that the failure of node j
                           1 in G
                           1 will consequently cause the failure of nodes j
                           
                              i
                            in all graphs G
                           
                              i
                            for i
                           =2,…,
                           S
                           +1.

Assume that V′⊂
                           V is a vertex cover of graph G, such that ∣V′∣=
                           k. Let V
                           (2)
                           ={i
                           1
                           ∈
                           V
                           1:∀i
                           ∈
                           V′}, then, obviously, V
                           (2) is a vertex cover of the interdependent network G
                           (2). Conversely, assume that V
                           (2) is a vertex cover of size k in the interdependent network G
                           (2). Using the observation above, we can conclude that having a node j
                           
                              i
                           
                           ∈
                           V
                           (2) (i
                           >1) does not do better than having a node j
                           1
                           ∈
                           V
                           (2). Indeed, the failure of node j
                           1 will cause the failure of all the nodes that fail due to the failure of node j
                           
                              i
                            for any fixed i
                           >1. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that all the nodes in V
                           (2) belong to the first copy of graph G (G
                           1). Obviously, the set of nodes V
                           (2) in the original graph G is its vertex cover of size k.□


                           The VCIN problem with Type 2 interdependence is NP-complete for any fixed S,S
                           ∗
                           .
                        

Using the proof of Proposition 3, observe that in the constructed interdependent network G
                           (2) Type 2 interdependence produces the same failure mechanism, since every node in G
                           (2) depends on no more than one other node. Therefore, the same logic can be used to prove the NP-completeness of VCIN problem with Type 2 interdependence.□

The NP-completeness results are straightforwardly generalized to the VCIN problem with “mixed” types of interdependence.

A series of computational experiments was performed to study the effectiveness and scalability of the developed linear 0–1 formulations, their LP relaxations, and the corresponding LP approximation (where applicable). Moreover, the computational experiments helped to numerically investigate the relationship between the size of a minimum vertex cover and various structural characteristics of an underlying interdependent network such as topologies of individual layers, type of interdependence, number of interdependent links and cascading stages S. This relationship can provide better understanding of how the presence of interdependence affects the vulnerability of networks with different topologies, since the size of a minimum vertex cover can be viewed as a measure of network robustness. The depth of cascade in networks with various numbers of interdependent links was also considered.

The computational experiments were performed on a Dell machine equipped with Windows 7×64 operating system and an Intel Core i7 940XM processor (CPU 2.13GHz, L2 8MB), RAM 8GB. All problem instances were solved to optimality using FICO Xpress-IVE solver (Xpress, 2012). The corresponding CPU times are presented in seconds. Consistently with other related studies, we considered problem instances on random graphs with two well-known degree distributions: power-law and uniform. A uniform random graph G(n,
                        p) has n nodes, where each pair of nodes is connected by an edge randomly and independently with a fixed probability p, whereas in a power-law graph the probability that a node has degree k is proportional to k
                        −β
                        . We used these two types of degree distributions to generate network layers G
                        1
                        =(V
                        1,
                        E
                        1) and G
                        2
                        =(V
                        2,
                        E
                        2). The interdependent links E
                        12 and E
                        21 were generated assuming that each node in one layer is dependent on each node in another layer randomly with a fixed probability q.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no real-world interdependent network data available in public domain; therefore, the majority of the computational experiments below are based on randomly generated instances. However, in order to give an intuitive interpretation of the proposed models in realistic settings, we also performed computational experiments on the two-layer network illustrated in Fig. 1, which consists of the well-known IEEE 118-bus power grid network (constructed using publicly available data) and a randomly generated SCADA network (with the assumed power-law distribution, which is common for communication networks).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The first set of experiments (reported in Tables 1–4
                           
                           
                           
                           ) is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed linear 0–1 formulations (LP relaxation and LP approximation) for Type 1 (Tables 1–3) and Type 2 (Table 4) interdependencies between network layers of the same size with uniform and power-law degree distributions. For Type 1 interdependence, 10 different pairs network layers of size ∣V
                           1∣=∣V
                           2∣=100 (u1_,…,u5_ with uniform and p1_,…,p5_ with power-law degree distributions) are generated with approximate edge densities 10%; and 20 different pairs of sets E
                           12, E
                           21 are generated with various edge densities q (q
                           =0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4), 5 pairs for each value q. Totally, there are 40 instances of interdependent networks uij and pij (i
                           =1,…,5;j
                           =1,…,4), where networks uij and pij with the same ij have the same sets E
                           12,E
                           21. The testbed for Type 2 interdependence (Table 4) was generated using the same procedure; however, the size of the layers was smaller: ∣V
                           1∣=∣V
                           2∣=50 due to the fact that solving the problem turned out to be more computationally challenging than for Type 1 interdependence.

The results presented in Tables 1–3 suggest the following observations:
                              
                                 •
                                 For each listed problem instance, the CPU time significantly decreases as more cascade stages (S) are considered.

The CPU time is generally faster for network instances with layers following a power-law degree distribution.

In most instances (both uniform and power-law) LP relaxations give rather tight lower bounds on optimal IP objective values. The bounds become tighter (sometimes coincide with an optimal IP objective) as S increases.

The LP approximation algorithm generally provides feasible solutions relatively close to optimal, with the exception of cases where the IP optimal objective is very small.

The observations for problems with Type 2 interdependence based on Table 4 are as follows:
                              
                                 •
                                 The increase in the number of interdependent links does not necessarily decrease the optimal objective value. This is intuitively understandable from the definition of Type 2 interdependence. This effect will be further illustrated in Fig. 8.

The CPU time drastically increases as the number of cascade stages S and the number of interdependent links grow larger.


                           Table 5
                            presents optimal objective values, CPU time, LP relaxation solutions and LP approximation algorithm output values obtained by solving F1c on networks with size n
                           =1000. The table contains eight instances of two-layer interdependent networks with the layers generated using uniform and power-law degree distributions (four instances of each). The power-law and uniform random graph instances are generated to have approximately the same edge density, i.e., for n
                           =1000, and p
                           =0.01, the corresponding power-law parameter β is approximately equal to 1.4. Observe that the CPU time is reasonably fast for networks of this size. Moreover, if S and q are large, then the LP approximation algorithm provides a solution relatively close to optimal even though Δ (max (Δ1,Δ2)) is large.


                           Fig. 6
                            shows the depth of cascade S
                           ∗ (relative to the network size) that was observed in two-layer networks with Type 1 interdependence with 200, 400, 600, and 1000 nodes (n
                           1
                           =
                           n
                           2). The horizontal axis shows the number of interdependent links between the networks divided by the total number of nodes. We denote by ∣E
                           
                              dep
                           ∣ the total number of interdependent links between two networks, that is, ∣E
                           
                              dep
                           ∣=∣E
                           12∣+∣E
                           21∣. The initial number of interdependent links is zero. Then, we add the interdependent links randomly (each link has the same probability to appear) and compute S
                           ∗ at each step. Interestingly, the depth of cascade S
                           ∗ is small at the beginning, but it increases with the number of interdependent links and reaches the maximum with ∣E
                           
                              dep
                           ∣/n between 1 and 2. Further increase in the number of interdependent links leads to the decrease of the relative depth of cascade. Intuitively, the initial increase of S
                           ∗ can be explained by the fact that adding more interdependent links creates longer cascading chains. However, once all the nodes in the network become connected through interdependent links, any further increase in the number of interdependent links would just shorten the paths between them; hence, decreasing S
                           ∗.

As in the previous subsection, for all computational experiments below, we start with two network layers having no interdependent links, and then randomly and uniformly add interdependent links one by one.


                           Fig. 7
                            shows the minimum vertex cover size for the networks with different edge densities and the number of cascade stages S considered for Type 1 interdependence. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the minimum vertex cover sizes for uniform random graphs with edge densities 0.1 and 0.2. Fig. 7(c) and (d) show the same information for power-law graphs with edge densities 0.1 and 0.2. For all of the cases depicted in Fig. 7, the minimum vertex cover size decreases with the increase in the number of interdependent links. This observation is intuitively clear, since adding more interdependent links would decrease the robustness of the network, as it would be sufficient to attack few nodes at stage 0 in order to cause complete network dysfunction by stage S. Note that uniform random graphs exhibit slightly larger sizes of minimum vertex cover, which implies slightly better robustness characteristics in the considered context.


                           Fig. 8
                            shows the minimum vertex cover size for two uniform graphs and two power-law graphs with edge densities 0.3 and 0.5 for Type 2 interdependence (n
                           =50,n
                           1
                           =
                           n
                           2
                           =25). Interestingly, with ∣E
                           
                              dep
                           ∣/n increasing, the minimum vertex cover size decreases at the beginning, reaches its minimum for ∣E
                           
                              dep
                           ∣/n somewhere between 1 and 2, and then increases again. This observation suggests that, contrary to Type 1 interdependence, it may be beneficial to add more interdependent links (after a certain threshold) in order to increase robustness of networks with Type 2 interdependence.


                           Fig. 9
                            illustrates the behavior of the minimum vertex cover size in interdependent networks with substantially different sizes of layers as the number of interdependent links increases. For this experiment, the second layer is randomly generated to have power-law degree distribution with an approximate edge density 0.005 and n
                           2
                           =1000. The first layer is also generated to have power-law degree distribution with n
                           1
                           =10 (Fig. 9(a)) and n
                           1
                           =100 (Fig. 9(b)) nodes. The patterns are rather similar to those obtained for same-size layers. However, for n
                           1
                           =10, the number of considered cascading stages seems to have less influence on the minimum vertex cover size.


                           Fig. 10
                            shows the size and composition of the minimum vertex cover for the coupled interdependent network shown in Fig. 1. Layer 1 represents the IEEE 118-bus network, a part of the American Electric Power System (in the Midwestern US) as of December 1962, with 118 nodes and 179 edges. Layer 2 represents a SCADA network that controls the power grid nodes. Since there is no publicly available data on this SCADA network, it was randomly generated as a power-law graph with approximately the same number of nodes and edges (118 nodes and 196 edges). The interdependent links (E

Fig. 10(a), (c), and (e) correspond to a practically realistic case with “mixed” interdependence (Type 1 from SCADA to power grid, and Type 2 from power grid to SCADA), whereas Fig. 10(b), (d), and (f) correspond to pure Type 1 interdependence for both layers. For “mixed” interdependence, as the number of interdependent links increases, the percentage of SCADA nodes in the minimum vertex cover becomes larger than the percentage of power grid nodes. It implies that if one wants to optimally attack a minimal set of nodes in order to make this interdependent network (and the power grid) dysfunctional, it is generally more effective to attack SCADA control nodes, rather than the power grid itself. However, this observation should be viewed in light of the fact that these experiments are done on a partly synthetic network.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have introduced an optimization-based framework for modeling cascading failures in interdependent networks, as well as the impact of two common types of interdependence on network robustness characteristics. As a quantitative measure of network robustness, the optimal solution of the minimum vertex cover problem was utilized; however, the setup of this classical optimization problem in interdependent networks needed to be extended due to the difference in the nature of such networks compared to standard “single-layer” networks. Our results show that this extended modeling approach can incorporate different types of interdependence that are common in practice; moreover, certain properties of the classical vertex cover problem (i.e., the computational complexity and the LP approximation ratio) can be generalized for the setup with interdependent networks. The presented computational results show that the proposed formulations can be used to find exact optimal solutions in interdependent networks with up to 1,000 nodes.

Possible extensions of the proposed approach include the following directions. First, the introduced formulations may allow one to incorporate and optimize other measures of network robustness (besides the size of the minimum vertex cover) by utilizing a different objective function and possibly an extra set of constraints in addition to the ones modeling two types of interdependence. Second, this framework may be extended to interdependent networks with more than two layers. Third, the proposed formulations can be generalized by incorporating edge and/or node weights. These weights can represent, for instance, capacity parameters, costs of disabling and/or protecting a node, as well as probabilities of node failures due to dependencies on other nodes (i.e., failures occurring probabilistically rather than deterministically). In the latter setup, quantitative measures of risks associated with cascading failures may be incorporated in the corresponding optimization models.
