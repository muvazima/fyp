                  Existing research on acceptability of pairwise interval comparison matrices focuses on acceptable consistency by controlling their inconsistency levels to within a certain threshold. However, a perfectly consistent but highly indeterminate interval comparison matrix can be unacceptable as it contains little (sometimes no) useful decision information. This paper first analyzes the current definition of acceptable consistency for interval multiplicative comparison matrices (IMCMs) and shows its technical deficiencies. We then introduce a new notion of acceptable IMCMs, considering both inconsistency and indeterminacy levels in IMCMs. A geometric-mean-based index is proposed to measure the indeterminacy ratio of an IMCM, and useful properties are derived for consistent IMCMs and acceptable IMCMs. An indeterminacy-ratio and geometric-mean-based transformation equation is subsequently put forward to convert normalized acceptable interval multiplicative weights into an acceptable IMCM with consistency. By introducing an auxiliary constraint, a logarithmic least square model is established to generate interval multiplicative weights from acceptable IMCMs. A geometric-mean-based possibility degree formula is designed to compare and rank normalized interval multiplicative weights. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate how to utilize the proposed framework.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In a classical Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a decision-maker (DM) carries out pair-wise comparison to elicit his/her preference over decision alternatives. The resulting crisp preference ratios are represented as a multiplicative comparison matrix (Saaty, 1980). Since real-life decision problems are often complex and indeterminate, it is often challenging for the DM to assign exact ratios in pair-wise comparison (Ahn & Park, 2014; Dubois, 2011; Scholten, Schuwirth, Reichert, & Lienert, 2015; Zhu & Xu, 2014). As such, different types of comparison matrices have been put forward to model DMs’ pair-wise comparison with imprecision and indeterminacy, such as interval multiplicative comparison matrices (IMCMs) (Saaty & Vargas, 1987) and interval additive comparison matrices (Wang & Li 2015; Xu & Chen, 2008). Modeling indeterminacy in multi-criteria decision analysis has received increasing research attention in the past decades (Borgonovo & Marinacci, 2015; Dede, Kamalakis, & Sphicopoulo, 2015; Durbach, Lahdelma, & Salminen, 2014; Merigó, Casanovas, & Yang, 2014; Rezaei & Ortt, 2013; Song, Ming, & Xu, 2013; Yan & Ma, 2015).

Consistency of comparison matrices directly affects final ranking of decision alternatives. Consistency refers to certain transitivity property in the DM's pair-wise comparison to ensure that the DM's judgment is consistent in some sense. Different transitivity properties have been put forward to characterize consistency (Brunelli, Canal, & Fedrizzi, 2013), and these properties are expected to be invariant with respect to alternative re-labelling. This invariance in measuring inconsistency of a pair-wise comparison matrix is identified as an axiomatic property by Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2014). Since the DM's comparisons are subjective and an alternative is compared with others in diverse contexts, the resulting comparison matrix often contains inconsistent elements. It is natural that a comparison matrix with low consistency stands for poor decision input and will inevitably result in a misleading decision result (Brunelli & Fedrizzi, 2015; Dong, Xu, Li, & Dai, 2008; Siraj, Mikhailov, & Keane, 2012a, 2012b). To measure the inconsistency level of a crisp multiplicative comparison matrix, Saaty (1980) proposed a consistency index (CI) and a consistency ratio (CR). A geometric consistency index and the corresponding thresholds were also developed by Aguaron and Moreno-Jimenez (2003). Dong, Zhang, Hong, and Xu (2010) put forward a group consensus model based on a row geometric mean prioritization method. Recent research conceives to treat inconsistency of a multiplicative comparison matrix as some kind of indeterminacy by constructing an IMCM (Entani & Tanaka, 2007; Guo & Tanaka, 2010; Sugihara, Ishii, & Tanaka, 2004; Wang, 2015b), and the indeterminacy level is then measured by interval probabilities or weights using the ideas of entropy, interval width and ignorance (Entani & Sugihara, 2012).

Current research on consistency of IMCMs can be roughly categorized into two groups. The first group adopts a feasible region idea and asserts consistency of an IMCM if there exists a consistent crisp comparison matrix within the original interval judgment (Wang & Elhag, 2007; Wang, Yang, & Xu, 2005a). The other category defines consistency based on some mathematical constraints (Liu, 2009; Wang, 2015a; Wu, Li, Li, & Duan, 2009; Xu, 2010). For instance, Wang et al. (2005a) employed convex feasible regions to define consistent IMCMs. Wang, Yang, and Xu (2005b) proposed a method to test consistency of an IMCM. Liu (2009) introduced consistency and acceptable consistency of IMCMs based on two converted crisp multiplicative comparison matrices. Liu's (2009) consistency model was reformulated as an equivalent mathematical constraint in Xu (2010).

A host of interval weight derivation methods have been developed for IMCMs. Based on the feasible region of normalized crisp multiplicative weights, Wang et al. (2005a) developed a two-stage logarithmic goal program to derive interval multiplicative weights from IMCMs. Similarly, Wang and Elhag (2007) established a goal program to obtain interval additive weights from both consistent and inconsistent IMCMs. Liu (2009) put forward a method to deduce interval multiplicative weights from acceptable IMCMs. Guo and Wang (2012) developed two linear programs to elicit interval probabilities from an IMCM, in which the interval pair-wise comparisons are approximated by the ratios of the obtained interval probabilities from exterior and interior directions.

The aforementioned research reveals that consistency and acceptability constraints are always used in deriving priority weights from comparison matrices. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that these constraints are reasonable and logical. The consistency definition in Wang et al. (2005a) and Wang and Elhag (2007) is built upon the concept of convex feasible regions without considering transitivity among three or more comparisons in an IMCM. This implies that this consistency constraint tends to be loose and highly indeterminate comparisons are often judged to be consistent. While the acceptable consistency definition by Liu (2009) utilizes the original comparison data in an IMCM, a further analysis in Section 3 demonstrates that it is inherently flawed due to its sensitivity to alternative re-labeling.

To overcome abovementioned deficiencies, we adapt the consistency definition for IMCMs in Wang (2015a) by using an interval-arithmetic-based transitivity equation. By examining properties of consistent IMCMs and introducing an acceptable indeterminacy ratio threshold, we define acceptable IMCMs and derive their basic properties. The key innovation of this acceptable IMCM notion is to consider both inconsistency and uncertainty levels in interval judgments: a highly indeterminate IMCM with little or no useful decision information is deemed unacceptable even if it is consistent or its inconsistency level is low. An indeterminacy index is defined to measure the indeterminacy ratio of an IMCM, and a geometric-mean-based formula is provided to gauge the difference ratio between any two IMCMs. Subsequently, we define normalized interval multiplicative weights and introduce a notion of normalized acceptable interval multiplicative weight vectors. An indeterminacy-ratio and geometric-mean based transformation equation is furnished to convert a normalized acceptable interval multiplicative weight vector into an acceptable IMCM with consistency. Based on the transformation equation, we put forward logarithmic least square (LLS) multi-objective models for generating interval multiplicative weights. By introducing an auxiliary constraint and minimizing the squared deviation between the logarithms of the two sides of the transformation equation, an LLS model is established to generate a normalized acceptable interval multiplicative weight vector from an acceptable IMCM. Finally, a new possibility degree formula is presented to compare and rank normalized interval multiplicative weights.

The organization of the article is as follows. Section 2 covers preliminaries on Saaty's consistent multiplicative comparison matrices and IMCMs. Section 3 points out the technical deficiencies of an existing acceptable consistency definition of IMCMs. An adapted consistency definition and new acceptability notion are put forward in Section 4 along with useful properties of consistent and acceptable IMCMs. An LLS model is developed to elicit interval multiplicative weights from acceptable IMCMs in Section 5. Two illustrative numerical examples and comparative studies are furnished in Section 6 to demonstrate the proposed framework. Section 7 concludes the paper with a brief comment on future opportunities.

                     , and developed an eigenvector method to obtain priority weights from multiplicative comparison matrices. He also put forward the following CI and CR to measure the level of inconsistency of the DM's judgments in A.

                     Saaty (1980) suggested an acceptable threshold of 0.1: If CR(A) ≤ 0.1, then the multiplicative comparison matrix A is called acceptably consistent. In this case, the preference intensity of alternative xi

                     , n) is adequately captured by the priority weight ωi
                      obtained from the eigenvector method. If CR(A) > 0.1, the consistency of A is deemed unacceptable, and the judgment matrix A should be revised by the DM to improve its consistency.

In many decision situations, pair-wise comparisons are often made with indeterminacy and vagueness. To characterize this indeterminacy, Saaty and Vargas (1987) introduced the notion of interval multiplicative comparison matrices (IMCMs).

This section analyzes an existing notion of acceptably consistent IMCMs. A numerical example is developed to illustrate its technical deficiency.


                     Liu (2009) introduced two formulas (Eq. (6) on p. 2690) to construct two multiplicative comparison matrices, which are then employed to define consistency of IMCMs (Definition 3 on p. 2691). The definition is rewritten by using the notation in this paper as follows.

                     Liu (2009) further employed AL
                      and AU
                      to check acceptable consistency of IMCMs. If AL
                      and AU
                      are both acceptably consistent, then 
                        
                           A
                           ¯
                        
                      is said to have acceptable consistency; otherwise, 
                        
                           A
                           ¯
                        
                      is unacceptable.

Next, a numerical example is provided to illustrate that acceptable consistency given by Liu (2009) yields contradictory results for the same judgment matrix after the alternatives are re-labeled, thereby revealing its technical deficiency.


                     
                        Example 1
                        Consider a decision problem with three alternatives E, F and G. A DM compares each pair of the three alternatives, and furnishes his/her results as shown in Table 1.
                           
                        

Interval comparisons in Table 1 can be shuffled by different labeling for the three alternatives and yield six equivalent IMCMs. If the alternatives E, F and G are labeled by x
                     1, x
                     2 and x
                     3, respectively, then the DM's comparisons are expressed as the following IMCM:

                     . The aforesaid example clearly demonstrates the technical deficiency of the acceptable consistency proposed by Liu (2009): the judgment of an IMCM's acceptable consistency depends on how the alternatives are labeled and a new permutation with the same IMCM may lead to a contradictory result.

This analysis indicates that the existing acceptable consistency and acceptability definitions are problematic in modeling transitivity and indeterminacy in a DM's pair-wise comparison. Next, we shall introduce new acceptable consistency and acceptability definitions for IMCMs.

This section first introduces an interval-arithmetic-based transitivity equation to define consistency of IMCMs. We then put forward acceptable consistency of IMCMs and a definition of indeterminacy ratio of an IMCM, thereby introducing the notion of acceptable IMCMs and defining a geometric-mean-based indeterminacy index for an IMCM. Useful properties are subsequently derived for consistent IMCMs and acceptable IMCMs.

                        . In this case, (4.1) is reduced to (2.3), which is equivalent to the multiplicative transitivity condition (2.2) given by Saaty (1980). Therefore, the consistency (4.1) is a natural generalization of Saaty's original multiplicative consistency.

Obviously, (4.1) is independent of the index order of i, j, k and, hence, Definition 4.1 is robust when alternative labels are permutated. By Definition 4.1,

                         in Example 1 are two inconsistent IMCMs. Hereafter, when an IMCM is called consistent, it is always under Definition 4.1 unless otherwise stated. Similarly, whenever a multiplicative comparison matrix is referred to be consistent, it is always in terms of consistency given in Definition 2.1.

                        Theorem 4.1 means that the transitivity constraint (4.1) can be equivalently formulated as a crisp arithmetic Eq. (4.2), implying Definition 4.1 is equivalent to the consistency introduced by Wang (2015a). The following theorem further indicates that (4.2) can be simplified by checking only the upper diagonal elements for consistency.

                        Corollary 4.3 specifies a particular crisp consistent comparison matrix within a consistent IMCM: each element of the crisp comparison matrix is given by the geometric mean of the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding interval judgment.

In real-world decision situations, DMs often furnish their preference over alternatives as IMCMs based on their subjective assessment and the transitivity property is not always honoured. By Corollary 4.3, the consistency of an IMCM

                         can be characterized by that of the associated crisp geometric mean matrix Agm
                         defined by (4.7). Next, we introduce acceptable consistency of IMCMs as follows.

                               is acceptably consistent if the crisp judgment matrix Agm
                               defined by (4.7) is acceptably consistent.


                        Definition 4.2 intentionally keeps the notion of acceptable consistency generic. Several consistency indices, such as Saaty's CI, the geometric consistency index (Crawford & Williams, 1985), and the harmonic consistency index (Stein & Mizzi, 2007), have been devised to measure consistency of crisp judgment matrices. Different thresholds have been proposed for checking acceptable consistency (Aguaron & Moreno-Jimenez, 2003). Despite the fact that Saaty's CR has been criticized for yielding unreasonable consistency result with respect to the condition of order preservation (Bana e Costa & Vansnick, 2008; Kułakowski, 2015), it remains the most widely used acceptable consistency in literature (Ishizaka & Labib, 2011). Based on this consideration, we employ Saaty's CR to verify acceptable consistency of the multiplicative comparison matrix Agm
                        , i.e., CR(Agm
                        ) ≤ 0.1. However, it should be stressed that our general acceptable consistency framework can be readily extended to other notions such as the aforesaid geometric and harmonic consistency indices.

Sometimes, DMs may give extremely indeterminate interval judgment such as [1/S, S] in a bipolar [1/S, S] scale with a neutral element of 1, indicating the DM's outright uncertainty about the comparison. For instance, if a DM furnishes an IMCM with all nondiagonal elements being [1/S, S], such a judgment matrix is technically consistent, but it discloses nothing about the DM's preference and does not help at all in deducing a reliable decision result (Dubois & Prade, 2012; Durbach & Stewart, 2012; Scholten et al., 2015; Wang & Li, 2015). In this case, even if the IMCM is consistent or acceptably consistent, we should still treat it as unacceptable due to its high indeterminacy. Therefore, it is the authors’ opinion that both the indeterminacy and consistency levels must be considered when determining acceptability of IMCMs. If an IMCM is too indeterminate or too inconsistent, it should be judged as unacceptable and returned to the DM for a revision. This holistic view differs from existing research on assessing acceptability of an IMCM: current literature tends to consider only the consistency level in line of Saaty's acceptable consistency without examining the indeterminacy level. It is inappropriate for IMCMs due to inherent indeterminacy in interval judgments.

The interval width is often adopted to measure the indeterminacy level of an interval judgment (Entani & Sugihara, 2012; Guo & Tanaka 2010; Guo & Wang 2012). However, the interval width sometimes does not properly capture the indeterminacy level of an interval judgment, especially when an element is expressed as a preference ratio. For instance, given two interval comparison ratios

                               is unacceptable.


                        Definition 4.4 stipulates that, for an IMCM to be acceptable, it must have both an acceptable indeterminacy level and an acceptable consistency level. An unacceptable IMCM 
                           
                              A

                         may contain extremely inconsistent or highly indeterminate information. In this case, the IMCM 
                           
                              A
                              ¯
                           
                         should be returned to the DM for an update.

Based on this holistic view of acceptability for IMCMs, a consistent IMCM may be deemed unacceptable due to high indeterminacy. For instance, let

                         for all i ≠ j. In essence, this acceptability notion furnishes an important vehicle to control the quality of DMs’ decision input IMCMs from two aspects: consistency and indeterminacy. It is simply not enough to be consistent; the indeterminacy has to be controlled to be within an acceptable threshold as well. This new quality control mechanism is presumably helpful for the DM to elicit more meaningful input and make better decisions.

Using the geometric mean idea, we introduce a ratio-based concept to gauge the difference between two IMCMs.

                        Theorem 4.3 demonstrates that the aggregation method (4.13) for m acceptable IMCMs always results in an acceptable group IMCM. This implies that it is reasonable to employ (4.13) to aggregate individual IMCMs with acceptability into a collective IMCM in group decisions.

This section first defines a notion of normalized acceptable interval multiplicative weights, then establishes an LLS model to elicit a normalized interval multiplicative weight vector from an acceptable IMCM. Subsequently, a geometric-mean-based method is developed for ranking interval multiplicative weights.

In a similar way to normalizing an interval additive weight vector (Wang & Elhag, 2006), we introduce a notion of normalized interval multiplicative weights.

                     Eqs. (5.7) and (5.8) hold only for consistent IMCMs. For an inconsistent IMCM with acceptable consistency, the equations in (5.7) and (5.8) will be relaxed by allowing deviations. The smaller the squared deviation, the closer the IMCM

Once multiplicative priority weights are generated from IMCMs, the next issue is to compare them and deduce a rank. Wang et al. (2005a) and Liu (2009) developed interval midpoint-based methods to compare two interval multiplicative weights, which are equivalent to an arithmetic mean approach. To be consistent with the geometric-mean-based modeling idea in this article, we introduce an alternative geometric-mean-based possibility degree formula and employ it to compare and rank interval multiplicative weights

This ranking order is consistent with the result given by Liu (2009) and Wang et al. (2005a). However, the possibility degrees differ. This difference is ascribed to the fact that their models use different consistent properties of IMCMs and apply different possibility degree formulae, which utilize the arithmetic means of interval multiplicative weights while our approach here adopts their geometric means.

To further validate the proposed models, a comparative analysis with the results from Liu (2009) and Wang et al. (2005a) is conducted by examining the associated consistent IMCMs generated by the obtained interval multiplicative weights.

As per (5.19), the associated consistent and acceptable IMCM is determined from the interval multiplicative weight vector

                      obtained by the proposed model in this article capture the DM's original indeterminate judgments the best in terms of the indeterminacy index and difference ratio. In addition, Wang et al. (2005a) did not consider acceptability of IMCMs. While the priority method in Liu (2009) entertains acceptable consistency for IMCMs, our analysis in Section 3 indicates that the acceptable consistency therein suffers from the drawback of being sensitive to alternative label reshuffling.


                     
                        Example 3
                        Recent rapid growth of graduate education in China creates a great need for Chinese universities to establish objective and fair criterion weighting schemes for evaluating graduate applications. It is typical to evaluate applicants based on four criteria: academic records and reputation of the undergraduate institution (c
                           1), research potentials (c
                           2), English proficiency and communication skills (c
                           3), and teamwork (c

In practice, interval criteria weights offer more decision flexibility and choices for DMs. In the context of this example, interval values can be interpreted as a general guideline for different faculties on campus. For an individual faculty, distinct real-valued weights may be derived from these interval values by assessing its specific characteristics and needs in graduate admissions.

It is noted that the approach by Liu (2009) cannot be employed to solve this group decision problem: by (2.5) and (3.1), one has

This paper first shows that the acceptable consistency for IMCMs in Liu (2009) is not robust with respect to permutation of alternatives. An interval-arithmetic-based transitivity equation is then introduced to define consistency of IMCMs. By incorporating both consistency and indeterminacy levels of interval judgments, we put forward a new notion of acceptable IMCMs. Subsequently, an indeterminacy ratio of an interval comparison is introduced to define an indeterminacy index for measuring overall indeterminacy of an IMCM. We propose a notion of acceptable normalized interval multiplicative weights. An indeterminacy-ratio and geometric-mean based transformation equation is devised to convert an acceptable normalized interval multiplicative weight vector into a consistent and acceptable IMCM. An LLS model is developed to derive normalized interval multiplicative weights from an acceptable IMCM. A geometric-mean-based possibility degree is furnished for comparing and ranking normalized interval multiplicative weights. Two numerical examples are offered to demonstrate the effectiveness and applications of the proposed framework.

Future endeavors are needed to extend the paradigm for decision problems with incomplete IMCMs and addressing consensus reaching processes in group decision.
