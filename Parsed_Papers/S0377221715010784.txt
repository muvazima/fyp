                  Analytical and iterative optimization techniques are employed to solve a job shop-like capacity planning problem for a maintenance service provider with contractually defined lead time requirements. The problem is motivated by a real-life case example, namely the overhaul of airline aircraft engines through an external service provider. The production network is modeled as a network of GI/G/1 queues, where the service rates are the decision variables and capacity costs and penalty costs for not meeting contractually defined lead times are minimized. In addition, we analytically investigate the effects of collaborative maintenance management as a source of advanced information regarding future maintenance demand. More specifically, we consider the benefits of improved service rates and service and demand variabilities on production capacities and total costs. Numerical examples are provided to verify the proposed optimization procedure and illustrate the effects of collaborative maintenance management.
               
            

Today, the rise of Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things facilitates real-time condition monitoring and condition-based maintenance of technical equipment (Zhu, Peng, & van Houtum, June 2015). Combining real-time condition data with plans of future equipment usage makes it possible to predict future condition and maintenance requirements. This is what we refer to as advanced information. Huge data streams are collected, stored and used for the optimization of maintenance schedules, production plans and supply chain operations. Sophisticated technical equipment such as Rolls-Royce’s Trent aircraft engines are equipped with sensors that measure different parameters and send the data to data warehouses in real time (Geer, Ellis). For Trent engines, this data includes more than 20 parameters such as oil pressure, oil temperature, and vibration levels that can be used for condition-based maintenance scheduling and optimized planning of maintenance operations. However, data usage is challenging in a service provider or contract manufacturer setting, as the data is collected by the owner and oftentimes not shared with the supplier due to privacy concerns. An analysis of potential benefits is necessary in order to convince customers to participate and invest in a collaborative planning system.

In this paper, we analyze the benefits associated with advanced information for a maintenance service provider that can be obtained through collaborative maintenance management. More specifically, we investigate how advanced information influences the optimal capacity allocations in a complex maintenance and repair process, the associated capacity costs and the potential penalties for tardiness. Since advanced information oftentimes requires substantial investments, it is important to understand the relationship between advanced information and the costs of the system. The results of our analysis help supply chain partners to decide whether or not to invest in advanced information technologies and collaborative planning systems.

Our research is motivated by a practical use case, namely the overhaul of aircraft engines of multiple airlines through an MRO
                        2

                      service provider. Airlines ship their engines to the service provider when they need to be overhauled. The service provider then processes the engines and sends them back after completion. A typical MRO engine overhaul production system is illustrated in Fig. 1
                     
                     . There are two sources of uncertainty in this system. One is that the engine arrival stream is a stochastic process where the interarrival time between subsequent engines is a random variable. Second, the service times at the work stations illustrated in Fig. 1 are random variables and depend on the required service, on worker skill, and on spare parts availability.

In this paper we seek to determine the capacities of the work stations in the MRO production network such that total costs (capacity costs as well as penalty costs for not meeting contractually defined turnaround times) are minimized. In addition, we investigate the benefits of advanced information that can be obtained from a closer collaboration between the service provider and its customers. Through information sharing and collaborative scheduling of engine arrivals, the variabilities of engine interarrival and service times can be reduced, and the mean time required for service at certain work stations can be shortened. Investigating the influence of these effects on optimal capacity is a complex problem, as these parameters are interlinked throughout all work stations in the network. Fig. 2 illustrates a framework for collaborative maintenance management in the aerospace MRO business leading to the aforementioned improvements. While we focus on capacity planning (shaded in Fig. 2), we briefly explain the basic ideas of the other process steps in the collaborative maintenance management framework.

Using historical and actual engine usage and condition data, it is possible to predict when an engine will arrive at the service provider, and in what condition (this is advanced information), (see Taigel and Tueno (2015)). If the service provider is able to use this data, spare parts can be ordered such that service levels are improved. In addition, the provider can plan for and prepare overhaul operations beforehand to optimize the activities carried out when the engine arrives. Both improvements contribute to a reduction of mean service time and service time variability. Once a forecast of future engine arrivals is available, actual engine arrivals can be scheduled such that their interarrival time variability is reduced.

These improvements are only possible through investments in a collaborative planning system. Airlines need to be able to report their engine usage and condition data (captured through sensors) to a central data warehouse in a timely fashion. As the data reported by the individual airlines is highly confidential, cryptographic methods are necessary to prevent competitive information from being leaked. The goal of this paper is to develop a tool that can estimate the benefits of different collaborative scenarios for the service provider and his customers, so that they can decide whether or not to invest in the collaborative planning system.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the relevant literature. In Section 3, we model the service providers’ production network as a network of queues. In Section 4 we analyze the effects of advanced information on the queueing network and total costs. Structural insights are supported by numerical analyses in Section 5. Section 6 provides conclusion and outlook. The proofs of propositions (if not given in the main document) and the queueing network parameter approximations can be found in the supplementary material.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

This literature review focuses on existing research regarding queueing networks for production capacity planning. Although this research area dates back to the 1950s, many problems remain unsolved and the field is still subject to continuing research. In addition, we provide an overview of the most important publications dealing with the effects of advanced information obtained through supply chain collaboration. As this paper is motivated by an aerospace case, relevant literature regarding the overhaul of aircraft engines is also outlined.

We use a queueing network model to describe the service provider’s production network. To date, most publications considering queueing networks for production planning have dealt with the fundamental tradeoff between capacity costs and lead time. They focus either on finding a cost-optimal capacity allocation subject to a maximum lead time constraint (Bitran & Tirupati, 1989; Negri da Silva & Morabito, 2009) or, vice versa, finding a lead time-minimizing capacity allocation subject to a cost (or budget) constraint (Boxma, Kan, & van Vliet, 1990; Bretthauer & Côté, 1996). In contrast, we combine both capacity and lead time penalty costs in the objective function in order to reflect the service provider setting.

As exact analytical results for queueing network performance metrics such as the sojourn (or lead) time can be computed only for a limited range of queueing networks, approximate expressions were developed for more general types of queueing networks (e.g., if the service and interarrival times at the nodes are not exponentially distributed). In this paper we use the Krämer–Langenbach–Belz approximation to compute the number of customers in a single GI/G/1 queue (Krämer & Langenbach-Belz, 1976). In order to approximate sojourn times in a queueing network, Whitt proposed in 1983 to decompose the network and evaluate each node separately (Whitt, 1983). In his Queueing Network Analyzer (QNA) approach, Whitt developed iterative algorithms to describe the queueing parameters at node level resulting from the network structure. Adjustments and improvements to this approach are summarized by Bitran and Morabito (1996). Lately, Wu and McGinnis (2012; 2013) developed new methods to approximate cycle and waiting times in queueing networks based on the intrinsic ration, especially suited for networks in heavy traffic .

In 1989, Bitran and Tirupati developed tradeoff curves between work-in-process (WIP), lead time, and capacity (represented by the service rates at the nodes) (Bitran & Tirupati, 1989). They formulated a convex program minimizing total cost of capacity subject to a total lead time constraint for a general open network of queues with Markovian or deterministic routing. Bretthauer and Côté (1996) developed nonlinear programming models for time-dependent capacity planning in manufacturing systems (Bretthauer & Côté, 1996). They present two models, one to minimize capacity costs under a WIP constraint and one to minimize lead times subject to a capacity cost constraint. In 2002, Hopp, Spearman, Chayet, Donohue, and Gel (2002) developed an Optimized Queueing Network (OQNet) capacity planning tool to support the design and reconfiguration of queueing network-like semiconductor production facilities . Using a heuristic algorithm, they minimize facility costs such that specific volume and lead time targets are satisfied, while these performance metrics are determined using the general open queueing network approximations. More discussion regarding tradeoff curves between WIP, lead time and capacity in this context, also using QNA approximations and convex/MIP models for capacity planning of semiconductor manufacturing networks, can be found in the review by Bitran and Morabito (1999). Da Silva and Morabito (2009) determine how to optimally allocate capacity in a job shop-like queueing network of a metallurgical plant (Negri da Silva & Morabito, 2009). They use approximate parametric decomposition models to compute performance metrics such as WIP and lead time and apply optimization models minimizing capacity costs. Finally, Morabito, de Souza, and Vazquez (2014) study network routing decisions for multicommodity flows. They provide and compare different performance approximation approaches for generalized open queueing networks (Morabito et al., 2014).

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies to date that incorporate both capacity costs and lead time penalties in the objective function. This means that in existing publications, capacity costs or lead time are constraints that must be fulfilled; in our setting, however, contractually defined lead times can be exceeded if marginal capacity costs are more expensive than marginal penalty costs. On the one hand, this best reflects the actual business case motivating our research, but on the other hand it also allows us to explore the effects of advanced information on total costs (capacity and penalty costs). In addition, whereas most other studies use heuristic algorithms to solve the optimization problems, we are (depending on the problem parameters) partially able to find explicit solutions.

The effects of advanced information have been explored in a variety of settings. In the most general of terms, advanced information can be used to reduce uncertainty. In return, this lowers capacity or inventory requirements. For supply chain collaboration through information sharing, we refer the reader to Poler, Hernandez, Mula, and Lario (2008). Collaborative scheduling of demand, taking into account customer demand and supplier capacity information is discussed, for example, by Chen and Hall (2007). In the MRO context, collaborative planning leads to reduced variability of service and interarrival times and finally to reduced costs. So far, this has not yet been explicitly studied for service provider production networks.

Interesting publications regarding the overhaul operations of aircraft engines include, for example, Stranjak et al. (2008). They present an agent-based simulator to predict and schedule aircraft engine overhauls, motivated by competitiveness considerations in a highly complex and dynamic business environment. In addition, Rolls–Royce recently published an online article in which they explain how they use big data gathered by the sensors of the Trent engines and advanced analytics to achieve cost-efficient engine maintenance scheduling for their customers (Geer, Ellis). Reményi and Staudacher (2014) present a simulation-based approach that is used to identify scheduling rules for aircraft engine maintenance carried out by a MRO for multiple airlines (Reményi & Staudacher, 2014). For more information regarding aircraft engine usage and condition parameters, we refer the reader to da Conceicao Pereira Batalha (2012).

We need to explicitly model the complex nature of the maintenance production system to determine optimal capacities per work station and to highlight how advanced information impacts both capacities and costs. Therefore, we model the system as a queuing network where the service rates of the individual work stations are chosen as optimization variables. The basic capacity planning model for maintenance services is developed in Section 3.1. In Section 3.2, we describe how to approximate sojourn times in the queueing network. Finally, analytical and iterative solution methods for the optimization problem are detailed in Section 3.3.

Within the service or production process, products (e.g., aircraft engines) pass through successive work stations under an FCFS
                           3

                         policy. In practice, service providers or contract manufacturers and their customers often have contracts specifying maximum lead times (also referred to as sojourn or turnaround times) for service or production processes. Over a finite planning horizon, the actual mean lead time is computed and compared to the contractually defined maximum lead time per product family. If this time is exceeded, the service provider incurs a penalty which increases with increasing mean lead time. The objective of the capacity allocation model developed here is to determine the capacity per work station such that total costs are minimized. It is worth noting again that total costs are comprised of both capacity costs (associated with the service rate) and penalty costs (incurred for not meeting contractually defined maximum lead times). Before developing the mathematical model to optimally determine production capacities, we summarize the notation used throughout the next sections.

The production network consists of work stations

                        . Each product family e follows a predetermined acyclic path

The decision variables of the optimization model are defined as μj
                        , representing the capacity or mean service rate at each work station 
                           
                              j

                        . The associated per unit capacity costs are denoted by cj
                        . Let Sj
                        (μj
                        ) denote the service rate-dependent mean sojourn times at station j and let 
                           
                              S

                               per product family for all customers.
                         The tardiness penalty cost per time unit for product family e is denoted by γe
                         and is incurred for positive differences of the actual total sojourn time minus the contractually defined maximum sojourn time.

As we will see in Section 3.2, we need some additional parameters in order to compute the sojourn times Sj
                        (μj
                        ). We define λj
                         as the mean arrival rate of jobs at work station j (sum of the individual arrival rates of all product families served at work station j). caj
                         denotes the squared coefficient of variation (ratio of the variance to the squared mean of a random variable) of product interarrival times at work station j. Service time variability at the work stations is captured as the squared coefficient of variation of service times csj
                        . Finally, Lj
                        (μj
                        ) denotes the approximate expected number of products at work station j given service rate μj
                        .

                        . Service rates are assumed to be continuous variables, which is quite common in the context of production planning with queueing networks; see e.g. Bitran and Tirupati (1989) and the references therein Bitran and Tirupati (1989).

Since the service rate-dependent mean sojourn times Sj
                        (μj
                        ) determine the penalty costs, they are the key performance measures in the production network. However, computing the sojourn times in a queueing network is not trivial due to the interdependencies of the individual nodes. Therefore, we subsequently describe an approximation method based on various queueing network parameters.

The individual work stations can be modeled as queues with independent and generally distributed interarrival times, generally distributed services times, one server, and infinite waiting room (abbreviated as GI/G/1/∞). This type of queue allows us to account for all possible kinds of probability distribution functions for the interarrival and service times. We do not consider M/M/1 queues first, but use GI/G/1 queues directly as this research is motivated by the MRO case where interarrival and service times are generally not exponentially distributed. One could assume that interarrival times may, without scheduling, be modeled as exponentially distributed random variables for each product family, resulting in a squared coefficient of variation

We can use parametric decomposition to approximate the production system as a network of J independent GI/G/1 queues, where each product family e follows a predetermined acyclic path comprising work stations

                        Eq. (3) provides an approximation of the mean sojourn times Sj
                        (μj
                        ) for each work station in the production network. We can assume to know the arrival processes to the system and the service time variabilities csj
                         for all work stations. However, although we assume independence of the queues at the individual nodes, it is still necessary to determine the arrival rates λj
                         and their variability parameters caj
                         for all work stations (except the ones where the engines arrive), depending on the network structure. These parameters are approximated prior to the optimization based on techniques proposed by Bitran and Morabito (1996). While the arrival rates can be found quite easily from the subsets

                              ,
                           
                         the interarrival time variability at a work station is driven by the interarrival time and the service time variability of the previously visited work station. The algorithms to determine the queueing network parameters can be found in the Supplementary Material B.

We follow the approach proposed by several authors, e.g., by Bitran and Tirupati (1989), and use the following assumption.

                           Assumption 1
                           The effect of a change in service rate μj
                               on the interdeparture time variability cdj
                               and therefore on the interarrival time variability cai
                              , i > j, can be neglected.

Therefore, λj
                         and caj
                         are computed for all work stations 
                           
                              j
                              ∈
                              J
                           
                         once for a reasonable guess of 
                           
                              μ
                              ∈
                              m
                              a
                              dom
                              
                              C
                           
                         prior to the optimization routine. Sj
                        (·) is treated as a univariate function of μj
                        . During optimization, all other parameters are assumed to remain constant. Assumption 1 generally holds as long as the service rates estimate is close to the optimal service rates. However, if the service rates are hard to estimate for a certain problem, the shortcomings of the assumption can be circumvented by iteratively solving the optimization problem, taking the optimal service rates as initializing service rates for the queueing network parameter approximations and solving the optimization problem again with the updated parameters.

With the definition of the approximate mean sojourn times we can derive structural insights regarding the capacity allocation problem defined in Section 3.1.

                         directly, we distinguish two limiting cases that can be solved directly and a general case for any other solution depending on the differentiability of (CAP). The two limiting cases are defined such that all relevant penalty terms are either differentiable (corresponding to Panel 4a) or not differentiable (corresponding to Panel 4b). The general case applies if the penalty cost term is differentiable for only a part of the product families. Due to the complex structure of the problem, it is a priori not possible to determine which case applies for a given set of parameters. Therefore, we solve the optimization problem for all three cases using different methodologies and determine the “true” optimal solution from their respective outcomes. In formal terms, the three cases can be defined as follows:

As the negative slope of Sj
                         increases with decreasing μj
                        , it is obvious that Case 2 becomes more likely to be the right way to solve (CAP) (as compared to Case 1) for increasing

                        . In other words, if the contractually defined maximum mean total sojourn times are relatively high, then we define capacity such that actual and contractually defined sojourn times coincide (incremental penalty cost increases for capacity reduction are higher than incremental capacity cost savings).

                         there are paths for which the penalty cost term is differentiable and paths where this is not the case. Thus, we need to solve the problem with an iterative method for nonlinear and nondifferentiable optimization, e.g., the subgradient method.

The subgradient method is applicable to unconstrained optimization problems. Therefore, in order to determine the solution of (CAP), we define the extended-value extension

The queueing network model developed in the previous section constitutes the basis for an in-depth evaluation of the benefits associated with advanced information that can be obtained through collaborative maintenance management of the MRO service provider with his customers. More specifically, we want to determine the cost benefits of collaborative demand forecasting, spare parts management, and collaborative engine arrival scheduling as introduced in Section 1. As explained in the subsequent subsections, collaborative maintenance management may result in improved service rates and reduced service and interarrival time variabilities.

                        It is interesting to note that sole forecast information does not lead to a cost improvement. This means that knowledge about future arrivals has no value as long as the information is not used for service preparation, spare parts management, or scheduling overhaul time slots. Without further processing of the information, the service rate is not improved and service and interarrival time variabilities are not reduced (e.g., although we know future arrivals, they are still Poissonian from a queueing network point of view).
                     
                  

For all three effects, we want to investigate the behavior of total costs for increasing improvement. That is, how does the slope of total costs evolve with the improvements? Do the benefits obtained through improvements at multiple work stations add up? What are the numerical effects on mean turnaround time? Can we find bounds on capacities and cost improvements in order to obtain good estimates of the minimum expectable benefits, even without solving the optimization problem? Are there interdependencies between the two types of variability reduction and which effects yields the higher benefits? These guiding managerial questions are answered as far as analytically possible for improved mean service rates and reduced service time variabilities in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively. The effects of reduced interarrival time variabilities are explained in more detail in Section 4.2. A numerical study validating and enhancing the theoretical results is conducted in Section 5.

In this section we want to determine the effects of improved service rates on the production network. We provide managerial insights regarding the benefits of capacity and penalty costs that can be expected as well as some structural properties regarding the updated optimal capacity allocation.

Until now the service provider did not receive any information regarding future engine arrivals and their condition. In the collaborative maintenance management scenario, customers grant access to historic and real-time engine usage data (e.g., traveled distance or number of takeoffs since last overhaul) and condition data (e.g., oil temperature, oil pressure, or vibration levels) that can be used to forecast overhaul time and service requirements using machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the forecasted service requirements can be used to computed the probability that a specific spare part will be needed for each engine. Therefore, it is possible to optimize spare parts management and to prepare the repair processes (e.g., guarantee that skilled personnel is available if a part is not replaced but repaired). This may reduce the time needed for inspection, repair and assembly by a factor ξj
                         and hence increase the service rates at the affected work stations of the network. For more information we refer the reader to Taigel and Tueno (2015) and Zilli, Kurz et al. (May 2015).

The queueing network model defined in Section 3 now allows us to investigate the effects of mean service rate improvement on optimal capacity and total costs. We assume that the service rate improvement can be quantified by the service provider ex ante. We define a matrix

This operation would yield the optimal updated capacity if the production system consisted of a single work station and no penalty costs were incurred. However, due to the network structure (an improvement at one node can induce a change in the optimal updated capacities at preceding and subsequent work stations) and the nonlinear penalty cost term in our optimization model, we will later see that the myopic choice does not yield the optimal solution. Nevertheless, as penalty costs would remain constant when choosing

It is interesting to note that total sojourn times are only reduced if a penalty was incurred for the original optimization problem’s solution. In addition, since penalty costs are weakly decreasing with improved service rates, a product family (or engine type) originally incurring a penalty can “loose” the penalty if the improvement is substantial.

As mentioned before, the updated optimal capacities do not correspond to the original capacities divided by the improvement, and an improvement at one work station can lead to a shift of the optimal capacity at a different node in the network. Therefore, the following proposition provides some structural insights regarding the updated optimal capacities.

From the proposition we can deduce some interesting results. If the solution of the original optimization problem is such that a penalty is incurred for all product families, we can conclude that capacities remain constant at work stations without improvement,

                         where

                        . This is due to the independence of the nodes when solving the Case 1 optimization problem. As soon as at least one product family does not incur a penalty, the result is generally no longer valid. For product families without penalty, increases and reductions in service rate at the work stations will balance each other out such that mean approximate total sojourn times still coincide with contractually defined maximum mean sojourn times. Mean service rates will increase at work stations with improvement and decrease at work stations without improvement, although this may be counterintuitive at first sight. Independent of the penalty cost term, updated optimal capacities will always range between the myopic updated capacity choice and the optimal capacity of the original (CAP).

In Section 5.3 we conduct a numerical analysis of the structural properties of service rate improvements in order to provide further insights regarding our guiding managerial questions.

In this section we explore the effects of reduced interarrival and service time variabilities on the production network. We do not only compare the impact of both types of variability reductions on total costs, but also provide some structural insights regarding the propagation of the effects through the network. As outlined in the previous section, optimized spare parts management (i.e., higher service levels) and preparation of service (i.e., required material and skilled personnel are available) lead not only to increased service rates, but also to reductions in service time variabilities at the respective work stations.

The scheduling of engine arrivals is another process step in the collaborative maintenance management scenario introduced in Section 1. Assume there exists a discrete set of arrival slot options around the predicted slot resulting from the aircraft-specific flight plan. Then a scheduling algorithm would assign each job to a slot such that the overall interarrival time variability is minimized. For more information we refer the reader to Zilli et al. (May 2015).

                           Proposition 6
                           
                              For a single work station j with constant service rate, the following statements hold.

                                       The sojourn time Sj
                                       (·) is strictly increasing in csj and caj.
                                    


                                       Ceteris paribus, the cost reduction through improved interarrival time variability exceeds the cost reduction through improved service time variability.
                                    

Statement (i) tells us that sojourn times are reduced if interarrival or service time variabilities are reduced. Therefore, it is obvious that total costs will be reduced by any improvement of service or interarrival time variability.

While the impact of a reduction in caj
                         and csj
                         on sojourn times and total costs is intuitive, an investigation of the strength of the two effects from a queueing network perspective yields some interesting insights. As stated in (ii), when we consider one work station in isolation, the cost reduction through reduced interarrival time variability exceeds the cost reduction through reduced service time variability.

On the other hand, if we consider two subsequent work stations j and 
                           
                              i

                         assuming there is no superposition or splitting between the two work stations, we can derive which properties drive the impact of service and interarrival time variabilities from a queueing network perspective.

                         is an important measure that determines the propagation of variability reduction through the network.

Due to the interdependence of work stations in a queueing network, reductions of service or interarrival time variabilities will always have an impact on the interarrival time variabilities of all successive work stations in the production process. On the other hand, a reduction of the external interarrival time variabilities has no influence on the service time variabilities at the nodes. Because of the complexity of the queueing network performance parameter algorithm detailed in the Supplementary Material B, some numerical experiments illustrate the aforementioned effects in the subsequent section.

The following numerical analysis sheds light on the actual numerical behavior of the models introduced above. As we already derived some structural insights, numerical examples validate those insights and provide a more detailed evaluation of the actual performance and expectable benefits.

The experimental design of the numerical collaborative maintenance management scenario analysis is explained in the subsequent section. In Section 5.2 we define the reference case of our numerical analysis, including a comparison of the different solution methods introduced in Section 3. Numerical analyses regarding the benefits of the collaborative maintenance management scenario are provided in Section 5.3.

For all three effects analyzed in the previous section, we investigate the actual numerical behavior of total costs for increasing improvement. We address managerial questions such as: How does the slope of total costs evolve with the improvements? Do the benefits obtained through improvements at multiple work stations add up? What are the numerical effects on mean turnaround time? For improved service rates, we are also interested in the total costs benefit in comparison to the lower bound of cost improvement derived in Section 4.1. We also investigate how capacities at the work stations change with improved service rates, and check this against the structural insights provided in Proposition 5. Finally, we conduct a factorial analysis regarding the effects of mutual dependence of service and interarrival time variability improvements. Fig. 5
                         depicts the input and output parameters of our analysis.

Mean service rates are improved through advanced demand information and increased spare parts service levels. If we consider the network shown in Fig. 1, the NDT (Non-Destructive Test) and inspection process steps are accelerated, since more information is known in advance through continuous sharing of real time sensor data. Optimized spare parts management and service preparation lead to accelerated sojourn times of the repair and assembly process steps. Therefore, we assume an improvement of the mean service rates at work stations

In the following section we define the reference case used throughout the numerical experiments conducted in Sections 5.3 and 5.4.

In this section we define the queueing network parameters used for the numerical experiments. In addition, we investigate the performance of the three proposed solution methods for four different sets of sojourn time requirements, one of which is chosen as the reference case for the factorial analyses conducted in the following section.

According to the production network of the service provider setting depicted in Fig. 1, we use a queueing network with 11 work stations and two paths through the network,

The largest improvement (i.e., the lowest thin line) is found at work station 7, since this work station is visited by both product families and exhibits the largest service time variability without improvement as presented in Table 1. Node 7 models the assembling work station, where spare parts delivered from external suppliers are needed. Through collaborative forecasting of spare parts demand, the spare parts service levels can be increased, which explains the imposed reduced service time variability at the work station.

It is interesting to note that total cost reductions do not add up for improved service and interarrival time variabilities. However, they do add up for improved service rates due to the independence of the nodes when solving the differentiable optimization problem where penalties are incurred on all paths.

As already shown in Fig. 7, an improvement in mean service rates has the highest impact on total costs. As expected, with Proposition 6 in mind, the collaborative scheduling of engine arrivals exhibits the second-highest cost reduction. The reduction of service time variabilities has the smallest effect on total costs. On the other hand, in many cases this improvement will happen automatically when mean service rates are improved, and therefore requires little additional implementation costs. In the columns displaying the sums of the approximate mean sojourn times on paths

                         we see that not only total costs, but also mean turnaround times are reduced as stated in Proposition 5.

Finally, it can be observed from the column showing optimal total costs

                         that the benefits of the three effects of advanced information do not add up. For any combination of mean service rate improvement with another effect, the sum of the individual improvements exceeds the improvement when solving the optimization problem for the combination. In contrast, when solving the optimization problem for reduced service and reduced interarrival time variabilities, the improvement is larger than the sum of the individual benefits (15.9 versus 15.7, respectively). This suggests that maintenance demand forecasting and optimized planning foster the benefits of scheduling.

This paper solved the problem of determining the cost-minimizing capacity in an acyclic production network for a service provider with contractually defined lead time requirements and associated penalty costs. The production network was described as a network of GI/G/1 queues, and we were able to find analytical and iterative methods to solve the optimization problem through classification of different cases distinguished by the differentiability of the objective function. For differentiable objective functions we were able to solve the optimization problem with the first-order necessary condition. If the objective function is not differentiable on all paths products take through the network, the problem can be solved with the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions of an equivalent reformulation of the optimization problem. Finally, we developed a general near-optimal solution algorithm based on the subgradient method capable of solving the problem with any properties.

In addition, we considered a collaborative maintenance management scenario in the aerospace business. In this scenario, the service provider and customers jointly employ advanced information collected by sensors measuring aircraft engine parameters in order to further minimize maintenance costs. As the associated collaborative planning systems are an investment for all parties involved, we showed how to compute the expected benefits under improvement assumptions such as improved service rates and reduced service and interarrival time variabilities. Numerical analyses illustrated the findings, allowed us to derive further structural properties, and supported investment decisions regarding a collaborative planning system.

With the information displayed in Table 3 and knowledge regarding implementation costs of the collaborative planning system, the service provider and his customers can now decide whether to consider the investment or discard the opportunity. Of course, to do so, a benefit sharing scheme must be developed to incentivize the individual players to participate: whereas capacity and penalty costs are reduced for the service provider, a fair share of the benefits would need to be transferred to the customers through a price reduction. The proposed methods allow the parties to establish a fair benefit sharing rule (depending on the implementation costs per party) and to quickly assess the cost-effectiveness of the collaborative planning system. Customers also benefit from reduced mean turnaround times, which translates into a reduction of the total number of engines needed for flight operations.

We provided some preliminary ideas regarding collaborative demand forecasting, spare parts management and engine arrival slot scheduling. We continue to work on more formal models for collaborative maintenance management. Although this paper was developed specifically for the aircraft engine MRO case, the models and insights apply to any similar service provider setting.
