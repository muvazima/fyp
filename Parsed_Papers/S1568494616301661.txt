               Abstract
               
                  Three-phase induction motors (TIMs) are the key elements of electromechanical energy conversion in a variety of productive sectors. Identifying a defect in a running motor, before a failure occurs, can provide greater security in the decision-making processes for machine maintenance, reduced costs and increased machine operation availability. This paper proposes a new approach for identifying faults and improving performance in three-phase induction motors by means of a multi-agent system (MAS) with distinct behavior classifiers. The faults observed are related to faulty bearings, breakages in squirrel-cage rotor bars, and short-circuits between the coils of the stator winding. By analyzing the amplitudes of the current signals in the time domain, experimental results are obtained through the different methods of pattern classification under various sinusoidal power and mechanical load conditions for TIMs. The use of an MAS to classify induction motor faults allows the agents to work in conjunction in order to perform a specific set of tasks and achieve the goals. This technique proved its effectiveness in the evaluated situations with 1 and 2hp motors, providing an alternative tool to traditional methods to identify bearing faults, broken rotor bars and stator short-circuit faults in TIMs.
