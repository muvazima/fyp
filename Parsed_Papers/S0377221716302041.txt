                  In this paper, we present a general EOQ model for items that are subject to inspection for imperfect quality. Each lot that is delivered to the sorting facility undertakes a 100 per cent screening and the percentage of defective items per lot reduces according to a learning curve. The generality of the model is viewed as important both from an academic and practitioner perspective. The mathematical formulation considers arbitrary functions of time that allow the decision maker to assess the consequences of a diverse range of strategies by employing a single inventory model. A rigorous methodology is utilised to show that the solution is a unique and global optimal and a general step-by-step solution procedure is presented for continuous intra-cycle periodic review applications. The value of the temperature history and flow time through the supply chain is also used to determine an efficient policy. Furthermore, coordination mechanisms that may affect the supplier and the retailer are explored to improve inventory control at both echelons. The paper provides illustrative examples that demonstrate the application of the theoretical model in different settings and lead to the generation of interesting managerial insights.
               
            

Since the introduction of the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model by Harris (1913), frequent contributions have been made in the literature towards the development of alternative models that overcome the unrealistic assumptions embedded in the EOQ formulation. For example, the assumption related to the perfect quality items is technologically unattainable in most supply chain applications (Cheng, 1991). In contrast, products can be categorised as ‘good quality’, ‘good quality after reworking’, ‘imperfect quality’ and ‘scrap’ (Chan, Ibrahim, & Lochert, 2003; Pal, Sana, & Chaudhuri, 2013). In practice, the presence of defective items in raw material or finished products inventories may deeply affect supply chain coordination and, consequently, the product flows among supply chain levels may become unreliable (Roy, Sana, & Chaudhuri, 2013). In response to this concern, the enhancement of currently available production and inventory order quantity models, that accounts for imperfect items in their mathematical formulation, has become an operational priority in supply chain management (Khan, Jaber, Guiffrida, & Zolfaghari, 2011). This enhancement may also include the knowledge transfer between supply chain entities in order to reduce the percentage of defective items.

EOQ models are associated with another implicit assumption that stored items may retain the same utility indefinitely, i.e. they do not lose their value as time goes on. This assumption may be valid for certain items. However, real-life systems analysis suggests that goods are subject to ‘obsolescence’, ‘perishability’ and ‘deterioration’ that have a direct impact on the flow of an item as it moves through the supply chain (Bakker, Riezebos, & Teunter, 2012; Goyal & Giri, 2001; Pahl & Voß, 2014). In relation to the perishable items, Amorim, Meyr, Almeder, and Almada-Lobo (2013) presented a classification of perishable models for items that have explicit characteristics related to their physical status (e.g. by spoilage, decay or depletion) and/or changes in their value as perceived by the customer and/or a risk of future reduced functionality according to specialist's opinion.

The complexity and drivers associated with product waste and loss have been increasingly discussed in the academic literature and include such issues as imperfect quality items (that necessitate an inspection to take place at various supply chain stages to ensure the quality of the product is adequate) (Gunders, 2012). For example, in the food and drink industry, different proportions of food waste are attributed to different stages in the supply chain, from production to handling and storage, processing and packaging, distribution and retail and finally at the household consumption stage. In particular, the fresh meat sector has been identified as the largest producer of waste and accounts overall for 25 per cent of the waste, ahead of fruit and vegetables at 13 per cent (WRAP, 2012a). The waste and spoilage related to inventory decisions represent a large proportion, and it is estimated that around 10 per cent of all perishable goods are spoiled before they reach consumers (Boyer, 2006; Roberti, 2005; Tortola, 2005). WRAP (2012b) published that “5–25 per cent of fruit and vegetable crop might not get through the supply chain to retail customers”. For example, in the onion supply chain, losses related to grading account for 9–20 per cent; storage 3–10 per cent and in the packing process they equate to 2–3 per cent loss. The main causes of waste in these examples relate to product specification, product deterioration and reliance on (excessive) storage to cope with fluctuations in (forecasted) demand. The product shelf lifetime also depends on various environmental factors such as the product's temperature history, humidity, transportation and handling (Ketzenberg, Bloemhof, & Gaukler, 2015). Further, increases in the time products are being stored as well as changes in the environment of the storage facilities (e.g. temperature storage and controlled atmosphere storage) may result in an increase (or a decrease) of the deterioration rate of certain commodities. This means that the identification of an appropriate ordering policy is an essential but challenging task.

Appropriate management of perishable inventories, in conjunction with modern technologies, play an important role in monitoring the condition of those goods in different stages of the supply chain. Ketzenberg et al. (2015) emphasised the importance of the value of information generated from using different systems in the decision making process in the grocery industry (that is associated with low net margins). For example, continuous automated inventory control systems are capable of tracking, recording and transmitting relevant information regarding an item as it moves through the network. The deployment of radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems, data loggers and time–temperature integrators and sensors lead to a reduction of product spoilage and economic benefits (Ketzenberg et al., 2015). The potential benefits of RFID for logistics, transportation and warehousing relate to increased supply chain visibility, which in turn increases efficiency, lowers safety stocks, and provides the same or even better customer service level (Gaukler, Seifert, & Hausman, 2007). For further details related to this technology, see Jedermann, Emond, and Lang (2008) and Wessel (2007).

This paper aims to address the quality related issues discussed above when modelling inventories for items that require 100 per cent screening. In particular, a general EOQ model for items with imperfect quality is presented; the solution to the underlying inventory system, if it exists, is shown to be a unique and global optimal. The mathematical formulation considers arbitrary functions of time that allow the decision maker to assess the consequences of a diverse range of strategies by employing a single inventory model. Previously published models in this area are shown to be special cases of our model. The behaviour of different conditions (such as using functions for varying demand, screening, defective and deterioration rates, value of information (VOI) and perishable items that are subject to deterioration while in storage) is studied using illustrative examples, and interesting insights are offered to practitioners. This paper intersects the areas of fixed and random items’ lifetimes since the assumption that each lot is subjected to a 100 per cent screening will render the (potential) random lifetime of a product deterministic. The focus of this study is on the value and use of technologies such as RFID to capture the time and temperature history (TTH) to model shelf lifetime and not the technologies themselves.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses the literature related to perishable inventories, value of information (VOI) and models that consider imperfect quality items. Our EOQ model for items with imperfect quality, the assumptions and notations of the inventory system are presented in Section 3. The solution procedures are presented in Section 4, followed, in Section 5, by illustrative examples and special cases that demonstrate the application of the theoretical results in practice. Managerial insights and concluding remarks are provided in Sections 6 and 7, respectively. Finally, Supplementary material presented in an electronic companion to this paper offers a proof of the optimality and uniqueness of our solution.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The academic literature related to inventory control for imperfect quality items is multidisciplinary in nature and, for reviewing/presentation purposes in this paper, is thematically organised around three main streams of research: (1) deterioration, perishability and shelf lifetime constraints; (2) the value of information; and (3) model formulations and related solution techniques that consider imperfect quality items.

The terms ‘deterioration’, ‘perishability’ and ‘obsolescence’ are used interchangeably in the literature and may often be perceived as ambiguous because they are linked to particular underlying assumptions regarding the physical state/fitness and behaviour of items over time (Benkherouf & Gilding, 2015; Krommyda, Skouri, Konstantaras, & Ganas, 2013; Pahl & Voß, 2010, 2014; Teunter & Flapper, 2003). In this paper, deterioration refers to the process of decay, damage or spoilage of a product, i.e. the product loses its value of characteristics and can no longer be sold/used for its original purpose (Darlington & Rahimifard, 2006; Dave, 1986; Ferguson & Koenigsberg, 2007; Pei-xin, 2007; Shah, Shah, & Shah, 2005; Wee, 1993). In contrast, an item with a fixed lifetime perishes once it exceeds its maximum shelf lifetime and then must be discarded (Ferguson & Ketzenberg, 2005; Olsson, 2009). Obsolescence incurs a partial or a total loss of value of the on hand inventory in such a way that the value for a product continuously decreases with its perceived utility (Dohi & Osaki, 1995; Elmaghraby & Keskinocak, 2003; Jain & Silver, 1994; Joglekar & Lee, 1993; Leung & Ng, 2007; Song & Zipkin, 1996; Van Delft & Vial, 1996). Pahl and Voß (2014) provided an extensive discussion on mathematical modelling and the quality of information underlying deterioration, perishability and lifetime constraints of items. They demonstrate that the combination of such aspects is important in many industries where deterioration effects significantly influence the business outcomes. Nahmias (1975, 1977) introduced the fixed lifetime case and analysed the problem of a random lifetime product managed under periodic review with stationary stochastic demand. He assumed no fixed order cost and backlogged demand and orders perishing in the same sequence that they enter stock (i.e. a First In First Out – FIFO policy). Ketzenberg, Gaukler, and Salin (2012) extended the work of Nahmias (1977) and addressed the random lifetime as a function of the product's TTH in the supply chain. They allowed for orders to perish out of sequence, to discard inventory that remains good for sale and to sell inventory that may have already perished. In a follow-up study, Ketzenberg et al. (2015) considered a case according to which unsatisfied demand is lost, products may arrive already perished and orders may not perish in sequence by focusing on determining the VOI for integrating the TTH into the order policy. As we attempt to provide a general model that takes into account many possible practical scenarios, the behaviour of these conditions will be discussed through illustrative examples. In this paper, we consider perishable and non-perishable (infinite shelf lifetime) items, which are subject to deterioration while they are in storage. As discussed above, this study intersects two areas of fixed and random lifetimes since the assumption that each lot is subjected to a 100 per cent screening will render a potential random lifetime of a product deterministic.

There is a unanimous agreement among researchers and practitioners on the benefits of information sharing that allows more timely material flows in a supply chain (Costantino, Di Gravio, Shaban, & Tronci, 2013; Kahn, 1987; Metters, 1997). Ketzenberg, Rosenzweig, Marucheck, and Metters (2007) conducted an extensive literature review of papers that: (1) address VOI in the context of inventory control, (2) provide a numerical study to explore VOI over a set of varying operating characteristics and (3) compare two or more scenarios. In addition, they developed and tested a VOI framework to help identify the determinants of VOI. Common examples are agricultural, food or chemical products that are transported over long distances in refrigerated containers, where temperature variability has a direct impact on product shelf lifetime. Moreover, temperature control is not absolute and may indeed vary for items shipped in the same container (Doyle, 1995; Koutsoumanis, Taoukis, & Nychas, 2005; Taoukis, Koutsoumanis, & Nychas, 1999).

Accurate shelf lifetime monitoring is a goal of technologies that have been developed to collect and transmit data about the state of a product. For certain items, if temperature departs from a pre-defined range, the items are spoiled and must be discarded (Zacharewicz, Deschamps, & Francois, 2011). Ketzenberg and Ferguson (2008) examined the VOI for a product with fixed lifetime in the context of a serial supply chain. They evaluated the case in which a supplier shares retailer's demand and inventory information as well as the case in which a centralised decision maker collects full information at both echelons. Recently, Ketzenberg et al. (2015) addressed the VOI for inventory replenishment decisions to demonstrate the wide fluctuations in a supply chain's TTH, the applicability and accuracy of using RFID temperature tags to capture the TTH, and the use of TTH to model shelf lifetime. White and Cheong (2012) considered the benefit of observing the quality of a perishable product in a food supply chain that is processed in multiple stages from origin to destination. At each stage, it is presumed essential to decide whether or not to inspect the quality of the product at a certain cost. In this regard, a 100 per cent screening assumption not only guarantees the isolation of defective and/or already perished items, but also classifies the order quantity based on a first-to-expire first-out (FEFO) policy, rather than a FIFO one.

The classical EOQ has been a widely accepted model for inventory control purposes due to its simple and intuitively appealing mathematical formulation. However, it is true to say that the operation of the model is based on a number of explicitly or implicitly made unrealistic mathematical assumptions that are never actually met in practice (Jaber, Nuwayhid, & Rosen, 2004; Liao, Huang, & Chung, 2013). Salameh and Jaber (2000) developed a mathematical model that permits some of the items to drop below the quality requirements, i.e. a random proportion of defective items are assumed for each lot size shipment, with a known probability distribution. The researchers assumed that each lot is subject to a 100 per cent screening, where defective items are kept in the same warehouse until the end of the screening process and then can be sold at a price lower to that of perfect quality items. Huang (2004) developed a model to determine an optimal integrated vendor–buyer inventory policy for flawed items in a just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing environment. Maddah and Jaber (2008) developed a new model that rectifies a flaw in the one presented by Salameh and Jaber (2000) using renewal theory. Jaber, Goyal, and Imran (2008) extended it by assuming that the percentage defective per lot reduces according to a learning curve. They examined empirical data from the automotive industry for several learning curve models and the S-shaped logistic learning curve (Carlson, 1973; Jordan, 1958) was found to fit well. Jaggi and Mittal (2011) investigated the effect of deterioration on a retailer's EOQ when the items are of imperfect quality. In that paper, defective items were assumed to be kept in the same warehouse until the end of the screening process. Jaggi, Goel, and Mittal (2011) and Sana (2012) presented inventory models, which account for imperfect quality items under the condition of permissible delay in payments. Moussawi-Haidar, Salameh, and Nasr (2014) extended the work of Jaggi and Mittal (2011) to allow for shortages.

In a real manufacturing environment, the defective items are not usually stored in the same warehouse where the good items are stored. As a result, the holding cost must be different for the good items and the defective ones (e.g. Paknejad, Nasri, & Affisco, 2005). With this consideration in mind, Wahab and Jaber (2010) presented the case where different holding costs for the good and defective items are assumed. They showed that if the system is subject to learning, then the lot size with the same assumed holding costs for the good and defective items is less than the one with differing holding costs. When there is no learning in the system, the lot size with differing holding costs increases with the percentage of defective items. In this section, we have cited only references that are directly relevant to this paper. For more details about the extensions of a modified EOQ model for imperfect quality items, see Khan et al. (2011).

One basic assumption of the above cited contributions is that the demand rate is assumed to be constant and known. A survey of the inventory literature reveals that there is no published work that investigates the model of Wahab and Jaber (2010) for time-varying demand and product deterioration. Product life cycle analysis suggests that a constant demand rate assumption is usually valid in the mature stage of the life cycle of the product. In the growth and/or declining stages, the demand rate can be well approximated by a linear demand function (e.g. Alamri and Balkhi, 2007). Also, one implicit assumption is that the stored items that are screened may retain the same utility indefinitely, i.e. they do not lose their value as time goes on. In fact, the variation of demand and/or product deterioration with time (or due to any other factors) is a quite natural phenomenon.

This paper presents a general EOQ model for items with imperfect quality under varying demand, defective items, a screening process and deterioration rates for an infinite planning horizon. Consequently, the generality of the model goes beyond academic interests to enable inventory managers to establish the optimum order quantities that minimise the total system cost. In the model, each lot is subject to a 100 per cent screening where items that are not conforming to certain quality standards are stored in a different warehouse. Therefore, different holding costs for the good and defective items are considered in the mathematical model. Items deteriorate while they are in storage, with demand, screening and deterioration rates being arbitrary functions of time. The percentage of defective items per lot reduces according to a learning curve. After a 100 per cent screening, imperfect quality items may be sold at a discounted price as a single batch at the end of the screening process or incur a disposal penalty charge. Moreover, a general step-by-step solution procedure is provided for continuous intra-cycle periodic review applications.

The mathematical model is developed under the following assumptions and notations:

                           
                              1.
                              A single item is held in stock.

The lead-time is negligible and no capacity restrictions are assumed, i.e. any replenishment ordered at the beginning of a cycle arrives just prior to the end of that same cycle.

The demand, screening and deterioration rates are arbitrary functions of time denoted by D(t),  x(t)  and  δ(t) respectively. The percentage defective per lot reduces according to a learning curve denoted by pj
                                 , where j is the cycle index.

                         units have been screened and yj
                         units have been depleted, which is the summation of demand and deterioration. During this phase, items not conforming to certain quality standards are stored in a different warehouse.

The variation in the inventory level during the first and second phase (please refer to Fig. 1
                        ) and the variation in the inventory level for the defective items (shaded area) is given by (1), (3) and (4) respectively.

                                    .
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

It can be noted from Eq. (12), that 
                           
                              
                                 T
                                 
                                    1
                                    j
                                 
                              
                              =
                              0
                              ⇒
                              
                                 T
                                 
                                    2
                                    j
                                 
                              
                              =
                              0
                           
                         and T
                        1j
                         > 0⇒T
                        1j
                         < T
                        2j
                        . Thus Eq. (12) implies constraint (11). Consequently, if we temporarily ignore the monotony constraint (11) and call the resulting problem as (m
                        1) then (11) does satisfy any solution of (m
                        1). Hence (m) and (m
                        1) are equivalent. Moreover, T
                        1j
                         > 0⇒ RHS of (6) > 0, i.e. Eq. (12) guarantees that the number of good items is at least equal to the demand during the first phase.

First, we note from (2) that T
                     1j
                      can be determined as a function of Qj
                     , say

                        
                           (13)
                           
                              
                                 
                                    T
                                    
                                       1
                                       j
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 
                                    f
                                    
                                       1
                                       j
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    
                                       Q
                                       j
                                    
                                    )
                                 
                                 .
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  

Taking also into account Eq. (12) we find that T
                     2j
                      can be determined as a function of T
                     1j
                     , and thus of Qj
                     , say

                        
                           (14)
                           
                              
                                 
                                    T
                                    
                                       2
                                       j
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 
                                    f
                                    
                                       2
                                       j
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    
                                       Q
                                       j
                                    
                                    )
                                 
                                 .
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  

Thus, if we substitute (12)–(14) in (9) then problem (m) will be converted to the following unconstrained problem with the variable Qj
                      (which we shall call problem (m
                     2)).

In this section we present a number of examples and special cases to illustrate the efficiency of our mathematical model and solution procedures. First we consider scenarios with varying demand, screening, defective and deterioration rates. Then we present special cases for intra-cycle periodic review, perishable products and renewal theory.

In practice, the demand for products relies heavily on price (when price elasticity holds), time and quality (Karmarkar & Pitbladdo, 1997). In addition, increasing (decreasing) demand functions over time with quadratic, linear, exponential and stock-dependent trends is a natural phenomenon (Alamri, 2011; Benkherouf, Konstantina, & Konstantaras, 2013; Datta, Paul, & Pal, 1998; Hariga & Benkherouf, 1994; Murdeshwar, 1988). For example, essential commodities and seasonal products may follow steadily increasing quadratic or linear demand functions over time (Mandal & Maiti, 2000). On the other hand, exponentially increasing demand applies to products such as new spare parts, new electronic chips and seasonal goods in which the demand rate is likely to increase very fast with time (Sana, 2010). As such, the mathematical formulation presented in this paper considers arbitrary functions of time, which allows the decision maker to assess the consequences of a diverse range of strategies by employing a single inventory model. It is worth noting that the dominant form of a learning curve implemented by researchers and practitioners alike is either an S-shaped (Carlson, 1973; Jordan, 1958), or a power one as suggested by Wright (1936); please refer to Jaber (2006) for discussion on this issue.

The parameter “α”, represents the rate of change in the demand. The case of 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0
                           
                         reflects a constant demand rate, when then 
                           
                              D
                              (
                              t
                              )
                              =
                              r
                              
                              ∀
                              
                              t
                              ≥
                              0
                           
                        . A similar behaviour is observed for the effect of “a”, the rate of change in the screening rate. Note that δ(t) is an increasing function of time. The case of 
                           
                              β
                              =
                              0
                           
                         reflects a constant deterioration rate and 
                           
                              l
                              =
                              0
                           
                         corresponds to the case associated with no deterioration. The percentage defective per lot reduces according to an S-shaped logistic learning curve (Carlson, 1973; Jordan, 1958), where
 τ and  π are model parameters, γ is the learning exponent and j is the cycle index. The case 
                           
                              γ
                              =
                              0
                           
                         applies to a constant percentage of defective items per lot.

The problem (m
                        2) has been coded in MATLAB for the above demand, screening, defective and deterioration rates and solutions were obtained using Eq. (21) for a wide range of the control parameter values. Here, we adopt the values considered in the study by Wahab and Jaber (2010), that are presented in Table 1
                         below.

                         or incur a disposal penalty charge. The tabulated results indicate that all optimal quantities decrease as learning increases except for the amount of deteriorated items that incur a minor increase that can be justified by the slight increase in the cycle length (Table 2). Fig. 2
                         depicts the effect of each additional model parameter on the EOQ and Fig. 3
                         compares the case of having the same holding costs for the good and defective items with that of differing holding costs.

The results presented in Table 3
                         summarise the sensitivity analysis of the optimal order quantity, total minimum cost per unit time and total minimum cost per cycle with respect to all model parameters. The first row represents the original values of the proposed model and the last one yields the values of the EOQ model. As can be seen from the tabulated results the effect of α, significantly influences the optimal order quantity and the total minimum cost per year. Moreover, this effect holds true for the case in which the deterioration rate is assumed to be of a fixed value as well as for the case associated with no deterioration. A comparison between the results obtained in Tables 2 and 3 reveals that the reduction of the optimal order quantity does not imply that the total minimum cost per year decreases; in fact it may increase.

                        . Wright's learning curve leads to smaller quantities in the incipient phase. However, in practice, improvement is slow in this short phase making the S-shaped learning curve an appropriate model to use (Dar-El, 2000).

As illustrated above, the dis-location of good and defective items together with other forms of varying demand, screening, defective and deterioration rates may be incorporated to allow managers to assess the consequences of a diverse range of strategies. The result obtained using the S-shaped learning curve coincides with the behaviour observed in many industrial situations. The proposed model is not limited to the above contributions; its formulation may trigger other applications as shown in Section 5.2 below.

It is often desirable to adjust input parameters to be responsive to a new policy due to acquired new knowledge. Such adjustment may occur due to the dynamic nature of demand, screening and deterioration rates or as a result of price fluctuations. Therefore, the periodic review is also beneficial for the purpose of illustrating what happens if the decision maker deviates from the optimal solution to assess the consequences of such a deviation. In this section, we present a step-by-step solution procedure to determine the optimal policy for intra-cycle periodic review applications.

In real life settings, a large number of perishable items encounter spoilage and deterioration that occur out of sequence. This can be attributed to random lifetimes that are associated with the time elapsing for the items to flow through the supply chain. Packaged foods, seafood, fruit, baked goods, milk, cheese, processed meet, pharmaceutical and blood products, etc. would be examples of such items (Lashgari, Taleizadeh, & Sana, 2016). To show that our model can be easily responsive to manage such perishable items, consider the amount ordered

The special case of shelf lifetime equal to zero refers to newly replenished items that have arrived already perished or items not satisfying certain quality standards (defective items). It is worth noting here that the assumption that each lot is subject to a 100 per cent screening underpins such classification, where

                            seems realistic since all items are tracked.

Finally, let us assume that VOI such as TTH of an item as it moves through a supply chain is transferable within that supply chain. In this case, the remaining shelf lifetime can be readily calculated. For example, Bremner (1984) and Ronsivalli and Charm (1975) developed a shelf lifetime model for fresh fish that links the spoilage rate to a given temperature. Let °C
                              y
                             and  ty
                            denote respectively, the temperature and time elapsed of an item in a supply chain entity y, then the remaining shelf lifetime is given by

If this VOI is available to the next supply chain entity x, then a significant reduction in the cost per cycle can be achieved (Ketzenberg et al., 2015). In our model, the VOI can be perceived at external and/or internal domains of coordination. At the domain of external coordination, this model addresses the VOI to capture a safe remaining shelf lifetime and acknowledges the potential impact of transporting and handling of a product at both external and internal levels. Hence, the reflection of the VOI can result in a reduction of the percentage of imperfect items that may arrive already perished and/or defective, i.e.

In this paper, we have introduced the assumption that defective items are stored in a different warehouse. This assumption relaxes the behaviour of the inventory level that is presented by Jaggi and Mittal (2011) and Moussawi-Haidar et al. (2014). This is because not every defective item can be sold at a salvage price; rather defective items may encounter a disposal cost. For comparison purposes, Table 5
                            presents the input parameters of the example used by Jaggi and Mittal (2011). Their model leads to

In this section we emphasise the financial implications and managerial aspects of our work and we offer a number of cases to illustrate the efficiency of our mathematical model.

The general model developed in this paper reflects a number of practical concerns with regards to product quality related issues and may assist operations managers to respond to many real world challenges/opportunities for inventory improvements. Those opportunities include poor supplier service levels (imperfect items received from suppliers), potential dis-location of good and defective items (different warehouses for the good and defective items), tracking the quality of perishable products in a supply chain and transfer of knowledge from one inventory cycle to another. Furthermore, it provides a general procedure for continuous intra-cycle periodic reviews so as to adjust and control flows of raw materials, component parts and finished goods to maintain sustainable competitive advantage. This formulation could also potentially be of some value to software manufactures since it forms a generalised model inclusive of many existing ones.

The generic nature of the model explores various coordination mechanisms that may improve inventory management as shown below.

It is often the case that input parameters are randomly distributed. The versatile nature of our model accommodates such randomness. Let Dj

If q is assumed to be a random variable with known mean and variance, then the yield at the supplier site would be represented by a random draw from a quality distribution. If this is the case, then the yield is simultaneously influenced by internal and external randomness.

There is no doubt that many products require inspection, so as to guarantee an appropriate service to the customers. In addition, such inspection is essential to update the Information System records with good items that are actually available in stock in order to satisfy demand. Further, when raw materials are required in a production setting, their ordering policy depends on the production batch size of the products that require such raw materials. Therefore, the presence of defective items in raw materials has a direct impact on the production batch size. Moreover, there exists a plethora of factors that may force supply chain management to initiate both an inspection process and periodic review to enhance productivity, improve profitability, meet total product demand and avoid the tarnished reputation associated with product recalls (Klassen & Vereecke, 2012). A 100 per cent inspection may eliminate the return service cost caused by defective items. It can be used in real-life settings where the impact of letting through defective items could be severe. Different types of inspection can occur including seal inspection, outer case label inspection or damaged carton inspection. The service cost may include goodwill cost, transportation cost, and re-processing cost, etc. and that may affect all supply chain members. The assumption that each lot undergoes a 100 per cent inspection implicitly applies to any smaller amount of the lot. For example, let 
                           ϵ
                         be a fraction of the amount ordered representing a random sample size drawn from the batch. It is clear that 
                           
                              ϵ
                              x
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                         can also be implemented in the model.

If safety issues exist in keeping defective items in store, then the model formulation allows for an immediate disposal of defective items, i.e.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, a general Economic Order Quantity model for items with imperfect quality was presented. Each lot is subjected to a 100 per cent screening and items not conforming to certain quality standards are stored in a separate facility with different holding costs of the good and defective items being considered. The obtained numerical results reflect the learning effects incorporated in the proposed model. The presence of product deterioration and varying demand and screening rates significantly impact on the optimal order quantity.

The paper presents illustrative examples and special cases to support application of the model and solution procedures in different realistic situations. The proposed solution procedure to determine the optimal policy for continuous intra-cycle periodic review takes into account different inventory fluctuations during the planning horizon. We observe the effect of changing all model parameters and find that a reduction in the optimal order size does not necessarily lead to a lower total minimum cost per unit time.

This study intersects the areas of fixed and random lifetimes of perishable products, where unsatisfied demand may or may not be lost, products may arrive already perished, and orders may not perish in sequence. The accuracy of RFID temperature tags that capture the TTH, and the use of that TTH data are adopted to model a shelf lifetime of an item.

The generality of our model stems from the fact that the demand, screening and product deterioration rates are arbitrary functions of time. The proposed model unifies and extends the academic literature related to imperfect quality items, which is quite diverse in nature. Practical examples that are published in the literature for generalised models are used to demonstrate that the solution quality is the same as in published sources or in some cases produces better results, i.e. the validity and realistic qualities of the general model are ascertained. The versatile nature of our model and the fact that it may accommodate many real world concerns has been emphasised, where the results obtained are compatible with the behaviour observed in many real-life settings. A mathematical proof is presented, which shows that the solution to the underlying inventory system, if it exists, is unique and global optimal. Coordination mechanisms that may affect the supplier and the retailer are also explored to improve inventory management at both echelons. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be the first time that such a general EOQ model is formulated, investigated, and numerically verified.

Based on the findings of this paper, several interesting extensions are possible such as considering that the screening rate follows learning and forgetting curves with allowed shortages and the risk of failure during screening (Type I and Type II errors). Also, it seems plausible to assess the formulation of a two warehouse system (due to the capacity limitations of the owned warehouse), where a comparison between Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) dispatching policies that are governed by a fixed shelf life time may be implemented. In addition, considering different supplier trade credit practices such as a permissible delay in payment and formulation of an EPQ model in which product quality levels depend on an instantaneous cost of investing in product innovation are interesting lines of further inquiry in this area. All of the above suggested next steps of research can be addressed for finite or infinite planning horizons.
