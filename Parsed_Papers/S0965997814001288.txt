                  As the main safety facility on the highway, a guardrail system is very essential for the highway traffics safety. In this paper, the Finite Element (FE) models of the vehicle and the corrugated beam guardrail system were created. Two types of widely used corrugated beam semi-rigid guardrails were simulated, which were the W-beam guardrail and the Thrie-beam guardrail. The collision between the corrugated beam guardrail systems and the vehicle body was analyzed. In the collision process, the snagging effect of the post to the vehicle body was also concerned. Under the considerations of the collision safety and the mechanism of the snagging effect, the multiobjective optimization problem was defined with dimensional sizes of guardrails to be the design variables. And the radial basis function (RBF) was applied to construct the regression models of the analytical objective, which increased the accuracy of fitting. The Pareto set and the optimal solution were obtained. After the optimization design, the W-beam guardrail and Thrie-beam guardrail were both greatly improved, that increased the collision safety between the corrugated beam guardrail and the vehicle body. This kind of analytical method can also be used for the crashworthiness optimization between any other cars and guardrails.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

As we know, traffic accidents that happened on the highway caused huge economic losses and casualties every year. The guardrail is a main traffic safety facility on the highway and it is closely related to the road traffic safety. For one thing, it can absorb part of the impact energy to reduce the peak acceleration of the crash; for another, it can redirect impacting errant vehicles [1]. Therefore, it is greatly significant to optimize the guardrail system under the collision safety consideration.

In some countries, the highway facility was developed very early. At the beginning of the development of the facility, the collision safety had not been considered during the design process of a guardrail system. The United States is the pioneer to study the guardrails. Since 1920, US has established the large-scale real car crash test sites in many states, has accumulated a series of information and experimental data, and has developed a series of norms and standards based on the relevant theoretical analysis and experimental studies [2]. American Road Federation, related universities, research institutions and government departments conducted the “National Cooperative Highway Research Program”, which listed the level, evaluation indexes and test procedures of the guardrails [3]. “Guide for Selecting, Locating and Designing for Traffic Barriers” and the second edition of “Roadside Design Guide” were also published by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), which has become the standardized documents for the design of the highway guardrails in the United States [4]. In Japan, studies about guardrails were commenced in 1950s. And then, outlines of guardrails clearly defined the applications range, performance requirements, structural design, installation and construction of the guardrails [5]. Britain, Italy and other countries carried out relevant works later. Nowadays, the guardrail systems have been widely applied in many countries [6]. In China, research institute of highway ministry of communications has promulgated “Thrie-beam Guardrail for Highway” and “The Evaluation Specification for Highway Safety Barrier” [7] under the collision safety.

In addition, Elvik et al. [8] studied the effectiveness of the rigid and semi-rigid guardrails and other road safety facilities so as to improve the road safety based on the actual statistical data, and then, gave some suggestions on how to modify these safety facilities. Ray et al. [9] studied the connection method between the panels of W-beam guardrail so as to reduce the separation of the guardrail parts in the collision process. Vesenjak and Ren [10] discussed the various blockout structures of the beam guardrails, such as a hexagonal shape, U shape, D shape and Z shape based on simulations, and found that the hexagonal blockout had obvious advantages in energy absorption. Borovinšk et al. [11] carried out a comparative study on three derivative structures of the beam guardrails, and found that the beam guardrail had a better guiding performance when adding a steel bar to the post at the bottom of the blockout. Reid and Faller et al. [12,13] made the conclusion that the height of a guardrail greatly influenced its collision safety based on a lot of research results. Huang et al. [14] studied the bolted performance between the posts and panels of the beam guardrail and the friction coefficient between the vehicle and guardrail. Du et al. [15] used scale model test method to analyze the response characteristics and optimized the structure of the beam guardrail. Lei [16] put forward that the semi-rigid guardrail could be studied as a coupling system together with the vehicle. Ibitoye et al. [17] described a three-dimensional computer simulation of the kinematics impact of motorcycle and dummy rider with W-beam guardrail inclined at angles of 45° and 90° toward the initial direction of traveling. Zhang and Hu [18] discussed the importance of the soil behavior during a car-guardrail impact event and raised an effective method to investigate the soil behavior during impact.

In conclusion, some results of the beam guardrail system study have been obtained. However, the researches on the optimization design of beam guardrail usually rely on the design experience of the researchers and the data of the real car crash test. There is seldom a systematical optimization method which is widely used to optimize the beam guardrail system. This paper aims to optimize the W-beam and Thrie-beam guardrails by using the RBF surrogate model under the collision safety consideration between the vehicle and the corrugated beam guardrail system.

RBF surrogate model was utilized to establish the regression model of the analytical objectives in the optimization process of the corrugated beam guardrail system. RBF [19–21] is a series of functions on independent variables between the target point and design sampling points in the Euclidean distance. It is actually a linear combination of some basis functions. For giving a RBF, a set of discrete design sampling points are needed and some of them are selected to be the interpolation center.

Generally speaking, a single-objective optimization problem gives rise to a single optimal solution, and a multiobjective optimization problem can generate a set of optimal solutions (largely known as Pareto optimal solutions set) [29]. For all the objective functions, the different solutions in Pareto set are not comparable, that is to say, in Pareto space, the analytical objectives often compete with each other very much.

In this paper, we used Finite Element (FE) analysis method to simulate the crash process between the car and W-beam guardrail. The FE model of car utilized in this paper is the model of Ford Taurus provided by National Highway Transportation and Safety Association (NHTSA) and downloaded from the public domain at: www.ncac.gwu.edu/archives/model/index.html 
                        [30]. Penetrations and element quality of front and left components have been checked and ameliorated for an impact loading condition [31,32]. The total mass of the car body is 1.627 ton and the element number of the FE model is 1054750. The FE model is established and shown in Fig. 1
                        .

The FE model of Ford Taurus has been verified by National Crash Analysis Center [30]. In Ref. [33], it was pointed out that the integrated Ford Taurus model can be used for all impact scenarios. Hou et al. [24] used the FE model of Ford Taurus to establish the collision model between car and the NJ shaped guardrail, and optimized NJ shaped guardrail. Therefore, we used this FE model of Ford Taurus to set up the collision model between car and the corrugated beam guardrails.

According to the crash rating, guardrails can be divided into eight levels. Roadside has five levels which are A, B, SA, SB, SS. Median has three levels which consist of Am, SAm, SBm [34]. Guardrail levels and the corresponding experimental condition of collision were listed in Table 1
                        .

W-beam guardrail system consists of the panels, posts, blockouts and soil foundations. The models of these parts are simulated based on “Corrugated Sheet Steel Beams for Guardrail” [35].

The panels firstly contact the car in a collision. During the collision, the panels absorb part of the collision energy through extensional deformation of its own corrugation. At the same time, they can transmit the impact force to the posts and soil foundations via the bolts and blockouts, and redirect the errant vehicles.

The crashworthiness grade of W-beam guardrail panel is Am. Cross-sectional shapes and dimensions of the panels are shown in Fig. 2
                           (a). The geometric dimensions in Fig. 2(a) were listed in Table 2
                           . The FE model of the W-beam panel was created by using CATIA and HYPERMESH as shown in Fig. 2(b).

The panel materials is the ordinary carbon steel named Q235. The thickness of the W-beam panel model is 3mm. Four-node shell elements was used to simulate the panels. The isotropic elastic–plastic material was adopted in the panel model. And the material properties were shown in Table 3
                           .

In the collision between the car and the W-beam guardrail, the post mainly bears the bending moment and plays a very important role in supporting the whole structure. The cylindrical posts were utilized in this paper. The outer diameter, the thickness and the height of the cylindrical posts are 114mm, 4.5mm and 1850mm, respectively. The posts have a height of 750mm above the ground, and the remaining part of 1100mm was buried in the soil foundation as shown in Fig. 3
                           (a). In order to reduce the computation time and improve the computation efficiency, 10 posts were established in the model and the distance between two posts is 4000mm. The FE model of the post was shown in Fig. 3(b).

The blockouts are the load-bearing parts between the W-beam panels and the posts. They are suitable for the road sections where the constitution of the vehicles is complex in the traffic flow. The main functions of the blockouts are:
                              
                                 (a)
                                 They can absorb part of the collision energy via its deformation, which will reduce the peak acceleration and the impact force of the vehicle body, lower the extent of damage and increase the occupant safety.

They are installed between the panels and the posts, which will leave the panels hanging from the posts for a distance. This can largely reduce the possibility of snagging between the post and the vehicle body when a collision occurs.

They can transmit the impact force of the panels to the posts dispersedly, which will make the force of the panels more evenly, make the guardrail structure stronger, and increase the guiding role of guardrail to make sure the vehicle steering more smoothly.

A type of blockout was selected to match the cylindrical posts. It was a hexagonal structure as shown in Fig. 4
                           (a). The FE model of this type of blockout was shown in Fig. 4(b).

The posts should be mounted in the firm soil foundations. Therefore, in the collision process, the soil foundations play a constraint role on the posts so as to make the guide function of the guardrail act. However, they also restrict the extrusion and deformation of the posts. To make the simulation of crash closer to the actual situation, the soil foundation model was constructed in the model of the W-beam guardrail system. The cylindrical soil foundations were modeled with the inner diameter of 57.5mm, outer diameter of 800mm and height of 2000mm as shown in Fig. 5
                           (a).

The Thrie-beam semi-rigid guardrail includes the panels, square tube posts, blockouts and soil foundation, etc.

The crashworthiness grade of Thrie-beam guardrail panel is SBm. The cross-sectional shapes and dimensions of panels were shown in Fig. 6
                           (a). The geometric dimensions were also listed in Table 4
                           . The FE model of the Thrie-beam panel was created by using CATIA and HYPERMESH as shown in Fig. 6(b).

Based on design guidelines for Highway traffic Safety Facilities, the dimension of square tube posts is 130mm×130mm with the thickness of 4.5mm. The SBm grade Thrie-beam guardrail matching post height is 2600mm, respectively. The post has a height of 950mm above the ground, and the remaining part of 1650mm was buried in the soil foundations, shown in Fig. 7
                           (a). In order to reduce the computational cost and to improve the computational efficiency, 10 posts were constructed in the model and the distance between posts is 2000mm. The FE model of the post was shown in Fig. 7(b).

The BFI type blockout was selected to match the square tube posts. It is a structure with a standard size, as shown in Fig. 8
                           (a). The FE model of blockout was shown in Fig. 8(b).

The cylindrical soil foundation was modeled with the inner square hole with the size of 131mm×131mm, outer diameter of 800mm and height of 2000mm, as shown in Fig. 5(b).

The spotweld elements in Hypermesh were used to simulate the bolt connections among the panels, blockouts and posts. The failure stress was firstly set for the spotweld element in Hypermesh. When the stress reaches a critical failure value, the element failure occurs, which will make panels, posts and blockouts getting out of each other. The failure criteria [36] of the spotweld elements can be expressed as:

After completing the models of the various components, combine them together and import the car model, and then we can get the collision model between the car and the beam.

In this paper, there are some simulation conditions for the collision process between the car and the corrugated beam guardrail, which are:
                        
                           (a)
                           The friction effect should be completely considered between the car and the guardrail, as well as between the car and the ground. The influence of the air resistance was not considered.

The collision between the car and the guardrail end terminal was not considered.

The emergency operations was not considered, which was conducted by the driver in an expected collision, such as braking, steering.

In addition, the guardrail panels at the middle position of two adjacent posts are weaker and easier to generate a large deformation, because they are fare away from the supports. Therefore, this position was selected to be the initial collision position. The car-guardrail collision duration was set to be 0.4s. And the initial impacting velocity and angle between the car and guardrail were set to be 100km/h and 20°, respectively. The explicit FE Analysis (FEA) software LS-DYNA was used to calculate the contact-impact problem, which almost took 31h by using 8 processors of UNIX operating system for one running.

The simulation for collision between the car and the initial and optimal W-beam guardrail was shown in Fig. 9
                           , before and after optimization design. From Fig. 9(a), it can be seen that there is a snagging effect on the car wheel coming from the post when t
                           =100ms. And, the car couldn’t overcome the snagging through its own deformation. At t
                           =170ms or so, the calculation terminated due to a serious distortion of the wheel. By this time, the right front door, front bumper and the nearby parts have been deformed seriously. And the front windshield has been damaged. For these situations, it can be expected that the car wheel may tear from the car body due to the snagging effect on the car wheel coming from the post. This makes it difficult to protect the occupant in such an expected collision between care and the guardrail.

During the collision process, the centroidal resultant acceleration of the car body is an important indicator to measure the occupant safety. Generally, the smaller the acceleration is, the slighter the severity of injuries is. For the collision between the car and the initial W-beam guardrail system, the peak value of centroidal acceleration of the car body is Accel
                           =54.35g (g
                           =9.8m/s2) as shown in Fig. 10
                           , which is too large to increase the safety of the occupant. This is due to the occurrence of snagging effect.

The exit angle is the angle between the centerline of the car and guardrail when the car leaves the guardrail after the collision. It is an indicator to evaluate the car safety performance. If the exit angle is too large, the accident car is possible to rush into the adjacent lane and to cause the secondary collision with the normal running car on the lane, which will result in a much more serious accident. When the exit angle is less than 60% of the initial impacting angle, then the possibility of resulting in the secondary accident is relatively reduced. The initial impacting angle is 20°, so the exit angle should not exceed 12°. Because of the snagging effect and termination of the calculation, the exit angle of the car after crashing the W-beam guardrail was very difficult to be obtained.

The lateral displacement of the guardrail is the main indicator to evaluate the crashworthiness of the guardrail. The car may do not steer smoothly, even may vault over the guardrail if the maximum value of the lateral displacement is large. The evaluation specification [7] provides that the maximum lateral displacement of the W-beam guardrail should be less than 1000mm, while the Thrie-beam guardrail should be less than 750mm.


                           Fig. 11
                            is the lateral displacement curve of the original corrugated beam guardrail after simulating the collision. It is shown that the maximum lateral displacement of the W-beam guardrail is 1028mm, exceeding 1000mm. The big lateral displacement makes the posts bend seriously to the ground, resulting in the occurrence of the snagging effect and hindering the driving and steering of the car.

The collision simulation results between the car and W-beam guardrail were listed in Table 5
                           . Among the guardrail performance evaluation indexes, the peak centroidal resultant acceleration of the car body and the maximum lateral displacement of the W-beam guardrail did not meet the collision requirements. And the snagging effect coming from the post on the car wheel made the car deform seriously. Therefore, the overall performance of the W-beam guardrail couldn’t meet the requirements, and the W-beam guardrail system need to be optimized and improved.

From the above analyses, it is known that there is a snagging effect coming from the post on the car wheel in the collision process, which make the peak centroidal acceleration of the car body beyond the normal level and seriously damage to the car and occupant.

The occurrence of a snagging effect has a great relationship with the deformation process of the post. The deformation process of the post can be divided into two stages, namely lateral displacement and the bending to the ground. In Fig. 12
                           (a)–(c) showed the lateral displacement process, (d) and (e) were the bending process. In the early collision, the posts was subjected to the force transmitted from the W-beam panel, and generated the lateral displacement in the soil foundations. At this time, the car wheel has no contact with the post, and the snagging effect did not occur at this stage. When the car continued to travel and approach the post, the post bent to the ground. If the car wheel does not collide with the post when the car runs through the location of the post, the guardrail will guide the car to steer. If the car wheel collides with the post, the snagging effect will be produced. Then the driving condition of the car will become unstable, thereby affecting the occupant safety.

The preceding analyses of the simulation results show that the main problem of W-beam guardrail system is wheel snagging coming from the posts [37]. Therefore, the snagging effect should be avoided and the protection performance should be improved during the optimization process for the W-beam guardrail system.

So far, some guardrail researchers have avoided the snagging effect by changing the cross-sectional shapes and material property of the blockout. Changing the material property, for example, can increase its stiffness and reduce the deformation, to a certain extent, so that lowering the snagging influence. But it also makes the energy-absorbing weaken. So changing the parameters of the blockout does not improve the guardrail performance fundamentally [2].

Generally, the methods to improve the guardrail performance increase the intensity of the post and the W-beam panel. Decreasing the distance between two posts can increase the intensity of the post. For the W-beam panel, increasing its intensity can avoid the avulsion of it, mitigating the damage of the guardrail system, as well as reducing the maximum lateral displacement of the panel, lowering the occurrence probability of snagging effect. Increasing the number of the beam and changing the material property of the panel can improve the intensity of the W-beam panel.

Therefore, the distance between any two posts and the thickness of the panel were selected to be the design variables for optimizing the W-beam guardrail system. The centroidal resultant acceleration of the car body and the lateral displacement of the W-beam guardrail panel were selected to be the objective functions to define the multiobjective optimization problem of improving the collision safety between the car and the guardrail. The linear weighted average method [38,39] was used to transform the multiobjective optimization problem into a single-objective optimization problem. The general optimization problem after transforming can be expressed as:

After defining the optimization problem, the next step is to establish the approximation models of the objective functions. RBF-MQ is adopted for the construction of the regression models.

The optimal Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS) technique [40] is utilized to select 21 design sampling points for two design variables, listed in Table 5. Simulations were made on design sampling points and the FEA results were listed in Table 6
                           .

From the table, it can be known that there are 3 design sampling points where the snagging effect occurred during the simulation. The 3 design sampling points can be considered to be invalid. Then the simulation results at the remaining 18 design sampling points were used to construct RBF-MQ approximation models.

The approximation models of Accel and D were obtained and shown in Appendix Eqs. (A.1) and (A.2).

For checking the fitness of RBF-MQ models, 8 predicted design sampling points were selected additionally. Simulations were made at these predicted sampling points so as to get the FEA values of two objective functions. The RBF-MQ approximate values could be obtained via Eqs. (A.1) and (A.2). These values and RE at 8 predicted sampling points were given in Table 7
                           .

The above table shows that the range of RE for the centroidal resultant acceleration of car body is −4.40%⩽RE⩽3.84%, RAAE and RMAE are 4.40% and 2.97%. And the RE range, RAAE and RMAE for the lateral displacement of W-beam guardrail are −3.02%⩽RE⩽4.62%, 2.43% and 4.62%, respectively. Thus, the accuracy of two objective function approximation models can be accepted [22].

The two single-objective optimization problems expressed in Eq. (A.1) and Eq. (A.2) were solved to get the normalized values Accel∗
                           
                           =18.71g and D∗
                           
                           =673.41mm by applying the multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) [31]. Then, For Eq. (13), a final optimal point can be obtained after determining the values of two weighting factors w
                           1 and w
                           2. 11 group combinations of w
                           1 and w
                           2 are selected. And the Pareto-optimal set is given in Table 8
                           .

The weighting factors are w
                           1
                           =
                           w
                           2
                           =0.5 in the sixth group of Pareto-optimal set, that is, the distance between any two posts and the thickness of the panel are considered to be equally important. This group is selected to be modeled and conducted the crash simulation.


                           Fig. 9(b) is the collision process of the car with optimal W-beam guardrail. It can be seen that the turning of the car is relatively stable, and there no the snagging effect in the entire collision process. After the collision, the front fender and bumper of car body have slight deformation and the front windshield has some damage. Compared with initial W-beam guardrail, the damage extent of the car is relatively lighter for the optimal one.

After simulation, the centroidal resultant acceleration of the car body is Accel
                           =19.02g, indicating that the occupant is safer. And the RE with RBF-MQ approximate value 18.75g is −1.42%, within the range of the acceleration RBF-MQ model. The centroidal resultant acceleration curve is shown in Fig. 13
                           (a).

The exit angle of the car during the collision between the car and the optimal W-beam guardrail was given in Fig. 14
                           . With the collision, the driving angle of the car gradually decreases firstly. At t
                           =180ms or so, the angle between the car and the guardrail is close to zero, that is, the centerline of car is almost parallel to the guardrail. After that, the angle gradually increases. Until t
                           =340ms, the collision between the car and guardrail is over and the exit angle of the car is 9.3°, less than 60% of the initial collision angle. Thus, the guidance performance of the optimal guardrail has been greatly improved.

The lateral displacement of the optimal W-beam guardrail panel is given in Fig. 15
                           . It can be seen that with the collision, the lateral displacement gradually increases firstly, and reaches the maximum 776.69mm at t
                           =230ms, less than 1000mm. Then the lateral displacement gradually decreases due to the influence of the adjacent panel until t
                           =340ms when the collision is over. After that, the lateral displacement continues to decrease for the recovery of the elastic deformation of the panels; At t
                           =400ms, there is no change for the lateral displacement basically. The RE between the FEA maximum the lateral displacement of 776.69mm and the RBF-MQ approximate maximum 801.91mm shown in Table 6 is −3.25%, within the RE range of RBF-MQ approximate model of the lateral displacement.

The collision simulation results between the car and the optimal W-beam guardrail were listed in Table 9
                           . It can be known that for the optimal W-beam guardrail, there is no snagging effect and the damage extent of the car is relatively slight. The centroidal resultant acceleration of the car body drastically reduces, making the occupant safer. The exit angle of the car is less than 60% of the initial collision angle. The lateral displacement of the optimal W-beam guardrail panel significantly reduces. Therefore, the overall performance of optimal W-beam guardrail has a great improvement, satisfying the collision requirements.

The collision simulation of the car and Thrie-beam guardrail is shown in Fig. 16
                           (a). From the figure, it can be seen that there is snagging effect of the post to the car wheel when t
                           =110ms. The car can overcome the snagging by its deformation of cars. At t
                           =180ms or so, there is snagging effect of the post to the car body .However, the car could not overcome the snagging. At t
                           =240ms or so, the calculation terminates due to a serious distortion of the car body. By this time, the right front door, front bumper of the car and the front cover have been deform seriously. And the front windshield has been dropped. According to these situations, it can be expected that the car body parts may tear from the car body due to the snagging of the rail post to the car, making it difficult to protect the occupant in the following collision.

The peak value of centroidal acceleration of the car body is Accel
                           =49.14g (g
                           =9.8m/s2) that is too big to endanger the safety of the occupant because of the occurrence of snagging effect of the car body. The lateral displacement curve of the Thrie-beam guardrail after simulating the collision is given in Fig. 11. It is shown that the maximum lateral displacement of the Thrie-beam guardrail is 778mm, exceeding 750mm.

The collision simulation results of the car and the Thrie-beam guardrail were listed in Table 10
                           . Among the guardrail performance evaluation indexes, the peak centroidal resultant acceleration of the car body and the maximum lateral displacement of the Thrie-beam guardrail do not meet the collision requirements. And the snagging effect of the post to the car wheel makes the car deform seriously. Therefore, the overall performance of the Thrie-beam guardrail cannot meet the requirements, and the Thrie-beam guardrail system should be optimized and improved.

The optimization problem of Thrie-beam guardrail can be expressed as:

After defining the optimization problem, the next step is to establish a approximation model. RBF-MQ is adopted for the optimization of Thrie-beam guardrail. In order to ensure the approximation model is sufficiently accurate, the optimal Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS) technique is utilized to select 20 design sampling points for two design variables, listed in Table 11
                           . These sampling points are simulated and the FE analysis (FEA) results are shown in this table too.

The approximation models of Accel and D can be obtained and shown in Appendix Eqs. (A.3) and (A.4).

For checking the fitness of RBF-MQ model, 6 predicted sampling points are selected additionally. Simulating these predicted sampling points to get the FEA values of two objective functions. These values and REs at 6 predicted sampling points were given in Table 12
                           .

The above table shows that the range of REs for the centroidal resultant acceleration of car body is −1.98%⩽RE⩽4.53%, RAAE and RMAE are 2.41% and 4.53%, respectively. And the RE range, RAAE and RMAE for the lateral displacement of Thrie-beam guardrail panel are −0.82%⩽RE⩽2.67%, 1.26% and2.67%. Thus, the accuracy of two objective function approximation model can be accept.

The two single-objective optimization problem expressed in Eqs. (18) and (17) are solved to get the normalized values Accel
                           ∗
                           =13.48g and D

                           =389.97mm by applying the multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA). Then, For Eq. (16), a final optimal point can be obtained through the ISIGHT software and MIGA after determine the values of two weighting factors w
                           1 and w
                           2. 11 group combinations of w
                           1 and w
                           2 are selected. And the Pareto-optimal set was given in Table 13
                           .


                           Fig. 16(b) is the collision process of the car with optimal Thrie-beam guardrail. It can be seen that there no the snagging effect in the entire collision process. After the collision, the car can return to normal travel direction and the front fender and bumper of car body have slight deformation. Compared with initial Thrie-beam guardrail, the damage extent of the car is relatively light for the optimal one.

After simulation, the centroidal resultant acceleration of the car body is Accel
                           =13.68g, indicating that the occupant is safer. And the RE with RBF-MQ approximate value 13.49g is −1.39%, within the range of the RBF-MQ model. The centroidal resultant acceleration curve was shown in Fig. 13(b).

The exit angle of the car during the collision between the car and optimal guardrail is given in Fig. 14. With the collision, the exit angle of the car driving gradually decreases. At t
                           =180ms or so, the angle between the car and the guardrail is close to zero, that is, the centerline of car is almost parallel to the guardrail. After that, the angle gradually increases. Until t
                           =320ms, the collision between the car and guardrail is over and the exit angle of the car is 8.6°, less than 60% of the initial collision angle. Thus, the guidance performance of the optimal guardrail has been greatly improved.

The lateral displacement curve of the optimal Thrie-beam guardrail panel was given in Fig. 15. It can be seen that the maximum lateral displacement is 430.4mm at t
                           =140ms, less than 750mm. The RE between the FEA maximum 430.4mm of the lateral displacement and the RBF-MQ approximate maximum 428.42mm is −0.46%, within the RE range of approximate model of the lateral displacement.

The collision simulation results between the car and optimal Thrie-beam guardrail were listed in Table 14
                           . It can be known that for the optimal Thrie-beam guardrail, there is no snagging effect and the damage extent of the car is relatively light; the overall performance of optimal Thrie-beam guardrail has a great improvement, satisfying the collision requirements.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper firstly created the coupled dynamic FE model of the vehicle and corrugated beam guardrail system, and simulated the collision between the car and the corrugated beam guardrail. Two kinds of widely used corrugated guardrails were considered, which were the W-beam and the Thrie-beam guardrail. It was found that the post had a snagging effect on the car wheel during the collision, which made the car deform seriously. The peak centroidal resultant acceleration of the car body in the collision model of the W-beam guardrail is 54.35g, while that is 49.14g in the collision model of the Thrie-beam guardrai. The maximum lateral displacement of the W-beam guardrail is 1028mm, while that is 778mm for Thrie-beam guardrail. However, the original performance of the W-beam guardrail and Thrie-beam guardrail could not meet the collision safety requirements and need to be optimized and improved.

Based on the mechanism of snagging effect, the distance between any two posts and the thickness of the panel were selected to be the design variables in the optimization process for the W-beam guardrail. And the thickness of the post and the panel were selected to be the design variables in the optimization process for the Thrie-beam guardrail. The centroidal resultant acceleration of the car body and the lateral displacement of the corrugated beam guardrail panel were defined to be the objective functions. And the multiobjective optimization problem of the W-beam guardrail and the Thrie-beam guardrail were mathematically defined by using the linear weighted average method. The RBF-MQ approximation models were constructed based on the design sampling points. After that, the Pareto sets for the two multiobjective optimization problems were obtained via MIGA.

For the optimal W-beam guardrail and the optimal Thrie-beam guardrail, the snagging effect did not occur. The deformation and damage were slight on the car body. The peak centroidal resultant acceleration of the car body in the collision between the optimal W-beam guardrail and the optimal Thrie-beam guardrail are respectively 19.02g and 13.49g. The car returns to the normal driving direction and the exit angle of the car are respectively 9.3° and 8.6° after crashing the optimal W-beam guardrail and the optimal Thrie-beam guardrail. The optimal results have improved the collision safety between the car and the guardrails. The maximum lateral displacement of the optimal W-beam guardrail is 776.69mm, while that is 430.4mm for the Thrie-beam guardrail. Therefore, it can be concluded that the overall performance of the optimal W-beam guardrail and the optimal Thrie-beam guardrail are greatly improved. Meanwhile, the analytical method, based on the surrogate model technology and finite element simulations, can also be used for the crashworthiness optimization between any other cars and guardrails under other loading conditions.
