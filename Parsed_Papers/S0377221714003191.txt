                  We consider multi-stage stochastic fluid models (SFMs), driven by applications in telecommunications and manufacturing in which control of the behavior of the system during congestion may be required. In a two-stage SFM, the process starts from Stage 1 in level 0, and moves to Stage 2 when reaching threshold

                      from below. Stage 1 starts again when reaching threshold

                      from above. While in a particular stage, the process evolves according to a traditional SFM with a unique set of phases, generator and fluid rates. We first consider a two-stage SFM with general, real fluid change rates. Next, we analyze a two-stage SFM with an upper boundary

                     . Finally, we discuss a generalization to multi-stage SFMs. We use matrix-analytic methods and derive efficient methodology for the analysis of this class of models.

The phase variable may be used to model the behaviour of the underlying environment in some system of interest, while the level variable may be used to model a continuous performance measure of the system. As a simple example, phase may record which switch is currently on in a telecommunications buffer, while level may be the amount of data currently in the buffer. Since the phase process modulates the behaviour of the level through the rates

Now, suppose that we want to model a situation in which a congested buffer may need to operate under a different regime, with lower input rates for example. In order to achieve this, we introduce thresholds 
                        
                           
                              
                                 b
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 b
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                      for controlling congestion. Specifically, the process starts from level 0 in Stage 1 (original regime) and when it first hits threshold 
                        
                           
                              
                                 b
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           >
                           0
                        
                      from below, it moves to Stage 2 (a different regime). Following this, when it hits threshold 
                        
                           
                              
                                 b
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           <
                           
                              
                                 b
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                      from above, it moves to Stage 1 again. Of course, if the process is already in Stage 1, then no change of stage occurs upon hitting level 
                        
                           
                              
                                 b
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                     . Whenever in a particular stage, the process evolves according to the traditional SFM with a unique set of phases, generator and fluid rates. We refer to such model as a two-stage SFM and illustrate it in Fig. 2
                     . This class of models for controlling congestion in telecommunications buffers, is motivated by and contains a model with two thresholds introduced by Malhotra, Mandjes, Scheinhardt and van den Berg in Malhotra, Mandjes, Scheinhardt, and van den Berg (2009).

                           We assume any real rates

                                    ,

                                          S

                              , which allows to treat systems with general input rates.

The change at the moment of the transition between the stages may involve not only the change in generator

                                          ℓ

                              , but also the change in the set of phases

                               and 0), which may be needed in a system with general input rates.

We treat the model with an upper boundary

                              , which is a more realistic assumption for modeling real-life buffers.

We consider a generalization to multi-stage SFMs, which allows to model multiple-threshold based regimes for modeling congestion.

More importantly, apart from the above listed generalizations of the model itself, we make the following contribution in terms of the methodology provided. Specifically, we would like to note that the analysis in Malhotra et al. (2009) was based on solving appropriate balance equations using a spectral expansion, and as the authors emphasized there, was difficult.

Here, we apply arguments within the theory of the matrix-analytic methods (MAMs) (Ramaswami, 1997, 1999), in particular the methods of direct analysis of SFMs developed in Bean et al. (2005b, 2009), which involve sample path decomposition and the use of the key fluid generator 
                        
                           Q
                           (
                           s
                           )
                        
                      introduced in Bean et al. (2005b). The advantages of such methodology are that the expressions are in a matrix form that do not require the use of eigenvalues, and have useful probabilistic interpretation. This makes the analysis concise and leads to efficient numerical methods based on the existing powerful algorithms (Ahn & Ramaswami, 2005; Bean et al., 2005a, 2008; Bini, Iannazzo, Latouche, & Meini, 2006; Guo, Iannazzo, & Meini, 2007).

Additionally, Malhotra et al. (2009) deals with the stationary analysis only. Here, we provide both time-dependent and stationary analysis of this more general model, and introduce rates

                      as a measure of transient and stationary tendency of switching between the two stages, respectively.

Some other related models include the multi-layer model of Bean, O’Reilly and Taylor in Bean and O‘Reilly (2008), and the model of da Silva Soares and Latouche in da Silva Soares and Latouche (2009). Unlike in the current model, both models assume that the process has unique parameters within each layer which is defined by an upper and lower threshold. The two models differ slightly from one another in their assumptions about the behaviour at the boundaries between the layers. The results in Bean and O‘Reilly (2008) focus on the Laplace–Stieltjes transforms (LSTs) of time-dependent measures, while da Silva Soares and Latouche (2009) provides stationary analysis. Some arguments used here are similar to those used in Bean and O‘Reilly (2008), da Silva Soares and Latouche (2009), as the methodology developed here uses building blocks from the theory of SFMs, which we detail in the following section.

Congestion control, which the class of models introduced here addresses, is a classic problem with close relevance to telecommunications as well as manufacturing, with a range of methods studied (Baek, Lee, Lee, & Ahn, 2011; Bean & O‘Reilly, 2008; Buxey & Slack, 1973; da Silva Soares & Latouche, 2009; Horvth & Van Houdt, 2012; Malhotra et al., 2009; Mandjes, Mitra, & Scheinhardt, 2003; van Foreest, van Ommeren, Mandjes, & Scheinhardt, 2005; Van Houdt, 2012). Approaches for congestion control include the models studied within the Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis literature (Cassandras, Sun, Panayiotou, & Wardi, 2003; Sun, Cassandras, Wardi, & Panayiotou, 2003; Xia & Cao, 2012), in which gradient estimators of measures of interest are derived in order to implement them for network control through the perturbation of parameters.

An example of a direct application of the two-stage model defined above in manufacturing is discussed in our upcoming paper, where we present a case study on the wrapping section at a chocolate factory. In that real-life example, once the excess buffer collecting chocolates from the factory line reaches a certain upper threshold, the line is turned off and a new regime starts. Following this, once a lower threshold is reached, the line is turned back on and the original regime starts again. The lower threshold is chosen in order to avoid the need for too frequent turning off and on. This further motivates our choice of the upper thresholds

                        As one alternative, one could assume the existence of the reflective states such that no change of stage occurs upon reaching threshold

                            from below if the level starts decreasing at that point. The analysis for such modified model, which is not of interest here, can be readily obtained by a slight modification of the results developed here.

In this section we state the key results from the SFMs literature, which will be used in the analysis of the multi-stage SFMs in further sections. Consider the traditional SFM

So we can see now that there is a need to derive the results for the probability mass vectors observed at the thresholds 0,

                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 b

                     , since all other stationary vectors can be expressed in terms of them. This is established below.

For example, whenever the argument relies on the process starting from level

                      is important, as in practice different congestion control levels may be desired at the start and at the end of the congestion period, respectively, see (Malhotra et al., 2009) as an example. Here, we have assumed

                     , as it is natural for the end-of-congestion threshold to be lower than the other.

Below, we provide the building blocks of the methodology for the analysis of the multi-stage SFMs defined above.

For the purpose of the analysis of the n-stage SFMs, it convenient to introduce the following notation. Let matrix

                      can be derived by an appropriate modification of the above results, in a manner analogous to Section 5.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This work illustrates the effectiveness of the matrix-analytic methods, in which the proofs rely on meaningful physical interpretations and enable the use of powerful algorithms (Ahn & Ramaswami, 2005; Bean et al., 2005a, 2008; Bini et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2007), in the context of a class of multi-layer models for congestion control.

First, we considered two-stage stochastic fluid models as a generalization of the two-threshold model of Malhotra, Mandjes, Scheinhardt and van den Berg in Malhotra et al. (2009). We derived time-dependent and stationary measures of the model using the methods of direct analysis of SFMs developed in Bean et al. (2005b, 2009) and other building blocks from within the matrix-analytic methods (da Silva Soares, 2005; Ramaswami, 1997, 1999). We illustrated the theory with a numerical example.

Next, we considered multi-stage stochastic fluid models with 
                        
                           n
                           ⩾
                           2
                        
                      stages, and derived the methodology for its analysis using similar methods.

A direct application of the two-stage model in manufacturing is discussed in our work under preparation, where we present a case study on the wrapping section at a chocolate factory.
