                  The influence of applying queue state dependent order acceptance policies, where either decision is with customer or with manufacturer, on optimal capacity investment is discussed. Therefore, three order acceptance policies are developed where either the customer has a certain service level threshold for each order or the manufacturer has an overall service level threshold. The third policy, modeling queue state independent order acceptance, is used to identify performance gains of including queue state knowledge into this decision. Equations for state probabilities, order acceptance rate, work-in-process, finished-goods-inventory, backorders and service level are developed for a system with stochastic customer-required lead times applying queuing methodology. An optimization problem minimizing capacity, work-in-process, finished-goods-inventory, backorder and lost sales cost (for rejected orders) in a single stage MTO production system is presented. The system is modeled as an M/M/1 queue with input rates depending on queue length and random customer required lead time. For the optimization problem, which cannot be solved explicitly, a solution heuristic is developed and a broad numerical study is conducted. The numerical study shows that allowing the customer to know the expected production lead time and—based on this knowledge—decide whether or not to place an order can have positive or negative influences on the overall costs, depending on the customer's service level target. Furthermore, the study shows that a high cost reduction potential exists for simultaneously optimizing capacity investment and order acceptance policy if the production system can decide whether or not to accept an order.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In many production systems, the order acceptance decision is one of the choices influencing performance. In the available literature, this order acceptance decision is either treated in combination with lead time quotation (e.g. Savaşaneril, Griffin, & Keskinocak, 2010), pricing (e.g. Ray & Jewkes, 2004) or customer class decisions (e.g. Modarres & Sharifyazdi, 2009). Most models trade off the expected cost of accepting an order with the cost of lost sales. However, none of the models treats the situation where customers can state a required lead time which is not to be quoted. In many real production systems, customers state orders with a predefined due date and the manufacturer has to decide whether to accept them or not (decision with the manufacturer). Alternatively, if the decision is with the customer, the customer knows the required lead time and gets some queue state dependent production lead time information from the manufacturer based on which she decides whether to place the order or not. In such environments, the customer required lead time can be assumed to be independent of the order processing time and a detailed scheduling of orders is not applicable at the point in time of order acceptance. Both possibilities are modeled in this paper. Order acceptance policies in such systems may intuitively focus on how many orders are already in the production system (see also Chatterjee, Slotnick, & Sobel, 2002; Gordon, Proth, & Chu, 2002; Savaşaneril, Griffin, & Keskinocak, 2010; Slotnick, 2011) and on what the customer-required lead time of an order is, i.e. the question: what is the longest possible production lead time if the delivery still needs to be on time? Relevant questions in such production systems are the performance of the order acceptance policy and the optimal capacity to invest. In addition, a third policy ignoring the current queue state for the order acceptance decision is developed to identify the benefits of including this information.

The production system is approximated by an adapted M/M/1 queue where orders are accepted based on queue length and customer required lead time. An optimization problem balancing the optimal capacity investment, the costs for inventory and backorders, and the lost sales cost for the predefined policies is set up. Three different order acceptance policies are applied for each of which the optimization problem is either solved with predefined service level thresholds (exogenous) or with the service level threshold also to be optimized (endogenous).

Trade-offs discussed in this paper are between inventory costs, backorder costs, lost sales costs and capacity costs. These trade-offs, which are faced by many production system managers, are treated simultaneously, also considering customer required lead times. It is shown how optimal cost, acceptance rates and capacity investment behave with respect to an exogenous service level threshold and how the policies perform if service level threshold is also to be optimized.

Compared to the available literature, the customer-required lead time is not quoted but it is predefined and modeled randomly due to unknown variety in customer needs. The order acceptance policies 1 and 2 which are predefined in this paper correspond to two different practical decision situations. However, the optimality of these polices themselves is not discussed. Also, the model does not include a detailed scheduling problem, as in many due date setting and order acceptance articles.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The literature on order acceptance related to the current study, including lead time quotation for single and multiple product and customer classes, is reviewed. A good overview on available literature in this field is provided in Chatterjee, Slotnick, and Sobel (2002), Gordon, Proth, and Chu (2002), Savaşaneril, Griffin, and Keskinocak (2010) and Slotnick (2011). The literature on capacity investment, which is also a related topic, is reviewed in Crabill, Gross, and Magazine (1977), Buzacott and Shanthikumar (1992), and Rao, Gunasekaran, Goyal, and Martikainen (1998).

One stream of literature discusses optimal lead time (or due date) quotation strategies which in many cases are extended to include the possibility of rejecting orders. These strategies mainly decide what lead time (or due date) to quote or whether to reject an order based on the current production system state. The main assumptions are usually that longer quoted lead times are costly to the manufacturer (due to lower prices charged or lost customer goodwill) and that tardiness is additionally penalized. Some contributions do not directly reject orders but model the customer order rate as a decreasing function of the quoted lead time.

One of the first papers to discuss order acceptance or rejection based on queue length is de Cani (1962). It studies a profit maximization problem where lead time costs, capacity costs and profit loss of customers not joining the queue because of the queue length, are considered. Both, order rejection and order winning due to lead time quotes, are discussed in Duenyas and Hopp (1995). They derive properties of the optimal policies in general production systems with tardiness costs. Applying an M/M/1 queuing logic, they show that for a constant quoted lead time, there exists a threshold value of queue length up to which orders are accepted. Furthermore, they show that in the M/M/1 setting it is optimal to quote longer lead times when queue length increases. Based on this finding, the threshold values for customer-required lead time depend in the current paper for policies 1 and 2 also on the queue state.


                        Hopp and Roof-Sturgis (2000) develop approximations of queue dependent flow times for different production system structures and state due date quotes under a service level constraint. Spearman and Zhang (1999) discuss due date setting policies either under a service level constraint or a mean tardiness constraint and show that service level constraints can lead to unethical lead time setting policies. In Keskinocak, Ravi, and Tayur (2001), an order acceptance and lead time quotation model where revenues are lead time dependent and customers do not place orders if the quoted lead time is higher than a certain threshold value, is discussed for two customer classes. A model with exponential probabilities for order acceptance based on lead time quotes is developed in Chatterjee, Slotnick, and Sobel (2002) for multiple stages. It includes the tradeoff between quoted lead time and tardiness costs. In Bertrand and van Ooijen (2008), an optimal solution for the lead time quotation and work release problem is developed for a job shop production system, including tardiness costs. Savaşaneril, Griffin, and Keskinocak (2010) discuss lead time quotation for pure MTO and for base-stock policies. They find that in pure MTO systems, the quoted lead times are lower than in the base-stock situation. In their setting, the customer order rate decreases in the lead time quote, meaning that customers state less orders when they have to wait longer for their delivery.

Since different product types or customer classes can have different costs or revenues, the following models discuss capacity rationing and order rejection for multi-class problems. In Balakrishnan, Sridharan, and Patterson (1996) and Balakrishnan, Patterson, and Sridharan (1999), an order rejection policy for two products is developed. To maximize profit, only the less profitable products are rejected. In Weng (1996), a profit maximization problem with two different types of customers, type 1 being lead time sensitive and type 2 lead time insensitive, is introduced. The quoted lead time for type 1 customers is optimized—along with the order acceptance policy for both customer types. For an M/M/1 queuing system, explicit expressions are derived and the optimal order acceptance rates and optimal lead times quoted are discussed.


                        Weng (1999) extends this model to a phase type service distribution and it is found that marketing should not only focus on customer order rate, but also on quoted lead times. An implementation of multiple customer classes ordering the same product with different lost sales costs is presented in Ha (1997) where an optimal order rejection policy is developed. For each customer class a certain inventory level or queue state is identified below which a rejection of an order is optimal. Carr and Duenyas (2000) develop a queue-state dependent optimal production and admission policy for a lost-sales multi-item production system where some products are produced to stock and others to order. The order rate for MTS products, and the optimal rejection policy for MTO products, is optimized. However, in their model MTO customers face lead time costs but no lead times are quoted and therefore no tardiness costs occur. A distinction between firm orders and orders to be released by the customer with certain probabilities is introduced in Corti, Pozzetti, and Zorzini (2006). They develop a combined due date setting and order acceptance decision support system.

An independent stream of literature is on optimization problems for the combined order acceptance and scheduling for a specific production system status. In these contributions, mainly mixed integer linear problems (MILP) are specified and solution heuristics are tested. For example, Ebben, Hans, and Olde-Weghuis (2005) compare different heuristics for order acceptance in job shop production systems via a simulation study and show that their newly developed method outperforms simpler methods with respect to service level whenever customer required lead times are short. In Xiong, Tor, Bhatnagar, Khoo, and Venkat (2006), a decision support system for small and medium-sized companies solving the order acceptance and scheduling problems is introduced. The decision variables are which orders to confirm based on available resources.


                        Slotnick and Morton (2007) present an order acceptance and scheduling problem with limited capacity and tardiness costs and test the performance of different optimization heuristics. Similarly, Defregger and Kuhn (2006) develop a heuristic for the joint order acceptance and inventory refill decision in a make to order company. In numerical studies, the performance of this heuristic is shown. Rom and Slotnick (2009) focus on the application of genetic algorithms for the order acceptance and scheduling problem and show that these also perform well for large problem instances. A near-optimal order acceptance and scheduling policy is introduced in Ata and Olsen (2009). Properties of optimal solutions are derived if customers have convex, concave and concave–convex lead time costs. Mestry, Damodaran, and Chen (2011) study the order acceptance and scheduling problem in a job shop. They model expensive overtime and solve an MILP by a specially developed heuristic where no tardiness is allowed.

Customer orders of unit size arrive at the manufacturing system according to a Markov process with mean arrival rate λ. Each customer order requests an individual due date value that determines the non-negative exponentially distributed random customer-required lead time L. Customer orders are accepted according to different policies which lead to an effective order rate of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 λ
                                 ˜

                              (
                              
                                 η
                                 o
                              
                              )
                           
                        
                      for policy o. In policy 1 the decision is with the customer and an order is only placed if its on-time probability is at least η
                     1 (decision with customer). In policy 2, the decision is with the manufacturer and orders are accepted to reach an on time probability of η
                     2 for each system state. The accepted orders are processed following a FCFS (first come first serve) discipline. W denotes the random variable of production lead time and μ denotes the mean processing rate of exponentially distributed processing times. In the following, it is assumed that this capacity can be determined by investment decisions and therefore is a decision variable of the model, i.e. the processing rate μ increases (linearly) with investment. cμ
                      denotes the cost per unit of installed capacity per unit of time. Y denotes the random WIP and cY
                      the respective holding cost per order per unit of time. Let G denote the random FGI (I is the FGI lead time) and cG
                      the respective inventory holding cost per order per unit of time. Backorders B with the respective tardiness C are charged a backorder cost c
                     B per unit of time if an order is late. Rejected orders incur a lost revenue cost of c
                     LS per order. c
                     LS > cμ
                      is assumed since otherwise it is optimal to reject all orders. For modeling the stochastic behavior of production systems such as machine failure or different processing speeds, we assume that the random processing time of an order is not known until the end of the actual processing therefore deterministic optimization models do not apply.

The system state x is defined as the number of orders waiting in the buffer plus the order currently processed (e.g. system state 1 means one order is currently processed and no order is waiting).

The minimization of expected costs for WIP, FGI, backorders, lost revenue and capacity leads to the following optimization problem.

Note that, even for this simple case, the optimal capacity investment can only be stated implicitly.

Three different order acceptance policies are discussed in this paper, depending on who decides about the admission and if queue state information is applied. Either each individual customer decides based on a predicted production lead time (policy 1) or the manufacturer decides based on an on-time probability threshold (policy 2). Policy 3 models order acceptance independent of the queue state. Note that under all policies, entry respective admission decisions are driven by satisfying the service level constraint only.

Based on the queue state x, the production lead time of order x + 1 (the next one to be accepted to the system) is Erlang distributed with processing rate μ (see also Duenyas & Hopp, 1995) and therefore the pdf and cdf of the respective production lead time is:

In policy 1 (decision with customer), the customer asks for the current production lead time with an on-time probability η
                           1 and the manufacturer states the true value based on the current queue state. Whenever the stated production lead time is higher than the customer-required lead time, the customer does not place the order. Note that this restriction of each single order to be on time with a least probability η
                           1 results in a very restrictive customer-required lead time threshold value w
                           1(x, η
                           1) for queue state x. We do explicitly not model information distortion, i.e. not telling the true production lead time, but we assume that this information can, for example, automatically be derived from the integration of the customer's and manufacturer's information systems.

Calculating the on-time probability of an order with respect to the customer-required lead time gives an implicit expression for the production lead time communicated to the customer which is equivalent to the minimum customer-required lead time w
                           1(x, η
                           1) for which the customer still places the order when the system is in state x.

                           where Γ( · ) is the upper incomplete Gamma function. In Hopp and Roof-Sturgis (2000), a similar modeling approach is applied with w
                           1(x, η
                           1) being the lead time to quote for reaching a certain on-time probability with the respective order.

In policy 2 (decision with manufacturer), the customer states an ex-ante random required lead time and the manufacturer, who knows the queue state, accepts or rejects the order—whereby a certain overall on-time probability is guaranteed by the manufacturer. Note that this production system perspective leads to less restrictive customer-required lead time threshold values w
                           2(x, η
                           2) for queue states x.

For mathematical reasons, the policy modeled in this paper to reach this objective is a common service level objective for each system state. This simplified policy leads to the following state-dependent maximum customer-required lead time w
                           2(x, η
                           2) for which the manufacturer still accepts the order:

In Eq. (9), w
                           2(x, η
                           2) is implicitly defined by applying the state-dependent on-time probability from Eq. (8). The common service level assumption applied in this policy is not proven for its cost optimality but seems to be a reasonable compromise for fulfilling the manufacturer constraint to guarantee an overall service level for all customers while still keeping the optimization problem tractable.

To identify the benefit of using the queue state information for order acceptance, a third policy with a customer-required lead time threshold value w
                           3(η
                           3) independent of the queue state is developed. In this policy again an overall on-time probability is guaranteed and w
                           3(η
                           3) can implicitly be identified as:

The expected tardiness for an order arriving at system state x depends on the customer-required lead time distribution, the state-dependent production lead time distribution and the threshold value of customer-required lead time. The integral over θ in (22) represents the expected tardiness for a certain customer-required lead time, while the integral over τ represents all possible customer-required lead time values. Summing up these state-dependent tardiness values and weighting them with the state probability Pn
                         leads to the following expected tardiness:

The threshold values for customer-required lead times, as implicitly defined in Eqs. (8)–(10), are determined applying a quasi-Newton search algorithm. A two-dimensional grid search heuristic is applied to evaluate the optimal capacity investment for problem (29). Cost and capacity investment precision is defined with ɛ

                         and ɛ
                           μ
                         respectively. For a detailed heuristic description see Online Appendix.


                        Combined capacity invest and order acceptance approach: For solving problem (1) for both capacity and order acceptance parameters, the solution heuristic can be used to enumerate the ηo
                         space between 0 and 1 in the necessary precision and to identify the optimal solution.

The differences between policies 1, 2 and 3 for customer-required lead time threshold are shown in Fig. 3. It shows that in policy 1, where the customer requests an on-time probability of at least η
                        1 for each order, the threshold values for customer-required lead time are much higher than in policy 2. These higher threshold values result in higher state probabilities Px
                         for small x-values, which leads to less orders being placed/accepted and to a lower WIP in the system. By definition, w

                        3) is independent of the current queue state and the state probabilities of policy 3 are therefore exactly equal to the ones of an M/M/1 queuing model with input rate

                        Fig. 4 compares the expected WIP, FGI, backorders, acceptance rate and service level for predefined ηo
                         values. The results in Fig. 4 show that a much higher acceptance rate is reached with policy 2 than with policy 1 at the same ηo
                         value, whereby policy 1 leads to much higher service levels than policy 2. Furthermore, the backorders in policy 2 are much higher than in policy 1. Due to the higher order acceptance rate and the higher utilization, the WIP of policy 2 is also higher. This results from the restrictiveness of the “decision with the customer” where each order has to have an on time probability of at least η
                        1. An interesting result is that, even though fewer orders are accepted in policy 1, the expected FGI for low ηo
                         values is higher than in policy 2, which shows that the higher average FGI lead time outweighs the lower throughput of this system. Looking at the detailed results for service level when applying policy 2 shows that the reached service level for low service level threshold values is above this threshold. This happens because a higher service level than the ηo
                         threshold is reached for low queue states. Policy 3 mainly leads to lower acceptance rates, service level and FGI as well as to higher backorders and WIP than policy 2.


                        Fig. 5
                        
                         shows the overall costs with respect to capacity invested for a predefined service level threshold. Combined with the results provided in Fig. 6, the results for policy 3 confirm that ignoring the system state in order acceptance has negative effects on the system performance and costs.

Concerning the decisions process within a supply chain, Figs. 3–5 provide insights on how order acceptance is influenced if the manufacturer automatically states the true production lead time for a certain service level threshold—as opposed to being in charge of rejecting orders. The results show that policy 1 “decision with customer”, in which each order has to have at least on time probability η
                        1, leads to a more restrictive acceptance behavior. Note that the customer-required lead time threshold of policy 2 “decision with manufacturer”, too, could be stated on request of the customer if decision is with customer. However, this would involve information distortion, which is not discussed in this paper. A detailed study how these two approaches influence cost and invested capacity is discussed in the following section.

The difference in optimal capacity and inventory when applying no order acceptance, as opposed to applying policies 1, 2 and 3, is evaluated. Furthermore, the effect of different cost parameters on the cost reduction potential and the optimal capacity to invest is investigated and the value of state-dependent acceptance policies is evaluated. All combinations of the following parameters 1/β ∈ {5, 10, 20}, cμ
                      ∈ {100, 200, 300}, c
                     LS ∈ {350, 500, 650}, c
                     B ∈ {50, 100, 200} and cY
                      ∈ {2.5, 5, 7.5} are tested with cG
                      normalized to 10 and λ normalized to 1. These parameters replicate different production system structures with a reasonable relation between mean customer-required lead time and production lead time (with 80 percent utilization E[W] ≈ 5, with 90 percent utilization E[W] ≈ 10 and with 95 percent utilization E[W] ≈ 20). The cost factors are chosen to cover reasonable relations between capacity, inventory, backorder and lost sales costs, showing either preferences to reject a lot of orders (for low lost sales costs) or accept most of them (for low backorder costs).

Lost sale costs are never below capacity costs (otherwise no investment would be optimal) and backorder costs are moderate in comparison to FGI costs. In comparison to the lost sales costs, backorder costs are in a range that still leaves the chance for accepting orders and delivering them a few periods late, instead of rejecting them. Instances with the combination cμ
                      = 300 and c
                     LS = 350 are excluded from the analysis, since those are mostly the cases where it is optimal not to invest or only invest little. For each parameter combination, 14 possible service level threshold values are enumerated and therefore, the combination of all these parameters leads to 3024 test instances for each policy. The aggregated results for these parameter combinations are reported in Sections 4.2 and 4.3.


                        Fig. 6 provides a cost and order acceptance rate comparison for one specific cost parameter set, always applying the medium value of the tested parameters; problem (29) is solved for a predefined set of ηo
                         values. This comparison shows that for ηo
                         values above 95–99 percent, all three policies can lead to higher costs than the acceptance of all orders. This happens since accepting all orders leads to a certain backorder level, but no lost sale costs occur. In the case of high ηo
                        -values, rejecting orders with short customer-required lead time can lead to high lost sales costs. This shows that very high service level objectives either from customer or from manufacturer are worse than accepting all orders. For ηo
                         = 0, all three policies lead to the same results since all orders are accepted.

Interesting differences in the cost curves are that policy 2 converges to the cost without order acceptance even for medium values of η
                        2 while being below the cost without order acceptance for η
                        2 values are very close to 1. Policy 1, on the other hand, leads to lower costs for low η
                        1 values and meets the cost without order acceptance only at η
                        1 values near to 0. If the ηo
                         values are also to be optimized, as stated in problem (1), the results show that all three policies lead to lower costs in their optimal parameterization than without order rejection which is intuitive since another degree of freedom is added to the problem. An interesting result is that for all three policies not only order acceptance rate reduces when higher service levels are to be reached, but so does the capacity to invest. The comparison between optimal costs and effective service levels reached shows that policies 1 and 2 lead to a similar cost structure near the overall cost optimum, while policy 3 leads to significantly higher costs.

The influence of applying policy 1, hence providing the customer with a production lead time value and letting her decide whether or not to state an order is discussed. Table 2 shows how optimal costs with this policy compare to deciding on optimal capacity and accepting all orders. The results are the average values for all test instances with the respective parameter combination.


                        Table 2 shows that, depending on the cost and customer-required lead time parameters, the optimal costs when decision is with customer are lower (negative values) than with accepting all orders for most cases. However, for high η
                        1 values, the optimal costs in this setting can rise even higher than for the situation where all orders are accepted. Note that in these cases the realized service level 
                           
                              
                                 η
                                 ˜
                              
                              1
                           
                         is nearly 100 percent (see also Fig. 6). This finding, which has also been indicated in Section 4.1, is interesting for supply chain settings, since it means that too ambitious service level targets can decrease the convenience of sharing data between manufacturer and customer within the supply chain since this information sharing leads to lower order rates and higher capacity investments needed.

Whenever the production system can decide whether to accept or reject a customer order (decision with manufacturer), the question we answer in this section is: what—compared with accepting all orders—is the cost reduction potential of such order acceptance decisions if simultaneously the capacity investment can be decided?

                         ratio is provided. The results are presented in Table 3
                         with the best η
                        2 value from a predefined set being chosen for optimal costs. Note that the results in Table 3 are always the average values of all test instances with the respective parameters.

An average cost reduction potential of 12 percent can be gained over all instances within our numerical design by allowing manufacturer to reject orders and optimize the capacity investment, respectively. Neglecting the system state for simplifying the order acceptance policy (policy 3) leads to an overall cost increase of 7 percent in comparison to policy 2. The aggregated results show that, in general, the possibility of rejecting orders leads to significantly lower capacity investment and overall costs in comparison to the situation where all orders are accepted. Furthermore, the optimal inventory reduces when the rejection of orders is allowed, while the overall lead time (production lead time plus FGI lead time) increases. This lead time increase results from rejecting those orders with short required lead times and is consistent with the lower inventory since the input rates into the production system, too, are lower than without order acceptance.

The mean customer-required lead time influence reported in the study shows that lower customer-required lead times lead to higher optimal capacity investment and lower inventories in both situations. An interesting result is that with the order acceptance possibility, lower customer-required lead times lead to a higher order acceptance rate, which is linked to the higher optimal capacity. When orders are released immediately after acceptance, the FGI lead time increases with respect to the mean customer required lead time and this effect also dominates the costs in the aggregated results presented. This means that optimal costs increase with respect to mean customer required lead time.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, an MTO production system applying different order acceptance policies while facing demand with random customer required lead time has been modeled. Orders are accepted by the manufacturer (policy 2) or stated by the customer (policy 1) whenever their customer-required lead time is higher than a queue state-dependent threshold value. Based on a queuing model, equations for these threshold values, order acceptance rate, and a set of performance measures are developed for exponential interarrival, processing and customer-required lead times. Using these performance measures, a capacity investment optimization problem is formulated and a solution heuristic is provided. The paper extends earlier publications by implementing a customer-required lead time distribution. We find that all order acceptance policies can lead to cost reductions compared to accepting/stating all orders. However, they can also have negative influences on the optimal costs if service level objectives are very high. This is an interesting finding for a supply chain setting; in fact, it means that information sharing with the customer may imply higher costs.

For simultaneously optimizing order acceptance parameters and capacity investment, the results show that a large cost reduction potential exists as long a queue state information is applied in the policy, if queue states are neglected for order acceptance, still a considerable cost reduction potential remains. Limitations of the current paper are the streamlined modeling with exponential distributions and the simplicity of the order acceptance policies. Further research could therefore treat more general production systems and apply different pricing/lost sales policies for different customer-required lead times to improve the performance of the developed order acceptance policies. Furthermore, it could be investigated how the production system is influenced if orders are not immediately released after their acceptance.
