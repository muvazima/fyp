               Abstract
               
                  The attenuation of the light that travels through a water medium subjects underwater images to several problems. As a result of low contrast and color performance, images are unclear and lose important information. Therefore, the objects in these images can hardly be differentiated from the background. This study proposes a new method called dual-image Rayleigh-stretched contrast-limited adaptive histogram specification, which integrates global and local contrast correction. The aims of the proposed method are to increase image details and to improve the visibility of underwater images while enhancing image contrasts. The two main steps of the proposed method are contrast and color corrections; an underwater image undergoes the former before the latter. Global contrast correction generates dual-intensity images, which are then integrated to produce contrast-enhanced resultant images. Subsequently, such images are processed locally to enhance details. The color of the images is also corrected to improve saturation and brightness. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the contrast of the resultant image improves significantly. Moreover, image detail and color are adequately enhanced; thus, the proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.
