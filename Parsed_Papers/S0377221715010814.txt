                  Various shock models have been extensively studied in the literature, mostly under the assumption of the Poisson process of shocks. In the current paper, we study shock models under the generalized Polya process (GPP) of shocks, which has been recently introduced and characterized in the literature (see Konno (2010) and Cha, 2014). Distinct from the widely used nonhomogeneous Poisson process, the important feature of this process is the dependence of its stochastic intensity on the number of previous shocks. We consider the extreme shock model, where each shock is catastrophic for a system with probability p(t) and is harmless with the complementary probability

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Various shock models have been extensively studied and applied to various topics in reliability (see, e.g., Cha & Finkelstein (2010), Chakravarthy (2012), Frostig & Kenzin (2009), Huynh, Castro & Barros (2012), Montoro-Cazorla and Pérez-Ocón (2011)). In the literature, most of the shock models have been developed under the assumption of the Poisson process of shocks (see, e.g., Finkelstein & Cha, 2013; Nakagawa, 2007 and references therein). The non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), due to its relative simplicity, is the most popular point process in numerous engineering and biological applications and, specifically, in shock modeling. For instance, the famous Strehler–Mildvan model of human mortality (Strehler & Mildvan, 1960) considers the Poisson process of shocks (demands for energy) affecting an organism, which eventually results in ‘justification’ of the Gompertz law of human mortality. Various Poisson shock models are usually mathematically tractable and allow for rather simple and compact expressions for the probabilities of interest (see, e.g., Al-Hameed & Proschan, 1973; Cha & Finkelstein, 2009, 2011; Cha & Mi, 2007; Esary, Marshal, & Proschan, 1973 to name a few). It is worth mentioning that shock models governed by the renewal processes, which have a simple probabilistic nature, are already more cumbersome and approximations and numerical methods should be used (Finkelstein, 2003; Kalashnikov, 1997).

It is well known that the NHPP possesses the property of independent increments that along with other properties enables reasonably simple probabilistic reasoning. However, the assumption of independence of increments, in fact, can be too restrictive to describe most of the real life problems. For instance, in various shock models, a system's susceptibility to shocks increases with the number of shocks experienced previously. Thus a minor or even a negligible shock that had occurred during the initial lifetime period can become harmful and even catastrophic with time.

Recently, a new counting process, the ‘generalized Polya process (GPP)’, has been studied and characterized in Cha (2014) (see also Konno (2010) for the formal definition of this process). In the current paper, we consider the GPP as our baseline process for the corresponding shock models. This process is defined via its stochastic intensity that takes into account the number of previous shocks and, in this way, it creates a rather simple but effective model which depends on the history. The GPP defined in this way possesses a positive dependence property which means that the susceptibility of the event occurrence in an infinitesimal interval of time increases as the number of events in the previous interval increases. This property is definitely relevant to various applications, where the assumption of the independent increments of the NHPP was often used just for simplicity.

We focus on the extreme shock model for the case when the shock process follows the GPP. Each shock in this model is considered to be critical (catastrophic) to a system with the time dependent probability p(t) and harmless with a complementary probability 
                        
                           q
                           (
                           t
                           )
                           =
                           1
                           −
                           p
                           (
                           t
                           )
                        
                      (independently of ‘everything else’). The survival probability of a system (without critical shocks) is of interest. This is a classical reliability setting with a well-known solution for the NHPP process of shocks (Beichelt & Fischer, 1980; Block, Borges & Savits, 1985; Finkelstein, 2008). However, the problem is more complex for the GPP case and the corresponding solution should be carefully derived, which is the main result of Section 2. In addition, in this section, some generalizations to the case of the cumulative shock model are briefly discussed when a failure of a system occurs if the accumulated wear (damage) reaches some given threshold level. The emphasis of the paper is on the analysis of the obtained survival function and the corresponding failure rate. Therefore, in Section 3, we derive the relation for the failure rate using a different (point process) approach that allows for this important analysis. Furthermore, a new general concept describing the dependent increments property of a stochastic process is suggested and discussed with respect to the GPP. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 4.

The new meaningful analysis performed in this paper will constitute a basis for further development of the model for various applications in engineering, survival analysis, finance, biology and so forth.

A new counting process, called the ‘Generalized Polya Process’ (GPP) has been recently described based on the notion of stochastic intensity and its properties have been studied in detail in Cha (2014) (see also Konno (2010)) . As its definition was based on the corresponding stochastic intensity, let us first briefly discuss this notion in a way suitable for further presentation.

                      be the history (internal filtration) of the process in [0, t), i.e., the set of all point events in [0, t). Observe that

                      is the time from 0 until the arrival of the ith event in [0, t). The point processes can be conveniently mathematically described by using the concept of the stochastic intensity (the intensity process) λt, t ≥ 0 (Aven & Jensen, 1999, 2000). As discussed, e.g., in Cha and Finkelstein (2011), and Cha (2014), the stochastic intensity λt
                      of an orderly point process {N(t),  t ≥ 0} is defined as the following limit:

As mentioned in Cha (2014), the GPP with 
                        
                           (
                           λ

                           t
                           )
                           ,
                           α

                           )
                        
                      reduces to the NHPP with the intensity function λ(t) and, accordingly, the GPP can be understood as a generalized version of the NHPP. It should be noted that recently a similar model was studied in Asfaw and Linqvist (2015) (see also Le Gat, 2014; Babykina & Couallier, 2014). However, the focus of these papers was different, mostly considering the corresponding issues of statistical inference and related frailty modeling. It is also clear that, by suitable reparameterization, we can always transform the model to the case when 
                        
                           β
                           =
                           1
                        
                     . However for the sake of further presentation (e.g., the ‘restarting property’ based on Definition 1 is used in this section for discussing the residual lifetime of the system and for characterizing the dependence structure of the GPP in Section 3), we keep the above setting as in the original paper by Cha (2014).

Consider now a system subject to the GPP of shocks with the set of parameters (λ(t), α, β). Let it be ‘absolutely reliable’ in the absence of shocks. As before,

First of all, within the frame work of the extreme shock model and keeping in mind various applications, we will be interested in the probability of survival of our system subject to the GPP. To derive the survival probability, we need the following supplementary results.

                     , the intensity function is exponentially increasing which reflects the cumulative effect of the previous events on the probability of occurrence of an event at the current instant of time.

It is easy to see that all obtained expressions reduce to those for the NHPP when we set

                      and perform the corresponding limiting transitions for α → 0.

Now we are ready to obtain the survival probability of our system.

                           (t) for the NHPP is lower than those for the GPP and it ‘moves upright’ as α increases. As expected, when α → 0, the GPP curve converges to that of the NHPP.


                     
                        Remark 1
                        Additionally to the above extreme shock model, let us briefly comment on cumulative and combined shock models. Thus let, as previously, a system be subject to the GPP of shocks with the set of parameters (λ(t), α, β) but assume that the ith shock increases the wear of the system by an i.i.d. random increments

For simplicity, assume that the distribution of the random boundary R is exponential with mean θ, where R is independent of the shock process and

                           …
                        
                     . Then, due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, a shock which occurs at time t results in the immediate failure of the system with probability P(R < W
                     
                        N(t)) and it does not cause any change in the system with probability P(R ≥ W
                     
                        N(t)). Therefore, the current cumulative setting is equivalent to the extreme shock model with

                     .

In a similar way, assume now that the ith shock, as in the extreme shock model in this section, causes immediate system failure with probability p(t), but in contrast to this model, with probability q(t) it increases the wear of the system by an i.i.d. random increment 
                        
                           
                              W
                              i
                           
                           ,
                           
                           
                           i
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,
                           …
                        
                      as defined above. The failure occurs when a critical shock occurs or the random accumulated wear W(t) reaches the random boundary R. Again, for simplicity, let the distribution of the random boundary R be exponential with mean θ. Then, applying the above interpretation of the cumulative shock model, it is easy to conclude that a shock which occurs at time t results in the immediate failure with probability 
                        
                           p

                      and is survived with probability q(t)P(R ≥ W
                     1) and the results in the extreme shock model can be applied to this setting with appropriate modifications.

The notion of failure rate is crucial for reliability and survival analysis. Its shape, e.g., provides the time-dependent changes in the proneness to failures of a system and, therefore, can describe its aging properties. However, it is not easy to ‘read’ the failure mechanism of a system from the failure rate function λS
                     (t) given in (2) and, therefore, it is hard to interpret it. This interpretation can be very important in various applications of our model. Thus we need a deeper stochastic analysis, which will be performed in the next section.

Before moving to the next section, we will briefly discuss the concept of the mean residual lifetime for our system subject to the GPP process of shocks. Denote by

Note that, obviously, P(TS
                     (u; {N(t), 0 < t ≤ u}) > t) strictly decreases and λS
                     (t|u; {N(t), 0 < t ≤ u}) strictly increases as N(u) increases.

In this section, we perform stochastic analysis of the failure rate λS
                     (t) and provide its meaningful interpretation. For better understanding of the GPP case, it is useful to discuss first the setting when shocks in the extreme shock model arrive in accordance with the NHPP characterized by the intensity λ(t). It is well known that the survival function in this case is given by

Intuitively, Eq. (4) (multiplied by dt) defines the probability of failure at a shock at time t’ multiplied by the shock occurrence probability in

However, this does not coincide with the system failure rate in (2) and it implies that a more thorough analysis is necessary for the GPP case.

Although the fact that (4) holds only for the NHPP is well-known (see, e.g., Finkelstein (2008), Kalbfleisch & Prentice (1980)), we need to reinterpret it in a new suitable way for our further discussion.

For this, let us consider independently thinned processes of the original NHPP {N(t),  t ≥ 0} with thinning probability p(t): {Np
                     (t),  t ≥ 0} and {Nq
                     (t),  t ≥ 0}. Define 
                        
                           I
                           (
                           t
                           )

                      if the event occurred at time t is classified as Type 1 event (catastrophic shock); and 
                        
                           I
                           (
                           t
                           )

                      if it is Type II event (harmless shock). Then, the system failure rate λS
                     (t) can be expressed as

Coming back to the case of the GPP process of shocks, let us also denote by {Np
                     (t),  t ≥ 0} and {Nq
                     (t),  t ≥ 0} the independently thinned processes of the original GPP {N(t),  t ≥ 0} with thinning probability p(t). We must first emphasize the important property of this process: the GPP obviously does not possess the independent increments property.

                     and, therefore, while applying the approach suggested in (6), more careful reasoning should be implemented. The left hand side of this inequality is the conditional intensity function (on condition that no catastrophic shocks had happened in [0, t)). We will now derive the expression for this quantity, but first, we need some preliminary results.

                     which is the same as the failure rate given in (2). Thus using the point process approach we have derived the expression for the failure rate that was obtained formally in (2). However, the current point processes reasoning creates the basis for further meaningful analysis.

                        (Shaked & Shanthikumar, 2007). Let X and Y be two nonnegative discrete random variables with the corresponding cumulative distribution functions (Cdfs) FX

                           (n), probability mass functions fX

                                    (n) decreases over the union of supports of X and Y (here a/0 is taken to be equal to ∞ whenever a > 0), then X is smaller than Y in the likelihood ratio order, denoted by X ≤

We will present now more detailed analysis of the dependence structure of the GPP, which can be helpful for deeper understanding of the GPP and the above analysis. For this, we first need to recall the notion of positively quadrant dependence (PQD): two random variables X and Y, are positively quadrant dependent if the inequality

In addition, it is easy to show that the random variable (N(u

In this paper, a new shock model was proposed and analyzed. It is based on the generalized Polya process as an underlying process of shocks. This process was studied and characterized in Cha (2014) (see also Asfaw & Linqvist (2015), Babykina & Couallier (2014), and Le Gat (2014) for some applications).

Our focus is on deriving and analyzing the corresponding survival probability and the failure rate function. We first consider the extreme shock model for the case when the shock process follows the GPP. This is a classical reliability setting with a well-known solution for the NHPP process of shocks. However, the problem is more complex for the GPP case and the corresponding solution was carefully derived. The crucial distinction of the GPP from the NHPP is that the former does not possess the property of independent increments, which is really appealing as most of the real world problems should be described via the dependent events. For instance, in various shock models, a system's susceptibility to shocks increases with the number of shocks experienced previously and the GPP models this phenomenon.

The emphasis of our paper is on the analysis of the derived failure rate function. Therefore, we obtain the relation for the failure rate in an alternative way using a point process approach that allows for this important analysis.

Some of the results are generalized to the case of the cumulative shock model where the failure of a system occurs if the cumulative wear (damage) reaches some given level.

We feel that the approach developed in this paper has a potential for further generalizations. For instance, we believe that the generalization to the case when the shock's magnitude is taken into account can be performed. The other possible setting of interest could be a case when each shock can become effective only after some random time (See Finkelstein & Cha, 2013 for the NHPP versions of these settings).
