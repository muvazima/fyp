                  The problem of comparing random vectors arises in many applications. We propose three new concepts of stochastically weighted dominance for comparing random vectors X and Y. The main idea is to use a random vector V to scalarize X and Y as 
                        
                           
                              
                                 V

                      and

                           Y
                        
                     , and subsequently use available concepts from stochastic dominance and stochastic optimization for comparison. For the case where the distributions of X, Y and V have finite support, we give (mixed-integer) linear inequalities that can be used for random vector comparison as well as for modeling of optimization problems where one of the random vectors depends on decisions to be optimized. Some advantages of the proposed new concepts are illustrated with the help of a capital budgeting example.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many decision situations require comparison of random vectors. Examples of such situations arise in multi-period reward in dynamic programming (Dentcheva and Ruszczyński, 2008), multi-criteria decision making (Hu and Mehrotra, 2012), risk adjusted budget allocation (Hu et al., 2011), health applications (Armbruster and Luedtke, 2010), and capital budgeting Graves et al. (2003). The concept of stochastic dominance can be used for comparing random variables and vectors (see, e.g., Shaked and Shanthikumar, 1994; Müller and Stoyan, 2002 and Levy, 2006 for comprehensive treatments of the topic). A well-known approach to compare random variables is to compare their expected utility, for a given utility function u that represents the decision maker’s preferences. Stochastic dominance circumvents the problem of assuming knowledge of a decision maker’s utility function by requiring that 
                        
                           E
                           [
                           u
                           (
                           X
                           )
                           ]
                           ⩾
                           E
                           [
                           u
                           (
                           Y
                           )
                           ]
                        
                      for all u in a certain class 
                        
                           U
                        
                      of utility functions. The concept of utility-based comparison naturally generalizes to the multivariate case by using multivariate utilities. However, as observed by Zaras and Martel (1994) and Nowak (2004), it may become conservative in that setting. Moreover, testing dominance relationship in the multivariate case can be difficult, although recent work by Armbruster and Luedtke (2010) provides some new tools for that.

In this paper we propose three new concepts of stochastically weighted dominance. These concepts build on the idea of weighted scalarization of the random vectors. We informally present the basic ideas below to facilitate discussion on their benefits. We say that X dominates Y in the multivariate linear sense if

                     A standard approach, known as multivariate linear stochastic dominance, is to use 
                        
                           V
                           =
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 +
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                        
                      (see, e.g., Müller and Stoyan, 2002 and Dentcheva and Ruszczyński, 2009). Homem-de-Mello and Mehrotra (2009) and Hu et al. (2012) allow 
                        
                           V
                        
                      to be an arbitrary polyhedral and a convex set, respectively. In our new concepts we will allow a stochastically weighted scalarization by introducing a probability measure indicating the relative importance of each vector of weights. The use of random weights was also studied in Hu and Mehrotra (2012) to develop stochastic-weight robust models for multi-stochastic objective optimization problems without the framework of stochastic dominance.

In the first concept, called stochastically weighted dominance in average (see definition in (SWD-Avg)), we require that condition (1.1) hold not for all 
                        
                           v
                           ∈
                           V
                        
                      but just on the average with respect to a distribution supported on the set 
                        
                           V
                        
                     . In the second concept, called stochastically weighted dominance with chance (see definition in (SWD-Chance)), we require that condition (1.1) hold for a given fraction of the 
                        
                           v
                           ∈
                           V
                        
                      instead of all v. The third concept, called almost stochastically weighted dominance (see definition in (SWD-Almost)), can be roughly interpreted as allowing a tolerance on the right-hand side of (1.1).

The proposed new concepts provide additional modeling flexibility and potential computational advantages over current techniques. For example, they allow for the use of random discount rates in net present value type calculations in capital budgeting where future cash flow and predicted discount rates are random, thus resulting in a more accurate representation of future uncertainty. Moreover, the new concepts provide a systematic approach to reconcile diverse stakeholder opinions elicited by a decision maker by allowing the use of a distribution-based scalarization in optimization problems with multiple risk constraints. This situation arises, for example, when the weights are collected from a large survey on a public issue (see e.g., Hu et al., 2011).

In addition, the stochastic weighted dominance concepts introduced here provide a way to relax condition (1.1), which in certain situations may be too strict as it requires that dominance hold for every 
                        
                           v
                           ∈
                           V
                        
                     . Finally, the concepts in (SWD-Avg) and (SWD-Almost) lead to linear inequalities when the second order dominance is used to compare the scalarized vector. In comparison, known approaches for the model in (1.1) require solving an optimization problem involving concave minimization problems (see Homem-de-Mello and Mehrotra, 2009 and Hu et al., 2012), which are difficult to solve.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review some concepts of stochastic dominance, including the notion of multivariate linear dominance under a weight region, and provide some basic results. In Section 3 we formally describe new concepts of stochastically weighted dominance and provide their equivalent utility representations. In Section 4 we present linear and mixed-integer linear systems of inequalities corresponding to the new dominance relationships. This is done in the context where one of the random vectors is an outcome depending on decision variables in an optimization problem. In Section 5 we present an example from capital budgeting to highlight the salient features of our proposed concepts. The appendices contain the proofs of the theorems presented in the paper, as well as a simple example that illustrates the effect of the various notions of dominance on the size of the feasibility set of an optimization problem.

We shall avoid the repetition of the clause “whenever the expectations exist”, and always understand (2.3) in that context.

The concept of nth order dominance can be readily extended to the multivariate linear case as defined below.

In this section we introduce notions of stochastically weighted stochastic dominance. We shall use the notation V instead of v to emphasize that the weights are random. We assume that the m-dimensional random vector V and the random-outcome vectors X and Y are defined on the same probability space. Such an assumption is made only for notational convenience and does not lead to loss of generality, since we can always construct a random vector

                      on the same probability space as X and Y having the same distribution as V. Note also that V may in principle be correlated with X and Y, which allows for incorporating information on X and Y to influence the choice of weights. Let us define the conditional distribution function

                     Condition (3.4) provides essentially the same information as the robust relationship in Definition 2.1. The above discussion, however, motivates the study of alternative relaxed versions of (3.2) and its equivalent representation (3.4) which will allow us to fully explore the randomness of the weights as a modeling tool.

We proceed now in that direction. Note that, by Theorem 2.2, definitions (3.2) and (3.4) remain unchanged with respect to scaling the random vector V. That is, we can normalize V as 
                        
                           V

                      and zero otherwise so that a nonnegative support of V can be projected onto 
                        
                           Δ
                        
                     . Thus, we shall assume henceforth that the support of V is a subset of

                        . Thus, (SWD-Avg) requires that the dominance relationship hold on average with respect to the distribution of V. Note also that the supremum of an expectation is less than or equal to the expectation of the supremum. Thus, we have obtained a relaxed version of (3.4) by switching the order of expectation and supremum.
                           Remark 3.2
                           Note also that, by applying identity (3.1) into (SWD-Avg) and using the so-called “tower property” of expectations, we obtain an important characteristic of (SWD-Avg)—namely, that this multivariate dominance can be represented by a univariate relationship. For reference, we state this result in Proposition 3.3 below.

Consequently, properties of univariate dominance can be used for (SWD-Avg). This is particularly important from an algorithmic perspective, since it is much easier to test for univariate dominance than for robust multivariate linear dominance. We will discuss this issue in more detail in Section 4.

By combining Proposition 3.3 with (2.3), we obtain the following equivalent utility representations of (SWD-Avg) for the first and second orders. Recall the definition of

We now give an interpretation of (SWD-Avg). Assume that X and Y are future random cash flows of two completing projects, and V is a random vector that represents the discount rates corresponding to future periods (see Section 5).

We now discuss another concept of stochastic weighted dominance motivated from (3.4). In this concept we require that the relationship in (3.2) hold with some probability rather than almost surely. One can draw a parallel between this approach and the traditional notion of chance constraints (also called probabilistic constraints) in stochastic programming. Formally, we have the following definition:

The following proposition gives an equivalent representation of stochastically weighted dominance with chance

                         in terms of expected utilities. The proof follows directly from the equivalence (2.3) applied to the univariate random variables

In Section 4 we will discuss how to test for this type of dominance. We now give an interpretation of (SWD-Chance). Returning to the cash flow example following Corollary 3.4, under the criterion of (SWD-Chance) cash flow X is preferred over Y if the expected utility of random net present value of X is better than the expected utility of Y for all but a fraction of the possible discount rates, regardless of the choice of the utility function within the set

The third concept motivated from (3.4) we present is obtained by allowing for a tolerance on the right hand side of that inequality, as defined below. The basic idea was used in Hu et al. (2012) to ensure that a certain Slater condition holds when solving optimization problems with the second order stochastic dominance constraints. A similar idea (also for

When the distribution of v represents the opinions of multiple decison makers, (SWD-Relax) can be interpreted as follows: suppose that each decision maker allows for a tolerance to relax the nth order dominance condition (for example, Lizyayev and Ruszczyński, 2011 call this relaxation “almost stochastic dominance”); then, (SWD-Almost) says that the weighted average tolerance should not exceed 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        .

Further properties of (SWD-Almost) can be derived when both X and Y have bounded support. Suppose this is the case, and without loss of generality assume that

                         is the same as (3.4), whereas (SWD-Almost) is always satisfied with

We now derive an equivalent representation of (3.7) in terms of expected utilities. Theorem 3.8 below states the result.

                        . The corollaries below show that this is not the case, since arbitrary utility functions in [0,1] can be normalized to satisfy those conditions. Theorem 3.8 helps to interpret the meaning of the parameter

                         that appears in the definition of (SWD-Almost) and indicates how much we are willing to relax such a condition, with the tolerance measured in “utility values.” To see that, consider two random variables

The formulation of univariate nth order stochastic dominance, either in terms of integrals of cumulative distribution functions or in terms of expected utilities (as in (2.2) and (2.3)) does not lend itself to a practical method for testing that relationship. For the case when the random variables being compared (say, X and Y) have finite support, Fishburn and Vickson (1978) propose a linear program that can be used to test for the second order dominance. Dentcheva and Ruszczyński (2003) describe an alternative representation based on a set of linear inequalities. This interpretation is particularly useful in the context of optimization problems with stochastic dominance constraints. Luedtke (2008) proposes yet another representation, involving a smaller number of linear inequalities. Inequalities for the univariate first order dominance are studied in Luedtke (2008),Noyan et al. (2006) and Noyan and Ruszczyński (2008).

The situation becomes much more complicated in the case of multivariate stochastic dominance. Armbruster and Luedtke (2010) propose a representation for the “full” multivariate first and second order dominance, i.e.,

                     . The result is a linear program for the case of the second order dominance, and an integer program for the case of the first order. As mentioned in Section 1, however, full multivariate dominance can be a conservative notion. Homem-de-Mello and Mehrotra (2009) study the case of the robust multivariate linear second order dominance defined in (RSD) (with

                     ) and show that there exists a representation with finitely many linear inequalities. Since the number of inequalities may be large, they propose a cut generation method to selectively obtain these inequalities when solving optimization problems. A concave minimization problem is solved to generate the cuts.

In what follows, we discuss formulations for the three concepts of stochastically weighted dominance described in Section 3 for the first and second orders. We present easy-to-check inequalities that can be used to test for dominance. These inequalities are convenient when the goal is simply to compare two random vectors.

We also consider a case where the dominance relationship appears as a constraint in an optimization problem. This is an attractive approach for managing risks in an optimization setting. While optimizing an objective function, one avoids high risks by choosing options that are preferable to a random benchmark. In general, we write a stochastic dominance constrained optimization model as

                        Proposition 4.1 below shows that inequality (2.2) only needs to be tested for finitely many values of 
                           
                              η
                           
                        —more specifically, only for the values of

As discussed above, though, these inequalities are not convenient in the context of the optimization problem (4.1), where each

A disadvantage of formulations (4.17)–(4.22), (4.24)–(4.28) is that they involve “big M”-type constraints in (4.17) and (4.23), which are likely to lead to weak linear programming relaxations. We now provide alternative formulations avoiding the “big M” in the following theorems. Note that these theorems do not reduce the numbers of variables and constraints.

We now demonstrate the usefulness of the ideas laid out in the previous section using a capital budgeting problem. Graves et al. (2003) study a project selection problem where projects with random cash flows have different times to maturity. The authors point out the inadequacy of using a fixed risk-adjusted discount factor to account for both risk and time, and propose to separate those two factors by accounting for risk via a utility function and then for time through a fixed discount rate.

Let us consider the following specific example (see Table 1
                     ). Project A will have a payoff of $1 or $2 with probability 0.5 in Year 4. Project B will have a payoff of $3 or $4 with probability 0.5 in Year 10. Both projects have the same variance in payoff, consequently according to Graves et al. (2003) both projects “are exposed to same risk”. Graves et al. (2003) critique the use of a single risk-adjusted discount rate because it will over-discount a cash flow farther into the future. To see that, suppose that the company makes its decision based on expected payoff. It will choose Project B if it uses a discount rate of 10% without adjusting for any risk. However, if it decides to use project risk-adjusted discount rate of 16%, Project A will be chosen. This is because the classical risk-adjusted NPV approach does not account for time-risk and over-penalizes a long term project. The solution proposed by Graves et al. (2003) to the above problem is to separate time and cash flow risk. For example, one could choose a utility function to represent risk-aversion, calculate the expected utility of both projects, and then calculate the NPV of the resulting amount. Alternatively, one could calculate the NPV of both projects and the calculate the expected utility of the resulting values. The authors illustrate that approach by choosing a particular utility function of the form 
                        
                           1
                           -
                           
                              
                                 e
                              
                              
                                 -
                                 ax
                              
                           
                        
                     , where x is the NPV, and a is the constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) coefficient of the utility function. Although the approach proposed by Graves et al. (2003) provides a better way to model the problem than using a risk-adjusted rate, one may still question its sensitivity to their particular choice of the utility function and the discount rate.

We address this issue by applying our concepts of stochastically weighted dominance. In our approach the discount rates are modeled as random quantities, and instead of fixing a utility function, we verify a preference relationship between the projects using the entire class of risk-averse utility functions (i.e., the class of nondecreasing concave functions). The idea of randomizing a discount rate has been widely investigated in the literature (see e.g. Hull, 2010 and references therein), but not in the context of stochastic dominance.


                     Graves et al. (2003) used the risk-free discount rate of 10%. In order to keep our data similar, we also assume that the random discount risk-free rates

                      for (SWD-Almost). This shows that B is preferred to A under the various stochastically weighted dominance notions we propose but robust weighted dominance does not suggest any preference.

In summary, the analysis based on the satisfaction level and the tolerance level, in addition to the approach using (SWD-Avg), agrees with the conclusions of Graves et al. (2003) while providing more confidence to a decision since it is not tied to a particular utility function and it allows for random discount rates.

We have provided decision makers with a new tool for comparing random vectors, and given mathematical programming formulations to apply this tool. While these approaches do require specification of certain parameters, which may be difficult to specify in advance, parametric analysis on these parameters allows us to generate further information on the relationship between two random vectors. In this paper we presented reformulations of the stochastic weighted dominance concepts for the case where the support of random vectors and weights are assumed to be discrete. A possible approach to extend this to the continuous case can be developed based on sampling average approximation.

As mentioned earlier, one of the benefits of three proposed concepts of stochastically weighted dominance is that they provide some relaxation to the notion of robust weighted stochastic dominance. When stochastic dominance is used as a constraint in an optimization problem as in (4.1), such relaxation translates into a reshaping of the feasibility region. To illustrate that impact, we describe next a simple two-dimensional problem so we can graphically depict the feasibility regions under the various dominance relationships.

                      can be regarded as losses and

                      in a situation of loss, while constraint (A.2) requires the decision policy to be at least as good as 
                        
                           g

                      when there are gains.

Using the different concepts of stochastic dominance proposed in this paper in constraints (A.1) and (A.2), we obtain feasibility regions shown in Fig. 1
                     . Fig. 1a describes the case of positive linear stochastic dominance, i.e.,

                     , we draw the feasibility regions corresponding to the cases of the three proposed stochastically weighted dominance relationships in Figs. 1d. It is clear that all three stochastically weighted dominance relationships yield larger feasibility regions than the one given by positive linear stochastic dominance. In addition, Fig. 1c shows expanding regions for the parameter

                           α
                        
                      increases from 0.05 to 0.1 to 0.15. Fig. 1d shows the enlarged regions for the case of relaxed strong stochastically weighted dominance relationship with parameter 
                        
                           γ

                      increases from 0.001 to 0.002, to 0.003. Note that even reasonably small values of 
                        
                           α
                        
                      and 
                        
                           γ
                        
                      yield significant enlargement of the original feasibility region. Thus, these alternative notions of dominance can potentially lead to solutions with better objective value while still controlling for risk.
