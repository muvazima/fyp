                  This study analyzed the “Cost efficiency” and “Revenue efficiency” of 207 certified public accountant firms in Taiwan by using the additive efficiency decomposition DEA approach. Furthermore, this study applied the Tobit regression to explore the relationship between CPA firms and intellectual capital (IC). The study found that the Big 4 and CPA firms that practiced auditing in China were relatively efficient in both cost and revenue. In addition, this research discovered that CPA firms relying mainly on auditing are more efficient in creating revenue and utilizing costs. Furthermore, the Tobit regression was employed to evaluate whether IC affected CPA firms’ cost efficiency and revenue efficiency. This study found that IC played an important role in performance representation both in cost efficiency and revenue efficiency. Therefore, this study suggests that CPA firms should manage IC efficiently to enhance CPA firms’ competitive abilities.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Accounting scandals and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002 have led to more substantive auditing standards, and thus higher audit work [39]. In Taiwan, the most significant impact brought about by the foreign accounting firms is the improved auditing standards and principles. Besides, they have developed the confidence of accounting profession [20]. Due to the stricter auditing standards and the resulting increased auditing work, there is a higher demand for accounting services. A trend toward consolidation is underway in the accounting industry to strengthen their competitive advantage and this is often attributed to certified public accountant (CPA) firms’ attempt to avail themselves of economies of scale [1]. Today, the Big 5 have been reduced to the Big 4 after the collapse of Andersen due to the Enron scandal. As of today, the Big 4 are Price Waterhouse Coopers, Deloitte, Ernst & Young and KPMG.

Due to personal and corporate demand for accounting information, the number of Taiwanese CPA firms grew quickly from 762 in 2002 to 854 in 2007 (see the data from the Survey Report of CPA Firms in Taiwan). In addition, an increase in the pass rate for the CPA certification exam has caused the auditing market to be saturated with CPAs and thus the market has become more competitive. However, the earnings of CPA firms declined after the increase in the pass rate [21]. As a result, tackling this decline and surviving in this competitive environment have become important issues in the public accounting industry. It is therefore more urgent than ever for CPA firms to consider how to manage their costs and resources more efficiently to maximize revenue.

Data envelopment analysis (DEA), a performance management tool for evaluating efficiency between multiple inputs and multiple outputs [18], has been widely applied in evaluating CPA firms’ performance (e.g., [33,34]; Cheng et al., 2000; [1,3,2,16]). However, the traditional DEA model has some weaknesses [6]. One of the weaknesses is that the traditional DEA can only consider a single-process system. In other words, it neglects intermediate measures [44], in which the ‘black-box’ process of efficiency performance is ignored. Thus, this study employed a two-stage approach [23]. This study separated the two-stage production process into “Cost efficiency” and “Revenue efficiency” using a sample of 207 Taiwanese CPA firms from the Survey Report of CPA Firms in Taiwan over the period of 2003–2007. Cost efficiency indicates the relationship between a CPA firms’ spending and resources used. Revenue efficiency refers to the process that CPA firms create more valuation by using the resources.

Furthermore, this study evaluated whether Taiwanese CPA firms that practiced in auditing in China were more efficient than those that did not practice auditing in China. To illustrate this point, since China opened the CPA exam to accountants from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in 1994, it expanded the services scope for Taiwan CPAs. On the other hand, the current situation for Taiwan CPAs service in the mainland China is still in progress to meet customer needs. In addition, Taiwanese CPAs need to expand their geographical coverage of the market. In terms of the practice auditing projects, checking audits, examination of business and financial records in Taiwan Investment Company is the main object, and their approach is that Taiwanese CPA firms send Taiwanese personnel to work in China. 12 Taiwanese CPA firms set up branches in China in 2010.

Note that the public accounting industry is a knowledge-intensive industry, and knowing how to use intangible assets efficiently in order to survive and grow has become vital. There are many previous articles which used the human capital to evaluate CPA firms’ efficiency (e.g., [28,8]), but this study explores whether intellectual capital (IC) affects CPA firms’ efficiency. The concept of IC goes beyond the traditional performance of financial market value to represent intangible assets as embedded in an entity. Compared to traditional tangible assets, IC has become the dominant concern for an enterprise. Edvinsson and Malone [29] divided IC into three portions, organizational technology (structural capital), customer relationships (customer capital), and professional skills (human capital) that provide Skandia with the value framework in the market. Therefore, this study uses these three dimensions of IC to examine the relationship between IC and CPA firms’ performance.

To explore the impact of IC on CPA firms’ performance, Banker and Natarajan [5] used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the influence of contextual variables on efficiency through one-stage and two-stage parametric approaches to compare the different methods of estimation. The results indicated that the DEA-based procedures with OLS, maximum likelihood, or even Tobit estimation in the second stage worked as well as the parametric methods in the estimation of the impact of contextual variables on productivity. For example, Hoff [31] advocated using Tobit regression in second-stage DEA efficiency analyses. Therefore, this study utilized Tobit regression to analyze the relationship between IC and CPA firms’ performance. Hoff [31] argued that Tobit regression will be sufficient in estimating the coefficients in the second-stage regression analysis that involves DEA scores in most cases.

In summary, this study focused on three issues. The first issue explored CPA firms’ efficiency separated into cost efficiency and revenue efficiency by using additive efficiency decomposition DEA [23,27]. Furthermore, this study evaluated whether the Taiwanese CPA firms that practiced auditing in China were more efficient than those that did not practice auditing in China every year, and whether the Big 4 were more efficient than the non-Big 4 firms. Finally, this study used Tobit regression to analyze the relation between IC and CPA firms’ performance. The findings can help us understand the trends in the public accounting industry.

The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review of empirical evidence on the evaluation of CPA firms’ operation efficiency. Section 3 describes the research design, including the two-stage DEA methodology, Tobit regression, and collection of sample data. Section 4 describes the empirical results. Section 5 presents the conclusion.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Before 1988 the pass rate of the CPA exam was quite low in Taiwan. However, the Examination Yuan in Taiwan raised the pass rate since 1988. After Enron and Arthur Andersen collapsed in 2001 and 2002 respectively, the Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX) Act was enacted in July of 2002 as a result. SOX raised the corporate government, improved auditor independence, and increased the transparency and reliability of financial reports. Much research explored whether the productive efficiencies would change because of the increase in the CPA exam pass rate and the SOX.

Chen et al. [21] observed 3284 CPA firms from the Survey Report of CPA Firms in Taiwan over the period 1989–1995, excluding 1991, to examine the impact of the increased CPA pass rate on the industrial structure and earnings of CPA firms. They found that the earnings of CPA firms were positively related to market share, on-job training, labor cost and lawsuit risk.

Chang et al. [13] used the DEA model, central tendency and parametric methods that are involved in OLS regressions to evaluate productive efficiency differences between pre-SOX and post-SOX periods. They used annual operations data from 58 of the 100 largest CPA firms in the US over the period 2000–2004. Their study found that there was no negative effect on the production efficiency of public accounting firms after the SOX prohibited public accounting firms from offering management advisory services. Further, they found that their results were not affected by the inclusion or exclusion of the Big 4 CPA firms.

Chang et al. [14] investigated productivity growth, technical progress and efficiency change through utilizing a group of the 56 largest CPA firms in the US for the periods 1996–1999 (pre-SOX) and 2003–2006 (post-SOX). They used the DEA model to evaluate the productivity change for firms of interest. The findings of their study were as follows. First, the CPA firms in US, on average, experienced a productivity growth of approximately 17% from the pre-SOX to post-SOX period. Second, the productivity gain of CPA firms was primarily due to a 19.9% increase in technical progress. Third, the Big 4 CPA firms underperformed their non-Big 4 counterparts in both productivity growth and technical progress following passage of SOX. Finally, the productivity and opportunities for improvement both increased substantially after the passage of SOX.

Chang et al. [15] conducted a study of 62 of the largest US public accounting firms between the periods of 2000–2001 (pre-SOX) and of 2003–2004 (post-SOX) to evaluate changes in their productivity efficiency. The researchers used the DEA model to calculate Malmquist indexes of productivity and efficiency changes. They found that the US accounting firms, on average, experienced about a 14.5% increase in productivity in the post-SOX period, but the gain was attributed primarily to an improvement in the efficiency within the firms’ operations rather than a change in the boundaries. The productive efficiency increased in both the Big 4 and non-Big 4, but was much greater for the latter.

Ryu et al. [43] compared auditors’ performance between the pre-SOX and post-SOX periods. The researchers used 207 sample firms that went bankrupt between the periods of 1985–1997 and of 2004–2006 from the Wall Street Journal Index to examine the auditors’ audit accuracy rates for pre-SOX and post-SOX periods. Their results indicated that there was no significant difference in auditor’ audit accuracy between the two period.

Most of the previous research concerned evaluation of CPA firms’ operating efficiency by utilizing the DEA model. Jerris and Pearson [33] used the distribution of total revenue and resources such as the revenue per partner, the revenue per professional, the revenue per employee, and the revenue per office, to evaluate and benchmark the top 100 CPA firms’ productivity and efficiency in providing accounting and auditing, tax and management advisory service in 1994 as published by Accounting Today. The results indicated that the Big 6 CPA firms produced the most revenue, but the results were not as consistently efficient as some smaller CPA firms in utilizing firms’ resources on average. The top performing CPA firms not only had significantly higher percentages of revenue from management advisory services than other firms, but also significantly lower percentages of revenue from tax services and accounting and auditing.

Jerris and Pearson [34] used five ratios to evaluate and benchmark the top 100 CPA firms’ productivity and efficiency in providing accounting and auditing, tax, and management advisory service in 1995 as published by Accounting Today, and the results were compared to results in 1994. The findings of their study are as follows. First, using total revenue as the ranking basis ignored how well the firms used their resources. Alternative measures of productivity indicated that the total revenue did not increase productivity or effectiveness of utilizing resources in CPA firms. One reason for the smaller firms’ being able to have greater returns was that they could provide a mix of services to their clients. Second, there was the same percentage of revenue from accounting and auditing between more efficient CPA firms and less efficient firms. However, the difference between the top 10 and other firms was a significantly greater percentage of revenue from management advisory services, and a lower percentage of revenue from taxes. Finally, smaller firms were as productive or more productive than the Big 6 in using their resources for both 1994 and 1995.

Cheng et al. (2000) used the DEA model to assess the technical efficiency of 671 CPA firms in Taiwan in 1994, and they also used the Tobit censored regression model to examine the relationship between technical efficiency and firm-specific characteristics. The results showed that Taiwanese CPA firms could reduce inputs by 27.8%, on average, and still produced the same level of services. According to the Tobit censored regression results, factors such as a firms’ size, age, service concentration, CPA-to-employee ratio and training expenditure per employee had positive impacts on its efficiency, and firms with branches were less efficient than those without branches.

Banker et al. [1] used the annual surveys collected by Accounting Today from the top 64 U.S. CPA firms among the top 100 accounting firms over the period 1995–1999 to evaluate how economies of scale and marginal revenue products changed over that period. The researchers used accounting and auditing, tax services, and management advisory services as the output variables, and the number of partners, the number of other professionals and the number of other employees as the input variables. Further, they included the number of offices as a control variable. Their results indicated that the mergers among CPA firms were justified by the existence of economies of scale, and the marginal revenue product of partners increased from 1995 to 1998 and decreased in 1999.

Banker et al. [2] used the annual surveys collected by Accounting Today from the top 100 U.S. public CPA firms over the period 1995–1998 to examine changes in productivity and technicality by using service revenues and human resources, and they utilized the DEA model to evaluate the changes in efficiency. The researchers used accounting and auditing, tax services and management advisory services as their service output variables, and the number of partners, the number of other professionals and the number of other employees as their input variables of human resources. They found the DEA to be technically and allocatively inefficient when the study used total revenue as the single output variable or total cost as the single input variable. The results also revealed that statistically significant allocative inefficiency existed in the public accounting industry during the period from 1995 to 1998.

Chang et al. [12] used the DEA model and broke down productivity growth into relative efficiency change, technical progress and IT capital accumulation. The researchers used panel data from 52 CPA firms in Taiwan from 1993 to 2002. They found, on average, productivity growth of about 79% over the ten-year period, and the major reason was IT capital accumulation. Further, they investigated the relationship between cross-sectional variation productivity growth and its components as well as the changes in two dimensions: service diversification and workforce quality. Their results indicated that CPA firms diversified their services from the traditional audit service to new value-added non-audit services and achieved higher workforce quality, contributing to CPA firms’ IT capital accumulation which lead to the productivity growth.

In summary, after the SOX, CPA firms have had to be more independent when providing auditing services due to the increase in the demand for professional accounting services. The raising of the pass rate in Taiwan has made the auditing market more competitive than before. Therefore, measuring CPA firms’ operating efficiency factors has become a vital issue. On the other hand, there are few studies which used the two-stage DEA model to evaluate CPA firms’ performance with the evaluation separated into cost efficiency and revenue efficiency. Consequently, this study utilized the two-stage DEA model to measure CPA firms’ performance. Moreover, the study applied the Tobit regression to explore the relationship between the performance of CPA firms and intellectual capital.

DEA was first introduced by Charnes et al. [18], and subsequently extended by Banker et al. [4]. DEA is a data driven tool to measure efficiency and rank a given decision making unit (DMU) relative to other similar units. DEA can also capture the interaction among multiple inputs and multiple outputs in a scalar value, which is a distinct advantage over the traditional ratio analysis. The DEA model has been extensively used in a wide range of industries (e.g., [40,10]).

There are some weaknesses of the traditional DEA model [6], and one of the weaknesses is that the traditional DEA model can only consider the efficiency of one specific stage when a two-stage production process is present. In other words, it neglects the intermediate measures [25]. Specifically, the one-stage DEA cannot conduct the two-stage assessment of efficiency in an integrated implementation. Because of intermediate measures, the performance improvement of first stage would affect the efficiency performance of the second stage [37]. Besides, the public accounting industry is a labor-intensive industry; therefore, how to use resources more efficiently to create maximum revenue has become an important issue. Accordingly, this study examined the efficiency of CPA firms’ production procedure by using the two-stage DEA with the concept of cost and revenue efficiencies. The production procedure is presented in Fig. 1
                        .

CPA firms incur “human expenses” (HEs) to recruit employees and “maintenance expenses” (MEs) to provide facilities to assist employees in their work. They also incur “other expenses” (OEs) such as entertainment fees to develop their customer relationships. Therefore, the purpose of these expenses is to help the CPA firms to work more efficiently and more conveniently. Moreover, since the public accounting industry has become more competitive, CPA firms have to manage all of their expenses more efficiently to survive, and can also employ more personnel with the least possible expense. The previous discussion implies that the intermediate measures of this study are the employees: “number of people” (NPs), number of professional staff (NOPs), and number of other employees (NOEs). Using total costs as the input variables and CPA employees as the output variables, we measure cost efficiency in the first stage.

The second stage is revenue efficiency. CPA firms utilize resources to create the maximum revenue, and the employees can maximize the value of the firm. The revenue of CPA firms is divided into four groups in this study: auditing revenue (ARs), tax services revenue (TSRs), management advisory services revenue (MARs) and other revenues (ORs). Three input variables, three intermediate variables, and four output variables are used in this study to explore the production procedure for the CPA firms, and they are defined as follows.

Input variables:
                           
                              HEs=Human expenses contain salary, traveling expense, training expense, meal expense, welfare funds, retirement pay, overtime pay.

MEs=Maintenance expenses include depreciation expense, and repair costs.

OEs=Other expenses that total costs minus human expense and maintenance expense.

Intermediate variables:
                           
                              NPs=Number of all owners and shareholders.

NOPs=Professionally qualified staff who perform the accounting and other services offered by the firm, including staff accountants, senior accountants, and managers.

NOEs=Clerical and support personnel, usually involved in administration, printing of reports, record keeping, and the like.

Output variables:
                           
                              ARs=Revenue from auditing.

TSRs=Revenue from tax services.

MARs=Revenue from management advisory services.

ORs=Revenue other than the three items mentioned above.

The data used in this study were obtained from the Survey Report of CPA Firms in Taiwan for the five-year period, 2003–2007. The survey is done annually by the Department of Statistics, Ministry of Finance, Taiwan. It is a channel to gain insight into the operations of CPA firms and to provide reference for the government policy-making decision. The sample is 207 CPA firms, whose revenue makes up 90% of the overall revenue of the public accounting industry. As shown in Table 1
                         below, the first stage of this study used human expenses, maintenance expenses, and other expenses as the input variables, and classified the employees into three groups as output variables: owners and shareholders, professionally qualified staff, clerical and support personnel. These variables also become input variables in the second stage.


                        Table 1 is the trend of variables. The expense variables showed steady progress between 2003 and 2007. Intermediate variables, NPs and NOEs maintained 6 and 7 after 2003 respectively, although NOPs increased between 2003 and 2007. Finally, output variables tended to increase between 2003 and 2007 on average.


                        Table 2
                         shows the correlation coefficients for inputs and outputs in the first stage and second stage. The results reveal significant positive relationships between inputs and outputs, and the data also satisfies the assumption that when inputs are increased, output should not decrease. Our data set satisfies the assumption of isotonicity, meaning that an increase in any input should result in an increase in any output. Besides, [42] indicated that using too many input and output variables will reduce DMUs distinction. Our DMUs of 207 first imply that DMUs distinction is not reduced in this study. Another concern is that Bowlin [7] indicated that the number of DMUs must be at least twice the total number of input and output variables. Although Bowlin’s [7] rule may not apply to two-stage DEA models,
                           2
                           To the best of our knowledge, there is no available literature to support Bowlin [7] argument for two-stage DEA models. Considering the stages individually, we apply Bowlin [7] rule.
                        
                        
                           2
                         which are more discriminatory by nature, it is worth noting that we use 3 inputs and 3 outputs in the first stage, and 3 inputs and 4 outputs in the second stage. Considering the number of DMUs and the input–output variables, each stage meets the criterion; that is, 207>2(3+3) in the first stage and 207>2(3+4) in the second stage. Specifically, the DEA model of this study is deemed appropriate as each stage meets the standard.

A number of studies have used the two-stage DEA methodology (e.g., [45,25,26]). In these studies, DMUs consisted of two-stage structures where the first step used inputs to generate outputs and those outputs next became the inputs for the second stage. The second stage then utilized the first stage outputs to produce its own outputs. Outputs from the first stage are referred to as intermediate measures [23,27,51]. There are several two-stage DEA models with different features such as the network DEA model proposed by Yu and Lin [54], Yu [53] and Kao [36], but their model is valid only under the constant returns to scale assumption. That is, the scale economy and slack values for each DMU are hard to be computed due to the complexity of the modeling. Acknowledging Tone and Tsutsui’s [49] contribution on the network DEA model; unfortunately, we find that their model does not show the relative weight or contribution of the efficiencies of individual stages to the overall efficiency of the entire process. In contrast, the additive efficiency decomposition DEA model proposed by Chen et al. [23] and Cook et al. [27] can be applied to both technologies of variable and constant returns to scale and represents the relative importance or contribution of the performances of individual stages to the overall performance of the entire process. One reasonable choice for the weights in each stage is the relative size of each stage [23].

Therefore, this study adopts the additive efficiency decomposition of Chen et al. [23] and Cook et al. [27] by establishing a two-stage DEA model with intermediate measures in a single implementation. Assume we have n units and that unit j uses m inputs (xij
                        , i
                        =1,…, m) to produce d outputs (zpj
                        , p
                        =1,…, d) in the first stage; these are then used as inputs in the second stage to produce s outputs (yrj
                        ,
                        r
                        =1,…, s). The efficiency measure for stage 1–2 of the process under variable returns to scale (VRS) for an observed unit k becomes TE

                        The overall efficiency θk
                         of the two-stage process can be optimized, subject to the restrictions that the individual measures (TE
                        1 and TE
                        2) must not exceed unity in the linear programming format, after making the usual Charnes and Cooper transformation [19]. The linear programming problem of additive efficiency decomposition in the two-stage DEA under the VRS model is as follows.

                        =0 in Eq. (4), then the technology is said to exhibit constant returns to scale (CRS).

Once we obtain the overall efficiency, models similar to (4) can be developed to determine the efficiency of each stage. Specifically, assuming the pre-emptive priority for stage 1, the following model determines that stage’s efficiency

Since the traditional DEA model is limited to the inputs and outputs, the entire production process or social activities cannot be fully examined. Further, the traditional DEA cannot evaluate the internal decision-making unit with regards to the operating performance of CPA firms. Therefore, this study utilized the two-stage DEA model (e.g., [44,35,23]) to measure the operating efficiency of the multi-stage production process of CPA firms. The first stage is cost efficiency, which this study used to compare the efficiency score between scale and operating type from 2003 to 2007, and the second stage is revenue efficiency, which this study added to the main source of revenue to be considered together. The two-stage DEA results are reported in Tables 3–5

In this section, this study used the two-stage DEA model to analyze the operating efficiency of 207 Taiwanese CPA firms from 2003 to 2007. CPA firms’ relative efficiency score was from 0 to 1. If CPA firms’ relative score was 1, it was efficient, and it was considered inefficient when it was less than 1. To determine differences that exist in scale, operation type and main sources of revenues, a non-parametric statistical analysis (Mann–Whitney test) was used [9] for unknown distribution scores.

The results showed that the operating efficiency quality is significantly different in scale, and the DEA scores for both cost efficiency and revenue efficiency of the Big 4 firms were greater than for the non-Big 4 firms. This means that the Big 4 operated more efficiently than the non-Big 4. The primary reason may be that the Big 4 had better reputations and also had the advantage of economies of scale. Furthermore, since the Big 4 were larger, have existed longer and have international association relations, they had incentives and ability to carry out investment in manpower and equipment to enhance operational efficiency.

Furthermore, in terms of cost efficiency, the CPA firms that practice auditing in China differed significantly from those that do not practice auditing in China, because their DEA scores were greater than the others. This indicates that they can maximize their resources to operate more efficiently. On average, the CPA firms that practiced auditing in China got more revenue efficiency related to their high DEA scores. There are many benefits for Taiwanese CPA firms that practice auditing in China. First, they can expand their business markets in China based in Taiwan. Second, they can operate on local China business contract. Third, they can help Taiwanese businessmen in China return to the Taiwan market. Finally, they can hire local certified public accountants in cooperation with the Chinese-funded firms, to assist foreign and Chinese firms to enter the Taiwan market.

Finally, the difference of main revenue sources obviously influenced efficiency. The main revenue source of CPA firms is from auditing, and relying on auditing is more efficient than other firms with their higher DEA scores. This result suggests that Taiwanese CPA firms should strengthen their tax services and management advisory services in the future to increase operating efficiency, and they could provide specialized and personalized services in local markets to expand geographical coverage of the market. Furthermore, CPA firms could diversify their services to appeal to more customers for efficiency in improvement. However, these results are different from those of prior research [33,34], in which Taiwanese CPA firms’ revenue mainly relied on auditing, but a higher percentage of American CPA firms’ revenue relied on management advisory revenue. The reason may be that Taiwanese CPA firms’ are smaller than those in foreign countries, so some of the smaller CPA firms in Taiwan cannot process the management advisory revenue.

In 1969, Galbraith first put forward the concept of intellectual capital (IC), and he indicated that IC is the behavior of use of brain. Based on the concept of IC, Stewart [48] defined IC as intellectual material – knowledge, information, intellectual property and experience – that can be used to create wealth. Instead of traditional tangible assets, IC is the dominant value driver for an enterprise in today’s knowledge-based economy. To explore the relationship between IC and CPA firms’ performance, three variables related to dimensions of structural capital, customer capital and human capital (e.g., [47,29]) are described below.

Structural capital is one of three basic categories of IC along with human and customer capital. It is the concept of structural capital that allows IC to be measured and developed in an organization. This construction contains hardware, software, databases, organizational structure, patents, trademarks, procedural innovations and access to information for codification into knowledge (e.g., [29,41]). Structural capital is the critical link that allows IC to be measured at an organizational level. Along with technology development, the ability to use information technology in CPA firms has become very important. Besides, CPA firms use information technology for their employees as the structural capital proxy to measure to what extent an employee uses information technology. Therefore, structural capital is expected to have a positive impact on efficiency.

Customer capital represents the value of a company’s ongoing relationships with customers, which is reflected in their loyalty to the firm. In other words, knowledge of marketing channels and customer relationships are the main components of customer capital, which is a potential asset in organizations. Therefore, CPA firms might establish more branches be for efficient utilization of excess capacities or expansion of their marketing channels. Furthermore, they could also serve more customers in addition to local markets. Consequently, number of branches is used as this study’s customer capital proxy [41]. Therefore, customer capital is expected to have a positive impact on efficiency.

One aspect of IC that has received a significant amount of attention is the area of human capital. Edvinsson and Malone [29] define human capital as the combined knowledge, skill, innovation and ability of an organization’s employees and managers. Firms and organizations have relied heavily on the knowledge and skills of their staff (i.e., human capital) to generate earnings and growth and to improve efficiency and productivity [52]. Postgraduate degree holders are employed and used as the human capital proxy to assess CPA firms’ efficiency on human capital used (e.g., [32,50,41]). Therefore, human capital is expected to have a positive impact on efficiency.

In summary, it is expected that intellectual capital, i.e. structural capital, customer capital, and human capital would have positive impacts on firm performance. For example, Lu et al. [38,24] document that intellectual capital significantly contributes to firm performance. Such findings suggest that managing IC is able create firm value [11,17]. Another example is [22], which finds that intellectual capital has a positive impact on market-based and accounting-based performances.

To explore whether intellectual capital affects CPA firms’ efficiency, this study estimates the following Tobit models:

Information technology to employees (ITEM) is a proxy of structural capital. In terms of cost efficiency, it was negative in the first three years and positive in the last two years, because in the earlier period CPA firms put more focus on human resource investment rather than information technology investment. However, in recent years CPA firms have realized the importance of information technology, and they are investing more in this area. Using information technology has improved structural capital continually in the accounting industry. It also indicates that CPA firms have increased their demand for information technology. Unlike the Big 4 which are committed to information technology investment, the small CPA firms still focus on high-quality personnel training. In terms of revenue efficiency, it was positive on average. That is to say, the positive relation between information technology investment and revenue efficiency can produce a good impact. Consequently, CPA firms should strengthen their accounting software and also develop databases.

Branch numbers (BNO) is a proxy for customer capital. In terms of cost efficiency, the result indicated a significant positive relation with efficiency, which means the more branches they have the more efficient they can be when they utilize excess capacity. It can also save more variable expenses such as trading fees, freight costs compared to business travel cost. On the other hand, they can serve customers directly, increase their service quality, and can attract additional customers. However, it has no significantly positive relation with revenue efficiency. This indicates CPA firms’ service concentration on a few big cities such as Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung. Therefore, this study suggests that CPA firms should strengthen their customer relationships, provide specialized and personalized services to gain a competitive advantage over other firms in the local market and further diversify the services they offer. Accordingly, it may be change from insignificant to significant.

Postgraduate degree holders employed and used (PDHE) is a proxy of human capital. It changes from insignificant to significant in aspects of cost efficiency, which means that the benefit of human capital will appear over time. Therefore, if CPA firms recruit employees with a higher level of education, they can finish their jobs more efficiently and save costs. PDHE had a positive relation with efficiency except in 2005 and 2006 in terms of revenue efficiency, and this indicates that it is useful for CPA firms to make benefits with talented employees. In other words, CPA firms should spend more money and time to improve the quality of their employees in order to further raise profitability. This study suggests that CPA firms can foster teamwork, technical communication, and other on-the-job training to help create usable human capital.

With respect to CHINA_DUM, the results for the Tobit regression are significant for 4 out of the 5years in terms of cost efficiency, which means CPA firms that practice auditing in China maximized their utilities and it also indicates that these firms benefited from resource sharing and cost synergy related to economies of scale. It had a significant positive relation with revenue efficiency on average, but in 2006 it was negative and insignificant. This may be because in 2006 the Chinese Department of Treasury announced 39 business accounting rules and 48 certified public accountant auditing rules, and in 2007 the listed companies adopted these new business accounting rules. These two sets of rules affected the revenue efficiency, although not significantly, because Taiwanese CPA firms that practice auditing projects in China is acting as checking audits in Taiwan Investment Company.

With respect to BIG_DUM, the Tobit regression showed significant positive relations both in terms of cost efficiency and revenue efficiency. For the past two decades, the number of big CPA firms has dropped due to the consolidation of auditing firms that was driven by the potential for multinational companies to gain economies of scale, diversify their services, and make global auditing networks more effective. There has to be economies of scale for professional services firms to meet this need. Today the Big 4 consist of Deloitte, Ernst & Young, Price Waterhouse Coopers and KPMG, each employing thousands of accounting and tax experts. Due the effect of economies of scale, the Big 4 performed well in cost control, and also enjoyed increased profitability. On the other hand, the result is similar to the DEA results, and it indicates that the Big 4’s market share will increase gradually in the future, and it will also achieve the effect of convergence.

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

The findings can be simply concluded as follows: firstly, the Big 4 CPA firms operated more efficiently than the non-Big 4. The primary reason may be that the Big 4 had better reputations, the advantage of economies of scale, were larger, had existed longer and had international association relations. Therefore, they were motivated to invest more in information technology. In other words, non-Big 4 may have to build up their reputations through high quality of services. Secondly, the CPA firms that practiced auditing in China operated better on average than those that did not practice auditing in China, along with the resource sharing and cost synergy. This situation could probably be because of the experience gained from practicing auditing in China. Therefore, it is suggested that CPA firms should attempt to venture into China to provide auditing services; they not only can gain more experience, but also are able to increase their streams of income. Thirdly, on average, CPA firms relying mainly on auditing were more efficient than other firms that did not. This result is different from prior research, perhaps due to the difference in scale between the two countries. This finding suggests that Taiwanese CPA firms could strengthen other revenue sources in the future to raise operating efficiency. Furthermore, on an overall basis, an untabulated result suggests that CPA firms should first focus on improving their inefficiency in the first stage, i.e. cost efficiency, and then their revenue efficiency.

Finally, this study measured the impact of IC on CPA firms’ performance from the results of a Tobit regression. On average, the regression findings first indicate that the more information technology CPA firms invested in, the better their performance in both cost and revenue efficiency. This indicates that CPA firms increased investment in this area in recent years. CPA firms that have more branches can utilize excess capacities more efficiently, serve customers directly, and attract additional customers. Further, this study suggests that CPA firms provide diversified services and strengthen customer relationships to gain a competitive advantage in the future. Recruiting employees with a higher level of education helps CPA firms operate more efficiently and therefore CPA firms could spend more money and time to improve the quality of their employees. In practice, while employees possessing great skills are able to provide better services to clients, a CPA needs tool to work effectively as well. Specifically, CPA firms should first continuously invest in new information technology or other structural capital. Next, they should continue to recruit and retain employees who are with high caliber quality. Human capital is the source of knowledge, information, intellectual property, and experience needed to create wealth. Moreover, human capital could be the prerequisite for CPA firms to run many branches. Taken together, CPA firms are able to create more wealth if they have great structural capital and human capital, which in turn would ensure that their customer capital works towards contributing to firm performance as they are able to provide responsive service to their clients at lower costs.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

After the increase in the pass rate of the CPA exam since 1988 and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002, the accounting industry has become more competitive and this phenomenon has caused CPA firms’ market shares to shrink. Therefore, how to utilize resources more efficiently has become vital in this industry. This study used the DEA model to evaluate 207 Taiwanese CPA firms’ efficiency in the aspects of cost and revenue. Unlike previous literature, this study utilized the two-stage DEA model rather than the traditional DEA model, which only considers single-process systems. On the other hand, this study utilized Tobit regression to examine the relation between IC and CPA firms’ performance. This study showed that on average, IC was positively related to the operating efficiency and affected CPA firms’ performance in different dimensions. This study can help in CPA firms’ resource allocation and the development of IC investment strategies, particularly on how to survive in this competitive environment.

A few notes of caution are listed here. Since the data of this study come only from the Survey Report of CPA Firms in Taiwan, our sample is limited. Therefore, there are many dimensions that this study cannot explore. We argue that CPA firms might have to foster organizational learning process
                        3
                        We thank an anonymous reviewer for raising this point. According to Peters and Waterman [30], organizational learning can effectively initiate the development of “knowledge energy” or the accumulation of “intellectual capital”, eventually improving innovation capability.

                      in terms of improving their human capital, which include learning from past experience [11,13] or learning through training [38]. However, it is important to note that we do not measure the key factor of organizational learning in this study for at least three reasons: (1) data availability – As discussed earlier, there are many dimensions that we are unable to examine, among which include the proxy of organizational learning; (2) the main purpose of this study – We examined the impact of IC on firm performance. Specifically, the stock of IC is the focus of our study, rather than the initiator of IC, i.e. organizational learning; and (3) our proxy of human capital – On the merits of using postgraduate degree holders employed and used as a proxy of human capital, this study argues this approach may be relevant in reflecting organizational learning, in that the educational qualifications could reflect commitment to learning. Researchers will have an opportunity to examine how organizational learning affects IC and ultimately firm performance. Moreover, while Tobit regression is sufficient in representing second-stage regression analysis, the existence of bootstrapped truncated regression (see [46] for further details) to address the problem of performing second-stage regression analysis involving DEA scores is worthy of note. Future studies may consider applying the truncated regression; however, our results lend preliminary empirical support through Tobit regression. It is also suggested that in the future other researchers can consider the quality index such as balanced score-card to compare the CPA firms’ service quality. In addition, other researchers can compare CPA firms’ operating efficiency between pre-IFRS and post-IFRS. This study provides guidance to CPA firms to improve their operating efficiency in the future and the methods used in this study can be applied in many areas.
