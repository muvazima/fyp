                  Cognitive radio refers to an intelligent radio with the capability of sensing the radio environment and dynamically reconfiguring the operating parameters. Recent research has focused on using cognitive radios in ad hoc environments. Spectrum sensing is the most important aspect of successful cognitive radio ad hoc network deployment to overcome spectrum scarcity. Multiple cognitive radio users can cooperate to sense the primary user and improve sensing performance. Cognitive radio ad hoc networks are dynamic in nature and have no central point for data fusion. In this paper, gradient-based fully distributed cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio is proposed for ad hoc networks. The licensed band used for TV transmission is considered the primary user. The gradient field changes with the energy sensed by cognitive radios, and the gradient is calculated based on the components, which include energy sensed by secondary users and received from neighbors. The proposed scheme was evaluated from the perspective of reliable sensing, convergence time, and energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The recent advances in wireless networks demand efficient utilization of the radio spectrum. With the current innovations in smart phones, an explosive increase in data traffic for wireless internet access has led to spectrum scarcity. In 2008, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) allowed both fixed and portable devices to access unlicensed TV white spaces in rural and urban areas [1]. Cognitive radio (CR) is an enabling technology that allows cognitive radio users (CRUs) to operate in licensed bands. CRUs can modify their own operating parameters according to changes in the radio environment [2].

The most important task for CR is to detect the presence or absence of primary users (PUs). If a PU is absent, then the spectrum is available for a CRU (also known as secondary user [SU]), and a spectrum hole (also known as white space) is said to be available. The process of PU detection is achieved by sensing the radio environment, known as spectrum sensing [3,4]. Spectrum sensing involves two key aspects: the primary system should not be disturbed by CRU communication, and spectrum holes should be detected efficiently, as required, for throughput and quality of service (QoS). Thus, spectrum sensing is the most fundamental requirement for CR because CRUs must be aware of changes in the radio environment.

The performance of spectrum sensing is determined by the probability of detection Pd
                     , i.e., the probability of a CRU declaring that a PU is present when a PU is actually present, and the probability of false alarm Pf
                     , i.e., the probability of a CRU declaring that a PU is present when a PU is actually absent. The probability of misdetection Pm
                      is simply 1−
                     Pd
                     , and a misdetection may cause a CRU to interfere with a PU. Ideally, a high Pd
                      is required, subject to the constraint of Pf
                      
                     [5].

During cooperative spectrum sensing, many CRUs cooperate to achieve better data fusion results. This increases detection performance in terms of Pd
                      and reduces Pm
                     . In infrastructure-based networks, all of the observations made by CRUs are reported to a fusion center, and a final decision about a PU’s presence or absence is conducted at the fusion center [6,7]. Based on the final decision received from the fusion center, each CRU reconfigures its operating parameters, as shown in Fig. 1
                     (a).

Wireless ad hoc networks consist of self-organizing devices that can be deployed without any infrastructure. CR technologies have been considered for mobile ad hoc networks, and these are known as cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) [8]. CRAHNs enable wireless devices to establish a network dynamically without any fixed infrastructure or fixed spectrum. CRAHNs are important because they can be utilized for many key applications, such as military battlefield communications, disaster relief, and autonomous vehicular communication. The absence of a central network entity in CRAHNs, i.e., a fusion center, means that the independent operations performed by each user may lead to performance degradation during spectrum sensing. Thus, cooperative schemes are necessary to avoid performance degradation under fading and shadowing conditions. In cooperative CRAHN schemes, each CRU can exchange its local observations with other CRUs in the network, as shown in Fig. 1(b). This means that it is important to investigate the performance of fully distributed cooperative spectrum sensing using CRAHNs.

In this paper, a novel gradient-based cooperative sensing (GBCS) scheme is proposed for ad hoc networks that rely purely on the local interaction of CRUs without using any central entity to improve sensing performance. Neighboring CRUs exchange their sensing information to reach a point of consensus, and they compare that point with a predetermined threshold to determine the presence or absence of a PU. The advantage of GBCS over existing fully distributed consensus-based sensing is that it requires no prior knowledge of network topology. In existing schemes, each CRU needs to propagate the degree of the network to all other nodes before the exchange of sensing information with neighbors in the network because the degree of the network may be changed in mobile ad hoc networks whenever nodes change their positions. In graph theory, the number of connections a node shares with other nodes is called the degree, and the maximum degree of the graph is the largest degree among all nodes. In order to validate the GBCS scheme, a simulation was conducted to make a comparison with existing schemes.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

                           A novel gradient-based cooperative sensing scheme, which is a fully distributed consensus-based scheme, is proposed.

The proposed scheme uses a consensus-based algorithm to handle the network model with a fixed graph.

Unlike typical consensus-based schemes, the proposed scheme does not require any prior knowledge of network topology. Energy consumption is reduced significantly, and the number of exchanged messages is also reduced to achieve consensus.

Through simulation, the proposed scheme is compared with the consensus-based scheme.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the previously proposed spectrum sensing schemes for CRAHNs are briefly discussed. Section 3 presents a model of the system, and Section 4 describes the GBCS scheme. Section 5 presents simulation results and their detailed analysis. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

Recent research has addressed two main streams of spectrum sensing: local and cooperative spectrum sensing. In local spectrum sensing, the most common techniques used are the energy detection, matched filter, and cyclostationary detection techniques [9]. Energy detection and cyclostationary detection are non-coherent detection techniques whereas the matched filter technique requires coherency. Energy detection is the simplest technique, and it requires only a short sensing time. However, it performs poorly under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In contrast, cyclostationary detection provides reliable detection, but it is computationally complex. In CRAHNs, each CRU makes a decision about the presence or absence of a PU based on local observations. However, the observation range in ad hoc networks is so small that the CRU may interfere with a PU, and this problem is known as the receiver uncertainty problem [8]. Moreover, fading and shadowing also have a severe impact on detection performance. Thus, efficient cooperative spectrum sensing with CRAHNs is necessary for detecting PUs outside a small observation range.

A centralized cluster-based cooperative sensing scheme was proposed in [10]. In this scheme, the cluster head (CH) controls and adopts the distribution of the sensing nodes in the cluster. It uses prior knowledge of the channel statistics to select the channels to be sensed and the number of nodes that should sense the channel. Information coming from the sensing nodes is fused at a central node to make a final decision about the sensed channel.

In [11], a cooperative spectrum sensing model based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proposed. An optimal set of cooperative neighbors and report sequences are chosen using RL. This is an adaptive method that tries to minimize sensing delay and energy consumption. The selected cooperating neighbors send their local sensing results to the fusion center asynchronously before a final decision is made.

A cluster-and-forward-based energy-efficient distributed spectrum sensing approach was proposed in [12]. CRUs are clustered based on their geometric locations. A CRU can send its decision to the CH only if its contribution factor is positive. At the end of each round, each CRU knows the major spectrum sensing decisions made by its neighbors. Based on the information received from its neighbors, each CRU will readjust its contribution factor. In each cluster, the CH collects and processes the information received from the member CRUs. One of the CHs takes a turn to be the fusion center and receives local decisions from all of the CHs. The final decision made at the fusion center is based on the information received from the CHs. The final decision is sent back to the CHs, and it is then sent onto the cluster members.

A cluster-based decentralized cooperative sensing scheme was proposed in [13] where each node in the cluster decides which channel is to be sensed based on the past sensing decisions of the cluster nodes. Each node propagates its observations to its neighbors. Thus, each node acts as a local fusion center and fuses the received observations from its neighbors to make a final decision about the sensed channel.

In [14], a biologically inspired consensus-based spectrum sensing scheme without a central entity or agent was proposed. This scheme, where consensus from the CRUs is used to make the final decision, is fully distributed and scalable. CRUs send their locally estimated energy levels to their one-hop neighbors. After receiving updates from its neighbors, each CRU uses a biologically inspired computation rule to generate an updated state-of-the-consensus variable. This is an iterative process and continues until the individual states converge upon a common value. Of the neighbors selected for every iteration, the neighbor with the maximum deviation from the mean value is considered to be a potential attacker and is excluded from the list of neighbors.

A distributed consensus-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheme is proposed in [15]. In the proposed scheme, CRUs exchange messages based on local interaction without a centralized common receiver. An average consensus algorithm requires prior knowledge of the degree of the network, and the consensus of the CRUs is used to make the final decision. The proposed scheme uses the consensus algorithm to cope up with fixed bidirectional and random graphs.

A distributed consensus-based security mechanism is presented in [16]. Consensus-based spectrum sensing similar to that proposed in [15] is used, together with an additional security mechanism. An authentication scheme, which uses ID-based cryptography with threshold secret sharing to further improve the security of CRAHNs, is presented.

A weighted soft measurement-combining scheme using a weighted average consensus algorithm is proposed in [17]. Initially, CRUs measure energy using an energy detector. Each CRU then exchanges the measured energy with its local neighbors and evaluates the information exchange rate according to its own estimated SNR value. The step size is chosen based on the maximum degree of the network and the estimated SNR value. A final decision is made by each CRU when convergence is achieved after several iterations.

The energy value of each CRU
                        i
                      is xi
                     
                     ∊
                     R, where R is a set of real numbers; however, the CRUs can only communicate with their neighbors on a digital/quantized channel. A CRU can send one bit or more over a channel by using adequate coding. For example, if the required resolution is 2−16, the 16 consecutive bits are considered to be a code word where each bit represents the binary expansion of the energy value being transmitted. With such a coding scheme, the GBCS will achieve the precision of 2−16. In [18], Carli et al. considered the problem of reaching a consensus in R using quantized channels. If the energy level is rounded to the nearest integer, then convergence to the average is not guaranteed. When the CRU transmits quantized values of xi
                     , then the convergence time is O(N
                     2)log(NQ) time steps, where Q is the number of quantization levels of xi
                      
                     [19]. The message overhead gets increased with the increase in quantization levels.

The approaches proposed in [10–12] require a central entity to make final decisions, which is not suitable for an ad hoc network environment. The scheme in [13] was decentralized, but it did not consider shadowing effects where nodes experience varying co-correlations. The schemes proposed in [14–17] are fully distributed, but each node requires prior knowledge of the upper bound of the maximum degree of the network. The major constraint of a consensus-based scheme is the communication resources. Each CRU may only need to communicate with a small subset of all CRUs in the network. The design of distributed spectrum sensing requires interaction between immediate neighbors, and global information about the network is not required. Our proposed GBCS scheme is also fully distributed, but its major advantage over [14] is that there is no need for any prior knowledge of networks.

The system model for the proposed GBCS is shown in Fig. 2
                      in which an ad hoc network with N customer-premises equipment (CPE) is considered. The CRUs are CPEs, which include smartphones, laptops, PDAs, etc. The PU corresponds to digital/analog TV. In this work, we consider a scenario where prior knowledge of the PU is unavailable. Each CRU
                        i
                      estimates the energy value denoted by Ei
                      based on local spectrum sensing. For each CRU

For the sake of simplicity, only energy detection is considered in the implementation of our local spectrum sensing technique. Fig. 3
                      shows the block diagram of the energy detector. The elementary approach behind the energy detector is an estimation of the received signal power r(t). To compute the power of the received signal, the output of the bandpass filter of bandwidth W is squared and integrated over an interval T. The integrated value E is the energy value estimated by the CRU.

For a large number of samples, the output of the energy detector approximates the Gaussian distribution according to the central limit theorem [20], which is defined as follows:

                        i
                      discovers its single-hop neighbors. However, neighbor discovery is not the main concern of this paper. Following the neighbor discovery process, the cognitive radio network can be represented by an undirected graph G(N,
                     E), where N denotes CRUs and E represents potential communication edges. A potential communication edge (u,
                     v)∊
                     E exists if CRU
                        u
                      and CRU
                        v
                      are within communication range of each other. Two CRUs are considered to be neighbors of each other if a potential edge exists between them. Only neighbors can exchange their local information. For each CRU
                        i
                     
                     ∊
                     N, there are neighboring CRUs denoted by (CRU

                        i
                     . Each CRU can have a different number of neighbors depending on the potential edges. Therefore, the degree of each CRU
                        i
                      can vary based on the number of edges. The CRU
                        i
                      with the largest degree among all CRUs in the network represents the maximum degree of the network denoted by Δ=
                     max(degi

The cooperative spectrum sensing in CRAHNs, which lacks a central entity, can be resolved using the consensus process. Consensus means that an agreement is reached regarding a certain quantity of interest, which is the estimated energy of the PU signal in our case. Consensus is achieved using agreement among the neighbors via local information exchange.

                           .

All of the CRUs in the cognitive radio networks have been said to reach consensus if, and only if, xu
                           
                           =

                     (t) and its neighbor information xij
                     (t). The CRUs process the information acquired to obtain the final result about the presence or absence of a PU. The description of the modeling variables is given in Table 1
                     .

As mentioned earlier, cooperative spectrum sensing is based on the interaction among CRUs. In this section, we present GBCS to improve sensing performance without using a centralized entity in CRAHNs. A common control channel (CCC) in CRAHNs helps many operations, including transmitter–receiver handshakes, neighbor discovery, channel access negotiation, topology changes, and cooperation among CRUs [8]. An orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CCC has been designed for the CRAHNs [21] and is used to exchange energy information with each of its neighbors. It uses noncontiguous OFDM subcarriers placed within the guard bands separating the channels of the licensed spectrum. The OFDM-based CCC guarantees connectivity and improves PU protection.

Initially, all of the CRUs individually sense a PU using energy detection, and each CRU
                           i
                         obtains a local estimated energy, which is denoted by Ei
                        . GBCS is an iterative process where the ith user’s initial gradient value xi
                        (0) at time instant t
                        =0 is Ei
                        . Each CRU
                           i
                         then exchanges the initial measured energy with its neighbors. As in the consensus-based scheme where a malicious node is present in the network, GBCS may not make accurate decisions because the node can continuously misguide the neighboring CRUs, implying that false information is further propagated in the network. GBCS first authenticates the cooperative participating users by using the identifier (ID)-based node authentication protocol proposed in [22]. In the ID-based authentication protocol, the unique identity information is used as a public key. A private key is generated by the trusted private key generator (PKG). The neighbor selection rule proposed in [23] is used for the GBCS, according to which each CRU calculates a deviation of energy xij
                        (t) for each of its neighbors from the mean value. At time instant t
                        −1, the local mean value μi

These steps filter out potential malicious attackers and contribute to overall cooperation. Neighbor discovery and authentication are not the main concern of this paper. Only neighbors in the new list are used to update the state xi
                        (t
                        +1). Energy information xi
                        (t) is transmitted from each CRU
                           i
                         to the selected neighbors after each iteration. This mechanism is inspired by a biological principle, which governs a self-organization mechanism in cell–cell interactions, known as a reaction–diffusion mechanism [24]. This iterative process continues until the energy information of all of the CRUs converges to a common value, x
                        ∗. The gradient-based algorithm for this purpose can be stated as

                                                )
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                                 .
                              
                           
                        
                     

Based on the energy received from the neighbors, three cases for updated energy can be formed from (6):
                           
                              Case 1: If the neighbor’s energy xij
                                 (t) is greater than xi
                                 (t) then the updated state xi
                                 (t
                                 +1) is also greater than its previous value xi
                                 (t): if xij
                                 (t)
                                 >
                                 
                                 xi
                                 (t), then xi
                                 (t
                                 +1)>
                                 xi
                                 (t). In this way, the updated value is increased.

Case 2: If the neighbor’s energy xij
                                 (t) is less than xi
                                 (t), then the updated state xi
                                 (t
                                 +1) is also less than its previous value xi
                                 (t): if xij
                                 (t)<
                                 xi
                                 (t), then xi
                                 (t
                                 +1)<
                                 xi
                                 (t). In this way, the updated value is decreased.

Case 3: If the neighbor’s energy xij
                                 (t) is equal to or approximately equal to xi
                                 (t), then the updated state xi
                                 (t
                                 +1) is also equal to or approximately equal to its previous value xi
                                 (t): if xij
                                 (t)≈
                                 xi
                                 (t), then xi
                                 (t
                                 +1)≈
                                 xi
                                 (t). In this way, the updated value is converged to a value of the neighbor’s energy.

It is evident in Cases 1 and 2 that, after each iteration, the updated value gets closer to all the neighbors, and once Case 3 is achieved, the converged value is x
                        ∗.

Because of the bounded variable step size, the exact performance of the GBCS is difficult to present. However, all CRUs finally achieve an average consensus of the initial states, and it can be approximated as shown in the subsequent paragraphs.

The algorithm in (6) can be written in this form:

The flowchart of the proposed GBCS is shown in Fig. 4
                        . The main advantage of our proposed scheme is that it does not require any prior knowledge of network topology. In a consensus-based scheme [14], the maximum degree of the network indicates the maximum number of nodes connected with a node that must be known to each CRU in order to converge to x
                        ∗. Our proposed algorithm can also achieve an exponential convergence rate.

Since x
                        ∗ is an average of Gaussian distributions, it also follows a Gaussian distribution with mean and variance given by

Generally, the performance of spectrum sensing is improved with an increase in sensing time. However, increasing sensing time further reduces access time, which results in lower effective throughput. Therefore, the convergence rate is an important issue in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed GBCS. The speed to converge x
                        ∗ is the key to the success of GBCS and the design of network topology.

                         is the Laplacian matrix of the graph formed by the CRUs. The convergence rate of such a graph is exponential according to the Perron Frobenius theorem [26].

The sensing capability of the CRUs is limited, and they cannot transmit and receive at the same time. Therefore, the CRUs need to sense the channel before every transmission for each frame. The frame is divided into three slots, i.e., local sensing, iterations to reach consensus, and transmission slot. In the local sensing slot of duration τs
                        , all of the CRUs simultaneously perform local spectrum sensing. In iterations to reach the consensus slot of duration τc
                        , each CRU
                           i
                         exchanges its energy state with its neighbors until the consensus is reached, and then it makes a final decision individually. Each CRU then transmits or keeps silent for the duration τt
                         depending upon the decision. There exists a sensing-throughput tradeoff, which has optimal τs
                        , in order to maximize the achievable throughput.

                        mi
                         at maximum. Let each iteration take time τit
                        , then τc

                        . The total time for N CRUs is N (τs
                        
                        +
                        τc

                        τt
                        ) at maximum. Therefore, the time complexity of GBCS can be obtained as O(N
                        2).

The energy consumed to reach a convergence point is a critical element in CRAHNs. Let Ps

                         is the transmission power that the CRU consumes for data transmission. Detailed energy consumption elements and parameters can be found in [27]. The total energy consumption to reach consensus is E

In the case of the consensus scheme, the energy consumed to propagate the degree of the network is also added to the total energy consumed to reach the point of convergence.

In the simulations, it was assumed that all CRUs experience AWGN, and each CRU
                        i
                      uses energy detection for its local observations. The value of energy Ei
                      depends on the average SNR 
                        
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        
                      and the time-bandwidth product TW. Furthermore, we assumed that every user had the same average SNR 
                        
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        
                     , which is 10dB. The CRUs were unaware of any relevant PU information, such as the position, moving direction, and moving velocity of the PU.

We compared the performance of GBCS with the consensus-based scheme, which is better than the OR-rule, the AND-rule, and the majority-rule cooperative sensing schemes [14] in many cases. During the first step of GBCS, each individual CRU performed energy detection with TW
                     =5 to acquire local information Ei
                      for the selected center frequency fs
                      and the bandwidth of interest W. The initial value of the energy vector xi
                     (0) was Ei
                     . During the second step, GBCS was performed on all of the CRUs. In the simulations, we considered the ad hoc network for which the topology is shown in Fig. 5
                     , where 10 CRUs established a graph, G
                     =
                     {N,
                     E}.


                     Fig. 6
                     (a) and (b) show the PU’s estimated energy in a 10-node network with the consensus-based scheme and GBCS, respectively. In both cases, the initially sensed energy at each CRU varied because of the different wireless channel conditions with different CRUs, but after several iterations, the energy sensed by all of the CRUs converged. The results show that the consensus-based scheme converged after about 37 iterations when the difference between the SUs was less than 1dB, which indicates that a consensus was achieved. In order to achieve the same convergence in the GBCS scheme, about 43 iterations were required, but information about the degree of the network was not required. In the consensus-based scheme, the step size “ε” has to be selected before the iterative process. The value of ε is between 0 and 1/Δ, where Δ is the maximum degree of the network.

For simulation purposes, we chose 0.19 as the best value of ε at the maximum degree of network Δ=5. This meant that the consensus-based scheme had to propagate information about the degree of the network before starting the iterative process. The GBCS scheme required a little more iteration to converge when compared with the consensus-based scheme, but it did not require any prior knowledge about the degree of the network. Whenever a CRU changes its position in mobile ad hoc networks, there may be a change in the degree of the network, and the degree of the network has to be shared with the nodes of the entire network. This increases the traffic in the network and also consumes more energy due to the additional data exchanges required to reach convergence.

When the number of nodes in the network is increased, the energy consumed to reach the convergence point also increases. Fig. 7
                      shows that, as the number of CRUs in the network increased, the energy consumed by the consensus-based scheme was approximately the same as that consumed by the GBCS scheme until the number of CRUs reached 30. The energy consumed by the consensus-based scheme increased exponentially when there were more than 30 CRUs whereas the energy consumed by the proposed GBCS was still linear. Whenever nodes change their positions or a new iterative process begins in the consensus-based scheme, they need to consume energy to propagate the degree of the network. GBCS does not require knowledge of the degree of the network, and it is more scalable than the consensus-based scheme.

The practical interest in cognitive radios is to determine the relationship between Pm
                      or Pd
                      and Pf
                     . Receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves plot Pf
                      against Pm
                      for a given average SNR and the time bandwidth product TW with varying thresholds [28]. Fig. 8
                      shows the ROCs of the proposed GBCS and the existing consensus-based scheme. In this scenario, it was assumed that the average SNR of all of the CRUs was 10dB. The result shows that the ROC performance of GBCS was as good as that of the consensus-based scheme with no requirement for any prior knowledge of network topology.

We then investigated the probability of detection performance to determine the sensitivity of detecting the PU’s presence. The average SNR varied from 5 to 15dB for all of the CRUs, and the decision threshold λ was set to maintain Pf
                     
                     =0.1. According to the draft IEEE 802.22 standard [29], the probability of false alarm and misdetection should be less than or equal to 0.1. The time-bandwidth product TW was set at 5. Fig. 9
                      shows that the detection probability of GBCS was approximately the same as that of the gradient-based scheme with an average SNR of 7dB and above. If the expected detection probability is 0.99, both the schemes require an average SNR of approximately 7dB. With an average SNR below 7dB, the consensus-based scheme performed slightly better than the proposed scheme. In practice, we could not adjust the threshold λ on demand with respect to the average SNR. We needed to identify a fixed threshold that could work robustly at any given SNR. We could set a robust threshold if we maintained the probability of misdetection and false alarm below a certain level.

In the simulation, we tried to maintain the probability of false alarm Pf
                      below 10−1 where all 10 users experienced the same SNR of 10dB. Fig. 10
                      shows that the proposed GBCS scheme performed much better than the existing consensus-based scheme in terms of the false alarm probability. With a fixed threshold of 11dB, we can see that, for the given SNR range, the proposed scheme produced a Pf
                      of about 0.07 compared with about 0.22 for the consensus-based scheme. At the same time, Pd
                      was approximately the same with an average SNR of more than 7dB for both schemes, as shown in Fig. 9.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we proposed a fully distributed and scalable scheme for spectrum sensing in ad hoc networks. In the proposed scheme, the CRUs exchange local sensing information with their neighbors and converge on a decision after several iterations without the aid of a central entity. The point of convergence is compared with a predetermined threshold to determine the presence or absence of a primary user. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

The major advantage of the proposed scheme is that it requires no prior knowledge of the degree of the network, which reduces energy consumption. We found that the results for the proposed scheme achieved a performance that matched that of the consensus-based scheme but with lower energy consumption. It was also shown that, with a fixed threshold, the Pf
                      of the proposed scheme was much lower than that of the existing consensus-based scheme while the Pd
                      was as high as that of the consensus-based scheme with various average SNRs.
