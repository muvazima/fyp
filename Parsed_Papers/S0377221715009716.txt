                  The main objective of this paper is to address, in an a continuous-time framework, the issue of using storable commodity futures as vehicles for hedging purposes when, in particular, the convenience yield as well as the market prices of risk evolve randomly over time. Following the martingale route and by operating a suitable constant relative risk aversion utility function (CRRA) specific change of numéraire, we solve the investor's dynamic optimization program to obtain quasi analytical solutions for optimal demands, which can be expressed in terms of two discount bonds (traded and synthetic). Contrary to the existing literature, we explicitly derive the individual optimal proportions invested in the spot commodity, in a discount bond and in the futures contracts, which can be computed in a simple recursive way. We suggest various decompositions allowing an investor to assess the sensitivity of the optimal demands to the state variables and to specify the role played by each risky asset. Empirical evidence shows that the convenience yield has a strong impact on the speculation and hedging positions and the interaction among time-varying risk premia determines the magnitude and the sign of these positions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Futures markets have experienced a dramatic growth, worldwide, of both trading volume and contracts written on a wide range of underlying assets. These features make it easier to use futures contracts as hedging instruments against unfavorable changes in the investment opportunity set, i.e. changes in state variables describing the economic/financial environment. The growing activity of these markets has been accompanied, since the original normal backwardation (Hicks, 1939; Keynes, 1930) and the theory of storage (Brennan, 1958; Kaldor, 1939; Working, 1949), by a substantial body of literature devoted to pricing and hedging with futures contracts. Especially, investments in commodity futures have, in recent years, risen significantly. Indeed, commodities are considered by fund managers as an alternative asset class to traditional assets such as stocks and bonds for two main reasons: they may improve (stocks and bonds) portfolio diversification benefits, and may be efficient hedging instruments against the inflation risk. However, investors are also exposed to commodities risk. Although, a growing theoretical and empirical literature examines these two aspects (see, for example, Andriosopoulos & Nomikos, 2014; Bae, Kim, & Mulvey, 2014; Bodie, 1983; Dai, 2009; Daskalaki & Skiadopoulos, 2011; Erb & Harvey, 2006; Geman & Kharoubi, 2008; Gorton & Rouwenhorst, 2006; Kat & Oomen, 2007), there is no paper, in an intertemporal framework, dealing with the question of how to hedge commodities risk. The main objective of this paper is to address, in a continuous-time context, the issue of using storable commodity futures, by an unconstrained investor, as vehicles for speculative and hedging purposes.

The recent high fluctuations in commodity prices have revived the interest in commodity risk management through essentially futures contracts. The convenience yield, in accordance with the theory of storage, turns out to be the crucial variable, which constitutes one of the main differences between commodity prices and prices of financial assets. Surprisingly, while there are a number of models dealing with futures hedging, to the best of our knowledge, the specific case of commodity futures contracts with a stochastic convenience yield has not yet been addressed in the relevant literature. However, it is widely recognized that it evolves randomly over time. Moreover, a growing number of empirical studies on commodity return predictability stress its important role (see, Besembinder & Chan, 1992; Fama & French, 1987; Hong & Yogo, 2010; Khan, Khokher, & Simin, 2007). In addition, the evidence of predictability is consistent with time varying risk premia in commodities. In our environment, to the extent that spot prices, futures prices and inventory decisions are related (see, for example, Brennan, 1958; Litzenberger & Rabinowitz, 1995; Routledge, Seppi, & Spatt, 2000), we would expect market prices of risk to be stochastic. This is in line with some papers studying asset allocation with time varying prices of risk (see, for instance, Kim & Omberg, 1996; Lioui & Poncet, 2001; Liu, 2007; Munk & Sorensen, 2004; Sangvinatsos & Wachter, 2005; Wachter, 2002).

This paper provides a model of optimal demand that could better account for the way both the stochastic convenience yield and stochastic (affine) market prices of risk affect the optimal demand of an unconstrained investor
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        Other models examining dynamic asset allocation with futures (see, among others, Adler and Detemple, 1988a, b; Duffie and Jackson, 1990; Briys et al., 1990; Duffie and Richardson, 1991; Lioui et al., 1996) deal with a constraint investor.
                     . In order to do so, following the reference models in the literature (Casassus & Collin-Dufresne, 2005; Hilliard & Reis, 1998; Schwartz, 1997), the economic framework retains the spot commodity price, the instantaneous interest rate and the convenience yield as the relevant imperfectly correlated mean-reverting state variables associated with the dynamics of the futures price. The optimal demand for commodity futures contracts is derived for an investor who maximizes the expected constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function of her (his) lifetime consumption and final wealth by following the no-arbitrage martingale approach (Cox & Huang, 1989; Karatzas, Lehoczky, & Shreve, 1987). This framework takes into account the main characteristics of commodity markets and provides explicit solutions up to resolution of ordinary differential equation (ODEs) (see Liu, 2007) for the optimal demand, which is classically composed of a speculative part and of a hedging term.

We estimate the parameters of the model by using weekly data on U.S. Treasury bills and on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light sweet crude oil futures contracts traded on ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) for the period 2001–2010. Since the spot price, the short rate, and the convenience yield are not directly observable, the estimation is based on the Kalman filter method, which is the appropriate method when state variables are not observable and are Markovian (see, for instance, Manoliu & Tompaidis, 2002; Schwartz, 1997; Trolle & Schwartz, 2009). The results show mean reversion in the short rate and the convenience yield. They also reveal that risk premia are time varying amplifying mean reversion in these variables. The spot price is positively correlated with the convenience yield (theory of storage), while, as Frankel and Hardouvelis (1985) have suggested, it is negatively correlated with the short rate.

A thorough study of the speculative and of the hedging components allows us to enrich the analysis of optimal demands by going beyond the existing studies by suggesting various decompositions. Usually, in a continuous-time framework, papers obtain general formulae for these two components without deriving specific formulae for each risky asset. In the case of futures contracts for a constrained investor, Adler and Detemple (1988a, 1988b) suggested expressions for the futures contract and the spot. We generalize this result along the lines of our framework by deducing the individual speculative and hedging proportions invested in the spot commodity, a discount bond and the futures contract, which may be computed in a useful recursive way underlying the interactions between risky assets demands and by taking into account some commodity markets features. In particular, empirical estimations reveal that mean-reversion in the state variables and in the prices of risk as well as the correlation between the assets determine the sign of the speculative and hedging positions.

As a consequence of the calculation of the individual proportions for each asset, our analysis clarifies the role played by the primitive assets and the futures contract when speculating and hedging. Our analysis also calls into question Breeden (1984) result according to which the primitive assets are ineffective in hedging the risk of the state variables. Indeed, it assigns primitive assets and the futures contract a specific task: hedging the risk of the state variables.

An important question is to know how state variables affect optimal demands. In other words, what are the implications of the predictive variables on optimal demands? In our model, the investor is able to assess the sensitivity of the optimal demand, through the sensitivity of an investor-specific bond (synthetic), to the state variables and can therefore rule on the relevance of the investment opportunity set. Estimation shows that the convenience yield has a strong effect on the speculative and on the hedging proportions.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the economic framework is described and the investor's optimization problem is formulated. Section 3 is devoted to the derivation of the optimal asset allocation for the unconstrained investor. The estimation of the parameters of the model and a discussion of the behavior of optimal demands, based on those estimations, are given in Section 4. Section 5 offers some concluding remarks and suggests some potential future extensions.

The market prices of risk associated with the state variables are stochastic and, following the relevant literature, are affine functions of the variables. Assuming random prices of risk differentiates our model from the vast majority of the models exploring commodity futures pricing (a notable exception is Casassus & Collin-Dufresne, 2005). More significantly, with regard to our study, stochastic prices of risk related to each state variable also distinguish our model from those dealing with dynamic asset allocation and hedging, which usually consider only one stochastic price of risk (see also Liu, 2007; Sangvinatsos & Wachter, 2005). This will have key implications on the investor's optimal portfolio rules. To characterize the dependence of the spot price on the level of inventories (see, for instance, Brennan, 1958; Szymanowska, De Roon, Nijman, & Van den Goorbergh, 2014), the price of risk associated with the (log) of the spot price process is an affine function of its level and of that of the convenience yield:

                      are the diffusion vectors of the discount bond and the futures price respectively.

Since we are interested in futures contracts, the futures price changes are credited to or debited from a margin account with interest at the continuously compounded interest rate r(t). The futures contract is indeed assumed to be marked to market continuously, and then to have always a zero current value. The current value of the margin account, M(t), is then equal to

Having described the economic framework, we shall examine the optimal consumption and portfolio strategy problem for our unconstrained investor when the financial market is dynamically complete.

Given the CRRA utility function and the numéraire portfolio G(t), the solution to the static problem (8), which is a standard Lagrangian optimization problem, determines the investor's optimal consumption and wealth at time t:

The expression of Φ(γ, t, TI
                     ) is similar to that derived by Munk and Sørensen (2004). However, the resolution of the expectation in Φ(γ, t, TI
                     ) may be simplified by making an appropriate change of probability measure. This change holds for any diffusion process and for any price of risk. We suggest the measure

                     , called the CRRA TI
                     -forward probability measure or the CRRA-forward measure (upon request from the authors). Detemple and Rindisbacher (2010) have substantially generalized the work of Lioui and Poncet (2001) and Munk and Sorensen (2004) by using the forward probability measure (Geman, El Karoui, & Rochet, 1995; Jamshidian, 1989) and a zero-coupon bond, B(t, TI
                     ), as numéraire, to derive optimal portfolio rules in a very general setting for non-Markovian processes and for concave non-specified utility functions. To obtain optimal demands, Björk, Davis, and Landén (2008), Rodriguez (2002), Stoikov and Zariphopoulou (2005) have used a change of probability measure related to a CRRA utility function, but in this paper, we attempt to clarify this change of measure.

                     ), which results from the agent's consumption-investment problem solution, is investor-specific, since it is a function of her (his) risk aversion coefficient and horizon. As its expression, is formally similar to that of a discount bond, it will be qualified to as the investor-specific discount bond. Bγ
                     (t, TI
                     ) is stochastic because of the stochastic character of the prices of risk. For a more risk-averse investor than the logarithmic utility agent (γ > 1), yγ
                     (t, TI
                     ) > 0, and Bγ
                     (t, TI
                     ) is like a discounting factor. Conversely, for γ < 1, yγ

                     ) < 0, and Bγ
                     (t, TI

                     (t, TI
                     ) may be considered as a state variable incorporating the risk generated by the prices of risk and the yield curve. Under

                     , the investor's optimization problem consists in calculating two bonds. The first is a discount bond with a maturity date equal to the investor's horizon and is associated with interest rate risk (see Detemple & Rindisbacher, 2010; Lioui & Poncet, 2001; Munk & Sørensen, 2004), while the second is an investor-specific discount “bond” (synthetic) reflecting time-variation in the prices of risk. Although Bγ
                     (t, TI
                     ) is not a traded asset, it can be, however, manufactured, in a complete market, by existing securities. The investor's consumption-wealth problem reduces to the computation of the two bonds, which, by referring to the yield curve literature, is well-known and does not require a specific method.

                      denote the proportions of the total wealth invested in the commodity, the discount bond and the futures contract respectively. In the sequel of the paper, we shall distinguish the speculative proportions, πMV
                     (t), from the hedging proportions, πHIR
                     (t), related to B(t, TI
                     ) and those, πHMPR
                     (t), related to Bγ
                     (t, TI
                     ). In order to optimally determine these proportions, the investor solves the static program (8). The result obtained is presented in the following proposition.

Similar results can be found in other papers. The main important difference is that these results are expressed in terms of the two discount bonds. As shown in Proposition 1, the optimal demand for risky assets (Eq. 17) can be decomposed into two parts. The first one is the traditional mean-variance speculative portfolio proportional to the investor's risk tolerance, whereas the second part is a hedge portfolio. Under the CRRA-forward measure, the investor does not hedge against changes in each and every variable, but rather (s)he hedges against unfavorable shifts in Φ(γ, t, TI
                     ), which encompasses all the uncertainty in the investment opportunity set.


                     Φ(γ, t, TI
                     ) depends on the two bonds, B(t, TI
                     ) and Bγ
                     (t, TI
                     ). These two bonds represent, under the CRRA-forward measure, the two sources of risk in the economy. As a consequence, the hedging demand can be split in two components. The first one reveals how the investor should optimally hedge against random fluctuations in the instantaneous return of B(t, TI
                     ). The second ingredient hedges against the risk generated by Bγ
                     (t, TI
                     ) and arises because the prices of risk are stochastic. Although this term is similar in essence to that of other articles, since it captures the risk associated with the prices of risk, it is expressed in a different manner in our paper as a result of the change of the probability measure operated. In Detemple and Rindisbacher (2010) model this component has been couched in terms of the density of the forward measure, while our formula (20) highlights the role played by Bγ
                     (t, TI
                     ). In Lioui and Poncet (2001) paper this addend depends on an unknown volatility function of the forward measure density, which was left unspecified. In contrast, we explicitly specify the volatility

                              )
                           
                        
                     . Munk and Sørensen (2004) have derived their solution as a function of “a coupon bond paying a continuous coupon k(t) up to time T and a lump sum payment k(T) at time T” without distinguishing, however, the two bonds.

The next propositions are devoted to a thorough study of the speculative and hedging terms. They try to elucidate the consequences on these terms of the stochastic opportunity set, especially the stochastic convenience yield, to highlight the role played by the traded primitive assets and the futures contract as speculative and hedging instruments, and, for practical considerations, to implement these terms. Moreover, Proposition 1 does not allow an investor to compute the optimal proportions for each risky asset. In this respect, we extend the previous literature (see also Adler & Detemple, 1988a, 1988b) by deriving individual weighs for each asset.

To achieve these goals, two assets may be introduced into our analysis whose prices are denoted Bu
                     (t, TB
                     ) and Hv
                     (t, TH
                     ). These assets are assumed to be cash assets, i.e., they are not marked to market, and can be duplicated by a portfolio of four assets, namely the riskless asset, the discount bond with maturity TB
                     , the spot commodity and the futures contracts. They reflect orthogonal risks associated with the Brownian motions which are not correlated with the other variables. The first asset is associated with the orthogonal risk of the interest rate, while the second one is linked to that of the convenience yield. Note that the existing spot commodity spans the risk of zS
                     (t).

This formulation is useful for computational purposes since speculative demands are expressed in terms of excess returns, volatilities and covariances, and they are calculated in a recursive way: the speculative demand of futures contracts is first derived, which allows one then to determine that of the discount bond and finally the proportion of the spot commodity can be obtained as a function of the other two demands.

The investor's speculative demand consists of a fund including an element specific to the futures contract and a component proper to the two primitive risky assets. This decomposition sheds light on the role played by the orthogonal risks captured by the two replicable assets and the spot commodity. The speculative demand for the futures contract depends on the excess return and the variance of the synthetic asset, Hv
                     (t, TH
                     ). It reflects the investor's anticipations about the orthogonal source of uncertainty of the convenience yield. The futures contract is thus the sole asset that will be used by the investor to directly form her (his) expectations about the future evolution of the convenience yield. The speculative demand for the discount bond (Eq. 22) is a function of the excess return and the variance of the synthetic asset, Bu
                     (t, TB
                     ), which spans the orthogonal risk of the interest rate. Because of the correlation of the futures contract with the short rate,

                      is, however, modified by a second term. This additional term involves the mean-variance portfolio for futures contracts weighted by the usual covariance/variance ratio. A similar argument applies to the speculative demand for commodities. The excess return of the spot commodity divided by its variance, spanning the risk of the commodity, is now adjusted by two terms since the spot commodity is correlated with both the futures contract and the discount bond.

                     Proposition 3 above has the traditional Merton-Breeden elements flavor as it disentangles the hedging proportions in terms of the sensitivity to each and every state variable. However, in sharp contrast to these elements, our optimal hedging proportions inherit the advantages of Proposition 1, in that they depend on the features of the two bonds above mentioned.

According to this proposition, the hedging demand for the discount bond (Eq. 24) is the only one including a term that hedges the risk due to the stochastic nature of the interest rate through B(t, TI
                     ) (see Lioui & Poncet, 2001). Parts (b) and (c) indicate that the hedging term that stems from the stochastic character of Bγ
                     (t, TI
                     ) may admit two different decompositions. The first, in the spirit of the speculative components, expresses the hedging terms in a recursive way for each risky security and the three assets serve to hedge the orthogonal risk of the three state variables. Our proportions differ markedly from those of Breeden (1984), who, in his study, considers futures contracts with an instantaneous maturity perfectly correlated with the state variables. This particular definition implies that the demand for the primitive assets that serve to hedge state variables disappears. In contrast, our investor elaborates her (his) strategy by including those assets in order to hedge against the risk of the variables.

The second decomposition, given in expression (26), separates the hedging addend into three addends focusing on their sensitivity of these to each and every state variable. In the light of expression (26’), this decomposition appears in a natural way and admits an economic interpretation. The investor seeks an insurance against the random shifts in the price of the investor-specific bond, which involves the variables. The hedging demands

In this section, to get more insights into the behavior of optimal demands (the speculative and the hedging components), we estimate the parameters of our model for crude oil futures prices. We first describe the data before briefly presenting the estimation procedure and the Kalman filter method. Finally, we discuss our results.

The data used to calibrate our model consists of futures contracts traded on ICE from 2001/01/05 to 2010/12/31 for WTI light sweet crude oil. In 2001, 42 contracts were listed, while 78 contracts were listed in 2010 with a maturity from 1 month to 9 years. However, futures contracts with a maturity greater than 2 years are characterized by a low degree of liquidity. Consequently, for the estimation procedure, we retain 24 listed contracts with a maturity up to 24 months (CL1 to CL24) and use weekly data for futures prices (522 observations). The maturity of futures contracts varies across time because the last trading day is not a fixed day. The last trading day is the 4th US business day prior to the 25th calendar day of the month preceding the contract month.

WTI futures prices dramatically increased from 2001 to July 2008, when prices reached a peak, then prices sharply decreased until February 2009, before increasing again for the rest of the period. The interest rate data consists of constant-maturity Treasury yields. The corresponding zero-coupon yields or spot rates are derived by using first a linear interpolation to account for missing maturities and then the bootstrap method. We construct spot rates with maturities of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years.


                        Table 1
                         contains some descriptive statistics for spot rates for each maturity and for the (log) futures prices for different contract maturities. The skewness is positive and decreasing for spot rates until 2 years and then becomes negative and increasing in absolute values, while the kurtosis lies below 3 (except for 10 years, 3.052). Futures prices are characterized by a mean between 49 and 50 dollars and by a volatility slightly increasing with the maturity of the futures contract. The skewness is negative and increases, in absolute values, with the contracts maturity from –0.125 for a 1 month to –0.241 for 24 months. The kurtosis lies below 3 and is positive and decreasing. To test for the normality assumption of both the spot rates and the futures prices, we use the Jarque-Bera (JB) normality test. As can be seen in Table 2
                        , the values of the JB statistic are much higher than the critical value (9.21) at the significance level of 1 percent. Thus spot rates and oil futures prices distribution deviates from a normal distribution.

The estimation of the model parameters is accomplished in a two-step procedure. First, as there is a unique interest rate whatever the commodity, we separately estimate the parameters of the short rate process. Second, we estimate the parameters of the spot price and the convenience yield by using those of the short rate. In the two steps, the Kalman filtering approach is employed. Among the first authors to adopt this method were, for instance, Pennacchi (1991) and Babbs and Nowman (1999) for term structure estimation, and Schwartz (1997) for commodities.

The discrete-time Kalman filter is an estimation methodology for recursively calculating optimal estimates of unobserved state variables given the information provided by noisy observations. The unobserved state variables – on the one hand, the short rate, and, on the other hand, the (log)spot commodity price and the convenience yield – follow a stochastic process, called the transition equation, which is a discrete time version of the continuous time stochastic processes (1)–(3). The observed variables –on the one hand, spot rates, and, on the other hand futures prices– are related to unobserved variables by a measurement equation.

The zero coupon yields can be written:

The estimation of model parameters is obtained by maximizing the log-likelihood function of innovations.


                        Table 3
                         presents the parameter estimates of the spot price, the short rate and the convenience yield, the estimated standard deviations of the measurement errors, ε, and the log-likelihood value. Standard errors are given in parentheses. As can be seen, all the parameters are statistically significant except for the long-term level of the interest rate. However, the speed parameters α and k are positive and highly significant, which suggests that both the short rate and the convenience yield follow a mean-reverting process. The risk premia are significant implying that they are time-varying. It is worth pointing out, however, that, contrary to Casasus and Colin-Dufresne (2005), 
                           
                              
                                 λ

                                    X

                              −
                              0.03
                           
                         is very low and thus the price of risk related to the spot price is slightly time-varying.

                                    X
                                    δ

                         induces mean-reversion in the spot price relative to the level of the convenience yield (see Bessembinder, Coughenour, Seguin, & Smoller, 1995; Cassasus & Collin-Dufresne, 2005).

The correlation coefficient between the spot price and the convenience yield is high and positive since the convenience yield and the spot price are related through inventory decisions (e.g. Routledge et al., 2000). The correlation between interest rates and spot prices is negative in accordance with Frankel and Hardouvelis (1985) who have argued that high real interest rates reduce commodity prices, and vice-versa.

To analyze the impact of risk aversion, optimal demands are depicted for four degrees of relative risk aversion (RRA): 
                           
                              γ
                              =
                              1
                           
                         for a logarithmic utility function, 
                           
                              γ
                              =
                              0.7
                           
                        for less risk-averse investors (than the Bernoulli one) in order to avoid an explosion of the indirect utility function for too low values of γ (see Kim & Omberg, 1996) and 
                           
                              γ
                              =
                              3
                              ,
                              
                              6
                           
                         for more risk averse agents. When studying the optimal proportions as a function of the investment horizon, we let this horizon vary in the interval TI
                         ∈ [0, 2] and we set the maturity of the futures contract and the discount bond to expire one month and five years respectively after the end of the investor's horizon. Moreover, η = 0.03 and a = 0.3. To save space and because the influence of the interest rate is not at the heart of our study, we shall then omit the figures related to the short rate and shall mainly focus our analysis on the influence of the spot commodity price (ranging from 45 to 120 dollars) and the convenience yield (varying between –5 percent and +15 percent), first, on the speculative demands, and, second, on the hedging terms.


                        Figs. 1 through 4 picture the impact of the changes of the state variables and of the γ parameter on the speculative demand. We set the investor's horizon

                        , ceteris paribus. As expected, the mean variance components are inversely related to γ and tend to zero as γ goes to infinity. These figures reveal that the speculative futures position,

In contrast to the spot price, the effect of the convenience yield on the speculative positions is substantial. Indeed, in this case, δ(t) affects these positions via both λX
                        (t) and λδ
                        (t). The coefficients

                        , although they have an opposite sign, the two coefficients amplify the impact of δ(t). Moreover, an inspection of Figs. 3
                         and 4
                         shows that there exists a critical value of δ(t) separating positive from negative speculative demands. In other words, depending on the convenience yield level, it is the interaction between the prices of risk in conjunction with their mean-reverting behavior that determines whether the speculator goes short or long.

The reactions of the hedging addends associated with the investor-specific bond to the changes of the state variables for different values of the γ parameter are displayed in Figs. 5–8
                        . The impact of the variables on these terms is similar to that of the speculative components. As expected, they vanish for γ=1 and have an opposite sign depending on whether the investor is more risk-averse (γ>1) or more risk-tolerant (γ<1). When γ>1, an investor facing unfavorable states of the world wishes to hedge against this adverse evolution of the investment opportunity set. By contrast, when γ < 1, an investor prefers to benefit from favorable states of the world and, hence, from a “good” investment opportunity set. As can be seen in Fig. 5, for γ > 1 (γ < 1),

                        (t, TI
                        ) to δ(t) is also negative. Thus for γ > 1 (γ < 1), the futures contract hedging proportion is positive (negative) and it is added (subtracted) to (from) the mean variance efficient term. Conversely (see Fig. 6
                        ), the sensitivity of Bγ
                        (t, TI
                        ) to the spot price is positive and therefore, for γ > 1 (γ < 1),

                         is negative (positive). The explanation of the influence of the convenience yield on hedging demands is analogous to that of the impact of the spot price.

The hedging demands exhibit some similar features to those reported, though in a different context, among others, by Campbell and Viceira (1999), Kim and Omberg (1996), Wachter (2002) and Sangvinatsos and Wachter (2005). First, the hedging terms lie, for γ = 6, between those for γ = 0 and γ = 3 meaning that for risk-averse agents, beyond a certain level of RRA, the hedging demand decreases. Indeed, for high degrees of risk aversion, investors privilege less risky assets whatever the level of the sate variables. Second, in a particular region of the state variables the hedging proportions behave in a different manner than that above mentioned. For example, as can be seen in Figs. 7
                         and 8
                        , for some negative values of the convenience yield, a more risk-averse and a more risk-tolerant investor may both have a short or a long position. These authors have provided an explanation in terms of mean-reversion in the state variables (please refer to these authors). Finally,

                         are not monotonic in TI
                         (Figs. 11 and 12): they are humped or inverted humped for a very short horizon, while for longer horizons they evolve smoothly.

A clear distinction can be drawn between the mean-variance elements related to the interest rate (figures not reproduced here) from those associated with the spot commodity and the futures contract (Figs. 9
                         and 10
                        
                        
                        ). The latter are non-linear and sharply increase or decrease for a short horizon but they rapidly reach an asymptote for a longer term. This is due to the pattern of the synthetic assets price volatility, σHv
                        (t, TH
                        ): it flattens for a long horizon but is highly non-linear when the horizon shrinks. In contrast, the terms relative to the short rate are almost linear as functions of the volatility of the bond, which slowly varies with the horizon.

In this paper, optimal hedging decisions involving storable commodity futures contracts have been studied in a continuous-time environment (i) for an unconstrained investor with a CRRA utility function, (ii) when spot prices, interest rates and, especially, the convenience yield evolve randomly over time, (iii) and when the prices of risk associated with the state variables are stochastic. In this setting, a suitable CRRA specific change of a martingale measure allows us to express the results in terms of two bonds (a discount bond and a synthetic bond) facilitating the resolution of the investor's allocation problem. Moreover, we complement the existing literature by deriving explicit proportions (speculative and hedging) for each risky asset, which can be couched in a recursive way improving the tractability of the model, and by computing the sensitivity of optimal demands to the state variables. Empirical evidence, by using data on crude oil from 2001 to 2010, suggests time-varying prices of risk and mean reversion in the spot commodity price and the convenience yield. However, contrary to the convenience yield, we found a weak dependence of the price of risk associated with the spot price on its level. The convenience yield has therefore a strong influence on both the speculative and the hedging components.

The economic framework of this paper can be extended in several directions. First, the general setting may usefully be adapted to the investor's allocation problem by including commodities in a portfolio of stocks and bonds (see, Dai, 2009). Second, observed commodities characteristics may be taken into account. For instance, commodities markets are highly volatile and spot assets exhibit jumps (see, for instance, Hilliard & Reis, 1998; Trolle & Schwartz, 2009). The effect of jumps on the optimal asset allocation with commodities remains an open question. Third, commodity markets are characterized by tranquil periods or by periods with high fluctuations. In order to model two different economic regimes, a mixture of two multivariate Gaussian distributions could be employed (see, for example, Buckley, Saunders, & Seco, 2008; Jun Fu, Wei, & Yang, 2014). Fourth, as other financial assets, commodities returns are not normally distributed and investors are aware of higher moments of return distributions. Studying the impact of higher moments on optimal demands should enhance the analysis (Briec, Kerstens, & Van de Woestyne, 2013).
