On the other hand, our method is based on the Allen–Cahn equation, which has been applied in image segmentation due to its motion by mean curvature property. We modify the original Allen–Cahn equation by multiplying a control function to restrict the evolution within a narrow band around the given surface data set. To improve the numerical stability of our proposed model, we split the governing equation into linear and nonlinear terms and use an operator splitting technique. The linear equation is solved by the multigrid method which is a fast solver and the nonlinear equation is solved analytically. The unconditional stability of the proposed scheme is also proved. Various numerical results are presented to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The industry of rapid prototyping and 3D printing has emerged in past years, and the 3D printing technology to visualize objects in space is now one of the issues in mathematics [1] and computer science [2]. This work has been motivated by the need for 3D printing [3,4] from surface data. The basic mechanism of the 3D printer is that it builds up the object layer by layer. However, a surface is two-dimensional (see Fig. 1
                     (a)) and its slices are in general one-dimensional, which 3D printer cannot build up a three-dimensional object. Hence, to print the surface with a 3D printer, we need to thicken up the surface and make a surface embedding narrow volume (Fig. 1(b)). Fig. 1(c) shows a physical model manufactured from the proposing mathematical model. Even though we were motivated by 3D surface printing, our proposing algorithm is general so that the algorithm can be applied to other applications such as geometry processing [5], tolerance analysis in machine processing [6], and collision detection [7,8].

Up to now, a great number of algorithms have been proposed to solve the offset surface reconstruction problems. In [9], Liu and Wang approximated both the zero-level surface and its offset surface using an implicit function. They also developed a fast offset surface generation method via a narrow band signed distance-field [10]. In addition, Chen and Wang proposed thickening operations to convert a surface to a solid [11] and introduced a uniform offsetting model [12]. It enables to generate both grown and shrunk models from arbitrary offset distance. Curless and Levoy developed two important techniques for reconstructing complex and accurate models from scanned objects: spacetime analysis, d based on analyzing the time evolution of the structured light reflections [13], and a volumetric space carving technique for integrating several data into a single geometric model [14]. Lien [15] and Varadhan and Manocha [16] demonstrated representations of the Minkowski sum boundary. To get high-quality offsets, an adaptive octree-structure was used for distance bounds in [17]. Small and thin features were detected by subdivisional methods [18,19]. For some other considerations of offset surface reconstruction, we also refer to [20,21]. Recently, Wang and Manocha [22] presented a highly parallel method to compute the approximate offsetting on models represented by structured points in layered depth images (LDIs). The main idea is to compute the super-union of all the balls centered at the sample points, which can be conducted efficiently on the graphics processing unit with LDI representation. As compared to prior CPU-based approximation offsetting algorithms, their approach results in more than 100 times speedups.

Our approach is basically an implicit representation of interface as an isosurface of the level set function [23–25]. The level set method for numerical interface evolution has been successfully used for surface reconstruction, including texture objects [26–31]. Zhao et al. solved shape reconstruction problems by using a minimal-surface-like model and the level set method [30,31]. However, for offset surface reconstruction problem, the calculation of unsigned distance function is a challenging problem because the offset distance is generally small and the given surface is not closed. To solve these problems, we present a novel fast and accurate numerical method for surface embedding narrow volume reconstruction from an unorganized surface data set. Our method is based on the Allen–Cahn (AC) equation [32], which has been applied to image processing problems such as segmentation, denoising, and inpainting [33–39]. We choose the AC equation because it has intrinsic smoothing effect on interfacial transition layers and its fast and accurate hybrid numerical solver is available [40]. We modify the original AC equation by multiplying a control function to restrict the evolution within a narrow band around the given surface data set. The stability of numerical schemes for equations is very important. Explicit time integration schemes are generally only conditionally stable and require small time steps to insure numerical stability. Using an operator splitting technique, we propose the scheme that allows the use of a sufficiently large time step without the technical limitations. We also prove the unconditional stability of the proposed scheme.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe the main governing equation and we describe the numerical solution and prove its unconditional stability. In Section 3, we perform some characteristic numerical experiments for volume reconstruction. Finally, our conclusion is given in Section 4.

A simplest method for the volume reconstruction is to find an unsigned distance function from S, and then we define the volume bounded by the isosurface of the function at an order of h value. For better visualization, let us consider the simplest method in two-dimensional space. Fig. 2
                        (a) shows S. Include S by a domain 
                           
                              Ω
                           
                         and discretize the domain with 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Ω

                         (open circles in Fig. 2(b)). Then define the unsigned discrete distance function on

To overcome this non-smoothness of the isosurface and get a smooth narrow volume embedding unorganized point data set, we propose the following modified Allen–Cahn model with Neumann boundary condition:

We start with an example, which shows the basic mechanism of the algorithm, Eqs. (8) and (11). Let us consider a half sphere whose center is placed at

                     , we show the evolution of zero level set of

                     . Columns (a)–(c) are at initial, two iterations, and four iterations, respectively. In the middle row we show the zero contours of

                      plane. From the results in Fig. 5(c), we observe that the positive and negative values of the right term in Eq. (2) imply that

From left to right, they are input data set, initial reconstruction, final reconstruction, and the comparison with initial data set, respectively. The computation takes eight iterations on the domain

                     Fig. 7
                      shows the reconstruction of Costa–Hoffman–Meeks surface with genus two and engine surfaces. The initial data set is computed by using Mathematica software, and the other is taken from [46]. In each row, surface data set, initial reconstruction, and final reconstructed surface are shown. From the initial reconstruction result of engine, we can observe wrinkling surface. However, after eight iterations, we have smooth surface as shown in the last column of Fig. 7.

From left to right, they are initial data set, final reconstruction, cut and cross views of final offsetting surface, respectively. The initial data sets are taken from [46]. As can be seen, our proposed approach reconstructs the offsetting surface with a uniform distance.

                      grid. Fig. 9(a)–(c) are the plot of input data set which is taken from [47], isosurfaces of distance function, and final reconstruction, respectively. The computation takes 10 iterations. We can see that our proposed method can handle the complex topology and the reconstructed surface is very smooth compared to the result obtained by using an unsigned distance function.

Next, Table 1
                      gives the information of the number of data points, the iteration numbers, and the CPU times. The CPU times (seconds) of our calculations, which are performed in 
                        
                           C

                     , are measured on a 3GHz with 3G of RAM. As can be seen from Table 1, the robustness of our proposed method is observed, as expected from the unconditionally stable discrete schemes.

To test the accuracy of our proposed method, we consider a test with three synthetic surfaces, which are cube, sphere, and cylinder. The side length of cube, the radius of sphere, the radius of cylinder, and the height of cylinder are the same as 0.35. We define the error

                      are numerical and exact grown surface points. Similarly, negative superscript denotes shrunk surface error. See [12] for more details about grown and shrunk surfaces. The errors obtained using these definitions are given in Table 2
                     . Here we use the offset distance 
                        
                           l
                           =
                           0.05
                        
                      and thickness 
                        
                           ∊
                           =
                           0.005
                        
                     . The numerical results are qualitatively in good agreement with the theoretical values.

In practice, there are outliers or conflicting points into an unorganized point cloud. In Fig. 10
                     (a)–(c), we show offset surface reconstructions with 5%, 10% and 
                        
                           15
                           %
                        
                      random noises. From top to bottom, they are the contour plots of initial shape, the final shape, and plane views in the 
                        
                           y
                           =
                           0.5
                        
                      with data points. These results suggest that our proposed method can successfully reconstruct the uniform and smooth offset surface. It should be noted that the higher noise level leads to thicker embedding volumes.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this article, we proposed a novel fast and accurate numerical method for the surface embedding narrow volume reconstruction from unorganized points. The method is based on the Allen–Cahn equation with a control function, which restricts the evolution to the offset regions. The proposed method can deal with non-closed surfaces and do not have self-intersection problems. To overcome the time step restriction, we used an operator splitting technique and proved its unconditional stability. Various numerical experiments were presented to demonstrate the strengths of the proposed method. In future work, to speed up the computation, we will investigate GPU implementation of the current algorithm as done in [22].
