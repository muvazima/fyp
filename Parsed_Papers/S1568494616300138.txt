               Abstract
               
                  Stereo vision systems are utilized since it provides contactless measurements of objects in 3-D (three-dimensional). Orthognathic surgery is a very sensitive operation that requires very high accuracy in measurements. The reduction of measurement error is an essential problem in orthognathic surgery. Moreover, quality inspection of the process during the course of operation aids the surgeon to avoid or minimize the mitigating circumstances. In this paper, artificial intelligence methods (neural network and neuro-fuzzy system) are used in order to increase the accuracy of positioning of jaws during the real-time practice. The comparison of artificial measurements with the real measurements shows that a statistically acceptable accuracy is achieved in 3-D positioning of teeth.
