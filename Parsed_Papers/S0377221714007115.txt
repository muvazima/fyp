                  The theory of aggregation most often deals with measures of central tendency. However, sometimes a very different kind of a numeric vector’s synthesis into a single number is required. In this paper we introduce a class of mathematical functions which aim to measure spread or scatter of one-dimensional quantitative data. The proposed definition serves as a common, abstract framework for measures of absolute spread known from statistics, exploratory data analysis and data mining, e.g. the sample variance, standard deviation, range, interquartile range (IQR), median absolute deviation (MAD), etc. Additionally, we develop new measures of experts’ opinions diversity or consensus in group decision making problems. We investigate some properties of spread measures, show how are they related to aggregation functions, and indicate their new potentially fruitful application areas.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many introductory textbooks on applied statistics (or academic lectures on the subject) include a review of the so-called descriptive statistics, i.e. methods for summarizing quantitative data. Most often such methods are divided into at least two classes (cf. Aczel, 1996, Chap. 1 and e.g. Cramér, 1946):

                        
                           1.
                           
                              measures of central tendency
(also known as measures of location or centrality of observations); e.g. sample quantiles (including median, min, and max), arithmetic mean, mode, trimmed and winsorized mean etc.,


                              measures of variability (or data spread), e.g. range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation.

At the most general level, the process of combining multiple numeric values into a single, representative number is called aggregation. The theory of aggregation became a genuine, rapidly developing research field in the 1980s (see e.g. Beliakov, Pradera, & Calvo, 2007; Calvo, Mayor, & Mesiar, 2002; Grabisch, Marichal, Mesiar, & Pap, 2009; 2011a; 2011b). It may be observed, however, that the aggregation theory mainly focuses on the above-mentioned measures of central tendency, e.g. generalized means (OWA, OWMax operators, quasi-arithmetic means, etc.), averages, or “averaging functions”. Such a broad class of tools is characterized by the following widely accepted definition of an aggregation function (see Grabisch et al., 2009, Def. 1.1).

It is true that these characteristic properties reflect somehow the concept of data synthesis: finding a value representative to the whole vector. Moreover, it is well-known that such functions are strongly connected to monotone (fuzzy) measures and integrals (cf. e.g. Greco, Mesiar, & Rindone, 2014).

Aggregation functions have many successful applications, for example in multicriteria or group decision making, statistics, quality management, engineering, approximate reasoning, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic (cf. the notion of a t-norm and t-conorm, which are particular aggregation functions in [0, 1]2), etc.

                        Example 1
                        In a group decision making problem, assume that n decision makers express as x
                           1, …, xn
                            ∈ [0, 1] the strength of preference toward an alternative. An aggregation function may be used to combine these assessments in order to obtain a global score 
                              
                                 A
                                 (
                                 
                                    x
                                    1
                                 
                                 ,
                                 …
                                 ,
                                 
                                    x
                                    n
                                 
                                 )
                              
                           . For example, let n = 4 and x = (1, 1, 1, 0). If all the experts have the same standing, one may use e.g. the arithmetic mean to combine their opinions; in such a case we get 
                              
                                 A

                                 )

                           . However, assume that the fourth decision maker is conceived as less competent (at least in a given matter) than the other ones, or his/her opinion has lower significance for some other reason (see e.g. Bernasconi, Choirat, & Seri, 2014; Saaty, 1994). If e.g. a weighting vector w = (2/7, 2/7, 2/7, 1/7) describes the importance of the respective judges, then by calculating the weighted mean we get

It is evident that to understand the very nature of aggregation processes better, as well as to meet the practitioners’ needs, we should explore new classes of methods for summarizing quantitative data. And so, the second group of measures from the above classification of descriptive statistics consists of single numbers that quantify the broadly-conceived “variability” of mathematical objects. Let us investigate it more deeply.

An important, yet not directly connected with our task, characterization of measures of entropy or uncertainty of discrete probability mass functions (represented by numeric vectors in [0, 1]
                        n
                      with elements summing up to 1) was proposed by Martín, Mayor, and Suñer (2001). Such a class includes e.g. the Shannon entropy and alike, cf. also (Kostal, Lansky, and Pokora (2013)). Other very loosely related measures include the notion of fuzziness of a fuzzy set, cf. (Sanchez & Trillas, 2012; Weber, 1984; Zeng & Li, 2006), multidiscances (Martin & Mayor, 2011), or a probability distribution’s scale parameter estimates (non-negative, translation and ratio scale invariant functions discussed by Pitman, 1939).

Among the aggregation methods of our concern, on the other hand, we may find:

                        
                           1.
                           
                              Measures of absolute data spread, e.g. standard deviation, IQR, MAD. In this case, an absolute spread measure 
                                 V
                               may accompany an aggregation function 
                                 A
                               in order to state that a numeric list x is concisely described as 
                                 
                                    A
                                    (
                                    
                                       x
                                    
                                    )
                                    ±
                                    V
                                    (
                                    
                                       x
                                    
                                    )
                                 
                              .


                              Measures of relative data spread
(e.g. Gini coefficient, coefficient of variation), which are dependent on the order of magnitude of a numeric list’s elements. For instance, imagine that we have two groups of people. The first group consists of (1, 2, 3)-year-olds and the second one of (101, 102, 103)-year-olds. Intuitively, the relative spread of age in the first group is greater than that of the second group.

Most importantly, to our best knowledge none of these has been discussed from the point of view of aggregation theory. In particular, it is still unknown what characteristic properties link the measures within both groups. Note that even in statistics there are many functions which aim – at least theoretically – to be used for the mentioned purposes. Also, diverse application areas require treatment with different suitable measures. We strongly believe that the measures of absolute and relative spread are worth of deeper, separate studies. Hence, this contribution will focus on the first subclass.


                     Example 1 
                     (cont’d).
If all the experts are of the same esteem, we may use e.g. the sample standard deviation to assess the consistency of decision makers’ opinions, refer e.g. to Huang, Chang, and Lin (2013) for such an approach. However, if some form of weighting of the importance of opinions or their values is needed, then we should seek for a different kind of method for measuring the hetero/homogeneity. This, apart from measures of central tendency, could be an important, supplementary information on a numeric sequence, (cf. e.g. Ohki and Murofushi (2012)).

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we propose a binary preorder which is further on used to determine whether a vector has no larger absolute spread than another one. Basing on this notion, in Section 3 we introduce the notion of a spread measure and indicate some additional properties that may be useful in particular application areas. In Section 4 we prove that the spread measures are naturally connected to aggregation functions. In Section 5 we show that the well-known descriptive statistics, like sample variance, standard deviation, interquartile range, range, median absolute deviation, and mean difference, are consistent with our definition and develop some new classes of functions which are of particular usefulness in DM tasks. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and indicates many ideas worth of deeper further studies.

Please note that the notion of ≤ 
                           n
                         plays a central role in the definition of aggregation functions. It is because an aggregation function is a morphism between the partially ordered space 
                           
                              (
                              
                                 I
                                 n
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 ≤
                                 n
                              
                              )
                           
                         and linearly ordered space 
                           
                              (
                              I
                              ,
                              ≤
                              )
                              ,
                           
                         cf. property (a1).

In other words, if x ≤ 
                           n
                        
                        x′, then we are certain that each aggregation function ranks x no higher than x′.

We shall introduce the class of absolute spread measures in a similar manner. Let us pose a question: In which case does a given vector in 
                           
                              I
                              n
                           
                         
                        surely have the same or not greater spread than another one in 
                           
                              I
                              n
                           
                        ? Here is a list of the sine qua non postulates that seem reasonable for most applications.

                                  should have the lowest possible spread of all the vectors considered.


                                 Invariance to translations.
Spread comparison results should not change when we translate all elements in at least one sequence considered, i.e. x and x + t are of the same spread for any x, t. Note that such a condition would be inappropriate in case of measures of relative spread.

In statistics and data analysis, perhaps we will not take into account the relative ordering of the elements in a sequence: for any

                                  have the same spread, as we treat all the observations as just “points in the real line”; however, here we should be interested in a more general setting in which the relative ordering may be important: for example, each element in a vector may have a corresponding weight which is determined by its position (the ith element may be more “important” than the jth, cf. the above example).

Moreover, how to modify a given vector x so that its spread surely does not decrease? A sensible answer may be given in terms of the notion of some kind of distance between all the pairs of elements. Namely, if the distance between each xi
                         and xj
                         does not decrease, then the spread also does not decrease. The most natural choice of the distance measure in 
                           I
                         is of course an ℓ
                           p
                        -norm generated one, d(xi, xj
                        ) = |xj
                         − xi
                        |. However, according to the non-symmetry postulate, we should rather insist on checking whether the signed distance between each pair of observations of the first vector is not greater than the distance between the corresponding pairs from the second one, cf. Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) for a well-known approach concerning increasing a spread of a probability distribution.

Please note that ≼

                         i.e. a relation that is reflexive and transitive. Firstly, let us study how ≼

                         behaves under scaling and translation of elements in a given vector.

This fact conforms with the intuition: we cannot objectively (from all points of views) state which of the two vectors has greater spread: the second vector represents highly “polarized” observations, but in the two subgroups (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) the spread is the lowest possible (we may wish to give more weight to e.g. small observations). On the other hand, the observations in the first vector are all different. We see that, in general, our relation does not indicate whether we should look at a “global” or a “local” level, which is an advantage. A similar behavior is exhibited by ≤

                           n
                         relation is especially useful in group decision making. Recall that in Example 1
we had different confidence toward the competence of decision makers, and we should be really careful when judging whether they agree on a given topic or not. In our example, x
                        4 is known to express a less faithful judgment. Thus, in (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5), the first three “faithful experts” totally agree and in (0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) they do not reach full consensus.

On the other hand, the second characteristic property gives a kind of “normalization” of a spread measure’s output value: a constant vector has no spread at all. Of course, for n = 1, a spread measure always outputs the value 0, as a single number has “no spread”. Thus, we will always be interested in the case n ≥ 2. Also please note that for each function fulfilling (v1), by the fact that 
                           
                              (

                        . We see that each 
                           V
                         is a morphism between the preordered space

                        .

Note that there is no much sense in assuming that 
                           V
                         should be a function onto 
                           
                              I

                         because of translation invariance. 0 is a good choice for the “lowest possible spread” as we will later see that some well-known measures of spread used in statistics do indeed output such a value for (n*c). On the other hand, in practice, when constructing a spread measure, one may wish to think of a kind of normalization of 
                           V
                         by providing some condition similar to the (a3) property, for example to impose that a spread measure in [0, 1]
                           n
                         gives values in [0, 1], or – more generally – in [0, b − a]. These requirements may be expressed by the conditions:

                           
                              (v3)

In Section 5 we will show that such functions as variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range (among others) are indeed spread measures. Before that, however, we should study the relationship between spread measures and aggregation functions. Additionally, we are going to explore some basic properties of spread measures.

This result follows directly from Lemma 5 and the fact that

                      iff there exists c such that x = n*c. It becomes particularly appealing when we recall the definition of an aggregation function and compare the conditions (v1’) and (v2’) to (a1) and (a2). In fact, we have what follows.

Of course, if 
                        V
                      is symmetric, then we may restrict ourselves to the space of vectors that are already sorted. In such a case, only one generalized aggregation function is needed to generate

In this section we will provide an overview of descriptive statistics classically used in exploratory data analysis (all of them are symmetric), show that they are indeed spread measures according to our definition, and generalize them. This will lead to very interesting classes of functions that may be used e.g. in group decision making.

Interestingly, it turns out that any aggregation function on a specific domain (e.g. the weighted mean, OWA, OWMax operators, etc.) may be used to generate a spread measure in a quite simple way – basing on the fact that each object of our interest is translation invariant. It is Corollary 6 which implies that for any aggregation function

On the other hand, the class of spread measures is in some sense much richer: such a measure, after a proper translation of its inputs, is not necessarily nondecreasing in each variable. For example, let y = (0, 0, 1) and y′ = (0, 0.5, 1). We have y ≤

                         might be interesting as it leads to a proof of the fact that another set of data analysis tools indeed consists of spread measures. Let us recall the notion of a sample quantile of order α ∈ [0, 1]. Although there are many various definitions in the literature and implementations in statistical software packages, see Hyndman and Fan (1996) for a review, it is generally accepted that such an aggregation function is an OWA operator (Yager, 1988) given by:

                         is a spread measure. Such a function has an intuitive interpretation: it denotes a distance to some sample quantile.

In this section we will study functions which generalize spread measures of this type. First of all, we will substitute

                         for any weighted arithmetic mean (in the nonsymmetric case) or an OWA operator. Secondly, we will consider a weighted distance. We should note that, however, not all such functions fulfill (v1). For example, if

We of course have to determine in which cases it holds 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             ∂
                                             V
                                             |
                                          
                                          σ
                                       
                                       /
                                       ∂
                                       
                                          δ
                                          a
                                       
                                       ≥
                                       0
                                    
                                  for all a and 
                                    δ
                                 . However, it is easily seen that it is necessary and sufficient to consider only the diff-vectors of the form 
                                    δ
                                  = (0, …, 0, δb
                                 , 0, …, 0), i.e. with δb
                                  > 0, δi
                                  = 0, for all b, i = 1, …, n − 1 such that b ≠ i.

Therefore, at this point of the proof we have already shown that 
                                    
                                       
                                          V
                                          |
                                       
                                       σ
                                    
                                  is a spread measure if and only if for all a, b = 1, …, n − 1 it holds (*) ≥ 0. What is more, as 
                                    ξ

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this paper we have introduced a new family of functions that aim to synthesize numeric vectors: measures of (absolute) data spread, variability, or scatter. Although particular elements of this class have been studied in the literature for quite a long time – especially in probability and statistics – the presented results introduce them to the domain of aggregation theory and decision making. Thus, together with aggregation (averaging) functions and (fuzzy) logical connectives, spread measures are another examples of methods to reveal new “dimensions” of data being synthesized.

Of course, much still has to be done to understand the behavior of such measures better. Special attention should be paid to the study of the relation between spread measures for different vector arities (extended spread measures, i.e. functions in

Also, it is known that averaging aggregating functions may be obtained by minimizing some penalty P, which can be interpreted as a measure of consensus between the input vector and output value, see Calvo and Beliakov (2010) and Mesiar (2007), i.e.

Finally, we should note that in exploratory data analysis we also consider some “normalized” measures of relative spread. For instance, the well known (unit-free) Gini coefficient, defined as
