@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many physiological processes and pathological conditions in human and animal livers exhibit spatial heterogeneity. Livers are anatomically structured in lobes [1], the liver tissue is structured in lobuli [1], which are in turn subdivided into zones [2,3]. Typically, metabolic or clearance processes take place in zonated form [4]. This zonation is mainly due to zonated gene/enzyme expression [5,6]. The size of the respective periportal or pericentral zone depends on the specific phenomenon. In particular for pathological conditions, the sizes may additionally vary over time, e.g., for necrosis and regeneration after administration of carbon tetrachloride [7]. To allow describing the interaction of physiological processes and pathological states with zonation of different size, the classical geometric notion of lobuli divided into three zones [8] was refined to a larger number of zones in this study. Heterogeneity across the organ may be present as well, mainly due to pathological conditions varying at this coarser length scale, e.g., fibrosis [9,10], cirrhosis [11], or carcinoma [12,13].

Zonation of pathological conditions is relevant due to their interaction with various metabolic or clearance processes taking place in zonated form [4]. Quantitative data describing the extent of a pathological condition depending on the zonal position can thus provide data complementary to a diagnosis typically based on visual assessment of histological images. Quantifying additionally the organ-scale heterogeneity can help estimate the impact of the disease on overall organ function. Spatially resolved quantitative data describing a liver disease is indispensable for accurate simulations of physiological processes, e.g., [14,7,15].

In the present study, steatosis is considered as one example of a pathological condition which is known to occur in spatially heterogeneous form. Steatosis is a common human liver disease frequently caused by dietary misconduct or alcohol abuse [16]. Steatotic livers are characterized by lipids accumulating in the hepatocytes [17]. Steatosis is most typically located in the pericentral region, but it may also occur in periportal form, see [18] and the references therein. In addition, heterogeneity can also be observed across the whole organ [19]. Both zonation and organ-scale heterogeneity were present in the mouse liver considered in this study, see Fig. 1
                     . The main goal of the present study was to quantify these heterogeneities, in order to allow using the results for a pharmacokinetics (PK) simulation.

Clinical diagnosis of steatosis is based on histological assessment of liver biopsies, representing only a tiny fraction of the whole organ. For this purpose, e.g., hematoxylin & eosin (HE) or oil Red-O staining [20] is used, providing a distinction of micro- and macro-vesicular steatosis as well as a zonation [21]. Clearly, this only provides local data and does not permit examining the whole organ. Zonation of steatosis is easily assessed qualitatively by experienced pathologists, but is typically not quantified. At the organ scale, steatosis can be quantified using ultrasound and computed tomography [22] as well as magnetic resonance imaging [23], all of which are non-invasive, but do not reveal all features accessible by histology. Experimentally, lipid contents can be determined using biochemical measurements, which can be compared to averaged results obtained by other approaches [24]. This approach, however, lacks spatial resolution.

Detecting lobuli is the basis for zonated quantification. In most species, their boundaries are not determined by anatomical structures, so they need to be inferred from typically optical image data of sufficiently high resolution. A manual approach for determining lobular shapes [25,26] is of prohibitive workload for more than a few lobuli, so a semi-automatic procedure with an algorithmic component similar to [27] was employed here.

Recent advances in histological whole-slide imaging and image processing [28] permit quantifying steatosis using serial sections of entire organs of small animals such as mice. Besides the detection of lipid vacuoles, steatosis can be quantified as average values per lobe or on smaller tiles, typically squares that are not physiologically motivated. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of analysis has neither previously been performed in 3D to cover a whole organ, nor have zonated distributions and their heterogeneity been quantified at this scale.

Previous own studies [15,29] showed the influence of spatially resolved pathological perturbations in PK modeling, in particular in combination with zonated metabolism. The present study now offered the opportunity to use actual measured steatosis patterns for the whole organ as opposed to the synthetic spatial patterns used previously [15,29].

In the present paper, an approach is presented for zonated quantification of steatosis in a mouse liver. For this purpose, histological whole-slide scan images of serial sections of a whole mouse liver with different stainings were used. An image registration was performed for two purposes: for being able to combine information made visible by different stainings [30] and for obtaining 3D analysis results [31]. In our case, portal fields (PFs) and central veins (CVs) were detected using glutamine synthetase (GS) staining in order to determine lobuli and zones within them. In neighboring HE-stained slides, lipid vacuoles indicating macro-vesicular steatosis were detected by an automatic procedure in a set of slides covering an entire liver. This combined analysis was used for zonated quantification of steatosis for the entire liver. Finally, the analysis results were used in a multiscale whole-body PK simulation, in which the liver model represented both organ-scale heterogeneity and zonation.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

In this section, the workflow from creating specimens via image registration, annotation of PFs and CVs, tessellation in lobuli and zones, detection of lipid vacuoles, and zonated quantification is presented. The in silico part of this workflow is illustrated in Fig. 2
                     . Finally, a modeling approach is described where the analysis result was used as simulation input.

Steatosis in a male C57/BL6N mouse (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) was induced by feeding a methionine/choline-deficient high fat diet (E15652-94 EF R/M, high fat MCD mod. low methionine and choline experimental diet [32]; ssniff, Sulzfeld, Germany) for 4weeks. The animal was sacrificed under anesthesia by exsanguination. The liver was explanted and fixed in 5% buffered formalin followed by paraffin embedding. All procedures and housing of the animals were strictly carried out according to the German animal welfare legislation.

Subsequently, 3μm sections were prepared using a rotary microtome (Microm HM355S; Thermo Fisher Scientific Microm International GmbH, Walldorf, Germany). In total, a stack of 2037 slides were produced in four batches (1–577, 578–987, 988–1500, and 1501–2037). In between each batch, the microtome blade had to be changed and approximately 10μm of tissue were lost.

The slides were stained in batches of 25 slides. Each batch consisted of a block of 20 slides with Elastica-van Gieson (EvG) and HE staining alternatingly and another block of 5 slides using Gomöri, HE/EvG, Laminin, alpha-smooth muscle actin and GS staining. Finally, the slides were digitalized using a whole-slide scanner (NanoZoomer HT 2.0, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu City, Japan; at 400-fold optical magnification) at an in-plane image resolution of 227nm. Throughout this paper, the term ‘slide’ will be used for both the physical object and the image data of its scan to avoid unnecessary complicated notation. The distinction will be clear from the context.

For registering and analyzing the histological images, the original scans of the slides were downsampled to an in-plane resolution of 908nm. This resolution was sufficiently fine for detecting features used for registration and for detecting lipid vacuoles, and coarse enough to avoid excessive computational workload.

During the preparation of the histological slides (see Section 2.1) strong rigid deformations occurred when placing a tissue section on a slide. Furthermore, the cutting process inevitably introduced non-linear deformations. Therefore, registration of consecutive histological slides was used for two purposes: first, a geometric matching of lobuli and zones with steatosis was facilitated. To determine lobuli and zones, PFs and CVs needed to be located; they could be distinguished most easily using GS staining. Steatosis was easier to detect in HE staining as the contrast for lipid vacuoles is better than in GS staining. Second, registration also permitted a correct relative alignment within the stack of slides representing the organ.

The registration was performed in several steps. An automatic rigid registration was performed first, it was based on a method described in [33]. This rigid registration was extended to handle several individual tissue sections on one slide by first determining all connected components on both slides to be registered and then determining the best registration matches. However, the rigid registration was not sufficient in all cases. The main causes of error were strong non-linear distortions like tears and cuts, which could not automatically be compensated for. This required a manual review of the slides. In some cases, the distortions could be patched manually and then registered successfully, in other cases, slides had to be discarded. Another cause of error was a wrong correlation of the connected components, which could be easily fixed during the manual review by indicating which components actually corresponded to each other. In about 2% of the cases, the registration failed because the features used for registration were not prominent enough. In those cases, a manual alignment was required.

Since the slides were already aligned fairly well after the previous steps, a fully automatic non-linear registration could be employed as the final step to fix the remaining minor misalignments. The non-linear registration used an elastic regularizer as first introduced by Broit [34] and normalized gradient fields [35,36] as distance measure, since they proved to be robust towards different stainings.

In order to cover the whole dataset, the spacing of slides to be analyzed was chosen to be in the range of lobular radii in mice, reported as 284.3±56.9μm in [37, Table 1]. As some slides were inevitably damaged in the experimental procedure, 34 pairs of neighboring and undamaged GS and HE slides were selected from the 2037 slides used for registration, resulting in a non-equidistant spacing of 150–300μm between the slides to be analyzed.

For obtaining a zonated quantification, the positions of all PFs, CVs, and lipid vacuoles were obtained in the selected HE slides. Macro-vesicular lipid vacuoles were considered to be all lipid vacuoles that are larger than hepatocyte nuclei [38]. The assessment of steatosis was limited to macro-vesicular lipid vacuoles because micro-vesicular steatosis cannot be reliably quantified in HE-stained slides [39].

A particular challenge for the annotation was the large size of histological whole-slide images and the multitude of depicted structures. Therefore, two software tools were developed to facilitate annotation.

The first software tool allowed manual annotation of PFs and CVs. For this purpose, it featured a virtual microscope viewer in which the user could pan and zoom to arbitrary positions in a slide image. PFs and CVs could then be marked by clicking in the image. In HE-stained slides, PFs and CVs were often hard to distinguish. In GS-stained slides, however, both structures could be easily distinguished because central veins are highlighted in brown. The software tool, therefore, enabled the visual comparison of the current HE slide with the nearest GS slide in the registered tissue volume. The PF and CV annotations were performed by technicians trained in the analysis of histological images.

The second software tool enabled the fully automatic annotation of the macro-vesicular lipid vacuoles. This tool performed three main processing steps. First, the tissue region within the image was segmented by a tile-based image analysis approached based on [40]. Second, the pixels within the tissue region were classified into background or tissue by thresholds for their brightness and saturation values. Third, blobs of connected background pixels were classified by their shape into either macro-vesicular lipid vacuoles or other background structures, such as vessels or tissue cracks.

The two software tools provided lists of markers (points) for PFs, CVs, and macro-vesicular lipid vacuoles as well as the total area of lipid vacuoles per slide and the ratio of area of lipid vacuoles over area of the entire organ cross section in the slide. The latter implicitly provide the organ cross section in each slide. This data was used for further computations as described next.

Lobuli in liver tissue are physiologically defined as the regions drained by one CV [1]. The most obvious approach for extracting lobuli from the data would be to tessellate the respective liver mask into the Voronoï cells [41] defined by the CV markers. However, such a Voronoï tessellation ignores the location of the PF inflows and leads to lobulus boundaries not respecting the PF locations. Instead, the following procedure was used: first, a “portality measure” was defined that measures a relative distance to the closest PF and CV points. Quantizing this measure easily resulted in zones. Finally, a preflooded watershed transform of the portality measure allowed defining the respective catchment basins as lobuli, an approach similar to the one used in [27]. A slide-wise 2D procedure is presented here, the extension to 3D is discussed in Section 3.5.

For this study, the division of lobuli in zones was chosen to be such that the distance between PFs and CVs is equidistantly subdivided into H=12 pieces. This choice corresponds to the approximate number of 12.2±2.4 hepatocytes along one lobular radius for mice reported in [37, Table 1]. The structure of the zones matched the PK model in which the analysis data is to be used.

                        This can easily be adapted if a different motivation of zones is to be considered, e.g., different numbers for other species, a coarser zonation with fewer zones, different numbers of zones corresponding to the size of lobuli.

While the definitions in (1) and (2) are continuous, these values were actually computed on discrete points and separately in each slide. For this purpose, a resolution of 7.264μm was chosen, one eighth of the resolution of the image data used for the previous steps. This was still sufficiently fine compared to the size of liver cells, reported as 23.3±3.1μm in [37, Table 1] for hepatocytes in mice. Marker positions for PFs, CVs, and lipid vacuoles as well as the areas of lipid vacuoles were unaffected by this resampling. These quantities were determined at the previous resolution of 908nm.

Next, the preflooded watershed transform [42] of p was computed separately for each slide. The PF locations are maxima of p of equal height and CV locations are minima of p, also of equal height, and ridges of p intuitively correspond to lobulus boundaries. Hence lobuli could be defined to be the catchment basins obtained from the watershed transform. The preflooding height was chosen per slide so that the number of catchment basins coincided with the number of CV markers. This is not always possible exactly, so a trade-off was chosen between avoiding artificial catchment basins resulting from the image processing and avoiding combined catchment basins for distinct CV locations. Let L denote this total number of lobuli obtained by this analysis.

For each slide, the total lipid area was divided by the number of lipid markers to obtain the average size of a lipid vacuole. Both these values were available from the analysis described in Section 2.3. Future work will include refined analysis taking into account the size of individual lipid vacuoles and extend the assessment towards micro-vesicular steatosis. Lipid vacuoles appeared to be larger towards the PFs as shown, e.g., in Fig. 1. There seems to be generally a gradual decrease of the size of lipid vacuoles towards the CVs, without substantial variation in the number of lipid vacuoles per area. This could indicate that the approach used here underestimates the heterogeneity (as it assumes constant size) and the zonation is actually stronger, i.e., higher values of lipid accumulation near the PFs and smaller values towards the CVs. On the other hand, microvesicular steatosis not included in the analysis could lead to slightly larger values lipid accumulation towards the CVs. A future refined analysis will permit quantifying this effect and permit an investigation of the zonal distribution of sizes.

Depending on later applications, a clustering of lobuli with ‘similar’ steatosis patterns and the corresponding cumulative volumes may be useful. One possible clustering approach is presented in Section 2.5 as an example. It is rather generic, but nonetheless suitable for the purpose at hand.

The steatosis analysis results were used for a PK simulation of the clearance of dextromethorphan (DXM) in mice. This antitussive drug is widely used in humans [43] and was chosen for this application due to its high lipophilicity of 
                           
                              log
                              
                              P
                              =
                              3.2
                           
                        . In mouse livers, it is metabolized pericentrally and thus provides interesting interactions with the predominantly pericentral steatosis profiles. More precisely, DXM is metabolized by the enzyme Cyp2d22 in mice [44]. This enzyme is expressed in approximately the pericentral half of the lobular area (own estimate based on the immunohistochemical image shown in [45, Fig. 9]).

For the simulations presented here, a multi-scale perfusion and PK simulation framework [29] was used with parameters from an existing physiologically based PK model for DXM in mice [46], exported from the software PK-Sim® [47]. In summary, the multiscale model [29] extends an established whole-body PK model [47], mainly in two aspects. A recirculation delay is present for more accurate temporal resolution and a spatio-temporally model for the liver is used. In the latter, one-dimensional representative sinusoids divided into 12 zones are employed for reflecting zonation of metabolic properties such as the presence of Cyp enzymes and pathological model perturbations such as steatosis. Organ-scale heterogeneity is reflected by considering multiple representative sinusoids in parallel, e.g., one for each lobulus. For each zone h in each representative sinusoid l, the amount 
                           
                              
                                 s
                              
                              
                                 h
                                 ,
                                 l
                              
                           
                         of lipid accumulation due to steatosis from (3) was specified. It influences the model parameters via the respective intracellular partition coefficients, in the same simplified manner as previously considered in [15]. For the dataset considered here, no geometric models for the vascular trees were available that could be used as optional input for the multiscale model. Instead, a fixed delay between liver inflow and PFs as well as between CVs and liver outflow of 2s each was assumed.

In this setting, a single representative sinusoid could be used to reflect multiple lobuli with essentially the same steatosis pattern. For this purpose, a simple 12-dimensional clustering strategy was employed. The components of

                                 h
                                 ,
                                 l
                              
                           
                         for lobulus l were quantized to multiples of a chosen quantization parameter, thus binning the steatosis patterns. An average of the original steatosis patterns was computed for each bin, weighted by the respective sizes of the detected lobuli. Additionally, bins with a total size below a given threshold were omitted from the simulation. The quantization parameter was heuristically chosen to be 0.08 and the threshold as

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

From the annotation of PFs and CVs, total numbers of precisely 13 000 PF markers and 11 534 CV markers were obtained. A total number of 11 504 lobuli are obtained from (2) by the procedure described in Section 2.5. Hence, the trade-off for choices of preflooding heights in the watershed transform resulted in only 30 or 0.26% of CV markers not assigned a separate catchment basin (lobulus). This number of lobuli was larger than a previous own estimate of 6281 lobuli in a mouse liver [48] based on the respective sizes. The present approach probably overestimated the number of lobuli due to the fact that one lobulus may be part of more than one of the slides considered for the analysis. In particular, the slides intersected many lobuli peripherally. The mean ± standard deviation of the sizes was 
                           
                              0.281

                                    mm
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                        . This shows that the sizes determined in the 2D slides here generally agreed with literature values, e.g., the size of 
                           
                              0.21

                         in mice reported in [37, Table 1]. Fig. 3
                         shows more detailed plots of these values. In the boxplot, whisker lengths correspond to 1.5 times the interquartile range. Besides the aforementioned effect of peripherally intersected, i.e., unrealistically small lobuli, there are also outliers of unrealistically large lobuli, most likely due to poorly visible CVs missed in the annotation, despite the GS staining. Additionally, Ref. [37] was focused on lobuli intersected transversely, whereas the present analysis considers lobuli intersected in any orientation.

The automatic detection of lipid vacuoles resulted in a total number of 529 633 markers. The results were verified by visual inspection and had the accuracy to be expected, 92%, for the method employed [49].

The average size of the lipid vacuoles was determined for each slide as total lipid area divided by the number of lipid vacuole markers as needed for (3). This average varied substantially between different slides as shown in Fig. 4
                        , mean ± standard deviation was 135.5±28.2μm2. A density of lipid vacuoles was determined for each slide as the number of lipid vacuole markers divided by the total cross section area of the organ in the respective slide. This density also varied substantially between different slides, cf. Fig. 5
                        , mean ± standard deviation was 182.97±188.52per mm2. In both cases, the data does not seem to follow a normal distribution, so the standard deviations should be interpreted with caution. Together, these variations indicate an organ-scale heterogeneity of steatosis not only in terms of the number of lipid vacuoles, but also in terms of their size. This probably has an impact on the analysis results in the slides also exhibiting organ-scale heterogeneity and will be investigated in more detail using a further refined analysis procedure in the future.

The results of the zonated quantification of steatosis are visualized in Fig. 6
                         for the full stack of slides considered. This figure indicates an organ-scale decrease of lipid fractions from one side of the stack to the other. The distributions of lipid fractions along the H=12 zones for all 11 504 lobuli detected in the dataset are shown in Fig. 7
                        , clearly confirming the predominantly periportal patterns of the steatosis already visible in the HE slides. Moreover, these plots show the reduction from 11 504 to 105 substantially different steatosis patterns by the binning described in Section 2.5.

The organ-scale heterogeneity was further investigated in terms of the lipid content

                         from one side of the stack to the other. This confirms the observation of an organ-scale heterogeneity in Fig. 6.

As explained in Section 2.5, a clustering approach was used to obtain 105 substantially different steatosis patterns from the full analysis. Along with the respective cumulative volumes, this data was used in a model with 105 representative sinusoids with different steatosis patterns for performing a whole-body PK simulation involving DXM. For this purpose, an infusion of 5mg per kg body weight [46] into the portal vein, lasting for 10s, was simulated. This is certainly an unphysiological scenario for a drug typically administered orally, but was chosen to avoid complicating the example application by a model for oral uptake. For comparison to a healthy liver, an additional simulation considering a single representative sinusoid for the whole liver without steatotic lipid accumulations was considered, using the same infusion profile as before. These simulations were run for 180min.

The systemic DXM concentrations in the venous blood pool are shown in Fig. 9
                        . According to the PK model, the DXM was mostly taken up by the liver during the first pass and was released slowly afterwards, while at the same time being cleared from the model organism. The impact of steatosis at the systemic level (Fig. 9) can be observed mainly during the first 10min of the simulation. After that, the difference between healthy and steatotic case becomes less pronounced, but is nonetheless visible in the simulation output.

More detailed spatio-temporal concentration profiles for four representative sinusoids with different steatosis patterns are shown in Fig. 10
                         for the first 10min of the simulation. The plots show how a higher lipid content in the cells leads to a higher uptake of the lipophilic substance DXM in the cells.

The results presented in Figs. 3–6 and 8 are three-dimensional results of analyses separately performed in two dimensions. They could, on the one hand, immediately be refined by a more dense use of GS staining within the serial sections. In this case, more slides can be used for PF and CV detection and thus provide more lobulus data, and more neighboring HE slides can be used for steatosis detection. On the other hand, the analysis techniques presented here can be extended to a fully 3D zonated analysis. For this purpose, portality can be defined based on distances to the centerlines of the PFs and CVs rather than point markers. The watershed transform needs to be computed in 3D after choosing a suitable global preflooding, and the term ‘size’ in (3) needs to be interpreted as volume. Besides creating a potentially larger computational workload, the quantification can thus be transferred to 3D. In 3D, the quantification could benefit from tracking the vascular structures for distinguishing more easily between PFs and CVs. At the same time, this could provide the vasculature for subsequent simulations, as used, e.g., in [15,29], and thus provide the full link between organism and parenchymal scale for multi-scale liver simulations [50,51].

The computation of lobuli used here relied on PF and CV positions. Besides intra-observer variability in the manual annotation, this involved potential sources of errors also relevant for future automatic detection. PF positions may have been missed primarily if portal triads could not be distinguished from lipid vacuoles. Clearly, the accumulation of lipid vacuoles could not be used as an indicator for PF positions when investigating whether there is a correlation or not. Missing PF markers resulted in incorrect zones, but this did not have a major influence on the results as a lobulus tessellation rather than an acinus [1] tessellation is considered. CV positions may have been indiscernible even though GS staining is visible in the neighboring slide. Missing CV markers resulted in artificially large lobuli and incorrect zones. Due to the clear visibility of the GS staining, this rarely happened and had only a minor influence on the results. Moreover, tracking PFs and CVs in a future 3D analysis will further reduce PF and CV detection errors. For a future evaluation and validation of the lipid contents quantified by the technique presented here, a comparison to results obtained by other measurement techniques will be necessary.

Similarly, the PK simulation shown as a proof of concept application needs to be refined and validated before it can be used for predictive purposes. For a detailed discussion of the PK simulation framework used here, in particular the simplified way steatosis is represented in the model, see [29]. Moreover, estimation of Cyp2d22 presence from an image of a single lobulus [45, Fig. 9] from the literature yields only a non-objective and coarse estimate. While this is sufficient for our application, a future, more refined model should be based on more targeted data. For this purpose, the respective relevant enzyme should be stained in the same serial section of a steatotic liver, quantified systematically in more than a single lobulus in merely one slice, and correlated with the extent of steatosis.

The presented, modular approach for zonated quantification is based on marker positions and thus by no means limited to analyzing steatosis. In fact, the steatosis detection can easily be replaced by detection of other phenomena such as proliferation or necrosis [40] in the histological slides based on a staining targeted for the respective phenomenon. Similarly, the number or geometric definition of zones can be changed. This way, the zonation of other phenomena can also be quantified and the data can subsequently be used in the same manner as the steatosis data considered here. To improve PK simulations, enzyme expression profiles relevant for zonated metabolization can be determined in neighboring, appropriately stained slides from the same specimen as used to measure the pathological perturbation.

The quantitative results in Figs. 4, 5 and 8 indicate an organ scale heterogeneity of the extent of steatosis. The apparent trend depending on the slice position in the specimen. In order to correlate this heterogeneity with anatomical structures, the presented analysis methods will be extended in the future, e.g., so that different liver lobes can be separated in the slides and analyzed separately in 3D. This will permit anatomically motivated investigations of variations between or within lobes, e.g., differences between the interior and regions near the boundary.

For the analysis results presented here, a single organ at a single time point for a specific way of inducing steatosis was considered, so the analysis results obtained so far should be viewed as one example snapshot. The methodology, however, permits a comparison of steatosis patterns not only within one organ, but clearly also between different individuals. It is known that total hepatic lipid content differs between individuals under similar conditions, see, e.g., [24]. A zonated quantification could show whether these differences are due to essentially the same zonation patterns of different intensity, or whether there are also substantial differences between the zonation patterns. The zonated analysis thus provides a research tool to quantify how steatosis patterns differ, e.g., between different individuals, over time, or between steatosis occurring due to different causes, and hence support respective future investigations.

The presented methodology for zonated quantification can also be applied to serial sections of smaller tissue samples not covering an entire liver. The analysis is thus also applicable in cases where creating, staining, and scanning serial sections of a whole liver would mean a prohibitive effort, or for clinical applications where explantation of the entire liver is clearly infeasible. In this case, organ-scale heterogeneity is limited to what is sampled by one or more biopsies. Zonated quantification of steatosis or other phenomena in biopsies can thus complement a visual assessment of the individual slides. If future investigations show that different zonated patterns can be used to characterize different states of diseases, the zonated quantification can perspectively provide valuable additional information for diagnosis.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Registering and analyzing slides of histological serial sections of a mouse liver permit detecting lobuli, defining zones, and zonated quantification of pathological states. For the first time, this analysis was performed to detect steatosis throughout a whole mouse liver, providing a quantification of zonation patterns as well as a notable organ-scale heterogeneity. The analysis result was successfully used as a spatially resolved perturbation to the liver in an exemplary whole-body PK simulation. Combined with future detection of other phenomena in histological images, zonated quantification is a powerful research tool. It can provide biological insights as well as input data for spatially resolved simulations of physiological processes.

U.D. and O.D. performed the experiments (experimental design, induction of steatosis, generation and processing of samples: cutting, staining, and scanning the histological serial sections). M.S. implemented and performed the image registration. A.H. developed the software for the image annotation and steatosis detection. L.O.S. implemented and performed zonated quantification as well as the pharmacokinetics simulations. Ar.S. and L.K. provided and adapted the pharmacokinetics model. All authors participated in writing the manuscript and approved the final article.

Ar.S. and L.K. are employees of Bayer Technology Services GmbH, the company developing the PBPK modeling tool PK-Sim. The other authors declare that they have no competing interest.
