                  Phase-Contrast (PC) velocimetry Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a useful modality to explore cardiovascular pathologies, but requires the automatic segmentation of vessels and the measurement of both lumen area and blood flow evolutions. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated method for extracting lumen boundaries of the carotid artery and compute both lumen area and blood flow evolutions over the cardiac cycle. This method uses narrow band region-based active contours in order to correctly capture the lumen boundary without being corrupted by surrounding structures. This approach is compared to traditional edge-based active contours, considered in related works, which significantly underestimate lumen area and blood flow. Experiments are performed using both a sequence of a homemade phantom and sequences of 20 real carotids, including a comparison with manual segmentation performed by a radiologist expert. Results obtained on the phantom sequence show that the edge-based approach leads to an underestimate of carotid lumen area and related flows of respectively 18.68% and 4.95%. This appears significantly larger than weak errors obtained using the region-based approach (respectively 2.73% and 1.23%). Benefits appear even better on the real sequences. The edge-based approach leads to underestimates of 40.88% for areas and 13.39% for blood flows, compared to limited errors of 7.41% and 4.6% with our method. Experiments also illustrate the high variability and therefore the lack of reliability of manual segmentation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cardiovascular diseases remain an important cause of death. Several imaging modalities are available to explore cardiovascular pathologies: angiography, Doppler echo, Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Clinical cardiovascular MRI has evolved from a modality that provided anatomic imaging to one that gives access, in a day-to-day practice, to functional information as well [1]. A key component of this enhanced utility has been the capability, with Phase-Contrast velocimetry MRI to analyze and quantify hemodynamic parameters. Phase-Contrast velocimetry MRI provides not only anatomical information on vessels but also functional information related to blood flow over the cardiac cycle. Fig. 1
                     A reports an example of anatomical information (anatomical image), together with functional information (phase image). The evolution of blood flow through carotid is measured over a cardiac cycle using the intensity provided by phase image.

A major strength of MRI, compared to other modalities such as Doppler echo, regards its ability to give access to all anatomical regions in all orientations and its sensitivity to a broad range of flow velocities. This technique has a variety of clinical applications [1], including evaluation of valvular heart diseases (regurgitation and stenosis), assessment of left and right ventricular stroke volume, assessment of vascular stenosis [2], evaluation of arterial wall shear stress [3].

For a clinical use, analysis of the Phase-Contrast velocimetry MRI data requires the delineation of vessel lumen over the sequence, from which measurements, such as flow calculations, can be performed. The purpose of this work is to automate the delineation of carotid over entire PC-MRI sequences, in order to measure the evolution of both the lumen area and the blood flow over a cardiac cycle, and could be extended to additional measurements such distensibility for instance. Our proposal concerns a semi-automated analysis method. Manual interaction only regards the initialization of the automated analysis, compared to a fully manual analysis involving the manual delineation of vessel lumen over each image of an entire sequence, this being a tedious and time consuming task, non-compliant with clinical routine.

Carotid lumen segmentation has been widely studied but not in the context of PC-MRI. Related studies have concerned 3D CTA (Computer Tomography Angiography) and MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography) [4–6]. Some of related methods are based on region-growing, active contours and vessels׳ centerline prior detection.

Recent studies involving PC-MRI sequences focus on large vessels differing from carotid, being a smaller structure. Considered larger structures belong to the thoracic area (e.g. aorta [7–10] and pulmonary artery [10]). The study related to [9] focuses on the aorta, using manually initialized edge-based deformable models applied to the anatomical image, without any blood flow measurement. 3D PC-MRI sequences are considered in [8], where vessels are semi-automatically segmented using phase images only, by coupling anisotropic filtering (for noise reduction) and edge-based deformable models (level-sets). In [10], vessel lumen is segmented using 3D Angiographic MRI images, and PC-MRI sequences are only used for computing velocity profiles. In [7], segmentation exploits phase information only, using edge-based active surfaces, where edge regards the frontier between the blood flow region and stationary tissues.

These previous works focus on 3D segmentation (except [9]), with underlying difficulty of extracting entire 3D structures depicting bifurcations for instance. Our context differs for these works because one focuses lumen area and blood flow evolution from a single 2D vessel slice from PC-MRI sequences. Besides, compared to previous works dealing with PC-MRI, one focuses on the carotid, being a smaller structure (e.g. diameter of about 25mm for the aorta, against 7mm for the carotid [11]). To our knowledge, except preliminary results limited to a single sequence [12], such an application of PC-MRI has not been considered yet.

In this work, we propose to segment the carotid lumen using narrow band region-based active contours: deformation is guided by statistics locally computed within bands surrounding the contour. As studied in this paper, this choice is motivated by the lack of contrast of carotid vessels, making edge-based approach unappropriate (compared to previously mentioned studies on PC-MRI sequences focusing on larger structures [7–10]). Note that such local region-based approaches have been widely studied for general purpose segmentation [13–15] as well as in previously mentioned works on 3D CTA and MRA images [4–6,16].

The main contribution of this paper concerns the proposed semi-automated analysis method for measuring both lumen area and blood flow, using, for the segmentation step, narrow band region-based explicit active contours inspired from [16]. Another part of the contribution regards the comparison performed with traditional edge-based active contours, as considered in the similar work (i.e. PC-MRI sequence analysis) focusing on the aorta [9]. This shows the need of a region-based approach for this anatomical structure. The last part of the contribution regards experiments involving both sequences of healthy volunteers and a sequence acquired using a carotid phantom. The use of a phantom is known to be relevant to evaluate segmentation algorithms for medical applications, compared to validation protocols limited to the use of reference segmentations resulting from manual drawings achieved by radiologist experts, with underlying uncertainty [17].


                     Section 2 describes the proposed semi-automated method, while Section 3 presents experiments and results. Before concluding, Section 4 discusses this work and related results.

                        Fig. 1 A shows an acquisition example at a specific instant of an entire sequence (both anatomical and phase images are reported). Concerning the acquisition protocol, the axial slice is assumed to be manually selected (before acquiring an entire sequence) to be perpendicular to the common carotid artery (flow is maximal for a perpendicular plane): the axial plane is selected by the radiologist on a coronal plane of the carotid.


                        Fig. 1 B provides an overview of the proposed semi-automated analysis method. The input is the sequence of both anatomical and phase images. Segmentation is performed using anatomical images. Phase images are only used for measurements occurring after the appropriate segmentation of the lumen of the carotid.

Segmentation is initialized by an expert (i.e. radiologist) who places an initial contour (circle) within the carotid lumen of the first anatomical image of the sequence (green circle in Fig. 1B). As detailed in Section 2.2, active contours are then considered to deform the initial circle towards lumen boundaries, for anatomical image of the sequence (red circles in Fig. 1B). The initialization involves a second (optional) parameter: “inner versus outer band contribution” mentioned in Fig. 1B. This parameter enables us to control the width or extent of the segmented contour (this parameter is further explained in Fig. 2
                         and Section 2.2, then studied in Section 3, and finally discussed in Section 4).

Measurements, detailed in Section 2.3, are finally automatically performed using obtained carotid contours as well as the velocity information encoded in phase images (see Fig. 1B).

The first term α regards the internal energy, and aims at ensuring the smoothness of the contour. The last two terms, weighted by λ, concern the so-called external energy, and are attached to the image (anatomical image I
                        
                           a
                         in our case) so that the contour is attracted by some particular image features. Compared to [16], both α and λ are not linked (i.e. in the form α=a and 
                           λ
                           =

                         in [16]), to have a more general formulation and be able to give significantly more weight to the external energy. This is detailed in Section 3.1 when replacing, for comparison purposes, the considered external energy by a standard edge-based external energy and setting parameters to 
                           α
                           =
                           0.5
                         and 
                           λ
                           =
                           15
                        . Note that, for the considered external energy, α and λare set to 0.5, therefore corresponding to the formulation of [16].

Compared to traditional edge-based external energy attracting the contour towards high image gradients [19], we consider a region-based external energy involving intensity descriptors computed within B
                        in and B
                        out regions respectively lying inside and outside the contour being deformed [18,16]. B

                        out regions are bounded by C as well as by its internal and external parallel curves (

Concerning the implementation, our proposal is based on explicit contours for runtime performance reasons (generally considered implicit contours (level-sets) [13–15] being time-consuming). The counterpart of considering an explicit representation is the difficulty to manage topological changes (intrinsically managed by implicit representation). This is not a limitation in our context because PC-MRI sequences are not acquired at carotid bifurcations, therefore excluding possible changes of topology (this being not the case in previously mentioned applications based on CTA or MRA images [4–6,16]).

Contour deformation is performed through the minimization of the energy functional E using a gradient descent. During the deformation, each contour point p

                         are recomputed after each iteration (see [16] for details). Note that, to ensure a stable distribution of contour points, the contour is reparameterized after each iteration (see [16] for details).

Compared to [16], we consider an asymmetric configuration (as in Chan-Vese model [18]). This regards the ω parameter in Eq. (2) which determines the relative weight given to the inner band with respect to the outer one. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, a small ω (e.g. 0.2) involves a large carotid lumen because deformation favors a homogeneous outer band intensity (i.e. 
                           1
                           −
                           0.2
                           =
                           0.8
                         according to Eq. (2)). By opposition, a high ω (e.g. 0.8 in Fig. 2B) favors a homogeneous inner band intensity, this occurring at lumen center, therefore attracting the contour towards lumen center (underestimate of the lumen area). In our proposal, this parameter can be controled by the expert in order to automatically generate the appropriate segmentation, according to his visual perception of lumen boundaries. This aspect is further studied and discussed in Sections 3.3 and 4.

As underlined in [16], the use of a narrow band enables to be less sensitive to anatomical structures surrounding carotid (e.g. jugular vein indicated in Fig. 1A). Fig. 2C reports deformed contours obtained using bandwidths of 2 and 8 pixels (ω is tuned, in each case, in order to obtain similar deformation result on the upper right part of the carotid). In each case, outer band boundary is also reported: for a bandwidth of 8 pixels, B
                        
                           out
                         covers (in its lower left part) the surrounding structure (jugular vein) which attracts the contour.

As illustrated in Fig. 2D, the initialization must be carefully performed so that the contour is not attracted by surrounding structure. This aspect is further studied in Section 3.3 and discussed in Section 4.

Considered measurements are related to evolution, over the sequence, of the lumen area and blood flow.

The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated according to the evaluation protocol described in Section 3.1, using both a homemade flow MRI phantom (Section 3.2) and a set of real sequences from healthy volunteers (Section 3.3). Experiments performed using the phantom allow an objective evaluation in a controled environment: segmentation accuracy is evaluated by comparison to the known geometry and size of the “synthetic” carotid. Complementary experiments performed on the set of real sequences allow us to evaluate our proposal on real carotids.

Sequences are series of 20 images acquired with a clinical 1.5T MRI Siemens scanner using retrospective navigator gating with ECG. Acquired images are of size 192×132 pixels.

For comparison purposes, all sequences are manually segmented by one radiologist expert using a homemade software, allowing to simultaneously visualize manual drawings superimposed on both anatomical and phase images.

For experiment, the code provided by the author of [16] is used

To underline the relevance of the narrow band region-based energy for guiding contour deformation, segmentations are compared to those obtained using the traditional edge-based active contours (comparison with the related work on aorta [9]), where external energy is based on the gradient vector flow (GVF) [20]:

Segmentations are evaluated by measuring the similarity index [21], the lumen area error and the blood flow error. The similarity index is measured between the obtained contour and a reference contour. The reference contour is either the one obtained by manual drawing (case of experiments on healthy volunteers) or the one corresponding to the known shape and size of carotids (case of experiments on the phantom sequence). The similarity index

                         ranges between 0 (complete dissimilarity) and 1 (perfect similarity) [21].

Both area and blood flow errors are measured for each image of each sequence and are expressed in percentage of measurements obtained using the reference contour (errors averaged over sequences are considered).

For experiments, the initial circle is automatically computed from estimated center and radius of the manual segmentation of the first image of the sequence. In order to avoid being corrupted by structures surrounding the carotid, the radius of the initial circle is set to 80% of radius estimated from the manual segmentation (initialization within carotid lumen). Note that the influence of this initialization is studied in Section 3.3.

The parameter related to internal regularization (see Eqs. (2) and (10)) is set to α=0.5 (as in [16]). Thirty iterations are considered for the deformation procedure (i.e. no particular stopping criterion is considered for assessing its converge): this is experimentally observed to be sufficient for convergence.

For the edge-based approach, the computation of the GVF is performed by considering 5 iterations and 0.2 (μ in [20]) for the regularization parameter (as in [20]). This enables us to obtain a smooth GVF to appropriately capture and attract contours towards highest image gradients.

Other parameters are optimized to maximize the similarity index (averaged over sequences). For the edge-based approach, a high value is considered for the external energy (
                           λ
                           =
                           15
                         in Eq. (10)), in order to significantly favor contour attraction towards high gradients. For the considered region-based approach, the weight of external energy is set 
                           λ
                           =
                           0.5
                         (Eq. (2)) in order to obtain the highest similarity.

                        , being considered identical [16]) and ω (see Eq. (2)) are set to different values for experiments on phantom and healthy volunteers (specifically optimized in both cases). For experiments on the phantom sequence, the bandwidth is set to 18 pixels and 
                           ω
                           =
                           0.2
                         in order to obtain the highest similarity. For experiments on healthy volunteers, the optimal value for the bandwidth is 2 pixels. The value of ω is optimized for each carotid. Indeed, as detailed in Section 2, this parameter can be interactively tuned in clinical routine, and can therefore be specifically optimized for each carotid in experiments. Results (Section 3.3) obtained with the 
                           ω
                           =
                           0.5
                         are also reported for comparison purposes: this corresponds to the optimal value maximizing the similarity over all sequences, and corresponds to the symmetric configuration considered in [16].

The phantom (Fig. 3
                        A) consists in a motor generating a pulsative flow at a controled frequency (peristaltic pump DS-M series from Boyser), the value of which being defined according to the desired cardiac frequency. The motor injects the liquid within a tube whose internal diameter is 7mm (order of size of the carotid diameter [11]), corresponding to a section area of 0.38cm2. Fig. 3B shows an example of acquired image (both anatomical and phase images at a given instant).

Both phantom carotids of the sequence are analyzed and results are compared to segmentations, areas and flows obtained using the known tube size and geometry (perfect circle of 0.38 cm2). Table 1
                         provides statistics related to these results. It appears that edge-based approach involves an underestimate of areas of 18.68%, compared to an error of only 2.73% for the region-based approach. Concerning flows, the edge-based approach leads to an underestimate of 4.95% (1.23% for region-based active contours). Note that segmentations performed by the expert involve errors of 4.74% for areas and 1.37% for flows (slightly worse than results obtained by the considered region-based approach).


                        Fig. 3 provides some segmentation results (Fig. 3C) as well area and flow evolutions (Fig. 3D) for one of the two phantom carotids. Similar to manual drawing, the region-based approach encompasses the entire vessel lumen while the edge-based active contour is attracted by high gradients, lying within (although close to boundaries) carotid lumen. This is illustrated by Fig. 3C with contours superimposed on the anatomical image together with the gradient vector flow. This explains the underestimation of measured areas, and therefore on measured flows (see mean areas and flows in Table 1, and their evolutions in Fig. 3D).

Another interesting observation regards the variability of expert drawing over sequences. Manual contours are less smooth than those obtained using the proposed method, the shape of which being closer to the theoric circle (see superimposed contours in Fig. 3C). Similarly, area variations measured by the expert also appears less smooth than variations observed by the proposed approach (see area evolution in Fig. 3D). This underlines the difficulty of building appropriate manual segmentations required for evaluation purposes [17].

Note that this evaluation is performed by comparison with a perfect circle of a constant diameter, which is a rough approximation because the area varies (slight variation compared to variations observed on real sequences – see Section 3.3) over the sequence, due to liquid pressure variations (see area and flow evolution observed using manual drawing and active contours). Therefore, errors provided in Table 1 are overestimated because one compares segmentations to a perfect circle of constant diameter.

As a result, this experiment using a carotid phantom shows that the edge-based approach significantly underestimates areas compared to our proposal leading to similar results (and even more regular) than those manually built by an expert.

These experiments involve the segmentation of 20 carotids from 10 healthy volunteers.


                        Table 2
                         provides statistics related to segmentation results, and the two histograms on the top of Fig. 4
                         indicate the distribution of errors over carotids of healthy volunteers.

As on the phantom sequence, it appears that the edge-based approach involves a significant underestimate of areas of 40.88%, compared to an error of only 7.41% for the region-based approach. Concerning flows, the edge-based approach leads to an underestimate of 26.86% (only 4.60% of error for region-based active contours). This confirms the relevance of using a region-based energy term rather than an edge-based one.


                        Table 2 also reports results obtained using single common value for ω (
                           ω
                           =
                           0.5
                        , optimized over the entire database). Although significantly better than those obtained using the edge-based approach, these results are worse than those obtained using a specific ω optimized for each carotid (optimal values ranging from 
                           ω
                           =
                           0.4
                         and 
                           ω
                           =
                           0.6
                        ).


                        Fig. 4 details results obtained for two particular carotids (carotid 5a and 10b). Carotid 5a is an example of result observed for most carotids of the database (note that the example reported in Fig. 1 corresponds to carotid 3a). In particular, contours obtained by our proposal match the overall shape of expert contours, and the edge-based approach underestimates the area (visually more significantly than in the case of the phantom). Moreover, the area evolution follows the flow one (area increases with blood pressure) and manual drawing involves more fluctuations (as for the phantom).

Carotid 10b (detailed in Fig. 4) corresponds to the highest measured error resulting from our approach. One also indicates results obtained on carotid 10b using 
                           ω
                           =
                           0.2
                         (as for the phantom), leading to a larger vessel lumen. The area evolution becomes more similar to the one of flows, compared to evolutions measured with 
                           ω
                           =
                           0.6
                        . Moreover, estimated areas are more coherent with the mean area observed over the entire database of healthy volunteers (0.47cm2 reported in Table 2). A post-analysis of this sequence by the expert has visually validated the relevance of the result obtained with 
                           ω
                           =
                           0.2
                        , compared to the one obtained with the a priori optimal 
                           ω
                           =
                           0.6
                         (i.e. ω maximizing the similarity with manual delineation). Measured error for carotid 10b with 
                           ω
                           =
                           0.6
                         is therefore likely overestimated. Such a situation illustrates the difficulty of obtaining an objective ground truth for algorithms׳ validation. It also underlines the difficulty of performing a correct manual segmentation for a clinical use, and therefore justifying the relevance of a (semi-)automated analysis method.

Another aspect of experiments concerns parameters: Fig. 4 – top-right shows the influence, measured in terms of mean similarity over the database, of two important parameters, namely the initialization (in percentage of radius estimated from the manual drawing) and the bandwidth.

Concerning the initialization, it appears that the circle must be large enough to reach lumen boundary, and small enough to avoid being captured by surrounded structures during the deformation process (as illustrated for one particular case in Fig. 1). Fig. 4 shows that a radius ranging between 70% and 90% of the effective carotid radius appears reasonable. Note that experiments are performed with the optimal value of 80% (see Section 3.1).

Concerning the bandwidth parameter, the best mean similarity is obtained for a value of 2 pixels. Note that a bandwidth of 1 pixel must be avoided because it makes the region-based energy similar to an edge-based energy [16]. Such a thin band of 2 pixels is required to avoid being corrupted by surrounding structures (see Section 2.2 for explanations and Fig. 2C for result examples obtained for bandwidths of 2 and 8 pixels). Note that this is not the case for the phantom sequence where parameter optimization leads to a large band of 18 pixels, because phantom carotids do not depict any surrounding structures. This justifies the necessity of such narrow band approach, compared to the initially proposed region-based approach where entire inner and outer regions are considered [18].

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The efficiency of the proposed method depends on the image quality, resulting from the acquisition protocol and imaging settings. For instance, the acquisition slice must be perpendicular to the carotid. One also has to avoid motion artefacts (movement minimization), as well as to correctly set imaging parameters, such as, for instance, the velocity encoding one (VENC). As underlined in related works dealing with PC-MRI [10], the VENC must be appropriately chosen (larger that the minimum and maximum value of velocity magnitude in carotid), to avoid aliasing, although this can be corrected (phase unwrapping). It would be interesting to evaluate the influence of these acquisition conditions on the efficiency of the proposal, including their effects on blood flow measurements. This would help in specifying the required and optimal acquisition protocol.

Some preliminary contrast enhancement techniques could be considered, for instance for edge sharpening (e.g. anisotropic filtering for improving the contrast of the carotid). This would probably enable us to use traditional edge-based active contours for instance. This is intrinsically managed, in a unified manner, by the considered region-based method thanks to ω parameter. Note that avoiding such preliminary step also limits the complexity of the entire segmentation procedure (i.e. single segmentation algorithm instead of a combination of several algorithms, each one having its own parameters to estimate).

Concerning the information used for segmentation purposes, our proposal only exploits one information (the anatomical information), the other one (the phase or functional information) being only used for measurements regarding blood flows. As in our case, most recent related works consider only one information for segmentation purposes. For instance, only phase images are used in [7,8], while [9] exploits the anatomical information only. As recently investigated [22,23] (preliminary experiments only), coupling both information may have some potential. The expected benefit would be to overcome the issue related to the lack of contrast appearing in the anatomical image (and the ω parameter to be tuned), by searching, in phase images, for the frontier between flow region and surrounding stationary tissues. The drawback would be the increase of the complexity of the resulting segmentation algorithm, due to related additional parameters to properly estimate (i.e. parameters related to the phase image and to its combination with the anatomical image).

As mentioned in Section 2, initialization involves two kinds of interaction, one for setting the initial circle and the other one for the ω parameter. From the end-user point of view, setting the initial circle does not require to manually draw the carotid lumen boundary on the first image of the sequence. The circle center can be initialized thanks to a simple interaction, such as a mouse click at the carotid lumen center (as in [9]). The circle radius can be tunable (controled by basic mouse movements for instance), but with an appropriate default fixed radius. According to experiments (Fig. 4, “influence of the initialization”), the fixed default value can be set to 80% of standard known radius of carotids. Considering such a fixed radius enables us to reduce the influence of the variability of end-user interactions, limited to the definition of the circle center (click on the lumen center). The second (optional) initialization parameter (i.e. ω) can be set to a default optimal value of 0.5, according to experiments. It can be modified if needed, using a slider proposing a limited range of values. Theorically, ω is constrained within the 
                        [
                        0
                        −
                        1
                        ]
                      interval. Practically, this could be reduced to equally spaced values (e.g. 0.1 step), ranging from 0.1 (excluding 
                        ω
                        =
                        0
                     ) to 0.6 (highest one observed over the database of healthy volunteers). The runtime, excluding the initialization step, is about 0.1s for processing an entire sequence of 20 images (measured on a MacBookPro with a Core I7 2.2GHz Intel processor, and using the C++ implementation of Mille [16]). Thanks to this computation time, the user rapidly gets the result (fast visual feedback) and can re-initialize the procedure if needed (e.g. new circle or ω value). This is compliant with the clinical routine because it leads to a really short entire procedure (probably only few seconds in the worst case, if several initializations are required), compared to a tedious manual drawing over the entire sequence. The advantage of controling the initialization, compared to fully automated algorithms with fixed parameters, is the ability to adapt the proposed algorithm to any particular sequence (this is the case of the ω parameter, as experimentally observed for carotid 10b in Section 3.3). Nevertheless, automating the initialization would be interesting to further improve the analysis, keeping the possibility to switch, in case of failure, to the proposed interactive initialization for specific sequences (i.e. patients or pathologies). This automation constitutes one of the next step of this work. It could involve, for instance, the Hough transform, particularly adapted for detecting circular objects such as the carotid (an issue would be to distinguish the carotid from neighboring circular structures such as the jugular vein).

Aside from experiments using the phantom, our proposal is evaluated on healthy volunteers only, as in several recent related works (e.g. 4 and 6 healthy volunteers respectively in [7,8]). Note that only 2 patients are considered in [10], although one of both depicts a pathology. Pathological cases involve less regular lumen boundaries. As recently discussed for 3D PC-MRI focussing on the aorta [8] using active contours, the segmentation should be as feasible and reliable as for healthy volunteers (assuming appropriate acquisition settings, in particular for the VENC parameter). Indeed, active contours should be flexible enough to properly deform towards lumen boundaries, even if they appear irregular, due to a given pathology. This is illustrated on synthetic images in Fig. 2 – top (in particular for the three images on the right side). Nevertheless, this is an important aspect to be confirmed by an additional experimental study. The present study focuses on the proposition of a method for measuring both lumen area and blood flow evolution over the cardiac cycle. The next study will focus on computer aided diagnosis, concerning the application of this method for subjects depicting a pathology. This would enable us to evaluate whether our proposal can help to automatically detect some specific pathologies (by comparison of measurements on healthy volunteers), and to quantify their severity.

A last aspect to be discussed concerns cardiovascular diseases, such as the atheromatous stenosis of the carotid which develops mainly at its bifurcation. In this case, our purpose is not to directly quantify internal carotid stenosis by velocity measurement at the site of the bifurcation. We focus on blood flow quantification, on common carotid artery. The next step, in a clinical study, would be to do the same on internal carotid artery, above the bifurcation, to quantify hemodynamic changes downstream to an internal carotid stenosis (indicating the severity of the stenosis). Except for the requirement of the acquisition and the processing of an additional sequence, this should, a priori, not present any particular difficulty using the proposed algorithm.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we propose a semi-automated method, using narrow band region-based active contours, for extracting carotid lumen boundary and automatically computing both area and blood flow evolution from PC-MRI sequences. We experimentally show that such region-based active contours are more appropriate than traditional edge-based ones recently considered for the analysis of PC-MRI sequences focusing on the aorta: due to the lower size of carotids and lower contrast at lumen boundaries, such an edge-based approach strongly underestimates vessel area and blood flow. Moreover, experiments, coupling both a phantom sequence and sequences from healthy volunteers, also show the limits, in terms of reliability, of manual drawing.

The work can be used in clinical routine, where the expert only needs to initialize the algorithm by placing a circle within the carotid lumen. If necessary, a single additional parameter enables us to tune, with real-time feedback, the overall extent of segmented contours.

Next step of this work will concern the automation of the initialization using a dedicated algorithm, as well as the evaluation of this work for detecting pathologies and quantifying their severity.
