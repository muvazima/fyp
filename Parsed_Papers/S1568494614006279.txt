               Abstract
               
                  The presence of multiple markets create profitable opportunities to the supply chain system. In this regard, this paper consists of the joint relationship between a manufacturer and multiple markets in which manufacturer offers part-payment to the markets due to their collection of finished products during the production run time. Here it is also considered that manufacturer is facilitated with credit period by raw material supplier where credit period has been presented as an interactive fuzzy fashion. In this paper, two types of deterioration have been assumed such as one for finished products and the other for raw materials. A solution algorithm is presented to get fuzzy optimal profit for the proposed integrated production inventory system optimizing production run time. A numerical example is used to illustrate the proposed model. Finally, sensitivity analysis has been carried out with respect to the major parameters to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model.
