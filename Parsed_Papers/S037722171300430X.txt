                  The two-machine flowshop environment with sequence-independent setup times has been intensely investigated both from theoretical and practical perspectives in the scheduling literature. Nevertheless, very scant attention has been devoted to deriving effective lower bounding strategies. In this paper, we propose new lower bounds for the total completion time minimization criterion. These bounds are based on three relaxation schemes, namely the waiting time-based relaxation scheme, the single machine-based relaxation scheme, and the Lagrangian relaxation scheme. Extensive computational study carried on instances with up to 500 jobs reveals that embedding the waiting time-based bounding strategy within the Lagrangian relaxation framework yields the best performance while requiring negligible CPU time.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Due to the increasing competition caused by globalization, manufacturing industries are nowadays forced to minimize costs and reduce delays in order to maintain competitive positions in the fast changing markets. Flexible production systems together with modern scheduling tools, which rely on sophisticated and effective techniques, proved to substantially help in reaching such key success factors. Flexible production systems induce more important setup times during which the tools of each machine of a production line are changed in order to be able to switch from one batch to another. Setup activities include several important tasks such as tools acquirement and adjustment, machine cleaning up, and material inspection. Recent studies show the significant impact of reducing setup times with respect to several performance criteria encompassing production speed increase, competitiveness improvement, lead times shortening, stock reduction, and customer satisfaction increase [5]. For the sake of illustration, Trovinger and Bohn [29] reported that combining the SMED method with IT-based techniques in a printed circuit board assembly yielded a setup time reduction of more than 80%, resulting to an annual benefit of $1.8 million.

Not only it is crucial to optimize setup times, but more importantly, it is often essential to explicitly take them into account while scheduling numerous production systems. Allahverdi and Souroush [5] listed various real-world scheduling applications where setup times are considered separately from processing times. In addition to industrial applications (e.g. metal processing, brake manufacturing, electronics, etc.), the list covers a wide range of areas including finance, information processing, health care, cosmetics, and satellite imaging, to quote just a few.

In the present paper, we investigate a two-machine flowshop scheduling environment with setup time consideration. The setup times are assumed to be sequence-independent, i.e. they only depend on the job to be processed, regardless of its preceding job. The objective is to find a feasible job sequence which minimizes the total completion time. More formally, a set of n jobs has to be processed on machines M
                     1 and M
                     2 in that order. Processing job j
                     ∈{1,…,
                     n} on machine M
                     
                        i
                      (i
                     ∈{1,2}) requires s
                     
                        i,j
                      units of setup time and p
                     
                        i,j
                      units of non-preemptive processing time. At this point, it should be made clear in the reader’s mind that the setup times are separate entities that are not hidden in the processing times. Indeed, the setup time of a given job on M
                     2 can be dealt with during its processing on M
                     1. All data are assumed to be deterministic and integer. Each machine processes at most one job at one time and each job cannot be processed by more than one machine at one time. According to Allahverdi et al. [8], this strongly

                     . It is worth noting that we only focus on permutation schedules, i.e. where both machines have the same job sequence. Indeed, for any regular optimization criterion in a two-machine flowshop environment with sequence-independent setup times, it can be shown that there always exists an optimal schedule where the job sequence is the same for both machines [7]. Also, it should be noted that the total completion time is equivalent to the mean flow time criterion.

Interestingly, several real-world industrial applications can be modeled as a two-machine flowshop scheduling problem with sequence-independent setup times. These include scheduling multimedia data objects for World Wide Web applications [9], and scheduling automated manufacturing cells with computer-controlled transportation robots [24]. In particular, the

                      arises in the context of three-tiered Internet/database connectivity model which provides an interface between the enterprise service and clients [3]. In this model, client requests need to be processed by the application server and then by the database server (which represent M
                     1 and M
                     2, respectively). For the sake of efficiency, the queued requests are to be scheduled so that the average completion time of a client request is minimized. Before a request can be processed, the resources needed for this request are to be made ready in the application server. Also, an access to the database must be preceded by a preprocessing operation which consists in a database query decomposition and a partial optimization. Since this latter preprocessing operation can start while the application server is processing the query, then it can be seen as its setup operation on the second server.

From a theoretical point of view, the two-machine flowshop with sequence-independent setup times has been the scope of numerous investigations. One of the pioneering results is that of Yoshida and Hitomi [31] who showed that the minimum makespan can be computed in polynomial time. The last decade witnessed a particular interest arousal in this scheduling environment with various optimization criteria [4,6,9]. Also, thorough studies have been conducted on several variants of the machine/job settings, encompassing the single server variant, the no-wait variant, the assembly variant, and the random setup and/or processing times variants [4,10,12,17]. For an exhaustive overview of scheduling literature that deals with setup times, the reader is referred to the excellent survey papers of Allahverdi et al. [7,8].

                      related research is probably that of Allahverdi [6]. He implemented the lower bounds of Bagga and Khurana [11] together with two new dominance rules in a branch-and-bound algorithm which was able to solve instances with up to 35 jobs. He also proved that if s
                     1,j
                     
                     +

                     ⩽
                     s
                     2,j
                      for all j
                     ∈{1,…,
                     n}; then the optimal sequence is obtained by sorting the jobs according to the nondecreasing order of s
                     2,j
                     
                     +
                     p
                     2,j
                     . Moreover, he proposed three constructive heuristics which sequence one, two, and three jobs at a time, respectively. These heuristics have been combined with local search procedures by Al-Anzi and Allahverdi [3] and provided better results. Recently, Ladhari et al. [25] proposed a dynamic priority rule-based constructive heuristic which proved to consistently outperform those of [3]. Moreover, Ladhari et al. [25] devised a multiple crossover genetic local search algorithm that provided near-optimal solutions in reasonable CPU time for large-sized instances with up to 500 jobs.

As it will be detailed in the next section and assessed in our experimental analysis, these bounds are much simplistic and prove to have a low performance. Undoubtedly, efficient and tight lower bounds constitute the bedrock of highly performant branch-and-bound algorithms.

                     . On the other hand, it is well-known that a critical performance measure of an approximate solution is its relative gap with respect to a lower bound. Therefore, relying on loose lower bounds would yield inaccurate assessments of potentially good heuristics for the

The first bounding scheme, baptized the waiting time-based bounding scheme, is based on the minimum time each job has to wait since its finishing time on the first machine until its start time on the second machine. The second one, namely the single machine-based bounding scheme, is based on relaxing the capacity of the first machine. Preliminary computational results have shown that the derived polynomial-time lower bounds outperformed those of Bagga and Khurana [11]. In this paper, we revisit those lower bounding schemes in more details from both theoretical and experimental aspects as detailed in the following points:

A more thorough computational analysis of those preliminary lower bounds as well as of the newly derived ones is provided. The experiments have been conducted on a larger set of instances with up to 500 jobs. Moreover, the adopted performance criteria go beyond the percentage of times each bound yields the maximal value over all of the discussed ones. Indeed, a pairwise comparison of the lower bounds has been carried out in order to provide a clear picture of the empirical dominance of each bound with respect to another. Also, the relative distance of each lower bound with respect to the best obtained one and to the state-of-the-art upper bound are provided. These important measures, along with the average CPU time, allow the reader to easily assess the quality-to-effort ratio of each lower bound. Actually, one major finding of this analysis is that the lower bound that seems to have the best performance in our preliminary work (namely

Furthermore, we investigated two additional bounding techniques, namely the Linear Programming (LP) scheme and the Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) scheme. The LP scheme relies on the position-based formulation of the

Actually, it is important for the reader to know that our computational study revealed that the LP-based bound outperforms all of the discussed lower bounds in terms of effectiveness. However, its huge computation time compared to the other bounds makes it much less competitive in terms of efficiency. Indeed, the LP-based bound was shown to be worthless after having been assessed through two exact procedures, namely a branch-and-bound algorithm and a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach. On the other hand, the LR-based bounds consist of a generalization of the method that has been initially proposed by Van De Velde [30] for the

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the lower bounds proposed in the literature. The newly proposed waiting time-based and single machine-based lower bounds are detailed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Section 5 displays the mathematical model that computes the LP-based bound. The proposed LR-based lower bounds are discussed in Section 6. Computational experiments on a large set of randomly generated instances are reported in Section 7. Section 8 concludes the paper with some directions for future investigations.

In this section, we describe the lower bounds that are proposed in the

                           j
                        , that a job j
                        ∈{1,…,
                        n} has to wait between its finishing time from M
                        1 and its starting time on M
                        2. Since

Gharbi et al. [18] considered three scenarios on the number of job predecessors: a zero-predecessor, a one-predecessor, and a multiple-predecessor scenario. The first scenario assumes that job j is not preceded by any job, which means that the setup operation of job j on M
                        2 starts at the same time as its setup operation on M

The second scenario generalizes the first one by observing that only one job has no predecessor, and any other job j could have a longer waiting time than

                        2 has to wait until its predecessor, say job h, finishes its processing. Note that there are at least

The single machine-based bounding scheme [18] assumes that the resource constraint of the first machine is relaxed. As a consequence, M
                        1 can process any number of jobs at the same time. The obtained problem is a single machine scheduling problem, denoted by

                     +1, then we set δ
                     0,n+1

                     n
                     +1}). Obviously, we set δ 
                     
                        j,j

                     ∈{1,…,

                     Eq. (2) minimizes the total completion time on M

                     ∈{1,…,
                     n} is assigned to exactly one position. Constraints (4) guarantee that each position k
                     ∈{1,…,
                     n} is held by exactly one job. Constraints (5) take into consideration the completion time of the job’s predecessor on each machine. Exceptional jobs with no predecessors are handled by Constraints (6) and (7). Constraints (8) enforce each job to finish processing on M
                     1 before being processed on M

                     Constraints (12) and (13) ensure that the first scheduled job cannot start processing before its setup time is finished. Constraints (14) (respectively (15)) verify that M

                     2) can only setup or process one job at a time. Constraints (16) guarantee that the processing of job j
                     ∈{1,…n} on M
                     2 cannot start before its completion on M

                     Using the same arguments of Van de Velde [30], LR(λ) can be obtained in O(n

Interestingly, we can improve the value of LR(λ) by considering the waiting time δ
                     
                        j
                      that is introduced in Section 3. Indeed, constraints (16) can be modified so that each job j
                     ∈{1,…,
                     n} has to wait for a minimum amount of time δ

All the discussed lower bounds were coded in C and compiled with the Microsoft Visual C++.net 8.0. All the experiments were conducted on a personal computer with an Intel i7 3.4gigahertz processor and 16gigabyte RAM. The assignment problems were solved using the code of Goldberg and Kennedy [19] available at http://www.avglab.com/andrew/soft.html.

In this section, all the experiments were carried on a test bed of 2400 instances which were randomly generated in a fashion similar to that adopted in [6]. More precisely, the processing times were randomly generated using the discrete uniform distribution on [1,100]. The setup times were uniformly drawn from [1,100K], where K
                     ∈{0.25,0.5,0.75,1}. The number of jobs n was taken equal to 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 50, 70, 100, 200, 300 and 500 jobs. For each combination of n and K, 50 instances were generated.

Actually, one major aim of this section is to bring a more detailed picture of the performance of the proposed lower bounds. A pairwise comparison between lower bounds belonging to the waiting time-based, single machine-based and LR-based lower bounds is given in Tables 7–9
                        
                        
                        , respectively. In these tables, we provide for each pair of lower bounds LB
                        row and LB
                        col that are displayed in some given row and column, respectively, the percentage of times LB
                        col improves LB
                        row.

Clearly, the results depicted in Tables 7–9 strongly support the theoretical dominance results provided by Propositions 1–6. More importantly, this pairwise comparison brings a more detailed picture of the preliminary results that have been obtained in [18]. Indeed, the implementation of the best obtained bound of [18], namely

In order to have a better picture of the quality-to-effort ratio of each lower bound LB, we provide the following measures in Tables 10–12
                        
                        
                        :
                           
                              •
                              
                                 UB
                                 
                                    gap
                                 : the average deviation of LB with respect to an upper bound UB, where the deviation is defined by 100(UB

                                 LB)/UB. The upper bound is equal to the minimum value that is obtained by the two best heuristics that have been recently developed by Ladhari et al. [25], namely H3LSII and MCGLS.

                                 : the average deviation of LB with respect to the best obtained lower bound LB

From Tables 10–12, we observe that all of the displayed lower bounds require extremely short average computation time, never exceeding 0.03seconds. It should be highlighted that although

Consequently, after scheduling some jobs at the first positions, the remaining problem becomes polynomially solvable by the SPT rule.

                         shows the best behavior among the single machine-based lower bounds. Noticeably, the LR-based lower bounds offer the closest values to the upper bound along with very negligible computational effort, outperforming thus all the discussed lower bounds in terms of effectiveness/efficiency trade-off.

We observe from Table 13 that LB
                        
                           LP

                        max for all instances with n

                        ) by analyzing the impact of their incorporation within an exact algorithm. For that purpose, we implemented five variants of a branch-and-bound algorithm, each of which corresponding to one selected lower bound. At each node of the search tree, one unscheduled job is added to the last position of an initial partial sequence. We adopted the depth-first node selection strategy. Moreover, for a better performance, the branch-and-bound algorithm includes the following features:
                           
                              •
                              An upper bound provided by the two state-of-the-art heuristics, namely H3LSII and MCGLS [25], is computed at the root node.

The dominance criteria of [6,11,26] are implemented in order to eliminate a maximum number of nodes.

The search tree is consistently reduced by using the No-Good List pruning technique (see [23,28]).

Furthermore, in order to benchmark the implemented exact procedures, the MILP that is defined by Eqs. (2)–(10) has been solved using CPLEX 11.1 software package. A reduced set of generated instances has been considered where the number of jobs n does not exceed 40 jobs, and only 10 instances are generated for each pair (n,
                        K). A time limit equal to 3600seconds has been set for all the algorithms. In Table 14
                        , we provide for each algorithm:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Solved: the number of solved instances within the time limit.


                                 Nodes: the average number of explored nodes.


                                 Time: the average CPU time (in seconds).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper addresses the total completion time minimization problem on a two-machine flowshop with sequence-independent setup times. This scheduling environment has been intensely investigated from both theoretical and practical sides during the last decade. Several bounding strategies are proposed. In particular, embedding the waiting time-based strategy within a Lagrangian relaxation framework provides the best performance from both effectiveness and efficiency viewpoints.

An interesting perspective for future research is to hybridize the single machine-based and the LR-based lower bounds in a suitable and efficient way. Also, a natural future investigation would be to extend the current research to the sequence-dependent environment.
