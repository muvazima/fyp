@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In climate change research one uses simulations of past and future climate to explore the possible changes in future climate. Different global climate models (GCMs) have been developed by a number of research groups. To stimulate development of these models and reap maximum benefits of these efforts the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) has established the framework Coupled Modelling Intercomparison Programme which now is in its fifth phase, CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012). Regional climate models (RCMs) are then used to downscale the global information onto regional scales which helps in assessing climate change information on the scale relevant to the impact of a changing climate. The modelling and downscaling is coordinated in frameworks such as ENSEMBLES (van der Linden and Mitchell, 2009) and CORDEX (Giorgi et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2011) which produce ensembles of GCM and RCM combinations. The motivation behind the use of multiple models in climate change research is to cover different sources of uncertainties, for more details see e.g. Hawkins and Sutton (2009, 2012), and Deser et al. (2012). Due to limited computing resources those matrices with GCM-RCM combinations are not complete, thus only part of the known uncertainty is covered.

To further explore how a changing climate is affecting us and the environment, impact models use climate model output data for the simulation of future climate change impacts, such as crop yields, or in hydrological models simulating the run-off in local areas. Even though it is advised to take all available climate model data into account (e.g. Knutti et al., 2010; Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007; Palmer et al., 2004), often it is not feasible in research projects. The problem which projects face is that the ensembles of GCM-RCM simulations are too big to be handled by many impact modellers.

Until now the GCM-RCM ensembles have often been reduced by hand-picking climate simulations depending on the partners involved in the project. Recently, more thoughtful choices were backed up by considering the different climate change signals of temperature, and sometimes of precipitation too (e.g., Fig. 2.1 in Wilcke et al., 2012; Mendlik et al., 2015; Gobiet et al., 2012). Also Murdock and Spittlehouse (2011) use the spread in the change of temperature and precipitation in a study for British Columbia. In few studies in the field of climate research, e.g. Logan et al. (2011), cluster analysis has been applied to select a subset from an ensemble of climate simulations. Only recently Cannon (2015) presented a sophisticated method applying the Katsavounidis-Kuo-Zang (Katsavounidis et al., 1994) algorithm on a large ensemble of global climate simulations.

By reducing the model ensemble one also reduces the information about the uncertainty in the projections and the ensembles. Note, by reducing the ensemble one does not reduce the uncertainty as such, only the information available about the uncertainty. Thus the task is to maintain maximum information within the limitations dictated by climate impact studies. In projects like CLIP-C and IMPACT2C (Vautard et al., 2014) a clear demand is expressed for a more systematic approach to select subsets of ensembles of climate simulations tailored to the needs within climate change impact studies.

In this paper we present a selection procedure founded on the same basic clustering method as introduced by Mendlik and Gobiet (2015) and explore how it performs for various combinations of variables and climate indices. Specifically, our approach differs in the details of selecting how many principal components to retain, method for choosing the number of clusters and finally how to select one member from each cluster. Based on experiences from current projects, we designed an experiment matrix which focus the evaluation on varying combinations of study regions, climate variables, climate indices, and seasons to test different impact study situations. The study regions included here are examples from Northern Europe. However, the method is to generally select members out of an ensemble, independent of the region.

The paper is structured as follows. Starting with the data description in Section 2, which is followed by the explanation of the ensemble reduction method in Section 3. The experimental set-up is described in Section 4 and the results presented in Section 5. In the summary we draw some conclusions in Section 6.

The ensemble of climate simulations used in this study consists of 11 GCM-RCM combinations from the EURO-CORDEX initiative (Jacob et al., 2013) with a grid spacing of 0.44 × 0.44° (approx. 50 km × 50 km). The simulations have been produced assuming concentration pathway RCP8.5 (van Vuuren et al., 2011; Stocker et al., 2013) and are listed in Table 1
                        . For this study 30 years of data from historical (1971–2000) simulation runs were used as reference. The future climate is represented with three 30 year periods from the scenario simulation runs: 2021–2050, 2051–2080, 2069–2089.

These are the simulations available on the Earth System Grid Federation data network

                         in November 2014. Thus, it is a real world situation with an imperfect and imbalanced RCM-GCM matrix resulting in a limited ensemble of opportunity. This fact does not influence the integrity of this study, moreover it can be taken as motivation for selecting simulations different from each other.

The data used here are daily values of six model outputs over Northern Europe: 2 m mean temperature (tas), minimum temperature (tasmin), maximum temperature (tasmax), surface precipitation amount (pr), mean relative humidity at 2 m (hurs), and mean wind speed at 10 m (wss). From these model output variables we calculated seasonal averages (Table 2
                        ) for each grid cell.

Additionally, for each grid-cell we calculate five annual climate indices that are derived from the climate model output. For temperatures, these are the beetle-degree-days index (BDD) and exceeding threshold index (ET) which are related to climate impact research on spruce bark beetles accompanying this study (Jönsson and Bärring, 2011). The BDD are the degree days marking spruce bark beetle maturity and ET is a threshold for the beginning of the second life cycle of those beetles (c.f. Jönsson and Bärring, 2011, for technical definitions).

The change in cold days can be described, e.g. by the frost days (FD) index which counts the number of days with tasmin below 0° C (Frich et al., 2002). From precipitation the wet day frequency (RR1, days with pr >1 mm/d) was derived, and Beaufort days (FG6Bft) are the number of days with wind speeds above 6 Bft (10.8 m/s) (see also ECA&D indices of extremes
                           2

                        ).

This study focuses on the future climate, therefore the climate change signals (ccs) of the model output and indices are calculated and used as information for the clustering (subsection 2.1).

Covering regional and seasonal differences in climate change and in model performance, the climate change signals were integrated over 6 sub-regions in Northern Europe (Fig. 1
                        ) and four seasons. Table 2 shows the quantities used here, which gives n = 174 variables (6 climate variables × 4 seasons × 6 regions + 5 climate indices × 1 season × 6 regions = 144 + 30 = 174). This results in a matrix A spanned by m simulations and n variables

@&#METHOD@&#

Our approach share the same roots as the clustering method described in Mendlik and Gobiet (2015), but differs in details as they aim at answering slightly different needs. The idea is to group the ensemble members regarding a set of information (a
                     
                        ij
                     ), then select one member out of each group. Fig. 2
                      sketches the different steps in the selection process.

Even though the large number of variables (174 in this study) holds a lot of climate change information, there is also redundancy. Some of the climate quantities ϕ
                     
                        j
                      are strongly correlated with each other. Thus, singular vector decomposition (SVD) is applied to de-correlate (subsection 3.1) the data before the next step, the cluster analysis. The estimation of the optimum number of simulations to select is supported by silhouette values (subsection 3.2). The uncorrelated matrix is also used for the hierarchical clustering (subsection 3.3) which leads together with the tree-cutting to the requested k clusters. The selection of k simulations is finalised by an objective criterion for choosing one simulation from each cluster (subsection 3.4).

To counter the strong correlation and redundancy, as well as to reduce the number of variables without losing any information on uncertainty (i.e. spread or variability), we perform a singular vector decomposition (SVD) (e.g. Wilks, 2006, pp. 420–425). The SVD is applied to the centred and scaled matrix A (Equationfootnote:footnote 1) and transforms the input data in an orthogonal space spanned by n principal components (PCs), which are linear combinations of the original variables. Centring and scaling is necessary to counter different units of the variables. The first few PCs—which together explain more than 70% of the variability—are used for the clustering.

The clustering of m simulations starts with m groups and ends with 1 group. For the cluster analysis, and therefore the ensemble reduction, the number of clusters—the optimum “height” (k) where to stop the clustering—needs to be determined, which is called “tree-cutting”.

The tree cutting can be approached in different ways, with either static (fixed height branch cut) or dynamic cut. A dynamical cut detects clusters by the shape of the branches and has varying cut heights. A description is provided in Langfelder et al. (2008) and applied to large (n > 1000) data-sets to cluster. Mendlik and Gobiet (2015) use the successive increase of variance as indicator when to cut the cluster-tree. In our case the ensemble of simulations is rather small (between 8 and 20 members) and therefore a static procedure is sufficient.

Here, we use an objective distance measure, silhouettes, introduced by Rousseeuw (1987, 1987) used silhouettes to aid the validation of cluster analyses. Silhouettes consider the dissimilarity of a point to all other points in different clusters. That is, the average distance measure for m to 1 clusters is calculated. The highest average silhouette width indicates the number of clusters with maximum distance. The maximum distance between clusters is then interpreted as clearest structure for the ensemble. Fig. 3
                        a shows an example of average silhouette width (y-axis) for 2 to 10 clusters (x-axis) as black circles, when using 4 PCs which represent 76% of the variability. The red filled circle indicates the maximum average silhouette width and the choice for k height within the hierarchical clustering to cut the tree structure.

Following Jain et al. (1999) and Mendlik and Gobiet (2015), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990; Hastie et al., 2001) with tree cutting is used to support the reduction of climate model ensembles.

Hierarchical clustering is a agglomerative method, meaning that it starts with each ensemble member in a separate cluster (m ensemble members and thus m clusters) and in each step merges the two closest clusters together until all ensemble members are in one cluster. To calculate the distances between the members the Ward's Minimum Variance Method (e.g. Wilks, 2006, pp. 552) is chosen, which merges those pairs that minimise the variance within each new cluster.

The HCA requires uncorrelated input data and a height k to interrupt the clustering at the desired amount of clusters (tree cutting). The uncorrelated variables are the PCs gained from the SVD (subsection 3.1) and k results from the silhouette analysis (subsection 3.2). The HCA is then applied to the euclidean distances between the PCs.

On the basis of the resulting clusters we aim for maintaining the group information by choosing a cluster member in the centroid of each group. Another possibility could be to select distinct simulations in a non-automated way, e.g., one average and four extreme simulations Mendlik and Gobiet (2015).

The clustering groups climate simulations which are similar in the multidimensional variable space spanned by the PCs. From a mathematical point of view the clusters are best represented by the clusters means. However, usually there is no simulation exactly at the cluster means. Thus, the simulation that has minimum distance to the cluster's mean is selected to represent the cluster.

The bi-plot in Fig. 3b visualises the grouping and the selection in two dimensions, where the multi-dimensional (in this case 4D as four PCs were used) cluster mean is indicated as a triangle. Even though this plot shows only two dimensions (the first two PCs), the k = 4 groups identified by the silhouette measure are clearly visible.

A special case is when a cluster has only two members. Then the selection of the representative member is arbitrary as the two members are obviously at the same distance to the mean.

The experimental set-up is designed to elucidate the sensitivity of this selection method in relation to the information supplied. Four quantities can be varied: ϕ
                     
                        j
                     , regions, seasons (Table 2), and ccs period (1971–2000 versus: 2021–2050, 2051–2080, and 2069–2098). Here, we evaluate the effect of varying ϕ
                     
                        j
                     , where the regions and the ccs period are held constant. In all but experiment 2, all seasons are utilised. The table in Fig. 4
                      provides an overview of the experiments.

Part of the general test of sensitivity regarding ϕ
                     
                        j
                     , is testing the influence of climate indices, i.e. derived climate model output compared to standard model output variables. The motivation is that derived indices can have different climate change signals compared to their parent variable (e.g. ccs of FD vs. ccs of tasmin). Derived indices are commonly used within impact assessment models in addition to direct climate model outputs. Thus, we incorporated this information in the basic structure of the experiments, where the first part (E*.1) always includes direct and derived model output and the second part (E*.2) only direct model output. The indices and their relation to direct model output is described in subsection 2.2 and indicated by the colours in Fig. 4.

The experiments can be divided into three groups. The first experiment (E1.1 to E1.3) is a general test using all ϕ

                      (E1.1), only direct climate model output (E1.2), and only indices (E1.3).

In experiments 3–8 the combinations of ϕ
                     
                        j
                      are systematically varied, starting with only temperatures (E3.*), combining temperature and precipitation (E4.*), using only precipitation (E5.*), or only wind speed (E6.*), combining wind speed and temperature (E7.*), and combining relative humidity and precipitation (E8.*).

Experiment 2 tests the influence of the first PC on the selection. Based on E1.*, in E2.1 we exclude the ϕ
                     
                        j
                      representing PC1. In this case that would be all ccs for temperatures (tas, tasmax, and tasmin) in summer (JJA) and autumn (SON). Then based on E2.1 we exclude again the ϕ
                     
                        j
                      representing PC1 (E2.3), and then the ϕ
                     
                        j
                      representing PC1 in E2.3 were excluded in E2.4.

The logic behind the individual experiments within each experiment group is explained in more detail in the Results section.

@&#RESULTS@&#

All experiments were carried out separately for the three different future periods mentioned before. In the following we focus on the climate change signals of 2051–2080 with a base period 1971–2000. The results of other ccs periods (to the same base period) are shortly referred to in Section 6. The selection results for all experiments shown in Fig. 4 are described in the following. A comparison between the different climate change periods is completed in subsection 5.2.

Experiment 1 includes all ϕ
                        
                           j
                        , seasons, and regions. The average silhouette widths (Fig. 5
                        a and b) suggest 5 clusters for E1.1 (all ϕ
                        
                           j
                         are used), and 3 clusters for E1.2 (indices are excluded). The bi-plots (Fig. 5c and d) of PC1 and PC2 support this suggestion visually. Fig. 5e and f show that the clustering yields two main groups (from top the first two branches) which contain the same simulations, lilac-blue and yellow-green-red for E1.1 and blue and yellow-red for E1.2; even when following the tree down to the next branch (k = 3).

The cluster member (simulations) closest to the clusters' means are similar (considering the three clusters they have in common) for E1.1 and E1.2 (Fig. 5c and d), i.e. CERFACS-RCA4 (red) and IPSL-RCA4 (lilac in Fig. 5c (E1.1) and blue in Fig. 5d (E1.2)) are selected in both cases. The selection differs in the yellow cluster, where EC-RCA4 is chosen for E1.1 and NorESM1-RCA4 for E1.2; and, of course, the number of clusters/simulations differs too.


                        Fig. 6
                        a and b show the loadings of PC1 for each ϕ
                        
                           j
                        (x,t) for E1.1 and E1.2. The colour intensity indicates the loading, and thereby the contribution to PC1. From Fig. 6 one can see that summer and autumn temperatures contribute most to PC1, as well as the two temperature-related climate indices. Experiment 2 was designed to test, in particular, the effect of the “big” contributors on the selection method. Therefore, we excluded successively the ϕ
                        
                           l
                        (x,t) which are represented by PC1 as indicated in Fig. 4. In E2.1 to E2.4 the exclusion of PC1 relevant variables leads to strongly reduced structure in the silhouette analysis. Excluding temperatures completely as in E9.1 and E9.2 results in very different clustering and selection from experiment 1 and from all experiments with temperatures included. This shows that temperature is a dominant variable in this set-up. These results are not illustrated in detail here.

In the following experiments we alternate the combination of ϕ
                           
                              j
                           , but do not vary seasons and regions.

In E3.1 and E3.2 (Fig. 7
                           ) the selection is based only on temperatures (mean, min, and max), which exhibit strong climate change signals. The average silhouette widths peak for k = 3 in E3.1 (not shown) and for k = 2 in E3.2 (excluding temperature indices, Fig. 7a). The two main clusters differ only with respect to EC-RCA4 (Fig. 7c and d), i.e. the climate change signals for the threshold based indices are different from the climate change signals for the temperatures, which makes this simulation change the clusters. Nevertheless, the same simulations are selected within the clusters, IPSL-RCA4 and EC-HIRHAM5, and additionally NorESM1-RCA4 in E3.2, where one more cluster was suggested by the silhouette analysis.

In experiment 4 precipitation is added to the temperatures as basis for the selection process. The results are similar to the ones from experiment 3 (only temperatures). The silhouette analysis peaks again at k = 3 when including indices (E4.1) and k = 2 when excluding them (E4.2). Also the two main clusters are the same as in experiment 3 and the selection of IPSL-RCA4 within the blue cluster (Fig. 8
                           ). However, within the larger cluster NorESM1-RCA4 is chosen, and CERFACS-RCA4 when k = 3 (E4.1).

Using only precipitation as guidance for the selection (experiment 5), changes the structure of the clusters. For k = 2 the cluster sizes are nearly equal (5 and 6 members, Fig. 9
                           ). However, only two of the selected simulations are the same in E5.1 compared to E4.1, which are CERFACS-RCA4 and IPSL-RCA4.

In experiment 6 the selection is based on wind speed (and FG6Bft). The clusters with (E6.1, Fig. 10
                           a) and without (E6.2, Fig. 10b) the index differ from the other experiments. Furthermore, the inclusion of FG6Bft (E6.1, Fig. 10a) leads to a different grouping compared to using only wind speed (E6.2, Fig. 10b). Even though it might be highly unlikely that an impact study is only based on wind speed, it does mean wind indices should be considered in the selection process, when used for the impact study.

Adding temperatures to the wind speed (experiment 7) results in the two main clusters seen before with temperatures (Fig. 11
                           ). Not considering the indices (E7.2) shows the same clusters as in Fig. 8a (temperatures and precipitation). Including the indices (E7.2) leads to four clusters which only differ to E7.1 in separating the EC-HIRHAM5 into its own cluster.

A set-up purely related to water is tested in experiment 8, by using precipitation and relative humidity as basis for the selection. The striking feature here (Fig. 12
                           ) is the separation of the two non-RCA simulations for k = 2 from the RCA simulations, which only happened before when temperatures were excluded (E9.1).

Here, we investigate the sensitivity of the selection regarding the ccs period. The selection is completed for the experiments as described before for three climate change periods; 2021–2050, 2051–2080, 2069–2098.


                        Fig. 13
                         visualises the selection regarding experiments and ccs periods. It shows which simulations (names are not important here) are selected for ccs 2021–2050 (blue), ccs 2051–2080 (red), and ccs 2069–2098 (orange). Even though some simulations, like simulations 1 or 9, are preferred as representatives for their clusters, that does not hold for all experiments and all ccs periods, as count numbers show on the right side of Fig. 13. There is no visible pattern, i.e. the results for one ccs period to another differ and the selected simulations of one period most likely will not be selected in another period. In Fig. 13 this is visible as most of the boxes (experiments and simulations), contain fewer than three colours.

Comparing the frequency of number of simulations for the three ccs periods, more then five simulations are rarely suggested. For the climate change signals towards mid of the century (red) half of the times the silhouette widths suggested only two clusters (Fig. 14
                        ). This emphasises the importance of detailed information from the impact study side, like the ccs period, within the selection process.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The study presented here evaluates and extends an approach to reduce ensembles of climate simulations. The reduction contains five steps: 1) identify user requirements (variables); 2) transform variables into orthogonal and therewith uncorrelated variables; 3) calculate the optimum number of clusters (average silhouette widths); 4) use hierarchical clustering to group the simulations; and finally 5) select the simulation closest to the group's mean as representative.

The variables are combinations of climate change signals of climate model output (ϕ
                     
                        j
                     ), season, and region (Table 2). Climate model output were chosen: temperatures (mean, min, max), precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed. n Variables and m simulations (climate simulations from the EURO-CORDEX project, Table 1) span the matrix A = {a
                     
                        ij
                     } which was de-correlated via singular vector decomposition (SVD).

This selection process was tested for sensitivity against different combinations of ϕ
                     
                        j
                      and three different climate change periods. The focus here was on the use of climate change signals of climate indices as additional information, as the threshold based quantities can be differently represented in the simulations than their parental variable.

The results show a strong sensitivity to the choice of variables and ccs periods. In our experiments for regions in northern Europe, the structure of the clusters was dominated by temperature, when included. Overall, the clusters remained largely unchanged, when climate indices were in- or excluded. However, the simulations selected were different for the different experiments. The selection within the experiments stayed the same (for E*.1 and E*.2), when temperature was involved. This means the influence of the related indices is limited only to the number of selected simulations.

For the experiments excluding temperature, the indices strongly affect the final selection. Thus, for studies without temperature it is important for the selection to know if some kind of derived indices will be part of the study.

The highest impact of climate indices on the selection shows wind speed and its extreme index FG6Bft, when applied without temperature. Here, the resulting clusters differ in size and structure when the index was in- or excluded. Also there was no overlap in the final selection of the simulations. Based on that one cannot draw any conclusion regarding the amplitude of the climate change signal of wind speed and FG6Bft. However, it clearly shows that different members share the same characteristics in ccs of FG6Bft than when the selection focusses on the characteristics in ccs of wind speed alone.

The dependence of the results on the variables can be related to what is known about the performance of RCMs. In, e.g., Christensen et al. (2010) it is shown that RCMs show differences in performance depending on variable, region and season. Thus, the differing resulting clusters reflect this behaviour.

Comparing the results for the three different climate change periods no pattern could be found in the selection of representative model simulations. Two simulations might be favoured (Fig. 13), but not clearly enough to automatically choose them. Regarding the number of simulations, for half of the experiments for the mid ccs (2051–2080) two clusters were suggested. However, only rarely more than 5 simulations were suggested, which does relate to the ensemble size of 11 simulations.

The results regarding dominance of single variables, like temperature, are related to the regions included for the selection. They could be confirmed in examples not shown here, when regions from Southern Europe are included as well (Pulatov, 2015). Nevertheless, this is not a general statement as only a subset of possible variables and combinations were tested. Furthermore, one has to keep in mind that we were using an ensemble of opportunity only having 11 members. However, this paper intends to present and analyse a method on basis of examples. Thus, the dominance of temperature variables should not be generalised without further studies.

In the study of Cannon (2015) it is stated that clustering methods have the disadvantage that the selection changes if one changes the preferred number of simulations and explaining that it leads to inconsistencies for users with different needs. We can confirm, that if one changes the size of the requested subset from, e.g., 4 to 5, one cluster will be split up into two. The representatives of those two “new” clusters will differ from the representative of the one “old” cluster. However, as we select the representatives of each group and by that covering all existing groups, we consider the splitting as a positive and wanted result.

Following the concerns of Knutti et al. (2010) about redundant information in large model ensembles, Evans et al. (2014) considers the performance of the simulations as well as their independence from each other regarding the ccs, aiming for maximising independence between simulations and minimising redundancy. However, their final selection is based on a subjective decision about the independence and future performance of the simulations.

From this, it is also clear that there exist different motivations for reducing an ensemble, and therefore different methods (even though not many are applied in climate research), which serve different aims.

The influence of the provided input information on the selection procedure does not make a statement about the robustness of the method. It rather emphasises that researchers, working in climate change impact studies, need to be aware of this influence. It points out that climate data should not be used or selected blindly and too generally, but should be evaluated for fitness of purpose before.

Overall, this study shows the importance of a selection process depending on the variables relevant for the impact model and information about the impact study. It is worth spending some time on the communication of which are the relevant climate variables, but also indices for the impact modellers, as well as the study region, season, and ccs period. This information will help to find a representative subset of simulations and could thus improve the representativeness of the impact model output.

The last point will be investigated in a separate study together with the application of bias adjusted climate model output.
