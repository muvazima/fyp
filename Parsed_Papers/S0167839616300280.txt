                  The theory of the isoptic curves is widely studied in the Euclidean plane

                      (see Cieślak et al., 1991 and Wieleitner, 1908 and the references given there). The analogous question was investigated by the authors in the hyperbolic

                  In Csima and Szirmai (2013) we gave a natural extension of the notion of the isoptic curves to the n-dimensional Euclidean space

                      which is called isoptic hypersurface. Now we develope an algorithm to determine the isoptic surface

                  We will determine the isoptic surfaces for Platonic solids and for some semi-regular Archimedean polytopes and visualize them with Wolfram Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Inc., 2015).

                     . The isoptic curve of a given plane curve 
                        C
                      is the locus of points 
                        P
                        ∈
                        G
                      where 
                        C
                      is seen under a given fixed angle α 
                     
                        (

                        )
                     . An isoptic curve formed by the locus of tangents meeting at right angles is called orthoptic curve. The name isoptic curve was suggested by Taylor (1884).

In Cieślak et al. (1991, 1996) the isoptic curves of the closed, strictly convex curves are studied, by use of their support function. The explicit formula for the isoptic curve of the triangle can be found in Michalska and Mozgawa (2015). The papers Wunderlich (1971a, 1971b) deal with curves having a circle or an ellipse by an isoptic curve. Further curves appearing as isoptic curves are well studied in the Euclidean plane geometry

                     Loria (1911), Wieleitner (1908). Isoptic curves of conic sections have been studied in Holzmüller (1882) and Siebeck (1860). Isoptic curves of Bézier curves are considered in Kunkli et al. (2013). A lot of papers concentrate on the properties of the isoptics e.g. 
                     Miernowski and Mozgawa (1997), Michalska (2003), and the references given there. The papers Kurusa (2012) and Kurusa and Ódor (2015) deal with inverse problems.

                      the isoptic curves of segments and proper conic sections are determined by the authors Csima and Szirmai (2010, 2012, 2014). In Csima and Szirmai (submitted for publication) we extended the notion of the isoptic curves to the outer (non-proper) points of the hyperbolic plane and determined the isoptic curves of the generalized conic sections.

It is known, that the angle between two half-lines with the vertex A in the plane can be measured by the arc length on the unit circle around the point A. This statement can be generalized to the higher dimensional Euclidean spaces. The notion of the solid angle is well known and widely studied in the literature (see Gardner and Verghese, 1971). We recall this definition concerning the 3-dimensional Euclidean space

In this paper we develope an algorithm and the corresponding computer program to determine the isoptic surface of an arbitrary convex polyhedron in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. We apply this algorithm for the regular Platonic solids and some semi-regular Archimedean solids as well. We note here that this generalization of the isoptic curves to the 3-dimensional space provides possible research to extend the notion of isoptic surfaces to bounded polyhedral surfaces and, with triangulations, to ‘smooth surfaces’.

In this section we discuss the algorithm developed to determine the isoptic surface of a given polyhedron.

In the following we apply our algorithm to some polyhedra. We note here that the algorithm provides the implicit equation of the compound isoptic surface related to the given polyhedron (see Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                        ).


                        
                           Remark 2.3
                           Despite the equation can be obtained in 
                                 O
                                 (
                                 e
                                 )
                               steps, where e is the number of edges, the rendering of these figures by Wolfram Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Inc., 2015) takes 20–40 minutes. The implicit equation of the isoptic surface is so complicated that it seems difficult to draw further consequences from it.
