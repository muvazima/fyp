                  We propose an allocation rule that takes into account the importance of both players and their links and characterize it for a fixed network. Our characterization is along the lines of the characterization of the Position value for Network games by van den Nouweland and Slikker (2012). The allocation rule so defined admits multilateral interactions among the players through their links which distinguishes it from the other existing rules. Next, we extend our allocation rule to flexible networks à la Jackson (2005).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The study of networks under the game theoretic framework revolves around two basic problems: how a network is formed and how to allocate the value it generates among its members. In this paper we propose a new allocation rule that takes into account the importance of players as well as their links. Since a network describes the interaction structure between agents, a key feature of our allocation rule is that it covers both bilateral and multilateral interactions. We provide an axiomatic characterization of this rule and compare it to other allocation rules in the literature.

The notion of a “Network game” under the cooperative framework was introduced by Jackson and Wolinsky (1996). This itself is an extension of the “Communication situation” concept introduced by Myerson (1977). In a subsequent paper Jackson (2005) extended a solution concept for Communication situations to Network games: the Myerson value and called it “the equal bargaining rule”. Borm, Owen, and Tijs (1992), Slikker and van den Nouweland (2001), Slikker (2005); 2007), Haeringer (2006), Kamijo (2009), Kamijo and Kongo (2009), Ghintran (2013), van den Nouweland and Slikker (2012) etc., extended and characterized another solution concept for Communication situations and Network games: the Position value. Recently the kappa value is defined by Belau (2013) as a more generalized version of the position value for Communication situations that accounts for various potential alternatives to the actual network in place. Related works by Bergantiños, Gómez-Rúa, Llorca, Pulido, and Sánchez-Soriano (2014) and Rosenthal (2013) study the division of cost of a network among the agents.


                     Jackson (2005) introduced the notion of flexible networks. The underlying idea is that the network observed at a point in time need not be fixed, and could ultimately evolve into a better subnetwork if such a network exists. He showed that the equal bargaining rule for Network games possesses certain limitations. In fact similar arguments can also be constructed for some of the characterizations of the Position value for Network games. Jackson proposed another set of allocation rules for flexible networks among which, the Player Based Flexible Network allocation rule (PBFN) and the Link Based Flexible Network allocation rules (LBFN) are quite appealing. While flexible network allocation rules have many advantages, they may not always be feasible.

                        1
                        For instance there might be situations where a priori assessment of the values of alternative networks is not possible due to the need for costly hardware installations.
                     
                  

The Position value is a standard link based rule where players get less importance than the links they make. The equal bargaining rule on the other hand emphasizes more on players. Both these values are Shapley type in the sense that they aggregate the marginal contributions of the players over links and coalitions stemming from the given network respectively. The Position value aggregates the marginal contributions of the links and then divide this value into equal halves between the two players forming the links. The cumulative value arising from the links of a player is her final payoff. This shows the importance of the roles links play here. On the other hand the equal bargaining rule aggregates the marginal contributions of the players involved in each coalition restricted to the network. Thus the contribution of a player in this setup is measured by her joining or leaving the network with all her links. Therefore these two values are two extreme cases of interactions of a player with her peers. However, it is useful to have an allocation rule that accounts for both players and their links in a manner that incorporates the simultaneous multilateral interactions in a network. By multilateral interactions, we mean the interactions that take place among individuals through some (possibly more than one) of their links simultaneously in the network. For example, consider players 1, 2, and 3 of a particular football team who complement each other on the field. Suppose these players are linked to each other (and the rest of the team) by means of their passing game which ultimately leads to goals being scored. Since player 1 is involved in two links with 2 and 3 respectively and complementarities exist across players, this player’s contribution to the team will change depending on whether we consider the removal of those links separately or the removal of both the links together. Thus, measuring the marginal contributions of one of those players cannot be done independently from the others and the effect of the multilateral interaction needs to be considered.

In this paper, we develop such an allocation rule for fixed network games and extend it to flexible networks. First we provide an axiomatic characterizations of our rule using standard Shapley like axioms viz., linearity, null player axiom, anonymity, monotonicity and efficiency suitable for the standard revenue or cost allocation problems. We then show that this is satisfied only for a small set of networks.

On the other hand, cooperative game theory also had a long tradition of offering inefficient solution concepts. There are many situations like creating a public good or winning a voting situation where an allocation is not just to divide the winnings but to describe how the players can affect the outcome of the game through their interactions.
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        This idea is similar to most of the semi-values for cooperative games (e.g., the minimum norm solutions, Kultti and Salonen, 2007; least square values, Ruiz, Valenciano, and Zarzuelo, 1996; 1998; Banzhaf value, Banzhaf, 1965 for simple games and their extensions to general cooperative games i.e., TU games by Owen, 1975; Dragan, 1996; Marichal and Mathonet, 2011 etc.) and may be thought of as describing the power of players.
                      In Owen (1975), a modification of the Banzhaf value is defined for communication situations. This was characterized in Alonso-Meijide and Fiestras-Janeiro (2006) using the properties of component total power and fairness. Inefficient allocation rules are likely to describe the prospects of playing different roles in a game rather than describing fair division (see Dubey, Neyman, and Weber, 1981). In networks, when players have multilateral interactions with their peers, they have different roles to play in each such interaction. Thus for an allocation rule that measures the prospects of playing those roles (interacting with players at different levels) axioms like efficiency can be replaced by weaker axioms. Keeping this in mind, next we replace the axiom of efficiency by a new axiom, called the axiom of multilateral interaction and obtain an alternative characterization.

We show that our allocation rule can provide a better measure of a player’s prospects in the network and determines the total power (viz., power to initiate an action or power to prevent an action) of a player in the network due to her multilateral interactions. Here power of a player is measured by her prospects in playing different roles. These roles are interactions among players at different levels. In either case (with or without efficiency), we obtain a Shapley like allocation rule which finds the weighted average of the marginal contributions of players taking into account every possible combination of their links. Hence while the player based approaches account for contributions of all links of a player and the link based approaches for those of one link of each player, our rule accounts for everything in between.

In the literature, excepting van den Nouweland and Slikker (2012), both the equal bargaining rule and Position value for Network games are characterized by the rather strong axiom of component balance. It requires that when the Network game does not allow spill-over across components (alternatively: the game is component additive), the value generated by any component should be allocated to its constituent players. We do not require component balancedness for our characterizations.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides the necessary mathematical preliminaries, includes a brief description of the existing allocation rules and their characterization results. Section 3 develops our notion of an interactive allocation rule and its characterization. In Section 4 we provide numerical solutions to the motivating examples. Section 5 concludes. Major proofs and the additional details about Example 1 can be found in Appendix A.

In this section, we present the definitions and results required for development of our model.

Let N = {1, …, n} be a fixed set of players who are connected in some network relationship. A network consists of a finite set of elements called nodes corresponding to players and a finite set of pairs of nodes called links which correspond to bilateral relationships between players. The network g is thus a list of unordered pairs of players {i, j}, where {i, j} ∈ g indicates that i and j are linked in the network g. For simplicity, we write ij to represent the link {i, j}. The degree of a player in a network is the number of direct links she has in the network. Let gN
                      be the set of all subsets of N of size 2. We call gN
                      the complete network with n nodes. Then G = {g|g⊆gN
                     } denotes the set of all possible networks or graphs on N. Special types of networks that are important for us are k-regular networks (network where every node has the same degree k) and the star networks (networks in which n − 1 peripheral players are connected through one central player). The network obtained by adding another network g′ to an existing network g is denoted by g + g′ and the network obtained by deleting subnetwork g′ from an existing network g is denoted by g − g′. For g ∈ G, l(g) denotes the total number of links. By m ∈ g we mean that m is a subnetwork of g (m⊆g) with length l(m) = 1. A path in a network is a sequence of nodes such that from each of its nodes there is a link to the next node in the sequence. Let N(g) be the set of players who have at least one link in g. That is,

                        Definition 1
                        A component of a network g, is a non-empty subnetwork g′⊂g, such that

                              
                                 (a)
                                 if i ∈ N(g′) and j ∈ N(g′) where j ≠ i, then there is a path in g′ between i and j, and

if i ∈ N(g′) and ij ∈ g, then ij ∈ g′.

Essentially, components of a network are the distinct connected subgraphs in it. The set of components of g is denoted by C(g).

                        Definition 2
                        A value function is a function 
                              
                                 v
                                 :
                                 G
                                 →
                                 R
                              
                            such that v(∅) = 0, where ∅ represents the empty network i.e., network without links.

The set of all possible value functions is denoted by V. The value function specifies the total worth that is generated by a given network structure. It can take into account both costs and benefits whenever this information is available.

                        A Network game is a pair, (N, v), consisting of a set of players and a value function. When N is fixed and there is no confusion regarding this, we denote the Network game by only v.

A Network game v is monotonic if for g, g′ ∈ G with g′⊂g, we have v(g′) ≤ v(g).

The Position value for Network games is the most important link based allocation rule hitherto found in the literature.

Allocation rules for Network games, such as the equal bargaining rule and the Position value for Network games implicitly or explicitly take the network structure as fixed. In many situations, however, the network structure can be altered by players. This means that the value of alternative network structures (not just sub-networks) can and should influence the allocation of value among players on any given network structure, see Jackson (2005). The network is flexible in the sense that even if a network currently exists, it may change in the future simply because it may not be the best possible network. Consequently, an allocation rule should be defined for such flexible networks which takes into account the value that might accrue from alternative potential networks. Typically this is done by exploring all possible networks starting from the complete network but it can be adapted to non-complete networks as well. Thus in what follows, we define a flexible allocation rule following Jackson (2005).

                        Definition 7
                        An allocation rule Y is a flexible network rule if 
                              
                                 Y

                                    )

In Table 1
                     , we present some of the most popular allocation rules used in the networks literature to which we compare our work. Note that all these rules are Shapley like. The first two rules namely equal bargaining rule and Position value for Network games which we denote by Y
                     NMV and Y
                     NPos are fixed network rules characterized respectively by Jackson (2005) and Slikker (2007) for Network games while the player based and link based flexible allocation rules which we denote by Y
                     PBFN and Y
                     LBFN are due to Jackson (2005).

In this section, we develop a new allocation rule for fixed and flexible networks, emphasizing both the roles of players and their links. We call this rule: an interactive allocation rule. Consider a network g = {ij, jk, ik} with Li
                     (g) = {ij, ik}. In g, player i can interact with j and k separately (i.e., one at a time) or simultaneously which may provide additional synergies. We begin with the following definitions.

                        Definition 8
                        Fix a network g. Denote by Gg
                           , the set of all subnetworks of g. Consider the class Vg
                            of all network games defined on Gg
                           . Note that Vg
                            is a vector space over reals and of dimension 2
                              l(g) − 1. We define an allocation rule on g as a function 
                              
                                 
                                    Y
                                    g
                                 
                                 :
                                 
                                    V
                                    g
                                 
                                 →
                                 
                                    R
                                    n
                                 
                              
                            such that Y
                           
                              g, i
                           (v) represents the payoff to player i with respect to v ∈ Vg
                           .

An efficient allocation rule Yg
                            on g is one in which ∑
                              i
                           
                           Y
                           
                              g, i
                           (v) = v(g), ∀v ∈ Vg
                           . An efficient allocation rule Yg
                            is said to satisfy the axiom of efficiency E.

Note that the earlier literature on axiomatic approaches to networks has focussed on allocation rules that are efficient primarily because they have always used component balancedness. However, we do not use this property. Furthermore, the allocation rule we define here is network g specific.

Prior to the characterization of our allocation rule we need the following definitions.

                        Definition 10
                        An allocation rule Yg
                            on g is said to satisfy the Linearity axiom (L) if for v, v′ ∈ Vg
                           , and

The next definition is that of a null player which resembles with a similar notion in standard cooperative game theory.

                        Definition 11
                        A player i is null for the value function v ∈ Vg
                            with respect to the network g, if for every g′⊆g − Li
                           (g) and every gi
                           ⊆Li
                           (g), we have v(g′ + gi
                           ) = v(g′).

An allocation rule Yg
                            on g is said to satisfy the Null player axiom (NP) if for every null player i ∈ N for v ∈ Vg
                           , we have Y
                           
                              g, i
                           (v) = 0.

The Null player axiom (NP) says that if a player and her links have no effect in generating value in the network then she gets nothing. Next we define the axiom of anonymity which says that the payoff of a player does not depend on her “identity”.

                        Definition 13
                        Let π be a permutation on N. For a given network g, and for each v ∈ Vg
                           , we define the game πv ∈ Vπg
                            by, πv(πg′) = v(g′) ∀g′ ∈ Gg
                           . An allocation rule Yg
                            on g is said to satisfy the Anonymity axiom (A) if for all v ∈ Vg
                            and permutations π on N,

Our next axiom is of monotonicity which ensures non-negative payoffs to players under monotonic games.

                        Definition 14
                        An allocation rule Yg
                            on g is said to satisfy the Monotonicity axiom (M) if for every monotonic value function v, Y
                           
                              g, i
                           (v) ≥ 0 for every i ∈ N.

Observe that the axioms L, NP, A and M are standard in cooperative games and we follow van den Nouweland and Slikker (2012). Thus we have the following proposition.

                        Proposition 1

                            satisfies axioms L, NP, A and M for a given network g, then for every v ∈ Vg
                           , there exists a family of non-negative real constants

Observe that Eq. (3.1) gives a Shapley like allocation rule. Let us call the expression v(g′ + gi
                     ) − v(g′) in Eq. (3.1) the marginal multilateral contribution of player i due to her links gi
                      ∈ Li
                     (g) with respect to the network game v over g′⊆g − gi
                     . In particular, if l(gi
                     ) = 1 that is, gi
                      consists of only a single link, we call the corresponding expression, the marginal bilateral contribution.
                        3
                     
                     
                        3
                        In the player based rule, the marginal contribution of player i is measured over each possible coalition of players connected through the links in the network. Therefore, it actually measures her contribution to the network as a result of her interaction with her peers through all her links in the network together. Contrary to this, in the link based rule, her contributions to the network is measured on the basis of her interactions through one link at a time (the marginal bilateral contribution).
                      Note that the marginal multilateral contribution as the name signifies, measures the level of interactions made by player i through all her links in the network game. See Example 2 for more on this.

From Proposition 1 it is evident that the axioms of L, NP, A and M are not sufficient to have precise expressions for the coefficients. In the following, we first use the additional axiom of efficiency E to obtain an efficient allocation rule and then replace E by the axiom of multilateral interactions MI. The former only provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the class of efficient allocation rules while the latter gives a unique expression for the coefficients

The following example shows that the requirement that an allocation rule satisfies the axioms L, NP, A, M and E together sufficiently restricts the domain of any network game. Example. For N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, take g = {12, 23, 34, 35}. If the corresponding Yg
                         satisfies E, we must have from (3.2),

                        The above system of equations is inconsistent. However we have a weaker sufficiency condition for an efficient allocation rule that satisfies L, NP, A and M together in the following.

                           Proposition 2
                           An allocation rule that satisfies L, NP, A, M and E on g for any v ∈ Vg
                               if and only if either g is k-regular or is a star.

The proof can be found in Appendix A.

The fact that efficiency of Yg
                         is consistent with the axioms L, NP, A and M only for a very narrow class of networks can be attributed to our assumption that players interact multilaterally. Consequently, in what follows we replace the axiom of efficiency E by the axiom of multilateral interactions MI and obtain a unique allocation rule that satisfies L, NP, A, M and MI for any network g.

We first define a reduced game (in the sense of Harsanyi, 1963) and show that the marginal multilateral contributions of player i at all levels of interactions due to any game can be identified with the marginal bilateral contributions due to the corresponding reduced game.

In view of Definition 15, it is evident that in a reduced game with respect to the link set gi
                        , player i is connected to her peers through a single hypothetical link and the value generated through this will be the same as that in the original game when she links up through all her links in gi
                         separately. This suggests that the multilateral interaction of a player at any level k in a game can be realized through her bilateral interactions in the corresponding reduced game (by a single hypothetical link). Since, the Position value for Network games is an aggregate of the marginal multilateral contributions of player i at level 1 (considering interaction due to one link at a time) therefore it is natural to assume that our allocation rule for a reduced game should yield the Position value for Network games. It is easy to show that the Position value for Network games satisfies L, NP, A and M. We have the following definition.

An allocation rule Yg
                               is said to satisfy the axiom of Multilateral Interactions (MI) if it admits the Position value for any Network game v at each level of interaction.

Axiom MI ensures that the total power

                         of a player in the network is measured by summing all her powers stemming out from her possible multilateral interactions at each level. Thus

In the following we give an illustration of MI by means of a geo-political example. Let there be five countries viz., A, B, C, D and E connected in a network g. Let E and B share the same market. Suppose that A increases her bilateral relationship with E and B. It may now be viewed as a balancing node between E and B.

On the other hand let A have alliance with C and D and D is a close ally of E. D and E oppose certain policies of C. A also has excellent trade relations with D that are growing over time. Let further that C has been placed under various sanctions by E and its allied countries. Thus nation A plays a crucial role in the network of the bilateral relationships among all these nations. The influence it possesses over the policies of E for its neighbouring countries is highly dependent on its links with all the countries together. These cases are therefore to be treated independently and her marginal contribution needs to be determined on the basis of all these influence distinctly. All such marginal contributions aggregate to provide a reasonable basis for determining the power index of a country. See Example 1 for a numerical illustration using the above information.

Consequently we state the main result of this section as follows.

An allocation rule

                               on a given efficient network g satisfies axioms L, NP, A, M and MI and is a flexible network rule if and only if it is given by (3.6)–(3.7).

Continuing the examples of the trade network in the geo-political situation and the three player network in a football game, in this section we obtain numerically the allocations under a hypothetical setup. The first example viz., the geo-political situation shows how we can interpret the allocation to a player as her power to influence the other nations in her network. This is exactly the reason for doing a nice big example with 5 players. The second example focuses upon the role of multilateral interactions in the game of football and illustrates the relationship between the existing allocation rules which we have considered in this paper and our proposed allocation rule. Nevertheless other team games like hockey or basketball also constitute a natural example.

                        Example 1
                        Geo-political situation


                        Denote the countries in the network g (see Fig. 1
                           ) by their respective numbers (i.e., 1 for A, 2 for B etc.). Thus g = {12, 13, 14, 15, 25, 45, 34}. Let v define the percentages of increases in the total trades among the nodes (countries) for every g′⊆g during the last decade. The values for v at the subnetworks g′⊆g are given in Appendix A. Observe that these values represent the network structure and the multilateral interactions among the players described in the geo-political situation.

We first illustrate how an allocation can be interpreted as the total power of a player. Suppose g
                           1 = {15, 13, 14}. It follows that, in the reduced network g − g
                           1 + [g
                           1] = {12, 25, 45, 34, [{15, 13, 14}]} the reduced game v
                           [{15, 13, 14}] gives every g′⊆g − g
                           1 the net value of the total trades when player 1 is involved in a trade relationship with 3, 4 and 5 simultaneously. Thus our allocation rule Y
                           [{15, 13, 14}], 1 determines the power of player 1 to initiate trades with the other countries when she initiates negotiations among 3, 4 and 5. Subsequently, let g
                           1 = {14, 13}. By hypothesis,

                            assigns every g′⊆g − gi
                            the net value of the total trades when player 1 is involved in trade negotiations between 3 and 4 only. Following the analogy, allocation to player 1 for v
                           [14, 13] may be interpreted as the power of player 1 to prevent conflicts between 3 and 4. Each allocation gives player 1 a power to influence the countries in her network. Therefore, to assess her global acceptance as a leading economy, her total power is to be measured. This is essentially the sum of all the powers for each such reduced game. After computation the interactive allocation rule determines power of the players as follows.

                           We see that the interactive rule assigns about 52.46 percent of the power to the crucial country A.

Consider the football game with three players discussed in the Introduction. Note that by a link here we mean the strategic pass between two players. Thus the network formed by players 1, 2 and 3 essentially is the complete network {12, 23, 13}. Thus any g′⊆g is a combination of the passing of games that leads to a goal being scored. Since player 1 is involved in links 12 and 13 and complementarities exist across players, her contribution to the team will change depending on whether we consider the removal of the links 12 and 13 separately or the removal of the links 12 and 13 together. The equal bargaining rule of player 1 for example, involves aggregation of the marginal contributions v{12} − v(∅), v{13} − v(∅) and v{12, 13, 23} − v{23}, while the Position value for Network games involves aggregation of v{12} − v(∅), v{13} − v(∅), v{12, 13} − v{13}, v{12, 13} − v{12}, v{12, 23} − v{23}, v{12, 13, 23} − v{13, 23}, v{12, 13, 23} − v{12, 23}, v{13, 23} − v{23} etc. None of them considers the marginal contribution of the type v{12, 13} − v(∅) which involves player 1’s multilateral interactions through her links {12} and {13} together. Let us further suppose that the players are unevenly skilled. Let v assign each combination of the links in g the number of goals in a season they score. Assume that a pass between 1 and 3 can hardly be converted to a goal by either of the players as it is more likely to be intercepted in the middle by the players in the opposition than a pass between 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Thus we define v(g) = 4, v(12, 13) = v(13, 23) = 2, v(12, 23) = 6 and v(12) = v(23) = 1 and v(13) = 0. Observe that here,

                           . An allocation rule in this situation would determine the contribution of each player towards converting a pass from the others into a goal. Following Theorem 1, it is customary to show that there is an allocation rule for g which satisfies L, NP, A, M and E. Let

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we characterize an allocation rule for fixed networks and subsequently extend it to flexible networks. Our rule differs from the existing ones in the literature by emphasizing both players and their links. An allocation rule either completely divides the winnings of a game among its players (efficient rule) or measures the power of a player to initiate or oppose an action (inefficient rule). While our allocation rule can be interpreted as a power index we also show under what conditions it satisfies efficiency. Unlike some of the previous rules, our characterization does not require component balancedness and thus allows for spillovers across components. Our rule differs from the equal bargaining rule (PBFN) and the Position value (LBFN) for Network games in the sense that it allows for multilateral interactions at all levels. We focus on the role played by a player and her link set simultaneously for determining a player’s marginal contributions. This creates a break from the past and we believe that this can lead to a more general characterization of network allocation rules.
