                  In recent years, the automotive industry has known a remarkable development in order to satisfy the customer requirements. In this paper, we will study one of the components of the automotive which is the twist beam. The study is focused on the multicriteria design of the automotive twist beam undergoing linear elastic deformation (Hooke׳s law). Indeed, for the design of this automotive part, there are some criteria to be considered as the rigidity (stiffness) and the resistance to fatigue. Those two criteria are known to be conflicting, therefore, our aim is to identify the Pareto front of this problem. To do this, we used a Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) algorithm coupling with a radial basis function (RBF) metamodel in order to reduce the high calculation time needed for solving the multicriteria design problem. Otherwise, we used the free form deformation (FFD) technique for the generation of the 3D shapes of the automotive part studied during the optimization process.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the automotive industry, and particularly, in the shape design optimization field, the most of problems faced are multicriteria ones. Indeed, one way to solve these problems is to identify the Pareto front. To do this, there are often two issues to confront, the first one is how to reduce the computational time required by the conventional methods used to solve this kind of optimization problem, and the second one is how can we generate the 3D shapes of the automotive part studied in the optimization process. To overcome the first issue, it is necessary to couple methods for capturing the Pareto front with metamodels aimed at cheap costs’ evaluations. For the second issue, there are several versions of FFD technique used to do this [1–3].

The Twist beam suspension (Fig. 1
                     ) is widely used as rear wheel suspension systems for front wheel driven passenger vehicles, it is composed of several components such as swing or trailing arms, bushings and the twist beam which is the object of our study.

For our work, we focus on optimizing the shape of a twist beam undergoing linear elastic deformation (Hooke׳s law) [4–6] to improve certain mechanical criteria such as the rigidity and the resistance to fatigue of this automotive part (Fig. 1). Firstly, for the identification of the Pareto front with a reasonable calculation time, we use the (NBI RBF) algorithm built using a coupling between the NBI method [7–10] and the RBF metamodel [11–15], the idea is to lead optimization with the metamodel and only do the exact evaluations of the metamodel obtained solutions [16–20]. Secondly, for the generation of 3D shapes during the optimization process, we use a developed version of the free form deformation technique using radial basis functions (FFD RBF) [21–23].

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

This section will be divided into three parts, the first one is a reminder of the multicriteria optimization basics and fundamentals, then, we present the two main methods used in our work which are the NBI RBF coupling and the FFD RBF deformation technique. The first one will be briefly presented, then, we give a complete description of the second one.

                         presents the solutions obtained by the NBI RBF coupling after filtering dominated points for some academic test cases [27] and it clearly shows the effectiveness of the algorithm developed for capturing the Pareto front.

To show the effectiveness of our developed algorithm at the computing time reduction (i.e. cost evaluation of objective functions), we solve the problems “A, B, C and D” with our new algorithm “NBI RBF coupling” and the conventional method NBI without coupling, then, we make a comparison between the results obtained (the number of functions’ call needed by each method).

The results, Fig. 3
                         and Table 1
                        , show that the coupling NBI RBF converges to the Pareto frontier with an approximately 58%, 94%, 80% and 84% fewer number of objective functions’ calls compared to a conventional NBI for Fonseca, Tanaka, Poloni and Hanna problem, respectively.

In this section, we present a version of the free form deformation (FFD) which is a geometric technique used to model simple deformations of rigid objects using a technique based on radial basis functions (RBF). These mathematical functions can be used for the creation of a smooth interpolation between values known only to a discrete set of positions.

                        . For the choice of the radial basis function, there are several known in the scientific literature. For our work, we use the gaussian function 
                           g
                           (
                           t
                           )
                           =
                           exp

                                 −

                           )
                         with k=3. Now we can easily solve Eq. (5) to obtain the 
                           M
                           +
                           4
                         coefficients to be used in the expression (4) for the interpolation.

                        To illustrate the FFD RBF technique presented above, we present a simple example which is the deformation of a flat surface (Fig. 4
                        ). In fact, to deform the surface (A), we move only the points selected, and we used the FFD technique that allows us to have an approximation for the displacement of all the other points (Fig. 5
                        ).

Since the radial basis functions g(t) do not have a compact support, the RBF approximation moves all the nodes around, even though with a very small magnitude. We are then led to enforce a null displacement at the boundary parts which are not subject to deformation. In our example, 40 points are used in order to get vanishing RBF approximation near the fixed boundary.

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

For the design of the automotive twist beam, it is important to avoid permanent plastic deformation, in fact, its design must be studied so as to ensure that the level of stresses does not reach the elastic limit of the material. Hence the necessity to seek new geometry with more rigidity (the first criterion to be optimized) [28]. Similarly, it is essential to maximize the resistance to fatigue of the twist beam which is its ability to withstand a repeatedly applied load without failure (the second criterion to be optimized) [29,30].

The aim of this work is to seek to maximize both the rigidity and the resistance to fatigue of this automotive part (Fig. 6
                        ).

In this study, the FEA code, LS-DYNA software, was used to model the automotive twist beam and performs the calculations of deformed linear elasticity in order to determine the criteria to be optimized. LS-DYNA is an explicit and implicit Finite Element program dedicated to the analysis of highly non-linear physical phenomena.

                        34 is the magnitude of the reaction or torsional force to an imposed displacement at the nodes’ number 3 and 4. The solver LS-DYNA takes into account the ratio (reaction force)/(imposed displacement) per angular unit and the distance between nodes 3 and 4, to compute the torsional rigidity. Thus, maximization of the latter amounts to maximize FR
                        34.

The goal is to figure out a new design of the twist beam, which satisfies a FR
                        34 value bigger and a VM value smaller than the FR
                        34 and VM of the initial shape respectively. Our initial shape has 546MPa for the Von Mises constraint and a torsion reaction force of 2460N. We will use our developed approach of optimization which allows us to set the parameters of the shape by using the free form deformation technique with radial basis function (FFD RBF) and then optimizing under bound constraints.

We start by the representation of the characteristics related to shape optimization (design variable, constraints, metamodel database and multicriteria optimization formula).

The twist beam is divided into two parts, the belly of the twist beam (Fig. 8
                           (c)) which can be considered as the design variable and the rest of the twist will be fixed.

The belly (the variable part of the shape) is parameterized by nine control points (9 points), and during the optimization process, each point will move according to the three directions

In order to formulate the problem in a simple way, we decided that the displacements for the nine points will be the same and like that, the design variable has only three components which are the displacement of the nine points along the three directions:

With three components and for each variable five different positions, so we have a set of 125 points, each point representing a given shape of the twist beam. Then, for each point, we calculate the exact value of two criteria FR
                           34 and VM. These values present the database allowing us to build the RBF metamodel for each criterion, and the optimization problem will be studied using these metamodels.

Knowing the criteria to be optimized and the constraints to be respected, we can write our optimization problem in the following mathematical formula:

                           , we computed an approximate Pareto front for the FR
                           34 and VM costs using the NBIRBF coupling. For a prescribed number of Pareto points N, we show the overall time and total number of exact and surrogate evaluations needed in Table 2
                            and the optimization results are shown in Fig. 11
                           .

We discuss the results according to the following points:

                                 A simple comparison between the results obtained by our approach and the accurate evaluation of these solutions, Fig. 11,  allows us to assess that our results remain good ones notwithstanding the complexity of our cases study.

It is clear from Table 2 that our approach has allowed us to save a remarkable computational time. For example, if we take the case (N=50), there are 150calls of exact function evaluations and 788 ones for approximated function, respectively, which present 16% and 84% of the total function calls used in our approach, but at the same time, we note that only this 16% of total calls take 99% of the total computing time required. This last remark explains the idea why we chose not to apply roughly the NBI method with exact evaluations to solve this industrial case.

                                     and Table 3
                                     show the profiles (1) and (3) which had the best optimized value for the second criterion (FR
                                    34) and the first criterion (VM) respectively.

Our main goal was to look for new profiles for the twist beam satisfying some requirements (FR
                                    34 higher and VM smaller than the initial shape ones value), a goal that we achieve successfully (Fig. 13 new profiles (2) and (3)).

We eliminate all dominated points by a filter, and we remarked that all remaining solutions are almost located at the boundary of the space formed by the elements of the RBF database (Fig. 12). Then we can conclude that the solutions obtained are likely NBI solutions and our approach is able to solve the industrial problem with a reasonable computation time.

Finally, we present a new profile of the automotive twist beam obtained by the shape optimization done by our algorithm (Fig. 14
                           ).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we solved an industrial multicriteria optimization problem namely the shape optimization of an automotive twist beam, the resolution is done by a developed method for the capture of the Pareto front with a reasonable calculation time compared to conventional methods. This method is a coupling between the NBI method and the RBF metamodel which allows us to identify a set of non-dominated solutions well distributed on the Pareto front, and among these solutions, there are some ones that dominate the initial solution (the original design of the twist beam). Similarly, it should be noted that the FFD RBF technique used for deformation and construction of the 3D shape during the optimization process allows us to generate a set of new designs of the automotive twist beam that remain excellent for the industrial partner.
