Robustness and sensitivity analysis

                  Quality of decisions in inventory management models depends on the accuracy of parameter estimates used for decision making. In many situations, error in decision making is unavoidable. In such cases, sensitivity analysis is necessary for better implementation of the model. Though the newsvendor model is one of the most researched inventory models, little is known about its robustness. In this paper, we perform sensitivity analysis of the classical newsvendor model. Conditions for symmetry/skewness of cost deviation (i.e., deviation of expected demand–supply mismatch cost from its minimum) have been identified. These conditions are closely linked with symmetry/skewness of the demand density function. A lower bound of cost deviation is established for symmetric unimodal demand distributions. Based on demonstrations of the lower bound, we found the newsvendor model to be sensitive to sub-optimal ordering decisions, more sensitive than the economic order quantity model. Order quantity deviation (i.e., deviation of order quantity from its optimum) is explored briefly. We found the magnitude of order quantity deviation to be comparable with that of parameter estimation error. Mean demand is identified as the most influential parameter in deciding order quantity deviation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The newsvendor problem is one of the most well-researched and widely applicable inventory management problems (Choi, 2012). It is about deciding the order quantity of a product with uncertain demand such that the penalty associated with demand–supply mismatch at the end of the selling season is minimized. This inventory problem was first addressed by Arrow, Harris, and Marschak (1951) in their seminal paper “Optimal Inventory Policy”. Due to its wide applicability, different versions of the newsvendor model have been developed in the past six decades. Review of those works can be found in Silver, Pyke, and Peterson (1998), Khouja (1999), Qin, Wang, Vakharia, Chen, and Seref (2011), and Choi (2012). The simplest version of the newsvendor model, which is referred to as the classical newsvendor model (seeSilver et al., 1998, chap. 10 for assumptions and analysis), is focus of the current study.

Newsvendor model, like any other inventory optimization model, requires knowledge of certain parameters for decision making. One common implementation issue with these models is the possibility of error in estimation of the model parameters.

                      denote unit over-stocking and under-stocking costs. Each of these parameters may not be known correctly in every situation. For example, newsvendor deals with stochastic demand, whose realization takes place only after the procurement decision is made. Hence, theoretically speaking, correct knowledge of the demand distribution function (i.e., the form and associated parameters) with certainty is impossible at the time of decision making.

Unit over-stocking cost is the unit purchase cost less salvage value of an unsold item. Though purchase cost is generally known at the time of procurement decision, there are exceptions. If the newsvendor itself is the manufacturer and the production environment is complex (involving multiple items), purchase cost, i.e., production cost specific to the focal item may not be known correctly. The other component of over-stocking cost, i.e., salvage value, too, may not be correctly known. Newsvendor sells excess inventory in secondary market and then the remaining stock is disposed off. This process begins after the selling season is over and it involves multiple agents, thereby making the assessment of salvage value at the time of procurement decision difficult.

Unit under-stocking cost is the sum of unit profit and goodwill loss due to unmet demand of one unit. Unit profit is the unit selling price less unit purchase cost. We have already noted that purchase cost may not be known correctly in some situations. If the selling price is market-driven (e.g., selling prices of commodity products), due to time-precedence of the procurement decision over selling season, actual selling price may not be correctly known at the time of decision making. The other component of under-stocking cost, i.e., stock-out goodwill loss is the most elusive cost component in the newsvendor model. Stock-out is reflected back as loss of future demand (of the concerned product as well as other products) through complex human behavior (Hadley & Whitin, 1963, pg. 20), which makes the quantification of goodwill loss very difficult.

It is evident from the above discussion that parameter estimation error is unavoidable in the newsvendor model. Then the operational decision, which is derived using the parameter estimates, is likely to deviate from the optimum. Parameter estimation error is not the only reason for sub-optimal decisions in the newsvendor model. Based on experiments, Schweitzer and Cachon (2000) reported that managers tend to order more than the optimum when

                                 ∗

                           μ
                        
                      and order less than the optimum when 
                        
                           
                              
                                 Q
                              
                              
                                 ∗

                      where

                      denotes the mean demand. This “pull-to-center” effect was confirmed by other scholars (e.g., Bostian, Holt, & Smith, 2008). A number of alternate explanations were proposed, for example, Su (2008) showed that bounded rationality on the part of the newsvendor leads to the “pull-to-center” effect.

A sub-optimal decision, irrespective of the reason behind it, leads to greater cost. We study the nature of deviation of expected demand–supply mismatch cost from its minimum, in short, cost deviation. In particular, we attempt to address two issues. First, we identify the conditions for symmetry and skewness of cost deviation. If the newsvendor is uncertain about the optimal order quantity, these conditions would tell which is better, ordering more or ordering less. Second, we study the magnitude of cost deviation by establishing a lower bound. This reveals whether the newsvendor model is sensitive to sub-optimal decisions or not. Depending upon severity of the situation, further actions can be taken to improve the decision making.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We review relevant literature and derive an expression for cost deviation before proceeding to the next section. In Section 2, we identify the conditions for symmetry/skewness of cost deviation. In Section 3, we establish a lower bound of cost deviation for symmetric unimodal demand distributions. Then we demonstrate the lower bound along with cost deviation for normal demand distribution. In Section 4, we briefly study order quantity deviation, i.e., deviation of order quantity from its optimum. We conclude in Section 5 by discussing main results of this work and identifying future research possibilities.

Sensitivity analysis of some important inventory models are available in the literature. Economic order quantity (EOQ) model is one of the most popular inventory models. One reason for its popularity is its robustness to sub-optimal decisions. A discussion on sensitivity analysis of the EOQ model can be found in operations management textbooks (e.g., Nahmias, 2001). In the EOQ model, cost deviation is left-skewed and relatively insensitive to order quantity deviation. Zheng (1992) performed sensitivity analysis of the stochastic (r,Q) inventory system and found it to be more robust than its deterministic counterpart, the EOQ model. Chen and Zheng (1997) found similar result for the stochastic (s,S) inventory system with exponential demand.

A surprise omission from the above inventory models is the newsvendor model. However, there are some studies that indirectly address sensitivity analysis of the newsvendor model. We can classify them into two groups: (a) sensitivity of cost deviation to sub-optimal order quantities and (b) sensitivity of order quantity deviation to parameter estimation error. These two can be combined to yield sensitivity of cost deviation to parameter estimation error. We can further classify studies in each of the above groups into four subgroups: (i) direction of deviation, (ii) symmetry/skewness of deviation, (iii) magnitude of deviation, and (iv) distribution of deviation. Since the newsvendor model is multi-parameter model, the question of parameter importance (in influencing order quantity deviation or cost deviation) is relevant too.

Direction of cost and order quantity deviations can be understood easily by examining the standard results of the newsvendor model. Lapin (1988, chap. 6) noted down some of these. Since expected mismatch cost is convex in order quantity, it increases whenever order quantity deviates from its optimum. Note that cost deviation is positive if expected mismatch cost increases and negative if it decreases. The same is true for order quantity deviation. Since

Sensitivity analysis results regarding directions of deviations of some generalized newsvendor models are available in literature. The classical newsvendor model is a special case of the generalized models. Lau and Lau (2002) considered a supply chain with newsvendor type retailer and identified impact of demand variability on decision variables. Their conclusions are similar to that of Gerchak and Mossman (1992) when order quantity is the only decision variable, i.e., the retailer faces the classical newsvendor problem. Eeckhoudt, Gollier, and Schlesinger (1995) studied risk-averse newsvendor problem (risk-neutrality is equivalent to the classical problem) and identified influence of cost parameters on order quantity. Wang (2011) performed a similar study for newsvendor problem with advertisement-sensitive demand (no advertisement is equivalent to the classical problem). Their findings are similar to that of Lapin (1988).

In the newsvendor literature, there are studies that develop extensions of the classical newsvendor model and perform sensitivity analysis w.r.t. parameter(s) that differentiate it from the classical model, for example, Chen and Chen (2010) studied a multi-product budget-constrained newsvendor problem with a reservation policy and performed sensitivity analysis of expected profit and order quantity to the budget amount. There are more such studies. These studies, being contextually different, do not add much to our understanding of robustness of the classical newsvendor model.

Based on the above literature review, it is clear that our understanding of sensitivity of the classical newsvendor model is limited to the directions of deviations only. In this work, we study symmetry and magnitude of cost deviation as order quantity deviates from its optimum. We briefly explore order quantity deviation too.

                         separate the error “dampening” and “amplifying” zones. If a curve (or part of it) lies below these lines, the magnitude of the output error is less than that of the input error (dampening of error). Conversely, if a curve (or part of it) lies above these lines, the output error is more in magnitude than the input error (amplification of error).

We have showed that penalty for deviating from the optimum is quite high in the newsvendor model. We took 
                        
                           ±
                           30

                      as the error range in the demonstration of the lower bound of cost deviation. The error range can vary from situation to situation. Our conclusions hold if the error range is larger or somewhat smaller. However, if the error range is very small, say 
                        
                           ±
                           5

                     , some of our conclusions may not hold. Thus, we need to examine if such possibilities are common or not. In this section, we briefly study the magnitude of order quantity deviation.

                      varies from 4.4% to 17.9%. Clearly, order quantity deviation is not very small in magnitude. It is comparable with the error in model parameters.

In this demonstration, we considered common situations, i.e., common parameter and error values. We did not find order quantity deviation to be very low. Hence, in general, our conclusions about robustness of the newsvendor model hold.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Existing literature on sensitivity analysis of the newsvendor model is limited. We had mere understanding of the directions of cost and order quantity deviations. In this paper, we studied symmetry and magnitude of cost deviation. We looked into order quantity deviation briefly. Our work contributes to the literature in three distinct ways.

First, we have identified conditions for symmetry and skewness of cost deviation (Table 1). According to these conditions, for symmetric unimodal (in strong sense) demand, for example, normally distributed demand, it is better to order less (than ordering more) if 
                        
                           ξ
                           <
                           1
                           /
                           2
                        
                      and it is better to order more (than ordering less) if 
                        
                           ξ
                           >
                           1
                           /
                           2
                        
                     . According to the “pull-to-center” effect (Schweitzer & Cachon, 2000; Su, 2008), managers order more than the optimum when 
                        
                           ξ
                           <
                           1
                           /
                           2
                        
                      and less than the optimum when 
                        
                           ξ
                           >
                           1
                           /
                           2
                        
                     . Kevork (2010) developed estimators for order quantity and expected profit in the newsvendor model for normally distributed demand. His estimator over-estimated the order quantity when 
                        
                           ξ
                           <
                           1
                           /
                           2
                        
                      and under-estimated it when 
                        
                           ξ
                           >
                           1
                           /
                           2
                        
                     . Our finding suggests that cost minimizing (or profit maximizing) managers are better off doing the opposite if one is uncertain about the optimal order quantity.

Second, we have established a lower bound of cost deviation for symmetric unimodal demand distributions. Its demonstration (Fig. 1) revealed that the newsvendor model is sensitive to sub-optimal ordering decisions. It is more sensitive than the EOQ model. In many situations, magnitude of cost deviation exceeded the magnitude of order quantity deviation. This behavior of the newsvendor model is totally different from the robustness properties of other popular stochastic inventory models. Stochastic (r,Q) and (s,S) inventory systems have been found to be more robust than the EOQ model (Zheng, 1992; Chen & Zheng, 1997). This signals the practitioners to take proper care of the parameter estimation processes so that order quantity deviation is small. We also observed that cost deviation increases with the ratio of demand limits

Third, we briefly studied order quantity deviation. We observed that order quantity deviation can be quite high for moderate error in parameter estimation. Based on a demonstration (Table 3), we found

                      low can help in limiting order quantity deviation, thereby limiting cost deviation.

A number of questions related to robustness of the newsvendor model are yet to be answered. Our conclusions regarding the magnitude of cost deviation are limited to symmetric unimodal demand. Extension to other demand distributions would improve our understanding of robustness of the newsvendor model. In this paper, we worked with error ranges. In real life, sometimes, distribution of input error is known along with its range. In such cases, distribution of cost deviation is more appropriate in describing robustness of the model than the range of cost deviation. Our study of order quantity deviation lacks depth. A thorough investigation into order quantity deviation would strengthen our understanding of sensitivity of the newsvendor model.

Our work has established that the newsvendor model is sensitive to sub-optimal ordering decisions. One way to improve the decision making is to improve accuracy of parameter estimators. Since the newsvendor model is multi-parameter model, the question of parameter importance becomes relevant. Borgonovo (2008, 2010) has developed measures specific to inventory models and applied them to the EOQ model. The same can be done for the newsvendor model. Another way to improve the decision making is to minimize cost deviation instead of minimizing expected cost. Lowe, Schwarz, and McGavin (1988) took this approach assuming uncertain cost parameters. Their work can be extended to include uncertain demand parameters.
