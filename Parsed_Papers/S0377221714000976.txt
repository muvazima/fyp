                  We provide a novel approach to characterize the order process of continuous review

                      inventory policies, and study the impact of the batching parameter (the value of Q or

                     ) on the variability in the order process. First, we characterize the distribution of the time between orders, as well as the distribution of order sizes. We find that the coefficient of variation (cv) of the time between orders is smaller than the cv of the time between demands. The size of the orders can exhibit either variance amplification or dampening, compared to the demand sizes, depending on the demand size distribution and the value of the batching parameter. This may motivate a supplier to adjust his imposed fixed order cost to influence the batching size. Second, we look at the compound order process, defined by the number of units ordered during an arbitrary interval. The compound order process always exhibits variance amplification compared to the compound demand, which increases linearly in the batching parameter for large values of Q or 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                     ; for small values, the variance amplification is fluctuating. We point out that the time interval, during which the number of units ordered/demanded is observed, also impacts the level of variance amplification, and we show to what extent larger time intervals (resulting in more aggregation of the data) lead to lower values of variance amplification. Both perspectives (looking at time between orders and order quantities, or observing the compound order process) provide useful information for the upstream supplier.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the early fifties, Arrow, Harris, and Marschak (1951) introduced the 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      inventory policy as a way to balance the cost of inventory with the cost of placing orders, hence exploiting the economies of scale when ordering. In an 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      inventory policy, a lower stock level s and an upper stock level S are established: no order is placed until inventories fall to s or below, whereupon an order is placed to restore the inventory position to the level S. This means that orders are placed with a batch size, that is always larger than or equal to the value of 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                     . The more the inventory level falls below s (which depends on the stochastic demand size observed prior to the order is placed), the more the order quantity will exceed 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                     ; this is the stochastic overshoot. Several authors showed, in different settings, that an 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      policy is optimal when a fixed order cost is present (Iglehart, 1963; ?; Scarf, 1960; Veinott, 1966). Today, the 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      inventory policy is still of main importance to inventory theory and ordering policies and is incorporated in business software of many companies all over the world (Caplin & Leahy, 2010).

When materials flow in fixed batch sizes, such as full truckloads or containers, an 
                        
                           (
                           r
                           ,
                           nQ
                           )
                        
                      inventory policy can be adopted, which is comparable, but slightly different to the 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      policy (Federgruen & Zheng, 1992; Li & Sridharan, 2008). In an 
                        
                           (
                           r
                           ,
                           nQ
                           )
                        
                      inventory policy, if the inventory position reaches the order point r, an order is placed equal to the smallest multiple of Q that raises the inventory position above r.

In the supply chain literature it is widely accepted that batching of orders creates a bullwhip effect, indicating that the variability in the order process is larger than the variability in demand (see e.g., Burbidge, 1961; Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang, 1997; Potter & Disney, 2006). This distorted information can lead to serious inefficiencies upstream in the supply chain (Lee et al., 1997). It is argued that larger batch sizes create more bullwhip (e.g., Burbidge, 1961), and hence batching is to be avoided. However, Potter and Disney (2006) state: “While it is often advocated that batch sizes should be reduced as much as possible, there has been limited investigation into the impact of batching on bullwhip. Placing an order of a single item is not always possible, due to technical, economical or social reasons.” Therefore, it is worthwhile to gain insight how batch sizes impact the variability of the order process.

This insight can be useful, especially for an upstream supplier who suffers from a highly variable order process, as this impacts his inventory levels and/or production times. In many practical settings, the upstream supplier charges a fixed order cost to its customer. Based on this fixed order cost, the customer decides on the batching parameter. Therefore, if the upstream supplier understands how the batching parameter impacts the order process variability, he may adjust the fixed order cost of his customer in order to manipulate the resulting order process.

In this paper, we characterize the order process (and its variability) that is generated by a continuous review 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      or 
                        
                           (
                           r
                           ,
                           nQ
                           )
                        
                      inventory policy. These policies are commonly used when a fixed order cost is present. We look at the time between orders and the size of the orders placed and we characterize the distribution of both. This information can be relevant, for instance, if the upstream supplier produces on order: to characterize the arrival rate of his production orders, and thus his production lead times, he needs to know the mean and variance of the inter-arrival times between orders and of the size of the orders to be produced. This separate characterization of time between orders and order quantities is also useful when, for instance, the upstream supplier decides on the parameters of his own inventory policy as they are both needed to characterize the intermittent demand process, that is created by the 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      or 
                        
                           (
                           r
                           ,
                           nQ
                           )
                        
                      policy of his customer (e.g., Teunter & Duncan, 2008).

Besides looking at the time between orders and order quantities separately, we also look at the number of units that are ordered in an arbitrary time interval t (which we call the “compound” order process). This information is useful, for instance, when the upstream supplier reviews its orders on a periodic basis of interval t and as such aggregates the number of units that are ordered during this time interval. In this case, we cannot simply rely on the characterization of the time between orders and the order quantities, as these might be correlated.


                     Fig. 1
                      illustrates the compound order (and demand) process for an

                           s

                      policy, showing the total number of units that are ordered (and demanded) during time interval t. When 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           1
                        
                     , it represents the number of units ordered (resp. demanded) every time unit (Fig. 1(a)), which is either zero if no order is placed, or an order is placed with size greater than or equal to 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                     . If the value of 
                        
                           S
                           -

                      grows, the variability of this compound order process is likely to increase as the number of zero-orders goes up and the discrepancy between an order of size zero and an order size of at least 
                        
                           S
                           -

                      units grows. Fig. 1(b) illustrates the compound process when 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           20
                        
                     : in this case we aggregate the number of units that are demanded and ordered in an interval of 20 time units (this might be appropriate if the upstream supplier reviews his inventory every 20 periods, and thus wants to know how many units were ordered in this time window). Clearly, the longer the interval t, the lower the probability of observing an interval with zero-orders and the more aggregation on the number of units ordered. This leads to less fluctuations in the observed order process. In other words, the choice of the interval t has a great impact on the variability of the observed order process.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the related literature. In Section 3 we introduce our model and notations. Section 4 provides the characterization of the order process of an 
                        
                           (

                      policy as a batch Markovian arrival process. Section 5 is devoted to the analysis of the time between orders, and of the order quantities. In Section 6 the compound order process is analyzed. In Section 7 we provide some numerical illustrations for uniform, Poisson and bimodal distributed demand sizes. Section 8 concludes.

The bullwhip effect, which refers to the increased volatility in the order process compared to the observed demand, has been observed in many supply chains and has a number of highly undesirable cost implications (Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang, 2004). Many papers have studied the impact of adapting the parameters of the inventory replenishment rules on the order variance amplification, mostly in a base-stock policy (e.g., Boute, Disney, Lambrecht, & Van Houdt, 2007; Disney & Towill, 2003; Warburton, 2004; Warburton & Disney, 2007). In this paper we study the impact of order batching policies on the bullwhip effect.


                     Burbidge (1961) recognized order batching as a main driver of order variance amplification in supply chains. Blinder (1981) empirically showed the existence of an increased order size variability between wholesalers and retailers and suggested that the use of

                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      inventory models by retailers could be a possible explanation for this. Also Schultz (1983), Lee et al. (1997), Li and Sridharan (2008), and Chen and Lee (2012) attributed the existence of a bullwhip effect due to order batching.

To gain insight into the impact of order batching on the bullwhip effect, Schultz (1983) provides an exact formula of the order variance caused by a periodic review 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      policy. Based on this formula he shows that the order variance always exceeds the demand variance. Grounded on the exact formula of Schultz (1983), Schneider, Rinks, and Kelle (1995) derive an approximation. The derivation of the formula is based on asymptotic renewal theory, therefore it only holds for “large” values of 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                     . Based on this approximation, they show that the order variance amplification increases in the value of 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                     . Kelle and Milne (1999) provide some numerical experiments in which the approximation is compared to simulation. For normal and gamma distributed demand, they find that the relative error is smaller than 1% when the coefficient of variation of demand is larger than three and the ratio of 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                      with respect to the average demand is smaller than 0.7.

For a variant of the periodic review 
                        
                           (
                           r
                           ,
                           nQ
                           )
                        
                      policy, Potter and Disney (2006) show for deterministic demand and “small” values of Q (i.e., Q smaller than or equal to the demand), that the bullwhip effect (as a function of Q) reaches a local minimum when the quotient of Q and the (constant) demand is an integer. A numerical analysis shows that halfway two local minima, a local maximum is reached, and the height of this maximum increases as Q grows larger. Based on a simulation study, the authors also explore the same policy with stochastic demand, and observe that the bullwhip effect is a function of the average demand taken modulo Q.

There are a few papers that look at the impact of the time interval (during which the number of units demanded/ordered is observed) on the level of bullwhip. Cachon (1999) showed (for a periodic review 
                        
                           (
                           r
                           ,
                           nQ
                           )
                        
                      policy) that increasing the review period decreases the order variance. A similar conclusion was made by Chen and Lee (2012) (also for a periodic review 
                        
                           (
                           r

                      policy), who showed that aggregating data over longer time periods reduces the observed magnitude of the bullwhip effect.

In this paper, we show that the order process of continuous review 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      and 
                        
                           (
                           r
                           ,
                           nQ
                           )
                        
                      policies can be characterized by a batch Markovian arrival process, assuming a compound Poisson demand. Using this property, we describe the distribution of the time between orders placed, and the distribution of the order quantities. We provide formulas for the first two moments of the inter-arrival times between orders and of the size of the orders, which give extra insight in the order process compared to what is common in the existing literature.

Second, we define the total number of units ordered in a time interval and characterize the variance of this number as a function of the interval of length t. This variance provides insight in the compound order process taking the time between orders, the order quantities, and a possible correlation between the two into account. We confirm and extend the results concerning the impact of the batching parameter and the time interval on the order variance amplification, for random batch sizes and general time intervals. Whereas the majority of the literature studies periodic review policies, to the best of our knowledge, Caplin (1985) is the only paper that studies the impact of a continuous review 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      policy on the bullwhip ratio. Where Caplin (1985) assumes single-unit demand, we take general demand sizes into account, which results in the possibility of overshoots.

We assume a single product model with customer demand characterized by a compound (batch) Poisson process. This means that the time between subsequent demand arrivals is exponentially distributed with parameter

                      and demand sizes are discrete identically distributed random variables. Our analysis holds for any arbitrary finite demand size distribution with maximum demand size m (when 
                        
                           m

                     ). In Section 7 we provide numerical illustrations when the demand size follows a discrete uniform, a truncated Poisson, and a delayed geometric distribution. We use D to denote the random demand size variable,

                      its variance. Although throughout this paper, we will work with the compound Poisson demand assumption, large parts of our analysis can also be readily extended to more general demand processes, such as a phase-type renewal process, a Markov-modulated or even a general batch Markovian arrival process. However, the analysis in such a case becomes more involved (as scalars need to be replaced by matrices) and may not necessarily give more insights.

In this section, we start with a general introduction on the characterization of an order process by a batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP). In Sections 4.1 and 4.2 we illustrate how the order process of an 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      and an 
                        
                           (
                           r
                           ,
                           nQ
                           )
                        
                      inventory policy can be characterized by such a BMAP, when demand follows a compound Poisson process. The characterization of the order process as a BMAP allows us to look at the order process from two distinct perspectives: either we look at the replenishment orders when they are placed, and we analyze the distribution of the time between orders placed and the distribution of the order sizes (Section 5). Or we can look at the number of units that are placed within a certain time interval (Section 6). With these characterizations we can investigate how the batching parameter (value of Q or 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                     ) amplifies the order variability compared to the observed demand.

The batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP) is a point process that can characterize orders by batch arrivals of random size. It generalizes the compound Poisson process to non-exponential inter-arrival time distributions between orders and it allows for correlation between order quantities and inter-arrival times between orders (Cordeiro & Kharoufeh, 2011; Lucantoni, 1993). A continuous time BMAP can be characterized as follows (based on Cordeiro & Kharoufeh (2011)): Let 
                        
                           J

                      be an irreducible, continuous-time Markov chain. Matrix C represents the infinitesimal generator matrix of this Markov chain. If J enters state i, the process will only leave state i after an exponentially distributed amount of time with rate

We can now show how the order process of a continuous review 
                           
                              (

                              ,
                              S

                         and 
                           
                              (
                              r
                              ,
                              nQ
                              )
                           
                         inventory policy can be characterized as a BMAP. When demand follows a compound Poisson process, the inter-arrival time between demands is exponentially distributed. Therefore, if we model the order process as a continuous time BMAP with the states referring to the inventory positions, a transition occurs to another state at every demand arrival. This transition may or may not correspond to placing an order of size k. We can then characterize this order process by the matrices 
                           
                              {

                         as managing transitions in inventory positions when no order is placed, and

                         as the matrix containing the rate of transitions in inventory positions when an order of size k is placed. Modeling the order process as a BMAP has the advantage that it allows us to compute the variance of the number of units ordered in a time interval t, a characteristic which we will use in Section 6.

Based on the characterization of the order process, we are now in a position to derive some properties. We first define the time between two orders placed.

As demand follows a compound Poisson process, the time between demand arrivals follows an exponential distribution. The distribution of the time between orders is defined in the following proposition:

                               policy the time between two orders placed is equivalent to the time it takes for the Markov chain to move from the order-up-to level S until absorption in the order point s or below. Since the time between successive transitions in a continuous time Markov chain is exponentially distributed, the distribution of the time until absorption to s is the sum of a random number of exponentially distributed time intervals, and thus follows a phase-type (PH) distribution. The number of phases is equivalent to the number of inventory positions before placing an order, which equals

Interestingly, looking at the time between orders placed, we find that its variance is amplified compared to the demand process, but its relative variance, as defined by its coefficient of variation, is actually dampened compared to the demand process. This result follows from Proposition 1.

As demand arrives according to a compound Poisson process, it follows that

                              . Hence, to prove Corollary 1, we need to show that

Next to characterizing the order process from the perspective of the time between orders and the size of the orders placed, we can also look at the total number of units ordered in an arbitrary interval of length t. This can be useful when the upstream supplier reviews its orders on a periodic basis of interval t and as such aggregates the number of units that are ordered during this time interval. We compare the variance of the total number of units ordered in a time interval t with the variance of the number of units demanded in the same interval. This ratio is commonly used in the literature as a measure of the bullwhip effect. This ratio differs depending on the length of the interval t: the longer the interval t, the more the order and demand variances will flatten out and concur.

                      via Eq. (23), Proposition 8 is particularly useful as it allows us to prove the following corollary:

Also this result is in line with the existing literature, albeit in different settings, showing that order batching leads to variance amplification (e.g., Chen & Lee, 2012; Li & Sridharan, 2008; Schultz, 1983). Although the impact of the time interval t on the bullwhip ratio seems intuitive, its is worthwhile to quantify it explicitly.

The main difficulty in proving this lies in the fact that the amount ordered in an interval of length t is not uniquely determined by the initial inventory position and the total demand in such an interval (as is the case for an 
                        
                           (

                      policy). Instead, the amount ordered depends on the size of the individual demands, which makes an analysis as in Proposition 8 intractable.

                      (the motivation behind the delayed geometric distribution is inspired by Johnston, Boylan, & Shale (2003), who give empirical evidence that this distribution is often observed for the demand sizes).

With this numerical illustration, we basically want to show how the choice of the batch size impacts the order dynamics and can lead for example to undesirable variance amplification. As the order process determines the upstream supplier’s inventory requirements or production process, the upstream supplier might want to manipulate his customer’s ordering behavior. For instance, by slightly adjusting the fixed order cost that he charges to his customer, the batch size will be impacted and thus the corresponding order process variability. Our analysis helps to gain insight into the impact of the batch size on the order process.

In order to understand some of the dynamics, we derived closed-form expressions for some special cases in Appendix B. More specifically, when the demand size is uniform or delayed geometric distributed, Appendix B provides expressions for the average and the variance of the time between orders and the order sizes for the 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )

                           r
                           ,
                           nQ
                           )
                        
                      policy can be derived in an analogous way. When the demand size is Poisson distributed, the closed-form expressions are too complex to gain insight.

It shows that the relative variance of the time between orders is actually less than the relative variance of the time between demands, indicating that we have variance dampening (smoothing) in the time between orders.

                     : as demand sizes cannot be larger than Q, it is not possible that an order quantity exceeds Q.

If we look at the ratio of the cv of order sizes compared to the cv of demand sizes (Fig. 4(b)), we can make the same observation, but we see that we primarily have smoothing in the order sizes. This indicates that the relative variance of the order sizes is smaller than the relative variance of the demand sizes. Although this ratio generally goes down when 
                        
                           S

We finally illustrate the order variance amplification ratio of the order process, looking at the number of units ordered in a time interval t, compared to the number of units demanded in that same time interval (in Fig. 5
                     (a) we have

We also confirm the results – albeit in a different setting – of Caplin (1985) and Potter and Disney (2006), who state that for large batch sizes, the ratio increases linearly in the batch size, whereas for small batch sizes the linear relationship does not hold and local minima can occur. For most instances, we observe a stronger variance amplification ratio for the

In Fig. 6
                     , we compare the magnitude of the bullwhip effect of the order process in a continuous review setting and in a periodic review setting. The variance amplification ratio of orders in the periodic review setting is computed based on the formula of Schneider et al. (1995). We plotted both our results for the order variance amplification ratio in a continuous review

In Fig. 7
                      we make a connection with Caplin (1985), as this figure illustrates how the time interval t impacts the bullwhip ratio when single unit demand sizes are assumed (
                        
                           m
                           =
                           1
                        
                     ). For small intervals t, we see an increase as a function of 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                     , but this is not necessarily the case for large time intervals t and small values of 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                     . Recall that Caplin (1985), assuming single unit demands, finds a linear increase when the time interval is chosen such that either 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                      or 0 units are ordered; indeed, this assumption is more likely to hold if the batch size 
                        
                           S

                      is larger than the time interval t. This linear increase is observed in Fig. 7 when 
                        
                           S
                           -

                     , but the bullwhip ratio does not increase linearly in 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                      when 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                           <
                           t
                        
                     . In this case, Caplin (1985) shows that the magnitude of the bullwhip ratio depends on the extent to which demand concentrates around multiples of 
                        
                           S
                           -

                     . Also Potter and Disney (2006) observed the same effects.

This numerical study illustrates how the value of the batching parameter impacts the variability in the order process. An upstream supplier may want to manipulate the variance of the orders he receives by carefully selecting the fixed order cost that he imposes to his customer. Depending on whether he is interested in minimizing the variability of order quantities, time between orders, or the number of units ordered in a time interval t, the upstream supplier prefers a different batch size. Our analysis helps to give guidance on this.

                      policy. We characterize the order process of continuous review 
                        
                           (
                           s

                      and

                      inventory policies by a batch Markovian arrival process and analyze the order process from two distinct, yet complementary perspectives. First, we derive the distribution of order quantities and time between orders separately. Splitting a stochastic process into information concerning timing and quantities is common practice for slow moving items with intermittent demand. This separate characterization can also be of particular interest if the orders are sent to production (e.g., if the upstream supplier produces on order), in which case the production facility can have a better insight in the arrival rate of orders, which is defined by the time between arrivals of orders and the order sizes. These are prime determinants of the production lead time. We focus on the impact of the value of the batching parameter Q or 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                      on the order variance amplification. We find that the relative variance of the time between orders, as measured by its coefficient of variation, is less than the relative variance of the time between demands. Also the order quantities do not always display a larger variance compared to the demand sizes; we observe a non-linear pattern as a function of Q or 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                     , and find variance dampening in many instances.

Second, we also characterize the order process by observing the number of units ordered over a time interval t, and compare it with the number of units demanded over the same period. This can be useful if the supplier reviews its orders on a periodic basis and as such aggregates the number of units that are ordered during this time interval. From this perspective, we always have order variance amplification, which is generally increasing linearly in the value of 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                      or Q if this value is “large” compared to the time interval t. We also find that if the batching parameter is small compared to the time interval t, a non-linear pattern of the variance amplification ratio in 
                        
                           S
                           -
                           s
                        
                      or Q can be observed. For the continuous review 
                        
                           (
                           r
                           ,
                           nQ
                           )
                        
                      policy, we quantify the amount of variance amplification depending on the extent to which the total number of units demanded in a time interval t concentrates around multiples of the batching parameter. We find that the degree of order variance amplification is significantly less as the time interval t is longer (and it converges to 1 if 
                        
                           t
                           →
                           ∞
                        
                     ).

In many cases, the upstream supplier is able to manipulate the batching parameter of his customer by adjusting the fixed order cost that he charges to his customer. As the customer will decide on the batching parameter based on this fixed order cost, the upstream supplier is able to change the order process to his advantage. At that moment, insight into the impact of the batching parameter on the order process becomes useful.

In future research, it would be interesting to perform a similar analysis of more complicated inventory policies, such as the 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
