                  Background and objective
                  This study proposes an infrastructure with a reporting workflow optimization algorithm (RWOA) in order to interconnect facilities, reporting units and radiologists on a single access interface, to increase the efficiency of the reporting process by decreasing the medical report turnaround time and to increase the quality of medical reports by determining the optimum match between the inspection and radiologist in terms of subspecialty, workload and response time.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Workflow centric network architecture with an enhanced caching, querying and retrieving mechanism is implemented by seamlessly integrating Grid Agent and Grid Manager to conventional digital radiology systems. The inspection and radiologist attributes are modelled using a hierarchical ontology structure. Attribute preferences rated by radiologists and technical experts are formed into reciprocal matrixes and weights for entities are calculated utilizing Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The assignment alternatives are processed by relation-based semantic matching (RBSM) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP).
               
               
                  Results
                  The results are evaluated based on both real case applications and simulated process data in terms of subspecialty, response time and workload success rates. Results obtained using simulated data are compared with the outcomes obtained by applying Round Robin, Shortest Queue and Random distribution policies. The proposed algorithm is also applied to a real case teleradiology application process data where medical reporting workflow was performed based on manual assignments by the chief radiologist for 6225 inspections.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  RBSM gives the highest subspecialty success rate and integrating ILP with RBSM ratings as RWOA provides a better response time and workload distribution success rate. RWOA based image delivery also prevents bandwidth, storage or hardware related stuck and latencies. When compared with a real case teleradiology application where inspection assignments were performed manually, the proposed solution was found to increase the experience success rate by 13.25%, workload success rate by 63.76% and response time success rate by 120%. The total response time in the real case application data was improved by 22.39%.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The evolution of Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) and teleradiology starts with a simple PACS application where a single client can access the medical images, towards Enterprise PACS with several clients querying and retrieving inspections, to Web-Based [1–4] and Regional PACS [5–9] solutions. However, it can be concluded that Regional PACS solutions, which are usually utilized in nation-wide studies produce vendor dependent infrastructures [5]. Therefore, the recent trends in teleradiology has been towards Virtual PACS solutions interconnecting several vendors and facilities on a cloud platform [10] and towards quest for standards [11–13] in order to integrate patient data into a complete electronic health record utilizing Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and Health Level Seven (HL7) standards defined in Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) profiles or non-standard formats such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), Extensible Markup Language (XML) or Portable Document Format (PDF). The requirements have also evolved from accessibility to interoperability, compatibility [14] and workflow in the overall process [15]. In order to fulfill this requirement, technical solutions have evolved from regional VPN-based solutions to Grid-Based solutions [10]. These solutions which are also supported in parallel by the improvements in the content and information centric network solutions [16,17] propose the employment of a broker [18–20] or agent [21,22]. Accessibility solutions have been proposed by implementing PACS based on data grids [21,23,24] or web-based systems with faster image retrieval and processing capabilities [25]. RESTful interface solutions [19], JPEG2000 streaming architectures [26] have been proposed for image repositories to resolve compatibility issues as conventional DICOM viewer solutions are operating system dependent and often do not support mobile application usage.

Among the studies on teleradiology architectures or workflow optimization, only a few have implementations related to radiology reporting process. Benjamin et al. [27], proposed a teleradiology architecture in order to increase the efficiency of the teleradiology service. The system allows a radiology group serving multiple sites to access medical images on a global worklist. However, the implementation does not include a workflow optimization or contextual consideration. Huang et al. have implemented several studies on work distribution [28] and business process management [29,30]. These studies include mining the task distribution rules in the event log of CT-scan examination process. As a common approach, the rules are learned from the event log regardless of whether they are successful or not [30]. Reinforcement learning [29] and adaptive association [28] algorithms are applied and the results are compared based on response time and resource allocation efficiency. Expertise, subspecialty and quality of report are also critical parameters for teleradiology service delivery workflow. An inspection requiring subspecialty should be assigned to a radiologist with corresponding experience and high quality reports should be promoted in assignment process. In the proposed algorithm, subspecialties of radiologists are evaluated based on modality, anatomy, disease and body parts. Radiologist characteristics [31,32] and expert ratings are used as initial indicators and report quality feedback [33] is utilized to recalculate the corresponding ratings.

In previous research studies, multiple types of workflow optimization and semantic matching strategies are evaluated such as reinforcement learning [29,28], machine learning (SVM, Bayes) [34] and relation based negotiation [35]. In this study, a RBSM algorithm enhanced by ILP is utilized as RWOA to design medical image distribution strategy based on reporting workflow optimization.

The objective of this study is to design and implement a framework where multiple medical sites can outsource teleradiology services to multiple radiology groups and where radiology groups can access and report the assigned inspections from multiple sites on a single interface. In order to automize and optimize this mechanism, a reasoning component is implemented to direct the inspection to the optimum radiologist so that the inspection is reported in a short time, with high quality output and with optimum resource allocation.

Radiology inspections are generated by the imaging modalities in the form of DICOM files. Modality, body part and anatomy examined, protocol requested, file size, resolution, series and slice numbers data can be extracted rendering the inspection files. These attributes are indicators for the radiologist demand criterias. Pre-diagnosis which is a manually determined inspection parameter, has a 10th revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code and is used to determine subspecialty requirements together with modality, body part and anatomy attributes. Requested protocol id is used to determine the required effort and time for the reporting process using “Performance Point Documentation” (SUT) standard as a reference. SUT is a standardization for evaluation of medical processes published by Turkish Ministry of Health for performance assessment and payment measurements. Each process mapped to requested protocol id has a unique code and process indicators determined by Ministry of Health experts. “Point” is an indicator for resource and effort usage and used to estimate the payment for the corresponding operations as a function of “Risk”, “Technical Requirement”, “Work Required”, “Urgency”, “Presence of Alternative” and “Required Time”. RWOA utilizes normalized values of “Point” and “Required Time” in SUT standardization for Radiology. File size and resolution attributes are used to determine technical requirements such as bandwidth and resolution of medical monitors, respectively.

In a context where multiple medical sites transfer inspections to multiple reporting units to receive radiology reporting service, each reporting unit is a supplier that present medical and technical capabilities in order to get the service order. Each inspection generated by each medical site is a demand for service where an optimum assignment decision has to be made, i.e. a radiologist has to be chosen for high quality and fast outcomes based on the medical and technical attributes of reporting units and residing radiologists.


                        Subspecialty of the radiologist. Based on the subspecialty of radiologists or experiences on practice, radiologists may be better equipped in certain modalities, diseases or biosystems.


                        Response time. The factors effecting the response time are inspection file delivery time depending on the inspection file size and reporting unit bandwidth, availability time of radiologist based on the schedule and reporting time of radiologist associated with inspection modality, disease, body part and anatomy.


                        Workload of the radiologist. In order to achieve an efficient reporting process and to balance incomes, each radiologist should be assigned with workload within certain limits. Reporting process for each inspection is not equal in effort. The workload of reporting processes are determined based on requested inspection protocol id according to the SUT standardization. “Performance Point Extension Proposal” proposed by the Turkish Society of Radiology is also used to strengthen the estimations on the average reporting time.


                        Technical capability of the reporting sites. The technical capability of the reporting unit effects the response time and the reporting service capacity. Bandwidth of the site affects the response time, while storage capacity and number of the workstations determine the technical adequacy of the reporting unit. Monitor resolution is also taken as a requirement parameter based on inspection resolution. For example, a CT scan image that is composed of 512×512 pixels has a total of 262,144 pixels (0.25 megapixels), while a CR image is composed of 2048×2048 pixels (4 megapixels). Therefore, optimal monitor resolution should be chosen equal to or higher than the image resolution for original size and wholesome interpretation.

The architecture is designed to fulfill the requirements of Interoperability, Scalability, Compatibility, Accessibility and Workflow Optimization with four main components: Grid Agent, Grid Manager, Data Management Platform and Front-End (Fig. 1). Functional libraries, application server and database software is chosen to be open source and written in Java for customizability and adaptability.

Grid Agent software is developed to run on open source Red5 media server as it supports shared object communication over Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) in order to push Grid Index updates to sites in real time. DICOM and HL7 messages are handled by asynchronous Java threads using dcm4che and HAPI Java libraries. Grid Agent is composed of two main components.


                           Interface Layer. DICOM, HL7 and Grid Manager interfaces are implemented in order to interconnect Grid Manager with local PACS, RIS, Hospital Information System (HIS) and imaging facilities. Application Programming Interface (API) modules handle the interconnection functionality. dicomAPI handles DICOM transfers from modalities to Grid Manager API and from Grid Manager API to local PACS. hl7API is implemented to handle HL7 message communication with RIS and HIS. Grid Manager API is responsible for delivering workflow management requests between local site and Grid Manager with encrypted XML messages using Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and RTMP. It also synchronizes medical image and report data between local site and Grid Manager using HTTP Post or DICOM requests.


                           Task Manager. Worker threads are implemented using open source Gearman java library in order to manage parallel transfer, import and deletion tasks in a thread safe infrastructure. Gearman workers utilize Interface Layer functions in order to fulfill tasks registered by Gearman clients. Gearman client requests are generated by Task Manager Service which listens to state changes in the local archive and Grid Manager. Transfer workers, synchronize the archived DICOM studies or medical reports to the Grid Manager using Grid Manager API. Import workers are responsible for synchronizing DICOM studies of a patient's previous studies that are archived by different image acquisition sites to local PACS. Import workers can also synchronize imaging worklist requests or medical report updates to local RIS or HIS. Delete workers are responsible for deleting the archived studies on the temporary storage based on the permission by the Grid Manager. Grid Manager can decide to delete the study considering the storage capacity of site and the redundancy of the study in other sites.

Grid Manager is developed to run on Red5 and is specialized to send and receive encrypted XML and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages or DICOM files utilizing DICOM, HTTP or RTMP protocols. It communicates with Grid Agents and performs database, indexing and file operations at the center.


                           Grid Index. Grid Manager has the Grid Index which includes the patient examination map archived by Grid Agents. The index is in shared object form so that a change in the index is pushed to all agents with the help of RTMP protocol.


                           Image Delivery Service. DICOM images received by the Grid Manager are rendered into semantic data objects and semantic attributes involving modality, body part, anatomy, reporting effort estimate, prediagnosis values are extracted utilizing SUT and ICD-10 lookup tables. Grid Index is updated and DICOM objects linked with semantic data objects are forwarded to Data Management Platform. Image Delivery Service delivers inspection assignments decisions by Reporting Workflow Optimization Service to corresponding Grid Agents with the help of Task Manager Service at sites.


                           Reporting Workflow Optimization Service. Based on the reporting requests from imaging sites, RWOA implemented with Java are applied to semantic data objects of inspections and registered reporting units or radiologists. Open source OptimJ library lpsolve solver is utilized for the ILP process. Based on the assignment results, the inspections are synchronized to corresponding Grid Agents via Image Delivery Service.


                           Monitoring Service. Task Manager Service of the Grid Agents periodically posts worker thread activities and recent storage capacity and bandwidth values to the Grid Manager using Grid Manager API at each site. Statistics about transfer, import, deletion processes and storage and bandwidth capacities are archived with reference to time and are utilized for RWOA for technical capability requirement parameters.


                           Redundancy Service. The temporary storage mechanism at the agents provides the redundancy of the medical data so that the data achieve is distributed and cached. Based on the Grid Index and Monitoring Service storage capacity or transfer activity statistics, Grid Manager can decide to delete or move medical image data to different Grid Agents with the help of Task Manager Service at sites.


                           File Operation Layer. File Operation Layer is implemented with Tomcat Servlet Container. DICOM images rendered by Grid Manager are indexed using Lucene Indexing to improve image query response time for web access. Lucene Indexing is chosen as it has high performance for text search operations. File Operation Layer involves a Global File System (GFS) cluster where medical image files are archived in a hierarchical structure (year/month/day/patientId/studyId/seriesId/instanceId). DICOM objects are directed to the Federation Manager with the url reference for database operations.


                           Database Layer. Database Layer is implemented with PostgreSQL as it is one of the most advanced open source database software. The database instances are implemented in 1 master and 16 slave shards to deliver large scale loads. The master instance store the patient, inspection and report related information while shard instances store the study, series and instance information for patient inspections. Federation Manager performs a mapping between the 32-hexadecimal-digit unique identifier (UID) formed patientId and corresponding shard; therefore, a patient's image data is stored on a single shard and the overall data is distributed among 16 shards.


                           Application Layer. Application Layer is implemented with Red5 media server. A RESTful interface is provided for web access using HTTP or web service SOAP requests. Web service interface is considered for external system integrations. XML is utilized for client-server communication and open source memcached software is used as Server-Side Caching mechanism in order to cache recently accessed inspection objects or frequent query results. JPEG Streaming mechanism is implemented using open source dcm4che-toolkit library in order to process DICOM files with window level, window width or preset parameters and stream JPEG files as an output for mobile access.

Front-End application is developed using Adobe Air ActionScript technology, which can be exported as Web, Android and iOS applications. For web clients, Java based open source DICOM viewer software, ImageJ is embedded in the application as an Applet. ImageJ is customized to pre-fetch 3-neighbour slices in study series image instances and to cache the stack of downloaded slices so that the client can view images before all image instances are downloaded and investigate slices faster. For mobile clients JPEG Streaming implemented on the server Application Layer is utilized and annotations can be saved on the image instances.

@&#METHODS@&#

In order to perform the optimum matching between a radiologist and an inspection, parameters such as subspecialty, response time, workload limit of the radiologist and technical capability of the corresponding reporting unit have to be evaluated.

The inspection and radiologist attributes are modelled using a hierarchical ontology structure based on DICOM Conformance and DICOM Content Mapping Resource and WHO definitions. Ontology maps include the main nodes of Subspecialty, Response Time, Workload and Technical. Subspecialty is evaluated by the assessment of subquantities for each subnode Modality, Body Part, Anatomy and Disease. Similarly each node is connected hierarchically to subnodes having a weighted relation based on AHP. The input for the assessment process is provided by the inspection DICOM file. dcm4che library is used to render inspections in DICOM format. Modality, body part and anatomy examined, protocol requested, file size, series and slice numbers, resolution data are rendered into XML for RWOA. Requested protocol id, which is determined using the web interface by a physician's request for a radiology inspection, is mapped to SUT codes which determine the required effort and time for the reporting process. Pre-diagnosis is entered using the web interface by the report requester as ICD-10 code. The attributes rendered in the inspection files of DICOM format are used to derive the demand criterias for the radiologist.

The pairwise comparison for each entity of the problem is represented by a pairwise comparison matrix. The weight

                            for each entity l at hierarchical level k of the ontology map including n entities is calculated using pair-wise comparison matrix element a

                           In urgent cases, subspecialty and workload quota are evaluated as secondary importance and consequently there are two different weight matrixes on the response time node as illustrated in Fig. 2
                           .

Ratings are evaluated with a recursive relation based semantic matching process [36] by normalizing the sum of multiplicative weights with the following equation:

The architecture has been tested in a total of 35 hospitals, 13 primary care clinics, 3 mobile clinics, 1 reporting unit through a period of 30 months. 3.35 million inspections were archived and 14,216 inspections were reported by the reporting unit. Every inspection was archived based on a consent form from patients before the inspection. The archived inspections involved mainly CR, DX, MR, CT and MG images which were 57.4%, 15.2%, 12.6%, 12.6% and 0.5% of the total images, respectively. 55.3% of the inspections were generated by 6 hospitals which were Ataturk EAH, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit EAH, Sincan Devlet Hastanesi, Yenimahalle EAH, Numune EAH and Ankara EAH hospitals. The hospitals were located in an area of approximately 2000km2 and the distance between two farthest hospitals was 150km. The reporting unit was located in Yenimahalle Ismail Ulucanlar Aile Sagligi Merkezi and had a distance of 70.5km to the farthest hospital. The reporting unit had a bandwidth of 8Mbit/s while the bandwidth of hospitals ranged from 650Kbit/s to 20Mbit/s.

RWOA evaluation periods are categorized as Stage 1 and Stage 2. In Stage 1, 4738 medical inspections which involved 4481 CT, 116 MR, 106 CR and 35 MG, were imported from an archive to test the functionality of the reporting unit and user interface. At this stage, the radiologists were obliged to finish the overall reporting process within one month; therefore the chief radiologist had to make the reporting assignment considering the parameters of subspecialty, response time and workload limits. The reporting time, assigned workload, frequency of reporting, which are indicators of response time, workload limit and subspecialty, respectively, were extracted for each radiologist using the resultant event logs and archive data based on modality as illustrated in Fig. 3
                         and body part. The body parts involved Brain, Thorax, Lower/Upper Abdomen, Pelvis, Temporal Bone and Paranasal Sinuses.

In Stage 2, 1464 medical inspections, which involved 1445 CT, 18 MR, and 1 CR, from 22 hospitals were synchronized to the Reporting Unit with the help of Grid Manager and Grid Agent architecture within a period of following 3 months. The assignment was done by the chief radiologist to 9 radiologists who worked every weekday from 5pm to 8pm. RWOA was applied to Stage 2 data and the resultant assignment decisions were compared based on success rates calculated using extracted subspecialty and response time data in Stage 1. Medical reports delivered during the following 26 months were excluded from the RWOA evaluation as they were distributed on a large period and the number of radiologists or working hours were not stable.

A piloting application is currently available at 
                           http://eradyoloji.saglik.gov.tr
                         supported by the Governship of Public Health, Ankara, Turkey. The architecture with the workflow optimization is active for use in 8 imaging sites. However, only one reporting unit with one radiologist is employed for the reporting process, so it is practically not favorable to visualize the improvements provided by the algorithm.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to Round Robin, Random, Shortest Queue distribution policies using 100 sample radiology inspections. A simulation is adopted with 4 imaging facilities and 3 reporting units, 1 data center and 2 non-local clients as virtual machines on different subnets. 6 radiologists working in 3 reporting units are registered and their experience, reporting unit technical capabilities are defined using the web interface. Sample inspections include MR, CT, DX and MG data sets. When DICOM data is rendered the body part attributes consist of Brain, Leg, Thorax, Upper Abdomen, Lower Abdomen, Knee, Shoulder values. The attributes for prediagnosis data is generated based on a list of 10 ICD-10 codes (C39, C50, C71, C76, C78, D43, S02, S42, S82, S83). The results are evaluated based on subspecialty, response time and workload success rates.

Subspecialty success rate is the normalized value of RBSM calculated rating between 0 and 1 where higher subspecialty success rate is required for better reporting quality.

Response time success rate for policy p is defined as

                           j

                           p
                         equation is 0, which means that all assignment workloads are equal to the defined workload limits for each radiologist. Therefore, distribution policy can be evaluated as more successful in terms of workload efficiency when ld
                        
                           p
                         is high. The results for applied distribution policies are displayed in Table 1

In RWOA Evaluation Period Stage 2, the inspections from 22 hospitals were synchronized to the Reporting Unit with the help of Grid Manager and Grid Agent architecture. The assignment was done by the chief radiologist to 9 radiologists. RWOA is applied to Stage 2 data and the resultant assignment decisions are saved. The ontology map of radiologists formed using Stage 1 data is used in RWOA. The assignment results are compared between manual assignment and RWOA applied assignment based on subspecialty, response time and workload success rates as seen in Fig. 4
                        . The success rates are calculated based on extracted subspecialty, response time data in Stage 1. Therefore, Stage 1 data is taken as gold standard and primary data which is manual assignment outcomes with inspections generated in Stage 2 is compared to secondary data which is RWOA applied assignment outcomes with inspections generated in Stage 2. It is seen that RWOA increases the subspecialty success rate by 13.25%, workload success rate by 63.76% and response time success rate by 120%. Total response time in the real case application data is improved by 22.39%. Workload distribution is also optimized and distributed among resources.

ILP solution process can take long or stucks can occur in large data sets or strict boundary constraints. As a workaround solution to this situation, the boundary conditions are relaxed in real time or the data set is divided into smaller chunks.

The reporting frequency which is the only available indicator of subspecialty in the experimental setup can be misleading for overloaded radiologists. Therefore, this data is cross-checked with manually rated subspecialty evaluations by the chief radiologist. The ratings were found to be compliant except CT subspecialty rating for R8 which was rated to be lower by the chief radiologist. No correction was done based on this cross-check which was actually a disadvantage for the algorithm as it should still accomplish high speciality success rate while decreasing the workload of R8. The subspecialty rating node is foreseen to be evaluated more precisely with the inclusion of report quality feedback indicator.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Implemented infrastructure can be utilized to develop a teleradiology portal where radiologists and medical institutions sign-up to provide or receive reporting services. Radiologist can be initially accredited to be a member of the system and subspecialty and response time attributes can be updated dynamically within the system. This system can also be used to manage the schedule, resource management and salary management processes. All these processes can have performance assessments to improve the efficiency of RWOA.

Proposed infrastructure decreases the storage costs, reporting costs, turnaround times and increases report quality and effectiveness of resultant treatments. The adaptation of medical sites and reporting groups to the architecture only requires the integration of Grid Agent into the present systems deployed on these sites which decreases integration costs and provides high interoperability.

The integration procedure of medical institutions and reporting units to the proposed architecture is quite simple where only the Grid Agent is required to be deployed at sites. The deployment is possible with a moderate workstation capability and does not require high performance server or storage cluster capabilities. Also the deployment procedure does not effect available systems such as PACS, RIS and HIS. Instead, it also integrates these systems to the architecture for grid-based synchronization operations. The data archive is cached temporarily at sites and managed by the Redundancy Service at the Data Center. Therefore, redundancy and content distribution network is accomplished without additional storage or data center costs at sites. As a result, integration with the architecture at sites is low-cost, fast and practical. Therefore, the adaptation of this solution decreases the hardware and maintenance costs at sites. The operations at sites executed by Grid Agents can be monitored and controlled remotely with the help of Monitoring Service at the Data Center, which decreases the maintenance, technical staff allocation and training costs.

This solution can be applied in order to outsource radiology services to multiple groups, decrease radiologist payment costs, increase report quality and decrease turnaround time, manage workload and payment distribution based on performance evaluations. Nation-wide teleradiology solution can be accomplished with the integration on hospitals, medical centers and radiologists with the proposed solution. This architecture can also be used to deliver a qualified international reporting service to countries that have radiologist deficiency and subspecialty or consultation requirements. Global accredited reporting units can be accomplished for delivering a standardized, interoperable cloud-based radiology service to subscripted institutions. As a result, employment, financial management and performance assessment of radiologists processes are practically possible, image and report delivery mechanism is automized and optimized, quality and statistics assessment is accomplished and an innovative teleradiology service workflow is fulfilled.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The proposed architecture increases the efficiency of reporting process for teleradiology applications and provides a process centric implementation. It provides integration of several standard compliant medical systems regardless of the developer or manufacturer vendor, decreases storage costs with medical data redundancy at nodes, decreases reporting costs and turnaround times and increases report quality and effectiveness of resultant treatments.

This study integrates an architecture implementation with a workflow optimization algorithm for teleradiology service delivery. The integrated workflow management gives better results compared to the manual assignment process by the chief radiologist who has the knowledge about the reporting characteristics of the radiologists. The results are predicted to be better and more helpful when large-scale applications where there is a pool of radiologists and inspections are considered. Also when technical and schedule constraints are introduced, improvement ratios are also predicted to increase.
