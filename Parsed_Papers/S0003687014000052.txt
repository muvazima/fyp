                  Microclimatic conditions were recorded in an Italian school and Fanger's indexes PMV and PPD were calculated under different conditions. Students' sensations were investigated four times by means of two surveys, one related to actual microclimatic conditions and one on overall satisfaction, interaction occupant-building and reactions to discomfort. Pupils' classroom position was considered to look for possible influence on thermal comfort: a difference emerged from PMV and the survey, but the results obtained from the two approaches differ for both the entity of discomfort and its distribution within each classroom. Innovative multivariate nonparametric statistical techniques were applied to compare and rank the classrooms in accordance with students' subjective perceptions; a global ranking has been also calculated, considering thermal and visual comfort and air quality. Comparing pupil-sensation-based ranking with environmental parameters no clear correspondence was found, except for mid-season, where PMV, CO2 concentration and desk illuminance were similar in all the classrooms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Living in a pleasant, comfortable environment enhances people's wellbeing and satisfaction. These conditions are particularly important in commercial, educational and healthcare buildings, where good Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) influences productivity, learning and convalescence (Frontczak and Wargocki, 2011). This study focuses on Italian children (9–11-years-old) and their school, where they usually spend about 8 h a day, i.e. one third of their daytime. Children are very sensitive to indoor conditions since they are at growing age and they may develop hypersensitivity if they are exposed to poor indoor conditions (Mendell and Heath, 2005). Bakó-Biró et al. (2012) investigate the influence of poor air quality on pupils' attention and vigilance, and results reveal that poor ventilation lowers memory and concentration.

Many Italian schools have structural problems, such as insufficient space, safety, poor indoor air quality, low thermal comfort, and bad acoustics; they are often energy inefficient due to obsolete systems, the facades are poorly, if at all insulated, and in some cases windows are single-glazed.

Many studies have evaluated the indoor conditions of educational buildings, taking into account single aspects (Mendell and Heath, 2005; Bakó-Biró et al., 2012; Corgnati et al., 2009; Humphreys, 1977), or various aspects of overall comfort perception (De Giuli et al., 2012a; Astolfi et al., 2003; Astolfi and Pellerey, 2008; Mumovic, 2009; d'Ambrosio et al., 2010). This study looks at a range of aspects.

Four different classrooms and a total of 62 students were involved in this research. The school is attended by pupils from different countries and many of them belong to families with economic difficulties; therefore the sample represents a range of cultures, habits and social classes, which may influence perception of comfort and expectations. Some studies have analyzed the role of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, teacher quality and school size in learning achievements (Nichols, 2003; Toutkoushian and Curtis, 2005). One study surveyed New York City public schools in order to clarify the role that the condition of school facilities plays in educational outcomes (Duran-Narucki, 2008), starting from the fact that poor living conditions are related to a higher risk of social and emotional difficulties (Evans and English, 2002).

The IEQ analysis presented here is a development of the methodology explained and applied in (De Giuli et al., 2012a), where environmental snapshots were taken in seven primary schools near Venice; spot measurements were taken and pupils filled in a survey about their general satisfaction with indoor conditions. In that study, no specific reference was made to actual conditions, except for thermal sensation; moreover, spot measurements were recorded only once and no continuous measurements were carried out. The present analysis, however, overcomes these limits with a specific “spot survey” designed to compare recorded parameters with actual personal feelings; long-term measurements were also taken.

In this study, indoor microclimatic conditions and the level of children's satisfaction have been investigated in an educational building, by means of a comprehensive methodology, which involves both an objective and a subjective approach, measurements and survey administration, respectively.

The school itself is in a residential area near the centre of Padova (Fig. 1
                     (a)). In Italy, children begin primary school when they are six and they finish when they are eleven. School starts in mid-September and ends in early June. This research studied four of the school's classrooms: two were west-facing (A, B) and two east-facing (C, D). These classrooms were used by two fourth-year classes and two fifth-year classes, the oldest years at the school. The research lasted three months, from March to June, therefore it covered one month in heating conditions (until April 16) and two months in free-running conditions.

The four classrooms are the same size (around 45 m2); their façade is singled-glazed, shaded with internal Venetian blinds (Fig. 2
                     ), and the blackboard is opposite the windows. Classrooms B and C have two facades, but classrooms A and D only one. All of the classrooms are heated by radiators, and lit by four fluorescent lamps; they have no cooling or mechanical ventilation systems.

Pupils used two classrooms during the monitoring period: the fourth-year classes moved between classrooms A and B, while the fifth-year classes moved between classrooms C and D (Fig. 1(a) and (b)).

The aim of this study is to find a possible correlation between the recorded values and children perception of indoor conditions. As regards thermal comfort, Fanger's indexes PMV and PPD (Fanger, 1982; EN ISO 7730: 2005) have been calculated and compared to children actual thermal sensation, to see if Fanger's approach could be suitable even for children. Moreover, the influence of children’ position inside the classroom in terms in thermal comfort has been investigated, to see if the ones seated along the external and glazed wall express a different comfort level with respect to the ones seated far from the windows. Finally, from the answers given in the survey, an innovative statistical approach has been applied to provide a global ranking of the four classrooms, considering together thermal comfort, air quality and visual comfort: this ranking has been compared to the relative recorded parameters, to look for a possible correspondence between subjective and objective evaluation. Considering classrooms' orientation and position inside the building, it could be expected that, as regards thermal aspect, classroom B should result the worst comfortable (North-West oriented and two external façades).

@&#METHODS@&#

During each survey administration, the researcher noted the general condition of the classroom: door and window open or closed, shading up or down, lights on or off. Moreover a general impression of the students, in terms of clothing level, mood and excitement has been observed.

Measuring campaigns consisted in spot and long-term measurements, which started on March 14 and ran until June 6 2012. Spot measurements were recorded on four different days (March 14, April 11, May 9, and June 6); each day was characterized by different indoor and outdoor microclimatic conditions. Measurements were made with an Indoor Climatic Analyzer at the prescribed height of 0.6 m (ISO EN 7726: 1998). Air temperature, plane radiant temperatures, mean air velocity and relative humidity were also recorded in order to calculate Fanger's indexes (PMV and PPD) (Fanger, 1982; EN ISO 7730: 2005). Three different measurement points were selected in each classroom in order to establish possible differences between operative temperatures in the same room: one in the centre of the classroom, one close to the windows and one close to the wall opposite the windows. A room's operative temperature may vary greatly, especially in the extreme weather conditions of winter and summer when there is major asymmetry between the radiant temperature of the windowed wall and that of the opposite wall. In the previous version of the survey, pupils' classroom position was not taken into account; in this version, however, it was identified with a reference number. On each monitoring day, a desk map was drawn and pupils were asked to write their identification number in the spot survey. It was therefore possible to compare pupils' thermal sensation with the microclimatic conditions recorded at their classroom position.

Visual comfort was evaluated with illuminance measurements over the desks, and this was then compared with the pupils' visual satisfaction expressed in the survey.

Continuous monitoring consisted in recording air temperature, relative humidity and CO2 concentration with a time step of 5 min by means of a data-logger fixed vertically in each classroom (Fig. 1(d)). The used data-loggers have the following characteristics: temperature range was from −20 °C to 70 °C, RH 5%–95%, and CO2 concentration 0 ppm to 5000 ppm.

Two different surveys were administered to pupils in a subjective approach; one referred to actual conditions (i.e. the spot survey) and one (i.e. the general survey) to satisfaction with building-related aspects (e.g. building, space, furniture, etc.), occupant-building interaction (raising/lowering blinds, switching lights on/off, opening/closing windows) and reactions to discomfort.

The spot questionnaire was distributed four times during the recording of spot measurements. The general survey was administered only twice, at the beginning and at the end of the research. Although it was completed anonymously, each questionnaire had an identification number on the front page so that all the surveys for each pupil could be grouped.

Subjective scales have been simplified and changed from the ones suggested in ISO 28802, due to the tender age of the respondents. Perceptual and affective scales were used and not preference ones. As regards thermal sensation scale, the traditional 7-point scale has been reduced to a five-point one: this scale has been used in the spot survey, ranking actual thermal sensation. In the long survey, thermal sensation was investigated in terms of frequency of thermal discomfort during both cold and warm season, by means of a four-point scale. Questions about air quality and visual quality have a four point scale, like the one suggested in ISO 28802. In the long survey, all the questions about satisfaction of the overall building have an affective scale of four point and even the ones about the use of shading, window and lighting. Behavioral methods should be applied to obtain a more complete analysis, have not been applied since there was not parents' authorization.

In order to compare and rank the classrooms in accordance with the pupils' subjective perceptions, innovative permutation-based nonparametric multivariate statistical methods were used (Pesarin and Salmaso, 2010). When survey data are analyzed in literature, standard parametric techniques are normally used (e.g. t-tests, ANOVA or regression analysis). However, statistical literature makes it clear that parametric methods are not suitable when multivariate data are being analyzed in order to rank categorical responses (Blair et al., 1994; Pesarin and Salmaso, 2012). Permutation methods, however, are distribution free and do not need to assume the normality, which is the basis for standard parametric techniques. This kind of statistical approach has already been used to analyze several surveys conducted in other Italian schools (De Giuli et al., 2012a) and hospitals (De Giuli et al., 2012b).

NonParametric Combination (NPC) is a technique based on permutation tests and the nonparametric combination methodology (Pesarin and Salmaso, 2010; Basso et al., 2009). NPC enables more flexible analysis in terms of both specifying multivariate hypotheses and the nature of the variables involved. Nonparametric statistics, such as the permutation test, perform better than other parametric approaches (Pesarin and Salmaso, 2010) when applied to the asymmetric and non-normal distribution of variables (as happens when the answers to a survey are analyzed). Moreover, NPC methodology does not need a model of dependence between variables and is not affected by a loss of degrees of freedom when the number of variables is larger than the sample size (Pesarin and Salmaso, 2010). The main differences between the classrooms were analyzed with NPC R10 software. The possible difference between the answers was evaluated in terms of a p-value (a p-value below a significant level alpha, usually equal to 0.05, establishes that there is a significant difference).

The following is a brief outline of some theory behind the methods used to compare and rank the classrooms. A sample may be drawn from each of the C populations of interest (i.e. classrooms) in order to make inference on the true ranking of these populations. A one-way MANOVA layout may then be used to formalize the problem: let Y be the ordered categorical multivariate response variable representing a p-vector of the data observed, and it should be assumed, without loss of generality, that high values for each univariate aspect Y correspond to a better performance, and therefore to a higher ranking; in other words, the criterion “the higher the better” is assumed. The inferential goal is to rank C multivariate populations (i.e. classrooms) in accordance with their different p variables where n
                     
                        j
                      replicates (pupils' questionnaires), j = 1,…,C, from each population are available. Under the null hypothesis of the equality of the C populations (i.e. classrooms), all true ranks would necessarily be equal to one; this would result in a full ex-equo situation. This situation of equal ranking may be formally represented in a hypothesis-testing framework where the hypotheses of interest are:

Note that a rejection of at least one hypothesis H
                     0(jh) implies that ranking is not equal, i.e. one multivariate population is ranked higher than another.

As the goal is to rank a range of multivariate populations, an alternative univariate hypothesis H
                     0k(jh) is used to decide whether a population is greater than another rather than simply different. To achieve this, directional type alternatives are used, namely those suitable for testing both the one-sided alternatives. Directional univariate and multivariate directional p-values were applied with an algorithm that would rank the population from the “best” to the “worst”. Details on the ranking methodology may be found in Corain and Salmaso (2007).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Spot measurements were taken for each time and the values in each classroom recorded; pupil satisfaction was also taken into account. PMV and PPD indexes were calculated with a metabolic rate of 1.2 met (standard value for a sedentary activity, as suggested in ISO 7730) and a clothing level, determined from direct observation and from the answers given in the survey, of 1 clo for the first and second monitoring days (March and April) and 0.5 clo for the third and fourth ones (May and June). Operative temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, CO2 concentration, illuminance and PMV and PPD indexes were discussed on the basis of the limits in (EN ISO 7730:2005; EN 15251: 2007; EN 12464-1: 2002). Standard EN15251 classifies buildings in four categories in accordance with the occupants' psychophysical level (i.e. sensitive people with special requirements, such as people with disabilities, the sick, infants and the elderly) and level of expectation (e.g. Category I: high level of expectation, for sensitive people). The recommend criteria for these buildings are shown in Table 1
                     .

According to EN12464-1 (2002), recommended maintained desk illuminance is 300 lux.

During each monitoring campaign, time of day, sky condition, number of pupils, lighting (on or off), door (open or closed), windows (open or closed) and blinds (raised or lowered) were noted (Table 2
                        ), since these conditions influence measurements and must be considered in the overall evaluation. Sky condition was overcast only for the second campaign, which meant the light had to be switched on. Moreover, this was the only day the windows were closed; therefore CO2 concentrations were the highest (around 2500 ppm above outdoor).

Pupils' satisfaction with thermal and visual comfort, air quality and draughts is compared with the parameters measured in order to pinpoint a possible correspondence between the subjective and objective approaches. Satisfaction with thermal comfort is compared with indoor/outdoor air and indoor operative temperatures (Fig. 3
                        (a), Fig. 4
                        (a), Fig. 5
                        (a) and Fig. 6
                        (a) and (b)); visual comfort with mean and standard deviation, and minimum and maximum desk illuminance (Fig. 3(b), Fig. 4(b) Fig. 5(b) Fig. 6(c)); air quality with CO2 concentration (Fig. 4(c), Fig. 5(c), Fig. 6(d)); and draughts with mean and standard deviation of air velocity (Fig. 3(c), Fig. 4(d), Fig. 5(d), Fig. 6(e)). Visual comfort was compared with pupil satisfaction with desk visibility in relation to desk illuminance and with a question that asked whether classroom illuminance was excessive (answer “Not at all” corresponds to good illuminance distribution, while “Yes, extremely” corresponds to excessive luminous space).

On the first monitoring day, classroom D was being refurbished, therefore Class 5A was in a different room (H), where no long-term measurements were taken for this research. CO2 concentration in classrooms A and B was acceptable (classroom A belonged to Category II and B to Category I) since some windows were open (Table 2). Classrooms A and C belonged to Category I as regards thermal sensation, while classroom B was unacceptable (Category IV near the windows and III in the rest of the room), especially in the area near the windows; this was also confirmed by pupils' thermal sensation (Fig. 3(a)). Classroom B is a west-facing corner room (Fig. 1(b)), and the measurements were taken in the early afternoon; the outdoor temperature was around 20 °C and this explains the values recorded. Only in classroom B the relative position inside the classroom had an influence on thermal sensation, derived from both children perception and Fanger approach. This influence regards even classroom C, but only from subjective point of view.


                           Fig. 3(b) illustrates lighting in the classrooms; the question was: “Do you think that there is too much light in your classroom now?” In all the classrooms except 5A desk illuminance was below the required value of 300 lux, while mean illuminance was acceptable. When the survey results were compared with the values measured, no clear correspondence was found (e.g. 4A and 5B had similar illuminance, but pupils expressed different visual perception), and this confirms the subjective nature of visual comfort. Pupils had no problems with draughts.

The second monitoring day was characterized by the lowest outdoor temperature (Fig. 4(a)), which explained the windows being closed in all the classrooms. This meant that CO2 concentrations were the highest of the entire monitoring period (Table 2). This was the only time operative temperatures were lower than air temperature (Table 4
                           
                           ). The temperatures in classrooms C and D were approximately 1.5°C–2 °C lower than in classrooms A and B, despite measurements being taken around midday and early morning respectively; moreover, these classrooms had a greater percentage of pupils who felt cold (Fig. 4(a)). The position inside the classroom had not an influence in thermal comfort: both Fanger approach and children’ thermal sensation did not show any difference, except for classroom B. On the contrary, the entity of thermal sensation obtained by Fanger approach and the survey was different: in classrooms C and D, more than the 50% of children complained for a thermal discomfort (cold sensation). Nevertheless, PMV values of classrooms C and D were negative and this corresponds to the perceived cold sensation of children.

Good illuminance uniformity between the desks (Fig. 4(b)) was due to overcast sky conditions and to the light being switched on. Classroom 4A was the only one with desk illuminance below the required value; this means that the lighting system is not designed properly.

Pupils did not complain about poor air quality despite CO2 concentrations being extremely high and going beyond Category III (above 800 ppm). Pupils had no problems with draughts.

In May (Table 5
                           ), classrooms C and D were approximately 2 °C warmer than classrooms A and B, but measurements were taken after lunch and late morning respectively, therefore with different outdoor conditions. Indoor air temperatures were similar throughout the same classroom, while operative temperatures differed by about 1.5 °C. Nobody felt cold (Fig. 5(a)) and the classroom with the greatest amount of thermal satisfaction (“I feel fine”) was the one with the lowest indoor temperatures (4A). According to EN 15251, classrooms 4A and 4B belong to Category III, while 5A and 5B are outside all the acceptable ranges (Table 1). In classrooms B and D, a great difference in thermal sensation, depending on the relative position throughout the classroom, can be noticed. Nevertheless, the difference emerged from PPD indexes does not correspond to the one emerged from subjective responses: in both classrooms, the highest values of PPD were along the external façade, while, in classroom B, the highest percentage of dissatisfaction came from the children seated in the central area and, in classroom D, from the children seated in the area opposite to the one along the windows.

Minimum desk illuminance in all the classrooms was below the required level of 300 lux, and in 4A the mean value was also around 300 lux. This result can be explained by the blinds being partly lowered (Table 2). A greater percentage of pupils complained about excessive illuminance throughout classrooms 5A and 5B; this result is consistent with their illuminance values, which were higher than in the other classrooms (Fig. 5(b)).

As regards air quality, all the classrooms belonged to Category III, except 5B, in which CO2 concentration exceeded 800 ppm; nevertheless the classroom with the greatest number of pupil complaints is the one with the lowest value (5A). No particular remarks emerged about draughts.

In early June (Table 6
                           ), measurements were taken after lunch (Table 2) and operative temperatures were found to be unacceptable in all the classrooms (Category IV) except in D (Category III), since it is the only classroom with an east-facing external wall. Nevertheless, the measurements reveal that pupils' thermal sensation is extremely unpredictable: classrooms B and D have the same percentage of thermal dissatisfaction (around 80% of pupils, independent of their classroom position, felt hot or very hot), but operative temperature differed by up to 3 °C. Throughout all the classrooms, Fanger' indexes differed a lot, like children' thermal sensation, but PPD indexes were higher along the external façade, while subjective responses were unpredictable, except for classroom A. In fact, in classroom B, both children seated along the internal wall and the external wall complained in the same way, in classroom C the highest discomfort was perceived in the central area of the room and in classroom D in the central area and in the area along the internal wall.

Minimum desk illuminance in all classrooms, except 4A, was below the required level due to the blinds being partly or even completely lowered; classroom 5A had the lowest maximum illuminance (Fig. 6(c)).

Classrooms 4A and 5A had both their windows and door open (Table 2) and this explains the lowest CO2 concentrations and why air velocity was higher than the values recorded in the other classrooms. This difference is confirmed by the subjective evaluation, since pupils of classrooms 4A and 5A complained about air quality the least (Fig. 6(d)) and about draughts the most (Fig. 6(e)).

During each monitoring campaign, pupils were asked to write down the illuminance value recorded over their desk in their own “spot survey” so that it could be correlated to their actual desk visibility. Two representative illuminance conditions were examined; they are characterized by two different levels of uniformity and were observed throughout the monitoring period. Fig. 7
                         shows that visual comfort is extremely subjective and unpredictable, especially in non-uniform illuminance conditions (e.g. pupils with 300 lux and 1100 lux over their desk gave the same answer “Not much” for desk visibility).

Pupils' feelings of excessive classroom lighting were also analyzed as per their classroom position (near the windows, central and on the far side of the classroom). No particular influence emerged from pupils' perception.

Air temperature, relative humidity and CO2 concentration were recorded with a time step of 5 min throughout the monitoring period (Fig. 8
                         and Fig. 10
                        
                        ).

The position of each classroom is clearly identified by its temperature profile since the air temperature values of classrooms C and D (east-facing) are similar and higher in the morning; classrooms A and B (west-facing) also had the same values in the afternoon.

Pupils' thermal sensation in each season (heating season and free-running conditions) was compared with the mean and standard deviation, and the minimum and maximum air temperatures recorded by the data-loggers (Fig. 9). Classrooms A and B were considered together since the pupils of classes 4A and 4B used both these rooms. The same occurred for classrooms C and D. The two pairs of classrooms differ by approximately one degree: classrooms A and B are cooler in winter and warmer in summer than C and D. Nevertheless, pupils using C and D complained the most, both during the heating season and in free-running conditions.

Only after May 29 was CO2 concentration above outdoor below 800 ppm (Category III), but it reached up to 4000 ppm during the rest of the monitoring period. Classrooms C and D registered lower values (Fig. 11
                        ).

Pupil reactions to discomfort were analyzed with questions about how they behave when faced with it. The percentage of pupils who reacted passively, answering “Nothing”, is shown in Fig. 12
                              . The least passive reaction – less than 20% in all four classrooms – regards blackboard visibility, probably the most important classroom requirement. The most frequent reactions to discomfort for all the respondents were: “I ask the teacher to open the windows” for air quality; “I ask the teacher to close the windows” for draughts; “I move” for blackboard visibility; “Nothing” for desk visibility; and “I ask the teacher to raise his/her voice” for hearing teacher. When these answers were compared with the ones given by the pupils in other schools (De Giuli et al., 2012a), differences emerged only for draughts and desk visibility, where the most frequent answers were “Nothing” and “I tell my schoolmates to be quiet” respectively.

The total percentages of pupils who gave a positive answer (“Yes, somewhat” and “Yes, extremely”) to the questions about occupant-building interaction are shown in Fig. 13
                              .

The answers regarding lighting on/off and airing during break and blinds raised/lowered during summer turned out to be significantly different (p-value<0.05). Airing is frequent all the time (during break, class and in the hot season) for the two fifth-year classes (classrooms C and D), while teachers of the two fourth-year classes opened the windows mainly during the hot season (Fig. 13)

A first look at the classroom comparison in terms of pupils' perceived environmental comfort is provided by the radar graphs in Fig. 14
                              , where the sample means of the scores for the three comfort aspects are shown for each of the four classrooms; the classrooms are identified by the letters A, B, C and D, according to their position in the building (Fig. 1(b)) (see Fig. 14). Classroom H was used for the first time/monitoring day only when classroom D was being refurbished. Note that since all comfort aspects go by the rule “the larger the better”, the more external a given radar, the greater the perceived wellbeing for that classroom.

The radar graphs suggest that no relevant differences were found on the first two monitoring days (March 14, April 11), but some different general perceptions occurred in the last two surveys (May 9, June 6). Obviously this result has a simple descriptive interpretation and must be validated by suitable inferential analysis. To achieve this, the combined multivariate permutation p-values were considered (test statistic: Anderson-Darling, combining function: Fisher; see ((Pesarin and Salmaso, 2010) for details) and they confirmed that there were no significant differences on the first two monitoring days (p-value = 0.341, time 1; p-value = 0.592, time 2). However there was a significant global multivariate difference on the latter two (time 3: p-value = 0.031; time 4: p-value = 0.009).

In order to find out which specific comfort aspect mainly affected the global difference, Table 7
                               shows the directional univariate permutation p-values for the third and fourth days by monitoring day and comfort aspect (p-values are adjusted by multiplicity with the Simes-Hommel method (Westfall et al., 2011)). Each p-value should be interpreted as follows: for each given row, if the p-value is less than the alpha significance level (5%), then the null hypothesis of equal comfort must be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the perceived comfort for the classroom in the row is greater than that in the classroom in the column (see Table 7).

When the ranking methodology proposed by Corain and Salmaso (2007) is applied, the four classrooms can be ranked from “best” to “worst”. The higher rankings are occupied by the classrooms with the higher overall perceived comfort (Table 8
                              ).

Classroom A was the most comfortable on all monitoring days; it is the classroom with only one external façade, which faces west (Fig. 1(b)). On the first two time occasions (i.e. monitoring days) all the classrooms were ranked equally. Note that the two classrooms with two external façades (B and C) always had the same ranking, while classroom D, an east-facing corner room, was ranked differently according to climatic conditions, both indoor and outdoor.

When this pupil-sensation-based ranking (i.e. a subjective approach) is compared with environmental parameters (i.e. an objective approach), there is no clear correspondence. However some differences were noticed between measured and perceived comfort among the three aspects considered in the global ranking (thermal comfort, air quality and visual comfort). The only monitoring day on which these two approaches match is Day 2, where PMV, CO2 concentration and desk illuminance are similar in all the classrooms. On day 1 (March), air quality was similar in all the classrooms (Table 2), while thermal comfort was extremely different for classroom B (Table 3), the worst. Differences came to light for visual comfort as well: class H is ranked first (Fig. 3(b)). On day 3 (May), classroom A was the best for thermal comfort, but not for air quality; classroom D had the lowest CO2 concentration (Table 2); and classrooms C and D had excessively high desk illuminance values (Fig. 5(b)). Finally, on day 4 (June), classroom A did not rank first in any comfort aspects; classroom D was the best for air quality (Table 2), thermal comfort and visual comfort, together with classroom C (Fig. 6(c)).

These differences confirm the particular nature of IEQ analysis, therefore both subjective and objective approaches need to be taken into account, otherwise uncertain and incomplete conclusions could be drawn.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Indoor environmental comfort was evaluated from March to June in four classrooms by means of four spot-measuring campaigns, long-term monitoring, and surveys. Measured, recommended and perceived microclimatic and lighting conditions were also compared. The school building is not equipped with a mechanical ventilation system, therefore CO2 concentrations were extremely high in all the classrooms, and they decreased as hot season approached since the windows were opened more frequently. Operative temperatures varied from 20 °C to 30 °C during the four spot-monitoring campaigns and, considering the whole monitoring period, it came to light that from May indoor temperatures were unacceptable most of the time, since they often exceeded 30 °C. Visual comfort turned out to be extremely subjective; therefore it is difficult to look for a possible correlation. This work presents the results from mid-season and summertime. Analysis in autumn/early winter would be necessary to provide a more complete evaluation: this is already part of future work.

Pupils' behavior in the event of discomfort was analyzed with questions on how they react to discomfort; their main active reaction was towards the aspects strictly connected to school goals, i.e. to the level of blackboard visibility and to hearing the teacher.

As regards the statistical evaluation of the surveys, the scores obtained on each monitoring day for thermal comfort, air quality and visual comfort are presented with radar graphs. No major differences were found between the first two monitoring days, but some did come to light from the last two surveys. This descriptive interpretation was then validated by suitable inferential analysis, which considered the combined multivariate permutation p-values. This approach confirmed a global significance difference only between the last two monitoring days. Directional univariate permutation p-values were also calculated to find out which specific comfort aspect mainly affected global difference. Finally, a ranking methodology (Corain and Salmaso, 2007) was applied in order to rank the classrooms globally. When this subjective-approach ranking was compared to the environmental parameters, there was no clear correspondence; in fact this ranking was confirmed in terms of both perceived and measured comfort on the second monitoring day only. This confirms the extremely subjective nature of the analysis of indoor environmental quality and the need to consider both the approaches (i.e. subjective and objective), otherwise the interpretation of the results would be incomplete and misleading. People are the users of buildings and their satisfaction should be preferred to recommended values.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A comprehensive analysis in four classrooms, under different indoor conditions, has been carried out, measuring microclimatic parameters and lighting, calculating Fanger' indexes for thermal comfort and administering two different kinds of surveys. PMV and PPD have been calculated and compared to children actual thermal sensation: a clear correspondence could not be found between the two approaches. The influence of children' position inside the classroom about thermal comfort has been investigated: throughout all the classrooms, Fanger' indexes differed a lot, like children' thermal sensation, but PPD indexes were in general higher along the external façade, while subjective responses were unpredictable.

The global ranking performed considering subjective responses about air quality, thermal and visual comfort reported an equal ranking on the first two monitoring days. Classroom A, the classroom with only one external façade, which faces west, was the most comfortable on all monitoring days; The two classrooms with two external facades (B and C) always had the same ranking, while classroom D, an east-facing corner room, was ranked differently according to climatic conditions, both indoor and outdoor. Comparing the ranking obtained from subjective responses and from the objective approach (measurements and Fanger's indexes), the only monitoring day on which these two approaches match was in mid season, where PMV, CO2 concentration and desk illuminance were similar in all the classrooms. Anyway, in general, no clear correspondence has been obtained comparing pupil-sensation-based ranking (i.e. a subjective approach) with environmental parameters (i.e. an objective approach): this confirms the intrinsic subjectivity that characterizes IEQ analysis.
