                  Genetic algorithms are widely used in the estimation of expression profiles from microarrays data. However, these techniques are unable to produce stable and robust solutions suitable to use in clinical and biomedical studies. This paper presents a novel two-stage evolutionary strategy for gene feature selection combining the genetic algorithm with biological information extracted from the KEGG database. A comparative study is carried out over public data from three different types of cancer (leukemia, lung cancer and prostate cancer). Even though the analyses only use features having KEGG information, the results demonstrate that this two-stage evolutionary strategy increased the consistency, robustness and accuracy of a blind discrimination among relapsed and healthy individuals. Therefore, this approach could facilitate the definition of gene signatures for the clinical prognosis and diagnostic of cancer diseases in a near future. Additionally, it could also be used for biological knowledge discovery about the studied disease.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The term cancer encompasses more than 100 potentially life-threatening diseases affecting nearly every part of the body. Cancer is a complex, multifactorial, genetic disease involving structural and expression abnormalities of both coding and non-coding genes. In this sense, gene expression profiling plays an important role in a wide range of areas in biological science for handling cancer diseases [1–4]. The analysis of DNA microarray data requires a selection of features (genes) due to the small number of samples available (mostly less than a hundred) and the large number of features (in the order of thousands). This problem is well-known in the literature as the “large-p-small-n” paradigm or the curse of dimensionality [5].

Evolutionary models have been proposed in several works [6–12] and constitute one of the most widely used techniques for feature selection and prognosis analysis in microarray datasets. Despite all the variety of feature selection techniques proposed in the literature, it still remains a problematic intrinsic to the domain of DNA microarrays. Genetic algorithms (GAs) [13–18], as a particular case of evolutionary models, use classification techniques within the algorithm to evaluate and evolve the population. Producing stable or robust solutions is a desired property of feature selection algorithms, in particular for clinical and biomedical studies. Nevertheless, robustness is a property difficult to be analyzed and is often overlooked. In [19–21] different approaches are proposed, addressing the main drawbacks related to overfitting and robustness, through a modified GA that includes an early-stopping criteria and establishing a feature ranking method that leads to more robust solutions. Although some proposals use biological information to analyze DNA microarray data [22], none of them includes it into the mechanisms that guide the searching procedure in the GA. In our opinion, this strategy would, on one hand, produce more robust feature subset selections and, on the other hand, permit to obtain signatures more relevant for clinicians and biomedical researchers.

In this approach, a two-stage procedure is proposed in order to obtain robust feature subset selections with good performance rates in test future data. Bootstrap Cross-Validation (BCV) is used since its good behavior related to misclassification error with small samples has been previously demonstrated [23,24], including DNA microarray datasets. A novel feature scoring method within the GA is also proposed, taking into account biological information related to the studied disorders. One widely used source of biological information is the Gene Ontology (GO) database [25] since it provides a controlled vocabulary for the description of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. However, GO is sub-classified using a hierarchy of unclear reasoning with no validation analysis, contains insufficient number of rules for determining whether a given concept is present or not in GO, and most importantly, most GO terms have been assigned by sequence similarity through an automatic analysis, without laboratory validation [26]. Therefore, we have discarded the use of GO and moved to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database [27]. Since many years, this database has been one of the most important sources for building initial pathway models because it can be used as a reference knowledge base for deciphering the genome and linking genes/proteins to biological systems and also to the environment. Its main strength is that it is manually drawn and the assignment of a KEGG code to a sequence implies experimental evidence support. On the contrary, if a protein coded by a sequence does not produce enzymatic activity or is not part of a signaling pathway, it will never have a KEGG code. Fortunately, most genes involved in cancer have enzyme activity and belong to signaling pathways. This makes KEGG a valuable and highly reliable source of pathways and lead us to obtain robust and biologically important feature subset selections. In fact, KEGG codes 05200 to 05223 are specifically dedicated to cancer.

                      As an example, KEGG pathways have allowed the generation of systems biology models [28], the identification of disease virulence factors [29], the emergence of molecular pathway perturbations in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [30], or the analysis of the lipidomic and transcriptomic changes showing the distinct roles of STAT1 and STAT3 on apoptosis, immunity and lipid metabolism [31].

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the methodology of our approach and Section 3 shows the experimental results over different databases. Section 4 provides the final conclusions of the work drawn from the analysis of the selected genes and from the study of the influence of the biological information in the performance of the strategy.

Three free-public high-dimensional biomedical datasets have been used within this work. Each of them is related to an specific cancer study disorder: leukemia,

This dataset was taken from a collection of leukemia patient samples reported in [32] and it often serves as benchmark for microarray analysis methods. It contains measurements corresponding to acute lymphoblast leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples from bone marrow and peripheral blood. The dataset consists of 72 samples (25 of them of AML and 47 samples of ALL) and each one is measured over 7129 genes. The ID for the leukemia Affymetrix GeneChip HuGeneFL array is hu6800. In particular, the R package “hu6800.db” [33] has been used to manage and preprocess the biological information related to this microarray.

This dataset was reported in [34]. Prostate tumors are among the most heterogeneous of cancers, both histologically and with respect to highly divergent clinical outcomes. The dataset consists of 102 samples (52 of them are tumor samples and 50 samples are non-tumor ones) and each one is represented by 12,600 genes. The Affymetrix ID for the prostate cancer microarray is HGU95av2 and the R package “hgu95av2.db” [35] was used to manage and preprocess biological information related to this microarray.

This dataset presents a classification between malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and adenocarcinoma (ADCA) of the lung, being reported in [36]. It consists of 181 tissue samples (31 corresponds to MPM samples and 150 to ADCA) and each one is described by 12,533 genes. The Affymetrix ID for the prostate cancer microarray is hgu95a and the R package “hgu95a.db” [37] was used to manage and preprocess biological information related to this microarray.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

In this paper, a novel two-step methodology is applied in a strategy based on the use of GA with the addition of biological information, with the aim of obtaining a robust subset of features with high prediction capabilities. The first stage uses a filtering approach based on the KEGG database to retain those features representing enzymes and to establish a ranking for the different pathways available. The second stage implements the feature selection procedure, executing a GA for each of the best ranked pathways.

A high level description of our methodology approach is shown in Fig. 1
                         as well as a brief pseudocode of the algorithm is described in Algorithm 1. It is important to highlight the choice of a BCV strategy to obtain an accuracy measure on both stages of our approach because it has been previously demonstrated in [23,24] its good behavior under estimating misclassification error with small samples, as is the particular case of DNA microarray datasets. In concrete, the developed procedure executes a 50 bootstrap resampling and 5-k-fold validation techniques. Therefore, this approach tries to, on one hand, discover a robust subset of features with biological relevance on the studied disorder; on the other hand, good generalization rates in the prediction stage are essential to determine the probability of suffering from a specific condition.

Several pathways involved in the studied disorder are represented in a DNA Affymetrix chip. On this stage, our approach sets a prediction ability for each pathway on two ways: first, by obtaining an accuracy measure representing the capability of the genes of every pathway to generalize the problem; and second, by doing a text mining procedure searching for some keywords that may appear on the description of a pathway.

Statistical analysis were performed using R,
                              5

                              5
                            in particular those R packages mentioned in [38,35,37] have been used to obtain the pathways related to the studied diseases (Leukemia, Prostate and Lung). Each pathway is scored by the generalization rate after filtering features of the dataset keeping only those genes that are contained in the pathway and giving them as input to a classifying model. Furthermore, a text mining procedure is executed for each pathway in order to localize those pathways that may be more correlated to the studied disorder. Table 1
                            shows the keywords used within this procedure that have been obtain through biological support tools using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA®.

                              6
                           ) Then, the main purpose of the text mining process is to analyze the content of the webpages of each pathway and to search on it for some keywords. As a result, those pathways containing a higher number of keywords would lead us to think that are more correlated to the studied disease.

GAs are a class of optimization procedure inspired by the biological mechanisms of reproduction. In this kind of optimization problems, a fitness function 
                              
                                 f
                                 (
                                 x
                                 )
                              
                            should be maximized or minimized over a given space X of arbitrary dimension. On this stage of our approach, the most promising pathways are selected according to the prediction ability and the number of keywords found on the text mining procedure. A GA is executed for each of these pathways in order to find a robust feature subset selection taking into account biological information, preponderating the activation of genes included in the studied pathway without discarding the selection of the rest of genes.

A simple encoding scheme to represent as much as possible of the available information was employed, in which the chromosome is a string of bits whose length is determined by the total number of genes. Each variable is associated with one bit in the string. If the ith bit is active (value 1), then the ith gene is selected in the chromosome. Otherwise, a value of 0 indicates that the corresponding feature is ignored. In this way, each chromosome represents a different feature subset. Both, the active features and the number of them are generated randomly. In all the experiments, the population size of 100 individuals was used and the number of active features for a certain chromosome limited to 100, thus generating chromosomes representing signatures of few genes.

A selection strategy based on roulette wheel and uniform sampling is applied. Additionally, the E best chromosomes should be retained for the next generation. The E parameter is called elite count or sometimes referred as reproduction operator 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          p

                               (probability of the retained chromosomes in the population, between 0 and 1), since involves the insertion of a copy of a chromosome in the next generation. Scattered crossover, in which each bit of the offspring is chosen randomly, was the choice for combining parents of the previous generation. The crossover rate

                               can be found in the interval

                              , with values close to 1. In addition to that, a traditional mutation operator which flips a specific bit with a probability rate of

                               is considered. Usually, the mutation rate is rather lower than the crossover rate [39]. A modification which involves mutating a random number of bits between 1 and the number of active features of the individual is introduced. Since it was empirically verified that the best subsets include few features, this change avoids the increment on the number of active features in the last generations of the GA. Furthermore, the activation of those genes included in the studied pathway is prioritized without discarding the activation of the rest of genes. On the same way, the deactivation of genes not included in the pathway is prioritized without discarding the deactivation of genes that are present on the studied pathway. The following rule needs to be satisfied:

The fitness function assesses each chromosome in the population so that it may be ranked against all the other chromosomes. The main goal of feature subset selection is to use less features to achieve the same or better performance that provides more biological relevance for the studied disease. Therefore, the fitness function should contain three terms, so for a certain chromosome x to be analyzed, the function to be minimized is represented as follows:

The accuracy rate (ACC) in Eq. (1) is obtained after the application of a classification algorithm to the datasets. We have considered in this work two standard and well-known classifiers: a low complexity method named Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [40], whose aim is to find a linear combination of features which separates two or more classes of patterns; and Support Vector Machines (SVM), a more sophisticated method that find the optimal separation margin between two classes, and which has been widely used in microarray analysis [41,42].

Furthermore, since determining a robust gene signature to predict outcome disease can be considered as a feature selection problem, the authors also include a performance comparative analysis between the proposed strategy and three filter methods commonly used to do variable selection: ReliefF [43], extension of the original Relief algorithm [44] which works by randomly sampling an instance from the data and then locating its nearest neighbor from the same and opposite class; Consistency-based Filter (Cons) [45], which evaluates the worth of a subset of features by the level of consistency in the class values when the training instances are projected onto the subset of attributes; and Information Gain (IG) [46], which provides an ordered ranking of all the features and then a threshold is required.

This section shows the results of our approach on three selected data sets, Leukemia, Lung and Prostate. Table 2
                      outlines the result of evaluating and sorting each pathway by its predictive ability, following the scheme shown in Section 2.2.1. The ranking of the pathways in terms of this predictive ability (fifth column) is indicated in the first column. Columns 2, 3 and 4 contain information on the analyzed pathway, such as its code, description and number of genes. The last two columns show the number of keywords and keywords found after the text mining procedure for each database. This information provides an idea of the relationship between the pathway and the disease, based on the number of keywords found. The first ten pathways are listed, although, in some cases, pathways in lower positions in the ranking are added due to its influence with the disease, which is measured by the number of keywords (pathway 04062 in Leukemia and pathway 05215 in Prostate). The list of keywords used can be found in Table 1. The selected pathways, in bold in Table 2, are analyzed in the next phase of our methodology described in Section 2.2.2. This selection is carried out taking into account the predictive capacity and number of keywords of each pathway.

Before applying our methodology based on genetic algorithms, it is necessary to estimate the parameters related to the selection, mutation and crossover operators referred in Section 2.2.2. For this, the standard genetic algorithm (GA), which is quite common in the literature, is considered as the reference strategy and use as comparative framework for the parameter estimation procedure. This estimation is carry out by analyzing the Leukemia dataset, and different combinations of the

It is possible to observe that the differences in the accuracy rates for each parameter combination are not statistically significant, which implies that, for these cancer datasets, any combination of parameters can be chosen. Specifically, the authors have selected the parameters

Different evolutionary strategies are considered for comparing the results. The first one, the standard GA, whose objective is to minimize the number of genes and training error of the classification model for each combination of genes. As a second strategy a two-stage approach named (Filter+GA) is included. Initially, a filter based on biological information which selects those genes considered as enzymes (KEGG database) is applied. It is important to note that no information about the class (relapse or not) is used to carry out the filtering process, unlike other statistical techniques such as CFS (Correlation-based Feature Selection) [47], mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) [48] or Relief [44]. Thus, for Leukemia database, we move from 7129 to 3413 genes, for Lung from 12,533 to 5470 variables, and Prostate from 12,600 to 5489, obtaining a reduction of the 50% of the total. Subsequently, over the reduced set of features a standard genetic algorithm is applied. The aim is to check if the selection of relevant information from a biological point of view can guide the search for solutions with greater predictive capacity. Finally, we have many strategies as pathways selected in the first phase of the methodology, naming the strategies (Filter+GA+Pathway 
                        
                           code
                        
                     ). In this case, the standard genetic algorithm is modified to give advantage to the genes of the pathway analyzed, using the techniques discussed in Section 2.2.2.

According to the classification models to be used in the fitness function of the proposed strategies, the authors have considered to carry out the simulations by applying both LDA and SVM classifiers. Since LDA has no parameters, no adjustment has been required. On the other hand, for the SVM method, a grid search strategy is applied for finding optimal parameter values for each of the fifty resampling for each cancer dataset, and is performed before the genetic algorithm. The tentative parameters to be selected are, namely: the kernel type, t
                     ={linear, polynomial, radial base function, sigmoid}, cost, Co
                     ={1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15}, degree, d
                     ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, gamma, g
                     ={0.001, 0.005, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3, 5} and coef0, r
                     ={0, 1, 2}. It should be noted that not all the parameters are required for each kernel type. For further information please visit [49].


                     Table 4
                      shows a comparison of the results after applying different strategies. The first three columns show the classification method, the dataset and the strategy used. The fourth column represents the number of genes, on average, after executing the method fifty resamplings and five repetitions for each resampling. Robustness column in Table 2 indicates the average frequency of the most selected genes, which are those that appear more than 5% of the time in any of the solutions. The last column shows the result of prediction of the disease over a test set not used during all the process.

The accuracy results for the LDA method are, in general, slightly better than those obtained by applying SVM, although LDA has lower complexity. This is not surprising since it has been shown before that simpler classification techniques can lead to competitive or even better results [50]. Therefore, the following analysis done to extract the most significant genes for each cancer dataset is conducted only with the LDA classifier, since it provides a better accuracy rate, does not require any parameter setting, and is a simple and fast classification method. Additionally, note that the objective of the present work is not the comparison of different classification algorithms, but the extraction of robust feature subsets with potential biological relevance. It is remarkable that the use of biological knowledge by means of the pathways (information obtained from the KEGG database) more related to the analyzed diseases improves the GA strategy in all three data sets, being this improvement statistically significant in two of them (Leukemia and Lung).

The statistical test used to determine this significant difference involves a balanced two-way ANOVA followed by a multiple comparison procedure with a Bonferroni correction (p-value=0.05). Thus, for Leukemia dataset, selected genes with the strategies based on the pathways 04640, 05340 and 04662 provide a better prediction than the reference strategy (GA). Furthermore, the incorporation of biological information improves the robustness, in the sense that there is less variability in the final subset of selected genes after executing several times the algorithm. In the case of the Lung database the strategies with pathways 04144 and 04530 also improve the forecast of the standard genetic algorithm.

The authors also compared the performance of some well-known methods to do feature selection (Cons, IG and ReliefF) regards to the “Filter+GA+Pathway” combined strategy. Table 5
                      shows the ACC for the best solution obtained by the combined strategy and the methods Cons, IG and ReliefF, all of them by using LDA and SVM classifiers on the three analyzed datasets. The “Filter+GA+Pathway” strategy equalizes or outperforms the feature selection methods in terms of prediction accuracy, but with the advantage of incorporating some biological knowledge about the dynamic of the disease. Regarding the number of selected genes, the Cons method behaves very aggressive and extracts a very small set as significant genes, whereas IG and ReliefF, as ranked methods, provide sorted solutions with a higher number of genes that makes necessary to establish a cut-off criteria (
                        
                           N
                           /
                           8
                        
                      with N as the sample size to retain a similar number of genes regarding to the other strategies).

Not only is it important to analyze the robustness and prediction of the solutions for each strategy. Another aspect to consider is the choice of genes in the selected feature subsets. So, those strategies whose solutions include more genes of the pathway analyzed indicate that this pathway may have a greater influence on the disease. This information is shown in Fig. 2
                      for the selected pathways for each dataset as a ratio, where the closer to one the greater number of genes in the pathway are in the solutions obtained. Thus, in the Leukemia dataset the strategies of pathways 05340 (Primary immunodeficiency) and 04640 (Hematopoietic cell lineage) include many of those genes from these pathways, which may imply that its relationship with Leukemia disease could be significant. In fact, the biological meaning of both pathways seems to be highly related to leukemia. Other important pathways in relation to the disease are found in the same Fig. 2, such as the 04610 and 04530 for Lung database and the 00480 pathway for Prostate.


                     Tables 6–8
                     
                     
                      present the ten most selected genes for the six pathways considered for each database, where each pathway is represented in a row of the table. The selection in our two-step approach does not take into account up- or down-regulation. This implies that, after the analysis, the user must look at the original data to know the sense of regulation. The first three columns show information about the gene, such as the internal index (ID), the gene symbol (name of the gene although it is not unique) and the probe set ID, which is related to the chip where the database has been extracted (e.g., Affymetrix). The bar graph of the last column represents the frequency of selection (fourth column) of each feature in the generated solutions. Blue color indicates that the gene belongs to the pathway analyzed; cyan color which the gene belongs to another of the selected pathway; and gray color assumes the gene does not belong to any of the analyzed pathways. A higher frequency of selection might imply a higher relevance of the gene in the prognosis of the disease.

It should be highlighted that the genes of the analyzed pathway are stimulated to be selected. However, they are discarded if its prediction ability of the disease (together with the remaining selected genes) is poor. Therefore, those genes which are selected out of the pathway and are rather frequent, could be considered as relevant genes associated with the prognosis of the disease.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS@&#

The authors have analyzed in this work three cancer data sets using a combined approach of genetic algorithms and biological relevant information, in order to obtain a robust feature subset selection with good performance rates. The approach incorporates a novel feature scoring method within the GA, taking into account biological information about proteins (mostly enzymes) involved in the pathways of the studied disorders. The most remarkable finding is that our proposal improves the standard GA strategy regardless of the classification model used (LDA or SVM) in the three analyzed data sets (Table 4, Accuracy column), leading to statistically significant results in two of them (Leukemia and Lung). Even more important from the biological and clinic point of view, the robustness, in terms of the most selected genes that can be used to define gene signatures, is also improved in all three analyzed databases (Table 4, Robustness column). The main consequence of both facts is that the results of a KEGG-improved GA can provide more repetitive and consistent results that will facilitate the definition of gene signatures for further clinical diagnostic and prognostic. Moreover, the comparative analysis done among the KEGG-improved GA (Table 5) and three alternative filter methods (Cons, IG and ReliefF) demonstrated a similar or higher performance of the KEGG-improved GA, with the additional benefit of the biological information about the disease dynamics provided by this new GA-based strategy.

Regarding the summarizing results of Fig. 3
                      it can be seen that the best placed pathways in Table 4 provide more accurate and robust results. This opens the possibility of a deeper study of which KEGG-pathway(s) provide(s) the better results for any disease dataset. It should be noted that those feature subsets that include more genes of the analyzed pathways analyzed might indicate that this particular pathway has a greater biological impact on the disease.

But the proposed KEGG-improved GA not only can be used for diagnostic and prognostic, but also for biological knowledge discovery about the disease. Regarding the most remarkable genes of Tables 6–8 that even not originally present in the selected pathways, form part of the final selection thus playing an important role for obtaining robust and accurate prediction results. For example, in Table 6 (Leukemia set), the gene ZYX

                        7
                      is repetitively selected in all but one pathways; it codes zyxin, a adhesion plaque protein that prompts the formation of actin-rich structures at which signal transduction assemble. In the case of the lung database (Table 7), several adhesion pathways are involved in this cancer (cf., 04530, 04514) while the ZYX gene does not seem to be significant. The gene SEMA3C

                      corresponds to a semaphorin, a protein including an inmunoglobulin domain. It seems to play an important role in the regulation of developmental processes and axon growing. Its presence suggests that pathways 04360 and others should be considered for future analysis. Also, gene ALDH1A2

                      is related to an aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme that synthesises retinoic acid (RA) from retinaldehyde. RA is a hormonal signaling molecule that functions in developing and adult tissues and has been involved in spina bifida. As a result, might high levels of RA be involved in lung cancer? Gene GFPT2

                      corresponds to D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, an enzyme involved in regulating the availability of precursors for N- and O-linked glycosylation of proteins. Protein glycosilation might be affected in lung cancer, and thus it deserves further analysis. PTGIS,

                      although selected only in two pathways, is a prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin) synthase, a protein of cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, involved in the synthesis of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation that is also related to myocardial infarction, stroke, and atherosclerosis, and thus could be also involved in lung cancer.

As an overall conclusion, the results obtained suggest the important role that the incorporation of biological information might play for carrying out a robust feature selection procedure for cancer (and may be any other disease) diagnostic. Moreover, this may open the way to use GA for the prognosis of cancer diseases in a near future, a clinical aspect that is still concerning most oncologist and cancer patients.
