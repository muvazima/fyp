                     Background: The skin is the largest organ and is subject to the greatest exposure to outside elements throughout one׳s lifetime. Current data by the American Academy of Dermatology suggests that approximately ten people die each hour worldwide due to skin related conditions. Cancers such as melanoma are growths that originate in the epidermis. Therefore, an accurate and non-invasive method to estimate skin constitutive elements can play an important clinical role in detecting the early onset of skin tumors. It can also serve as a valuable tool for research and development in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals in general.
                  
                     Methods: In our prior work, we developed a method that combined a physics-based model of human skin with machine learning and Hyperspectral imaging to non-invasively estimate physiological skin parameters, including melanosomes, collagen, oxygen saturation, and blood volume. In this work, we extend that model to also estimate skin thickness. Moreover, for the first time, we develop a protocol to test our methodology for skin thickness estimation using Ultrasound to acquire a gold standard dataset.
                  
                     Results: We tested our methodology for skin thickness estimation on a dataset of 48 Hyperspectral signatures obtained in vivo from six patients under IRB at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We found mean absolute errors on the order of the Ultrasound resolution (i.e., our gold standard).
                  
                     Discussion: This is the first study of its kind to validate skin thickness estimates using a gold standard. Our preliminary results constitute a proof-of-concept that hyperspectral-based methods can accurately and non-invasively estimate skin thickness in clinical settings.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The study of human skin and its related properties has now been an active area of research for many decades. There is a plurality of work that ranges from biophysical modeling of skin, to non-invasive diagnostics of skin related conditions [9,10]. Applications of skin studies span from cancer research, pharmaceuticals, drug delivery, and cosmetics [1]. In addition, there is a significant research interest in designing non-invasive methods for rapidly and accurately estimating the components and properties of human skin. Various research groups have suggested that longitudinal studies of skin components are vital to not only characterizing etiology, and understanding pathophysiology, but also detecting the onset of cancerous tumors [7].

In this paper we discuss a generalized method that is capable of estimating the underlying parameters of human skin. One of these parameters, the skin thickness, is very important in understanding a number of pathologies. Unfortunately, the current method for estimating thickness requires one to excise a sample of skin through a biopsy and then study it under a microscope [8]. This method is not ideal when it needs to be repeated for multiple sites, and possibly multiple sessions. Non-invasively estimating skin thickness is very challenging because skin varies a great deal from one anatomical location to another. It also varies based on ethnicity, environmental factors, and age, amongst others. While many researchers have proposed methods for estimating skin thickness, they seldom have access to any gold standard. In such cases the best that can be done is to assess the physiological plausibility of estimated parameters. Such a benchmarking methodology cannot truly assess the accuracy of the estimation.

Our own prior work includes [16–19], where we used support vector machines coupled with a Kubelka–Munk (K-M) based biophysical models of human skin. This method was used to estimate melanosomes, collagen, blood volume (each as percentage by volume), and oxygen saturation (as a percentage). It, however, assumed that the thickness of skin was constant, and was hence not estimated. Our biophysical model was based on work by Nunez [12] who developed a model which related the components of skin to a multi-band reflectance spectra. Prior work in this area also includes that of Yudovsky and Pilon [20] who developed a two-layer model and an inverse method based on radiative transfer equations to estimate melanin, epidermal thickness, and oxygen saturation. We differ from that work in that we go beyond measuring epidermal thickness and estimate the total thickness as well as all other skin parameters. In addition, Pilon et al. compared their skin thickness estimation to tabulated values from literature. This is appropriate to determine if the estimates are physiologically plausible, but is insufficient to judge the accuracy of the method because the true estimates for the patients are not available. In that regard, in this study we have access to physician-made gold standard, and hence can directly compute the accuracy of our method. Finally, Claridge and Preece [6,13] developed a method based on optimizing a set of filters that map digital images and histological parameters. That work estimated the dermal thickness, however it measured the error between the RGB and the optimal filters (not raw parameters). For additional reviews of past work in this area, the reader is referred to our prior study in [16], and to other thorough reviews of K–M models by Baranoski et al. [2], and a review of optical properties of skin by Cheong et al. [5].

The novel features of the study presented herein includes

                           We extend our previous biophysical model to estimate the thickness for 5 strata and 4 dermises of human skin.

We acquire Ultrasound (US) sequences corresponding to each hyperspectral signature, from which we derive physician-generated gold standard for the skin thicknesses.

We perform a sensitivity analysis with regard to the number of bands used.

@&#METHODS@&#

In this study we extend our previous biophysical model [18,19] and the one developed by Nunez [12]. This model has 10 layers: layers 1–5 represent the strata of human skin; these layers are: stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. Layers 6–9 are the dermises; these layers are: papillary dermis, upper blood net dermis, reticular dermis, and deep blood net dermis. Layer 10 is the subcutaneous tissue layer. As described before [18,19] it is assumed that the subcutaneous layer is infinitely thick because, it allows for the assumption that there is no transmittance through it.

Skin is composed of seven biological parameters, including melanosome concentration (p
                        
                           m
                        ), collagen concentration (p
                        
                           c
                        ), O2-saturation (p
                        
                           bo
                        ), blood volume (p
                        
                           bv
                        ), skin thickness (p
                        
                           st
                        ), water volume (p
                        
                           wl
                        ), and subcutaneous reflectance (p
                        
                           sr
                        ). The first five parameters in the list are estimated in our method, but the focus of this paper is on the estimation and validation of each layer׳s thickness, i.e., p
                        
                           st
                        . The latter two parameters are omitted, as described later in this section. Each of the layers of skin used in the model, as well as the parameters׳ physiological ranges are tabulated in Table 1
                        .

In order to make the model tractable, the following assumptions (as described by Nunez [12]) are made: First, each layer is assumed to have similar optical properties, and homogeneous absorption and scattering coefficients. The concentration of each parameter is the same for all the layers (each layer is assumed to contain a uniform distribution of melanosomes, collagen, blood, and water.) Water percentage by volume (p
                        
                           wl
                        ) is assumed known and fixed for each layer (based on Meglinski and Matcher [11]) and hence not estimated. Each layer of skin is assumed to have a particular percentage of water, which is found based on empirically derived values tabulated in [11]. Blood is assumed to be uniformly distributed in the dermis layers (rather than in differing concentrations for each layer) and zero in the strata. The parameter p
                        
                           sr
                         is an internal model parameter that does not have any physiological meaning. Therefore, it is omitted from further discussion. The model is assumed to be Lambertian with uniform bidirectional reflection. The model further assumes that the chromophores are distributed equally in the layers. The reflectance and transmittance of light through these layers of skin are determined based on Kubelka–Munk Theory, described next.

When light interacts with skin, it can take one of four paths, as is illustrated in Fig. 1
                        : (1) it reflects off the top of the layer, (2) it reflects off the bottom of the layer, (3) it is absorbed by the layer, or (4) it continues along its path without being reflected. It is then clear that the total reflectance between any two layers is the sum of all of these paths. Note that the reflection and transmission are given by

                           (

                           )
                        , for each wavelength λ. These are computed by using the Kubelka–Munk equations [12] as

In addition to using the Kubelka–Munk equations, we also use the Fresnel equation, as detailed by Nunez [12]. Since human skin has uniform bidirectional reflection, Nunez assumes that light incident on the skin surface is always normal to the surface. This allows us to use the Fresnel equation to describe the amount of reflection that is normal to the interface separating the skin from air. The equation is based on the tabulated indices of refraction for air and the stratum corneum (skin Layer 1), given by η
                        
                           air

                           sc
                         respectively. The Fresnel reflection FR is then given by

Light being reflected off the surface of the skin is actually made up of light coming from each path leaving a skin layer, as well as the Fresnel reflection. In other words, the total fraction of light leaving each layer i is the product of (i) the Fresnel transmittance, (ii) transmittance of all the layers it had to go through in order to reach layer i, (iii) the reflectance of the layer i (the model assumes an infinitely thick bottom layer, and therefore has pure reflectance), (iv) the transmittance of all the layers it must once again traverse in order to reach the top, and finally (v) the Fresnel transmittance. Note that the transmittance from layer 1 to layer i is the same as the journey back from layer i to layer 1.

Using this methodology, the total reflectance and transmittance between any two interfaces is the sum of all reflectance paths (see steps 1–4 above) and the transmittance and reflectance it accrues from its journey (see steps i–v above). This is given by

The final step is to iterate the quantities in Eq. (6) for all optical layers 1 through N=

                         and t
                        
                           i
                         are inherently linked to the thickness of the layer. In addition, as described, the absorption and scattering coefficients given by β
                        
                           n

                           n
                         are linked to the other skin chromophore concentrations, i.e. collagen, melanosomes, etc. It is noteworthy that the quantity 
                           
                              
                                 R

                         is the hyperspectral reflectance signature that one would expect to collect in a lab from a hyperspectral imager, or a spectrometer. In addition, Eq. (1) shows that R
                        
                           i
                        , which is linked to r
                        
                           i
                         and t
                        
                           i
                        , is linked to d
                        
                           n
                        , i.e. the thickness of each layer, and each of the other skin parameters (e.g., melanin) through K
                        
                           n
                         and β
                        
                           n
                        . Therefore, the reflectance signature is related to the biological parameters of the interface being imaged. This is the rationale for the forward and inverse methods that are now discussed.

It was shown in the previous section that the skin hyperspectral reflectance signature is directly tied to the skin thickness (and other skin parameters). Therefore, we can say that there exists a mapping that expresses this relationship:

We are interested in solving the inverse problem, i.e. given the hyperspectral signature s collected clinically, we seek to estimate the parameters of each layer, i.e. 
                           {

                           }
                        . This is the inverse model that can be expressed as follows:
                           
                              (9)
                              
                                 G
                                 :
                                 s
                                 →
                                 p
                              
                           
                        Machine regression is a natural choice for estimating G because we can leverage the abundance of training data provided by the forward model F. In particular, we use F to instantiate a dense labeled database of parameters and corresponding signatures which is used to train a regression engine. This is described in greater detail in the Experiments section of this article.

In this work, we estimate G by using Support Vector Regression (SVR) [14]. There are several benefits to SVR including (1) generalizability, (2) avoids over-fitting, (3) no assumptions made about the distribution of data and (4) SVR leverages kernels for non-linearities. SVR is implemented in Matlab (Natick, MA) as well as several open source platforms including OpenCV and LibSVM [4].

We now provide a brief overview of SVR and refer the reader interested in additional mathematical details to Smola and Scholkopf [14]. Each component of p is a scalar, and it must be regressed independently of the other scalars parameters. Therefore, we can decouple the regression problem into h regression subproblems, where h is the number of components of p. We start with a training set of the form: 
                           {
                           (

                        , with an added offset b. The support vectors define parallel hyperplanes that lie on either side of the optimal margin (the boundary that optimally separates the data). The support vectors and the weights are found by maximizing an objective function which asserts that all the training data lie within a margin of the regression function. We use a “soft margin” SVR to allow some data points to violate the margin, provided the violation is smaller than a threshold, a process which allows some degree of robustness to the presence of outliers. This is accomplished using a constrained optimization method involving the Lagrange function and its associated Lagrange multipliers,

                        . This is why the support vectors are not the optimal boundary, but rather lie parallel to the optimal margin. A kernel dot product is used to account for non-linearities. For this study, we use the LibSVM [4] implementation of SVR in Matlab R2012b. The full derivation of the SVR technique is a classical result which is omitted in this paper and the reader is henceforth referred to the work by Vapnik et al.

Ultrasound (US) uses acoustic waves with frequencies in the Megahertz (MHz) range. A typical medical ultrasound imaging system operates in the 4–10MHz range. US imaging, or ultrasonography, at a high level, works by generating a sound wave using piezoelectric elements encased within a transducer. These sound waves enter the body and are selectively attenuated by tissues, bones, etc., and return back to the transducer in the form of echoes. These echoes are sensed and converted into electrical impulses by the transducer׳s piezoelectric elements and then formed into a digital image. This process can occur in 2D, 3D, or 4D (3D volume + time).

One of the many advantages of US includes the fact that it is real time; an operator can adjust the probe dynamically and scan different areas based on what he/she would like to image. More importantly, US is quite apt at imaging soft tissues, muscles, and bones, and in particular is very good at delineating the boundary between these tissue types. This is important for our application because it makes it easy to delineate the boundary between skin, and muscle. Fig. 3 show examples of several US scans acquired in vivo. Notice the clear delineations between different skin layers and tissue types. Therefore, given an US scan of an anatomical location, a trained physician can clearly indicate and measure the thickness of skin or some other anatomical feature (as shown for example in Fig. 3).

The particular Ultrasound system we used in this study was the Ultrasonix SonixTablet (Analogic Ultrasound, MA, USA). The SonixTablet is an all-in-one portable Ultrasound system capable of high-resolution and real-time imaging. In this study, we used the 1D L14-5/38 GPS Linear US probe, which has a frequency of 10MHz, resulting in scans with a depth of 4cm, at a rate of 25 frames per second, and an expanded image field of 16mm. This results in a spatial resolution of approximately 0.08mm/pixel. The US images were acquired and annotated by the physician on our team; the scheme and methodology are described in Section 3.

The methods were tested on a separate testing dataset. This dataset was compiled by hyperspectral imaging of six patients in vivo. All data was collected under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine. The data was collected using an ASD LabSpec 4 Spectrometer with wavelengths ranging from 450nm to 1800nm. During the spectral signature acquisition, the probe was positioned perpendicular to the skin and light was shone in a 10mm diameter. The acquisition time was approximately 100ms.

We collected data from six patients spanning various ethnicities, ages, and skin types. In particular, we systematically collected data from eight anatomical locations, four from each side of the body: dorsal forearm, upper inner arm, calf, and cheek. For each of these locations, the ASD Spectrometer generated a reflectance signature as a function of wavelength; Fig. 6 contains two examples of measured signatures in the clinic. This resulted in a set of 48 hyperspectral signatures:

Finally, in order to validate our methods, we also acquired ultrasound sequences under the same IRB from the same patients, from the exact same anatomical locations (using the system described in Section 2.4). Therefore, we create an equivalent dataset with ultrasound sequences given by US

In order to use the Validation Dataset, the physician on our team (Dr. J. Meyerle) annotated the US sequences; the US images were marked and the thickness was computed. This was then effectively used as gold standard because skin is visible in the sequences, and a medical expert can use it to ascertain the thickness by delineating the boundary between skin and subcutaneous fat. An example of such an annotation is included in Fig. 3.

A flowchart of the experimental protocol is provided in Fig. 2
                        , and is summarized in this section. In order to use the machine learning based method, we needed to first train the regression engine. We used the methodology outlined in Section 2.3 in order to accomplish this. We showed in our prior work that the forward model F was robust at estimating a hyperspectral signature given it׳s underlying constitutive components, i.e., given p, we could generate a robust estimate for s using F. Therefore, we used F to generate a vast training dataset; we sampled each component of p uniformly and then used F to generate a corresponding signature s. This led to labeled data, and hence it was used by SVR to learn a mapping from physiological parameters to spectral signatures. For the thickness parameter, we sampled each layer of skin as was detailed in Table 1; the other parameters were sampled uniformly at intervals of 0.02 percent per volume. This yielded a total of 325,000 training examples. Once we had trained the regression engine, we used the signatures from the Testing Dataset, and the inverse mapping G to estimate the underlying components

As an example of the output from G, Fig. 6 shows the original HSI signature plotted alongside the signature obtained via the machine learning method. In other words, the HSI parameters estimated by G were forward mapped using F to produce an “estimated” HSI signature, corresponding to the signature whose parameters we sought to infer. If the mapping G is robust, then we should expect accurate estimates of the parameters, and if F is robust, then we should be able to use those estimates and re-create the original signature. Notice that the estimated and the measured signatures are very similar, implying that the method presented here is robust. Furthermore, the estimated parameters for each of the traces are as follows:

                         for the plot on the right of Fig. 6. Notice that these parameters are all well within the physiological range for humans (see Table 1 for the acceptable ranges for each parameter). This is further validation that the machine learning method is robust.
                     

For error analysis, we computed the average absolute error, and the standard deviation (SD) between the machine learning estimated thicknesses (from hyperspectral),

                        .

Next we analyze if there is a strong correlation between the thickness estimated by the hyperspectral imaging methodology, and the reference gold standard prepared by the Physician. We first compute the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, and then perform a t-test. Our experiment is setup as follows:

                        ). This result suggests that there is a very strong correlation between the machine learning estimated skin parameters and the physician estimated parameters. The t-statistic suggests that the probability of erroneously finding a strong correlation by chance is close to zero.

In the hyperspectral image processing community, signatures are rarely used without some form of pre-processing. One common pre-processing technique is usually a dimensionality reduction using an algorithm like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The idea of dimensionality reduction stems from the fact that having too many dimensions can often confuse classification algorithms as the methods attempt to account for all the dimensions and hence results in a noisy decision boundary. If we only consider the salient dimensions that contain the most information, we are more likely to yield better results.

In this work, we used the ASD LabSpec 4 Spectrometer, which resulted in hyperspectral signatures in the range 450nm to 1800nm, hence a total of 1351 bands. Since we have a gold standard dataset we wanted to investigate the role of the number of bands on the accuracy of the estimation methodology. If a smaller number of bands is able to produce relatively the same performance as the 1351 bands, then we could greatly reduce both the processing time and the cost of the system. As such, we performed sensitivity analysis to determine how much error is introduced as the number of bands are reduced.

In order to perform this sensitivity analysis, we used a technique known as band decimation. We do not want to simply drop or remove bands because that can result in a great deal of information loss. Rather, we use a scheme where at each decimation interval, the bands are averaged together, i.e., down-sampled. For example, a decimation by a factor of two would average every two bands together resulting in half the total number of bands. We assume that the “error” for the full 1351 bands is taken as the reference (zero), and all other errors are computed relative to that mark. This was repeated for all 48 samples, and the results were averaged together. A plot of the findings is provided in Fig. 5

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Our results presented in Table 2 and Fig. 4 show that the accuracy of the skin thickness estimation methodology is promising. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to compare the estimated parameters to a gold standard, i.e., “ground truth.” In our previous study [16], we demonstrated that our method was reliable in the way it estimated parameters such as melanin and collagen, but we did not have access to ground truth and hence had to rely on physiological precepts in order to assess plausibility for the skin parameter estimates. This has also been the case for other recent studies reported in Section 1, which try to tease out skin parameters from hyperspectral measurements. In this study, however, we have ground truth, and we can therefore directly evaluate the accuracy of our method. Given the results in this study, our hypothesis is that our methodology holds promise for a potential deployment in clinical settings for estimating the skin thickness. However, additional work needs to be done in order to validate this hypothesis on a larger dataset consisting of joint hyperspectral and ultrasound measurements, an endeavor which we intend to pursue in the future. It should be noted that in future studies other surrogate measures such as the modified Allen׳s test [3] can also be used for validating parameters such as hemoglobin oxygenation, rather than relying on precept analysis. However, the main focus of this manuscript is the estimation of the skin thickness.

While the results in this article are promising for estimating skin thickness, it must be noted that these results and associated significance tests were performed for the total skin interface. The physician on our team did not mark each individual dermis and strata, and therefore we can only report errors for the full skin interface. Evidently, it need not be true that just because the total interface estimate is accurate and significant, that the estimates for each layer also be accurate and significant. However, it is unlikely that those estimates would not follow a similar accuracy trend. Nonetheless, care needs to be taken in interpreting the results in this study because of this particular fact.

An important consideration regarding the machine learning estimate is that of uniqueness. The algorithm is deterministic given a training dataset; we will always obtain the same weights and support vectors given a training dataset. However, this by no means implies that the solution is unique. A future study could involve varying the training dataset, and observing how the resulting performance is changed. For now, we provide a statistical significance test in the paper. Nonetheless, a limitation of the method lies in the fact that if the training dataset is changed (e.g., a new instance is added), the resulting parameters estimates may change, albeit to a modest extent.

Our US system is operating at a frequency that leads to a spatial resolution of 0.08mm/pixel. For dermatology applications, the resolution of the US platform and probe used in this study is adequate to delineate the boundaries of skin tissues (as presented in Fig. 3), and hence serves as an appropriate gold standard considering this is a first endeavor in this type of cross modality validation. The US resolution, in particular, is over an order of magnitude better (about 30 times smaller) when compared to typical skin depths. Our errors reported relative to the depth measured by the US are of the order of 3%, i.e., about the US resolution. Future studies should consider the use of higher resolution sensors including working with US at higher frequencies or exploring the use of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).

Another limitation of this study lies in the fact that only one physician was used to create the gold standard. As such, it is not possible to characterize inter-operator error. However, while resources were not available in this study to allow for multiple physicians to annotate the images, in our opinion, this study׳s results still remain an important step in elucidating the possibility of correctly estimating the skin physiological parameters using the reported method, especially since this constitutes the first study of its kind to perform an analysis with gold standard. Unlike other applications where it is much more difficult to delineate the boundaries of anatomical features, a skilled dermatologist can quite robustly mark the images, as described previously (see examples provided in Fig. 3). Nonetheless, a future endeavor should also strive to characterize if the estimated error is on the order of the inter-operator error.

Finally, it is worth noting that there is a strict reduction of light penetration in the blue region of the EM spectrum. While we obtain modest errors with respect to the gold standard, it is possible that this reduction has some influence on the modeling output. It should, however, be noted that the absorbance profiles in Eqs. (3) and (4), do account for this reduction to some degree. None-the-less, this caveat should be considered; it would be interesting to investigate the influence of this reduction in future studies.

A natural question one could pose regarding the method proposed herein is why perform the machine learning or the modeling if US or OCT can solve the problem. One major point to consider is that our modeling methodology not only estimates skin thickness, but also all the other skin parameters (e.g., melanin, collagen, etc.), therefore, unless a physician is only interested in one skin parameter, US is not the ideal solution. Furthermore, under pathology, it is rarely the case that only one parameter is affected. For example, in melanoma, melanin, blood volume, and dermal thickness are all affected, therefore only analyzing one parameter is not sufficient. Finally, in cases of burns or wounds, the thickness of skin is a critical component needed to better decide how much and where to deliver skin-based drugs. In such cases, contacting the skin with US gel and the probe is not desirable as it could lead to complications and patient discomfort. For these reasons US alone cannot replace hyperspectral imaging for the task of skin parameter estimation. Nonetheless, we do believe that there is need for using other sensors such as OCT in dermatology for other use cases.


                        Fig. 5 contains the results of our sensitivity analysis. As expected, we note that the error associated with the estimation method increases drastically as the number of bands is reduced. However, it is worth noting that even with about half the number of bands, the error is about 15%. An avenue for future work could include determining which bands contain the most information and are hence needed for the estimation. For example, we note that using approximately 1000 bands, i.e., removing approximately 300 bands, only reduces the estimation error by 2%. If the “optimal” bands are selected, we could greatly reduce the number of bands that need to be processed. This would also reduce the cost of the system.

In this study, we collected data from various ethnicities, skin types, and ages, and from four different anatomical locations. However, no analysis was done to determine the effect of each of these factors on the estimation method. While the results are still strong and statistically significant, it would be a fruitful endeavor to determine if our method is sensitive to these factors. This is another potential avenue for future work.

This study currently employs a single point spectroscopic system. The model and the inverse method discussed in this article were implemented in Matlab R2012b (Natick, MA, USA) on a PC with an Intel i3-3225 CPU with 8GB DDR3-1600 RAM. The forward model takes approximately 10h to generate (when run using a single CPU thread; the time reduces linearly with the number of available threads on the CPU). However, note that the forward model only needs to be generated once (for training). The inverse method takes approximately 40s to estimate the parameters for each signature we seek to test. Of course if multi-threading and/or a compiled language such as C++ is used, this estimate can trivially be reduced by at least an order of magnitude. A GPU could also be employed for the SVR step, which would also drastically reduce the computation time.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we developed a fully-automated and non-invasive method based on a biophysical model of human skin and machine learning. We used this method to estimate the constitutive skin parameters, and in particular accurately measured the thickness of human skin. When comparing the results to Ultrasound sequences obtained from the same anatomical locations and annotated by a physician, we found an error on the order of the gold standard (US); this was further supported by our test of statistical significance. This speaks to the efficacy of our method and in comparison to most other studies, provides validation using a gold standard dataset. Overall, this study serves as a promising proof of concept that skin thickness can be estimated non-invasively using hyperspectral imaging in clinical settings.
