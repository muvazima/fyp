                      consists of two different parts – one is the motion of an anti-parallelogram whilst the other one is a pure translation with circular paths. We will refer to this translatoric part in this paper only and demonstrate that this translatoric self-motion has the following property: At any moment the positions of the corresponding four coupler points form quads homothetic to Q. This property can be used to define spatial one-parametric motions of an extruded version of the four-bar mechanism which again generate quads of coupler points homothetic to Q. As the next step we take an arbitrary “saturated chain” of quads in space (each vertex shares a vertex with another quad of the set) and define the corresponding one-parametric spatial motions. Then all can be parametrized by the same parameter t. We will show that these partial motions can be interlinked by spherical 2R-joints without locking the one-parametric self-motion. This way the construction delivers a series of new (overconstrained) mechanisms which generalize results on so-called “Fulleroid” linkages. An example based on four quads in space (in planes of a tetrahedron) is worked out in detail.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The aim of the paper is to generalize the construction of highly overconstrained mechanisms consisting of rigid bodies linked by 1R- or spherical 2R-joints.
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        A 2R-joint is called “spherical” if its two rotary axes intersect in a point.
                      Based on the famous Heureka mechanism and its generalizations (see Stachel, 1991, 1992 and Röschel, 1995, 1996a, 2001) the so-called Fulleroid mechanisms have been studied in the last years by Kiper et al. (2008), Kiper (2008), Wohlhart (1997, 2001, 2007) and Röschel (2010, 2012).

The considerations are based on an observation on special planar four-bar mechanisms: In Section 2 we will define special four-bar mechanisms based on quadrilaterals (quads) and work out an interesting property. In Sections 3 and 4 the planar results are embedded into space and yield further generalizations of the so-called Fulleroid linkages. In Section 5 the results are worked out in detail for a special example based on quads in the faces of a tetrahedron. Section 6 is devoted to the study of bifurcations of the mechanism's self-motions.

                           •
                           Any vertex from the set V is coincident with at least two different quads.

The set interpreted as a framework of vertices and edges of the quads is connected.


                     
                        Remark 4.1
                        This definition is weaker than the usual definition of saturated chains by Harborth and Möller (2007). In our case it would be possible that a vertex belongs to more than two different quads or that two quads share more than one vertex.

                     . As all can be parametrized by the same time-parameter t we have got a one-parametric self-motion of this configuration. Neighboring systems (with their joint vertex within the saturated chain of quads) can be interlinked by spherical 2R-joints without locking the self-motion of the mechanism.

                        The one-parametric self-motion (guaranteed by construction) can physically be confined.
                      The spherical 2R-joint degenerates to a single rotary joint if the two neighbor planes coincide.

In general we get 4n rigid bodies interlinked by 4n rotary joints (1R-joints coming from the rotary joints of the four-bar mechanisms) and 2n spherical 2R-joints (interlinking the four-bar mechanisms). According to the Cebyshev–Grübler–Kutzbach formula the theoretical degree of freedom (see Beyer, 1963, p. 102, and footnote 4) takes on the value

                           The described construction based on any saturated chain of n quads in space yields new mechanisms consisting of 4n rigid bodies linked via 1R- and 2R-joints. Though the classical degree of freedom of these mechanisms in general takes on the value

                        Remark 4.3
                        These new examples can be viewed as generalizations of Fulleroid mechanisms (see Wohlhart, 2007; Kiper, 2008; and Röschel, 2010, 2012).


                     
                        Remark 4.4
                        According to Section 3 the rigid parts of the mechanism perform Darboux-motions with respect to the world-coordinate frame. The relative motions of different bodies are special one-parametric motions studied by the author in Röschel (1996b). In general they are rational of degree 4.

                     Fig. 6
                      displays the mechanism based on the configuration of Fig. 5 at three different positions of its self-motion.

The mechanism presented here consists of 16 rigid (prismatic) bodies which are interlinked by 16 rotary joints and 8 spherical 2R-joints. According to (10) and Theorem 4.2 the theoretical degree of freedom takes on the value 
                        F
                        =
                        −
                        22
                     . As the mechanism admits at least the one-parametric self-motion of our construction it is overconstrained.

The basic quads of the saturated chain from Section 4 define some parallel four-bar mechanisms

                      we can reverse the direction of rotation at that moment. As the corresponding quads of the coupler points do not change (see Remark 2.2) this can be performed without blocking the mechanism.

                        This is a theoretical result. The self-motions of the physical model will be limited by several constraints. It can happen that not all of these theoretical options can really be implemented as bodies may interfere with each other and collide.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The procedure presented here allows to study other new overconstrained mechanisms. Interesting examples could be based on saturated arrangements with a small number of quadrangles (such as for the cube and its affine relatives). Moreover, it would be possible that more than two quads of the chain share one common vertex. These interesting arrangements and the corresponding mechanisms will be subject to future research.
