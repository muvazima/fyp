                  In this work we address a game theoretic variant of the Subset Sum problem, in which two decision makers (agents/players) compete for the usage of a common resource represented by a knapsack capacity. Each agent owns a set of integer weighted items and wants to maximize the total weight of its own items included in the knapsack. The solution is built as follows: Each agent, in turn, selects one of its items (not previously selected) and includes it in the knapsack if there is enough capacity. The process ends when the remaining capacity is too small for including any item left.
                  We look at the problem from a single agent point of view and show that finding an optimal sequence of items to select is an

                  From a centralized perspective we observe that some known results on the approximation of the classical Subset Sum can be effectively adapted to the multi-agent version of the problem.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the computer science literature of the last two decades several classical combinatorial optimization problems have been revisited in a game theoretic setting where multiple deciders take over the role of a single decision maker. This new field of research is receiving growing attention and led to the emergence of algorithmic game theory (Nisan, Roughgarden, Tardos, & Vazirani, 2007).

In this context we address the problem of two agents competing for a shared resource. It can be described as a game theoretic variant of the classical Subset Sum problem, in which there are two players, or agents, called P
                     
                        a
                      and P
                     
                        b
                     , and a given amount c of a shared resource. Each agent owns a set of items with non-negative weights and knows the other agent’s item set, i.e. there is perfect information.

The Subset Sum game works as follows: Starting with P
                     
                        a
                     , the agents take turns to select exactly one of their items which was not selected before. The total weight of all selected items must not exceed the capacity c at any time. The aim of the game is, for each agent, to select a subset of its items with maximum total weight. This problem is new and has not been studied in the literature before. In the following we point out some possible application scenarios.

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

The Subset Sum game is an interesting theoretical problem in its own right as a game theoretic version of the most basic combinatorial optimization problem. Moreover, one can find applications in all scenarios where a limited resource has to be allocated to different and possibly selfish users.

In the general setting of a single-machine scheduling problem two agents may compete for the processing time and want to maximize their utilization of the machine within a given planning horizon by scheduling some of their jobs. To decide in a fair way which jobs to accept for processing, a round-robin mechanism is often the method of choice (see for instance Agnetis, Pacciarelli, & Pacifici, 2007; Auletta, De Prisco, Penna, & Persiano, 2009). It remains for the agents to decide which jobs to submit.

In many communication networks there is the need to allocate bandwidth based on user requests (using, for example, the RSVP-TE protocol Awduche et al., 2001). Consider a single time unit in which two agents (users) have a number of different bandwidth requirements, corresponding to different applications, to be allocated. In a simplified scenario the users are asked to submit their requests with a round-robin discipline and want to maximize their allocated requests. More details on this application domain and related context can be found in the next section.

In a business setting a highly specialized producer, say a much sought-after dress maker, may produce creations for two designers. From a long term business perspective, the producer wants to retain both designers as customers, however, the production capacity up to the given deadline (the fashion show) is limited. Thus, the producer accepts orders alternating between the two designers as long as the production capacity suffices to fulfill the current set of orders. It remains to decide for the designers which creations to submit to this allocation mechanism and which to produce elsewhere with a less desirable producer.

@&#RELATED WORKS@&#

Several problems strictly related to the Subset Sum game have been considered in the literature. In particular, due to its simple structure, the {0,1}-Knapsack problem was frequently considered in a game-theoretic context and will be briefly discussed in Section 5. Recently, (Marini, Nicosia, Pacifici, & Pferschy, 2013; Nicosia, Pacifici, & Pferschy, 2011) considered a knapsack-type scenario with unitary weights in which the decision process is performed in rounds and managed by a central decision mechanism (arbitrator). In every round each of the two agents selects exactly one of its items and submits the item for possible inclusion in the knapsack, then the arbitrator chooses one of the items as “winner” of the round. The winning item is permanently included in the knapsack. The process goes on as long as there is enough capacity. A related problem where jobs are submitted in rounds for selection to be processed on a single machine was recently considered in Agnetis, Nicosia, Pacifici, and Pferschy (in press).

In the so called Knapsack Sharing problem studied by several authors (see for instance Fujimoto & Yamada, 2006; Hifi, M’Hallab, & Sadfi, 2005), a single objective function balancing the profits among the agents is considered in a centralized perspective. Another interesting game, based on the maximum {0,1}-Knapsack, interpreted as a special on-line problem, is addressed in Liberatore (2000) where a two person zero-sum game, called Knapsack Game, is considered. Knapsack problems are also addressed in the context of auctions, see for example (Aggarwal & Hartline, 2006; Brotcorne, Hanafi, & Mansi, 2009).

Kindred problems are the so-called Bin Packing Games. There, one considers k agents representing bins and another n agents representing items of given size. The value function of a coalition of bins and items is the maximum total size of items in the coalition that can be packed into the bins of the coalition. This class of problems was introduced in Faigle and Kern (1993, 1998) where numerous results are provided. The Selfish Bin Packing is another interesting game theoretic variant, where each item is controlled by a selfish agent who pays a cost proportional to the ratio between its own item size and the total weight of the items packed in the same bin. In Epstein and Kleiman (2011), the authors study different equilibria and the associated quality measures, namely Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability.
                           1
                           Surprisingly, the investigation of this problem from a game-theoretic perspective allowed to establish new results on the approximation ratio of a heuristic algorithm for the classical bin packing problem (Epstein, Kleiman, & Mestre, 2009).

A significant application closely related to our problem is the so called Admission Control problem (ACP) which, in a wide sense, refers to the design of mechanisms for managing traffic requests in communication systems (for a comprehensive survey, see for instance (Ahmed, 2005; Ghaderi & Boutaba, 2006)). In bandwidth-managed networks, it is required to evaluate (i) if bandwidth is available to service a new potential user and (ii) the QoS (quality of service) that can be provided to this user. Only if bandwidth is available, the new user is admitted. Clearly, new users can be viewed as selfish users competing for network bandwidth, i.e., resource capacity. In this context, game theory techniques have been used to design management protocols to monitor, control, and enforce the use of shared resources and services in networks. For instance, in Yolken and Bambos (2008) the authors propose pricing schemes influencing users in their decision to take part or not in a wireless channel. The equilibria induced by these schemes and their performance are evaluated showing their potential to produce high quality outcomes in an incentive-compatible way. Analogously, the issue of designing resource allocation mechanisms that produce efficient throughput and congestion allocations despite the selfish users’ behavior is discussed in Shenker (1995).

The above mentioned works follow two established approaches in classical and algorithmic game theory and focus on (i) finding equilibria, i.e., solutions where each agent obtains no benefit by moving away from the current solution, and/or (ii) designing mechanisms, i.e. protocols leading the (selfish) agents to solutions which are either globally optimal or follow some intuitive, easy to compute rule. The problem we address in this paper is indeed a multi-deciders version of the well known Subset Sum problem where two agents compete for the capacity of a common knapsack in presence of a very simple mechanism (round robin). However, we adopt a different perspective here, namely we look at the problem from the point of view of one agent and seek strategies optimizing her payoff depending on the behavior of the other agent.

In this paper we show that it is 
                           
                              NP
                           
                        -hard to compute an optimal strategy for one agent by a simple reduction from the standard Subset Sum problem. Hence, we introduce heuristic approaches and analyze two very natural strategies based on a greedy concept which would be intuitive rules of thumb for any practical game scenario (Section 2.2).

The first strategy is the pure greedy algorithm, which maximizes in each round the weight of the selected item. The second strategy is an extension which tries to take the subsequent round into account in the decision. Assuming that one agent adopts the proposed strategy, we analyze the performances when (i) the opponent is able to play optimally and (ii) the opponent also follows the greedy strategy. In particular, we are able to show that the first heuristic has a performance ratio of 1/2 both against an optimal opponent and against a greedy opponent (Section 3.1), while the second proposed algorithm has a performance ratio of 2/3 against the optimal opponent (see Section 3.2). Moreover, we show that a natural generalization of these greedy based strategies invoking a farther reaching consideration of future rounds does not allow a further improvement of the 2/3 performance ratio (Section 3.3).

Furthermore, we observe that from a centralized perspective, some known results on the approximation of the classical Subset Sum can be effectively adapted to the multi-agent version of the problem (Section 4).

After showing in Section 5 that two natural extensions of the proposed algorithms to a Knapsack Game problem do not provide a bounded performance ratio, we conclude with a few directions for future research (Section 6).

                         indicate the two agents. Agent P

                         of n

                           x
                         has a non-negative weight x
                        
                           i
                        , with x
                        =
                        a, b. We assume that N
                        
                           a
                        
                        ∩
                        N
                        
                           b
                        
                        =∅ and that there is perfect information, so agents know each other’s item sets.

The game can be seen as a sequence of rounds, where in each round P
                        
                           a
                         selects an item from N
                        
                           a
                         followed by the selection of an item from N
                        
                           b
                         by agent P
                        
                           b
                        . The total weight of all selected items must not exceed the capacity c at any time. If at any point of the game one agent is unable to select any more items because the remaining capacity is too small, the agent just remains idle and the other agent can continue to select items.

It is easy to show that the associated decision problem, namely whether both agents can reach a certain total weight, is 
                           
                              NP

For notational convenience, we address the problem from the point of view of agent P
                     
                        a
                     . For agent P
                     
                        b
                     , the perspective is completely the same after subtracting from c the weight of the item selected by P
                     
                        a
                      in the first round.

In this paper, with a slight abuse of terminology, a strategy
                     
                        2
                        In game theory, a strategy would denote the set of all decisions for any possible scenario of the game. This would be the result of a strategy in our more algorithmic terminology.

                     S of an agent indicates a rule, or an algorithm, that specifies which item to select in any round depending on the capacity and the sets of selected and still available items of both agents. Since the outcome of the game depends on the strategies employed by the two agents, if P
                     
                        a
                      follows a strategy S and P
                     
                        b
                      a strategy Z, then we denote the total weights obtained by agent P
                     
                        a
                      and P

                      as A

                      and B
                     
                        SZ
                     , respectively. Clearly, for every pair of feasible strategies S and Z, A
                     
                        SZ

                     B

In general, the optimal strategy of an agent depends not only on the outcome of previous rounds but also on the future decisions of the other agent. If the strategy of P
                        
                           b
                         is not known, there is no way for P
                        
                           a
                         to always make optimal decisions. Else, if agent P
                        
                           a
                         knows the strategy Z of agent P
                        
                           b
                        , it can compute an optimal strategy O, maximizing the total weight of the selected items. This can be done by modeling the Subset Sum game as a game in extensive form and representing it by a game tree as it is usually done in game theory (see e.g. Osborne, 2004, Section 5).

A game tree represents all possible decisions of both agents in sequential form. Each node of the tree corresponds to the decision of an agent in a certain round, such that every possible outcome of this decision is represented by a child node. Thus, the root of the tree (i.e. a node in level 1) corresponds to the decision of P
                        
                           a
                         in the first round and has n
                        
                           a
                         child nodes, one for each possible item selected by P
                        
                           a
                        . Each such child node (i.e. a node in level 2) represents the decision of P
                        
                           b
                         in the first round. Clearly, feasible selections are those where the total weight reached at the current node does not exceed the capacity c.

Considering an arbitrary node in level ℓ, ℓ⩾2, in the tree, one could easily determine all previous decisions by moving upwards along the unique path to the root of the tree. Thus, the remaining capacity and the set of not yet selected items of the current agent (P
                        
                           a
                         if ℓ≡1 mod 2, P
                        
                           b
                         otherwise) are known and one can establish which items could still be selected at this node. Each of them gives rise to a child node in level ℓ+1. It is convenient to assume that an agent selects an artificial item of weight 0 if it cannot select any other item, but the other agent still has items to select. Every leaf of this game tree describes a feasible outcome of the game and yields a pair of total weights (A, B) obtained by the two agents.

Now an optimal strategy can be determined for both agents by settling all decisions by backward induction. This means that for each node, whose child nodes are all leaves, the associated agent can reach a final decision by simply choosing the best of all child nodes w.r.t. their allocated total weight. Then these leaf nodes can be deleted and the pair of gained weights of the chosen leaf is moved to its parent node. In this way, we can move upwards in the tree towards the root and settle all decisions along the way.

If an agent, say P
                        
                           b
                        , follows a certain strategy S, then P
                        
                           b
                         will execute a certain decision in each of its nodes. Thus, each of its nodes only has one child node. P
                        
                           a
                         can determine an optimal answer against strategy S by following the same procedure as above.

Unfortunately, this procedure cannot be easily used in practice due to the exponential number of nodes in the game tree. In particular, it can be easily concluded from the proof of Proposition 1, that it is 
                           
                              NP
                           
                        -hard to compute the optimal strategy for an agent against a given strategy of the other agent. To escape this intractability, it is a reasonable approach to make use of heuristic algorithms as strategies (see in Sections 2.2 and 3).

In the terminology of game theory an optimal strategy as described above is by definition a Nash equilibrium and also a so-called subgame perfect equilibrium (a slightly stronger property), since the decisions made in the above backward induction procedure are also optimal for every subtree (see Osborne (2004, Section 5) for more details). Clearly, the optimal strategy and hence the equilibrium of the game is not unique, since there may well be several different leafs of the game tree yielding the same weights for both agents.

Because it is 
                           
                              NP
                           
                        -hard to compute an optimal strategy, we will consider heuristic strategies for the agents. A simple greedy algorithm is a very natural choice for the Subset Sum game. In this case an agent simply selects in every round the item with largest weight that does not violate the capacity constraint. In this way, the capacity available for the other agent is (at least locally) minimized, which seems to be an intuitively appealing approach. In Section 3.1 it is shown that such a greedy algorithm may reach only half of the weight obtained by an optimal strategy but cannot do worse than that. For sake of completeness we also give a formal description in Algorithm 1.

An effective improvement over this simple greedy mechanism is the following Look-ahead Greedy algorithm L, which tries to avoid the shortsightedness of Greedy at least to some extent. Motivated by the worst-case example given in Section 3.1 (proof of Theorem 5) it considers in every round all feasible pairs of items and picks the pair with highest total weight. The larger item of this pair is then selected in the current round. In this context a pair of items is feasible if P
                        
                           a
                         can be sure to be able to select the two items in the current and the subsequent round, no matter what P
                        
                           b
                         does in the current round, i.e. even if P
                        
                           b
                         selects the largest item that fits. A formal description is given in Algorithm 2. To avoid tedious special cases we assume that there are always sufficient items available for P
                        
                           a
                         to consider a pair of items in every round. This can be achieved by adding dummy items with weight 0.

                           b
                         does not select the maximal possible weight b

A natural generalization of Look-ahead Greedy looks even farther into the future and considers more than two items as a look ahead. The resulting k-Look-ahead Greedy algorithm (k-L) determines, in each round, the best combination of k items for P
                        
                           a
                         that cannot be “blocked” by the opponent P
                        
                           b
                        . Then the largest item of this k-tuple is selected in this round. Clearly, the above algorithm L arises as the special case of 2-L. Note that by definition of this algorithm, any possibility by P
                        
                           b
                         to block the k-tuple considered by P
                        
                           a
                         is taken into account. This “blocking strategy” of P
                        
                           b
                         may be quite different from the greedy strategy which always puts b
                        max against 2-L.

While it is easy to see that Look-ahead Greedy may perform better than Greedy (see e.g. Example 3), and also 3-Look-ahead Greedy may perform better than 2-Look-ahead Greedy (e.g. in Example 5), we can show that it may also be the other way round (see e.g. Example 1). In conclusion, there is no strict dominance between the different extensions of the Greedy strategy.

                              ε as the best triple and selects one of them. In round 2, only the remaining two items of this triple can be packed, and the algorithm continues to gain a total weight of 12−3ε.

                               would start with item 1 and continues to pack all four items of weight

                               ending up with a total weight of 12. Note that Greedy and 2-Look-ahead Greedy both pick this optimal strategy.

A simple variation of this example where the three items of weight 4−
                              ε are replaced by two items of weight 6−
                              ε shows by an analogous reasoning that 2-Look-ahead Greedy may be stuck with 12−2ε while the optimal solution identified by Greedy obtains 12.

To analyze the performance of the heuristics for the Subset Sum game we follow a worst-case perspective taking agent P
                     
                        a
                     ’s point of view. As in the performance analysis of classical approximation algorithms, we consider the worst solution scenario over all possible instances, i.e. sets of input data, and compare the solution value derived by a heuristic with the solution value attained by the optimal strategy.

Differently from classical optimization problems we also have to include the strategy of agent P
                     
                        b
                      in our analysis. In the following we define as performance bound ρ

                     As usual, we call a performance bound ρ
                     
                        HS
                      
                     tight, if no larger value than ρ
                     
                        HS
                      exists which fulfills (1).

Assuming that P
                     
                        b
                      does not act in a completely arbitrary or self destructive way, the most plausible strategy S of P
                     
                        b
                      is the optimal response. That is, knowing the strategy H of P
                     
                        a
                     , P
                     
                        b
                      maximizes its total weight (cf. Section 2.1) neither trying to help nor harm P
                     
                        a
                     . By maximizing its own total weight, the capacity remaining to be utilized by P
                     
                        a
                      is automatically minimized, which fits well together with the notion of a worst-case analysis. However, note that an optimal strategy of P
                     
                        b
                      does not necessarily yield the worst possible outcome for a strategy of P
                     
                        a
                     . This can be seen—after exchanging the roles of P
                     
                        a
                      and P
                     
                        b
                     —from Example 4, where the switching from the optimal to the Greedy strategy of one agent generates a worse outcome for the optimal strategy of the other agent.

To avoid clumsy notation we assume w.l.o.g. that the items of both agents are numbered in the order they are selected during the game, i.e. agent P
                     
                        a
                      selects a
                     
                        j
                      in round j. Items not selected are numbered arbitrarily with indices higher than the selected items.

The following proposition will be useful in the proofs below.
                        Proposition 2
                        
                           It can always be assumed that an optimal strategy of P
                           
                              b
                            
                           selects items in nonincreasing order of weights against the 
                           Greedy 
                           strategy of P
                           
                              a
                           
                           .
                        

Assume contrary to the statement that there exists a selected item b
                           
                              j

                              b
                            has four possibilities to react. The resulting games are listed as columns in Table 1
                           .

In order to achieve the maximum total weight for herself, P
                           
                              b
                            has to choose first the item with weight 2 and then the one with weight 5. In some sense P
                           
                              b
                            can “threaten” to use its largest item 1 in the next round and thereby forces P
                           
                              a
                            to choose the larger item with weight 6 instead of items 3 and 4. Thereby Look-ahead Greedy leaves room for the final item 3ε of P
                           
                              b
                           . If P
                           
                              b
                            chose items in decreasing order of their weights, this would permit a better choice for P
                           
                              a
                            and would reduce the total weight attained by P
                           
                              b
                           .

By going through all possible solutions it can be checked that in the above example the strategy of P
                           
                              a
                            is optimal.

                           may select items in a non-monotone order of weights.

The following technical lemma will be used to prove the performance bound of Greedy both against an optimal and against a greedy strategy of P

To find an optimal strategy we depict a partial decision tree below. Numbers in the circles refer to item weights while the leaves of the tree contain the weights obtained by both agents.
                                 
                              
                           

Clearly, P

                               will start with an item of weight 4 because otherwise the above case applies again. If P
                              
                                 b
                               chooses item 1 with weight 10 in the first round, P
                              
                                 a
                               could select any item in the second round to prevent P
                              
                                 b
                               from selecting any further items. Hence, P
                              
                                 b
                               should select, in the first round, an item with weight 5.5. This allows P
                              
                                 a
                               two choices: (1) it selects an item of weight 7, then P
                              
                                 b
                               would continue with the other item of weight 5.5 and both agents are finished gaining a total weight of 11 each; (2) P
                              
                                 a
                               selects another item of weight 4, then again P
                              
                                 b
                               continues with the other item of weight 5.5 (since item 1 does not fit) and reaches a total weight of B
                              
                                 OO

                                 a
                               can enter into a next round to submit a third item of weight 4 yielding A
                              
                                 OO
                              
                              =12 (circled outcome).

While the optimal strategy of an agent may even suffer from a suboptimal strategy of its opponent, the following proposition says that for the Greedy strategy it is always better if the opponent deviates from an optimal response to a greedy response.

                                 j+1. Since in round j the Look-ahead Greedy computes a pair of items and selects the larger of the pair, this means that a different pair (j, k) was determined yielding p
                              max. By definition of the algorithm a

                               holds and hence a
                              
                                 k

                                 j+1. Hence, items j and j
                              +1 would have been a better pair than j and k and must have been excluded from the computation of p

It is natural to expect that the performance of the Look-ahead Greedy heuristic should improve the more items one includes in the look ahead set, i.e. ρ
                        
                           k−LO increases in k. When moving from k
                        =1 to k
                        =2 this was shown to be true in the previous sections. The general case could be seen as being related to the construction of a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the Subset Sum and the Knapsack problem, where subsets of a certain cardinality ℓ are enumerated and the larger ℓ, the smaller the resulting relative error ε.

Surprisingly, the following example shows that this is not the case. Instead, it can be shown that the worst case performance bound of

As it is often done in game theoretic settings, we can put the outcome of the game by two competing and selfish agents in perspective to a centralized view, where a single decision maker makes all selections for both item sets N
                     
                        a
                      and N
                     
                        b
                     . The goal of such a centralized decision is the maximization of the total weight obtained from both item sets. Clearly, the centralized decision has to select items from N
                     
                        a
                      and N
                     
                        b
                      in turn as in the underlying Subset Sum game.

It is easy to see that the computation of such a globally optimal solution weight W
                     ∗ is an 
                        
                           NP
                        
                     -hard problem since it contains the classical Subset Sum problem (SSP). A reduction can be obtained similar to the proof of Proposition 1.

In algorithmic game theory, the Prize of Anarchy is a widely used concept to analyze the difference between a global optimum and the outcome arising from the combined solutions of selfish agents. For the Subset Sum game, we compare the optimal weight generated by the central decision to the outcome obtained by the two agents each following its own optimal strategy (cf. Section 2.1). A simple example shows that the Prize of Anarchy can be arbitrarily high.

The central decision maker could also consider the game as a bicriteria optimization problem where the items from each agent’s set constitute one objective. The decision problem whether a certain pair of weights (W
                     
                        a
                     , W
                     
                        b
                     ) can be reached is again 
                        
                           NP
                        
                     -complete from SSP.

From an approximation point of view, it is not sufficient to apply a fully polynomial approximation scheme (FPTAS) for each (SSP) associated to each agent since one has to take the rounds with alternating selections from both item sets into account. However, we can consider the cardinality constrained Subset Sum problem (kSSP), where at most k items can be selected. Following the dynamic programming approach in Caprara, Kellerer, Pferschy, and Pisinger (2000) and assuming integer weights, we can compute for each agent every reachable pair (ℓ, W) with ℓ=1,…,
                     n
                     
                        a
                     , respectively n
                     
                        b
                     , and W
                     =1,…,
                     c. Then we search for the best combination of two solutions with equal cardinality (=number of rounds) such that agent’s P
                     
                        a
                      weights reach at least W
                     
                        a
                      and agent’s P
                     
                        b
                      weights reach at least W
                     
                        b
                      but their sum does not exceed c.

Now we can transform this pseudopolynomial exact dynamic programming solution procedure into an FPTAS by the usual scaling techniques (cf. Caprara et al., 2000) and thus answer the approximation version of the above question whether a solution with weights (A, B) exists with (1−
                     ε)W
                     
                        a
                     
                     ⩽
                     A
                     ⩽
                     W
                     
                        a
                      and (1−
                     ε)W
                     
                        b
                     
                     ⩽
                     B
                     ⩽
                     W
                     
                        b
                      in time polynomial in the size of the encoded input and 1/ε.

It appears natural to extend the addressed Subset Sum game to a Knapsack Game by introducing profits for all items. In this case, the two agents would strive to maximize the total profit of their selected items while the weights still have to obey the capacity restriction. In this section it is shown that extending the Greedy-type algorithms introduced in Section 2.2 to the knapsack case does not yield a bounded performance ratio.

There are two natural approaches to extend the Greedy or k-Look-ahead Greedy algorithms to a Knapsack Game: one may, in each step, choose the most “efficient” items (according to their profit to weight ratio), or one tries to gain as much profit as possible by simply choosing the item with largest profit in each round.

It can easily be shown that the k-Look-ahead Greedy (k
                     ⩾2) – which stepwise lays its focus on the best k-tuple according to the sum of the profit to weight ratios – has an arbitrarily bad performance bound. The same example works also for k
                     =1 which corresponds to the Greedy algorithm.

The following example shows that also the k-Look-ahead Greedy algorithm for k
                     ⩾1, i.e. including the pure Greedy algorithm, has an arbitrarily bad performance bound when focusing on the k-tuple with the highest total profit in each round.

                           −
                           k)+1. For n tending to infinity, the performance of the profit based on k-Look-ahead Greedy becomes arbitrarily bad.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we have analyzed a game theoretic variant of the well known Subset Sum problem in which the agents take turns to select their items to be included in a capacitated shared resource. This round-robin dynamics has been considered in other game theoretic studies of classical combinatorial problems (Agnetis et al., 2007; Auletta et al., 2009; Piliouras, Valla, & Vegh, 2012), however a possible topic for further research is to consider, as in Marini et al. (2013) and Nicosia et al. (2011), a different game theoretic variant of the Subset Sum problem where the round-robin mechanism is replaced by a central decision mechanism (coordinator) which picks only one of the two items selected by the two agents in each round (cf. Section 1.2). Hence, a coordinator may decide to enforce different rules, that incorporate some idea of fairness (which is for instance very important in the context of telecommunication networks).

Another possible direction for future research is to analyze the existence and the properties of equilibria, which can be used by a coordinator to enforce solutions from which the agents have no incentive to deviate.

Finally, one could study the problem in which an agent has limited information on the other agent’s items.
