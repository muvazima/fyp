                  An efficient and reliable stress computation algorithm is presented, which is based on implicit integration of the local evolution equations of multiplicative finite-strain plasticity/viscoplasticity. The algorithm is illustrated by an example involving a combined nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening; numerous backstress tensors are employed for a better description of the material behavior.
                  The considered material model exhibits the so-called weak invariance under arbitrary isochoric changes of the reference configuration, and the presented algorithm retains this useful property. Even more: the weak invariance serves as a guide in constructing this algorithm. The constraint of inelastic incompressibility is exactly preserved as well. The proposed method is first-order accurate.
                  Concerning the accuracy of the stress computation, the new algorithm is comparable to the Euler Backward method with a subsequent correction of incompressibility (EBMSC) and the classical exponential method (EM). Regarding the computational efficiency, the new algorithm is superior to the EBMSC and EM. Some accuracy tests are presented using parameters of the aluminum alloy 5754-O and the 42CrMo4 steel. FEM solutions of two boundary value problems using MSC.MARC are presented to show the correctness of the numerical implementation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In many practical applications, metal forming simulations are implemented to estimate the induced plastic anisotropy, the residual stresses and the magnitude of spring back. It is known that the numerical computations accounting for these effects should employ constitutive models of finite strain plasticity/viscoplasticity with combined nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening  [1–3]. One of such models was proposed by Shutov and Kreißig within the phenomenological context of multiplicative plasticity  [4]. An important constitutive assumption of this model is the nested multiplicative split of the deformation gradient: Within the first split, which is a classical one (cf.  [5,6]), the deformation gradient is multiplicatively decomposed into the elastic and inelastic parts. Within the further splits, which were introduced by Lion in  [7] to account for a nonlinear kinematic hardening, the inelastic part is decomposed into conservative (energetic) and dissipative parts.

Although there is a big number of approaches to finite strain elasto-plasticity  [8], the approach based on the multiplicative split is gaining considerable popularity in the modeling community. This is due to numerous advantages of the approach: Utilizing the multiplicative split, one may build a model which is thermodynamically consistent, objective, does not exhibit any non-physical energy dissipation in the elastic range and shear oscillation under simple shear. Moreover, the multiplicative split is considered to be the most suitable framework for the elastoplastic analysis of single crystals  [9].

                        1
                        Aside from materials with a crystalline structure, the multiplicative split advocated in this paper yields good results even for rubber-like materials  [10] and geomaterials  [11].
                      Furthermore, the classical small strain models of metal plasticity exhibit the so-called weak invariance of the solution  [12]. The use of the multiplicative split allows one to retain this weak invariance property during generalization to finite strains  [12].

Apart from the modeling of nonlinear kinematic hardening, the extensions of the Shutov and Kreißig model are used in analysis of nonlinear distortional hardening  [13], thermoplasticity  [14], ductile damage  [15], and ratcheting  [16]. Moreover, the model of Shutov and Kreißig was coupled with a microscopic model to account for the evolution of metal microstructure in  [17]. Due to the manifold applications of this model, its numerical treatment becomes an important task. The main goal of the current paper is to report a new efficient and robust stress integration algorithm, which benefits from the special structure of the governing equations.

A similar phenomenological model with a nested multiplicative split was presented in  [18] by Vladimirov et al. This model was applied to many practical problems (see, among others,  [19–21]). Moreover, the idea of the nested multiplicative split was also adopted by other scholars to nonlinear kinematic hardening in  [22–25] and to shape memory alloys in  [26–28,21]. Due to the similarity of the modeling assumptions, the algorithm proposed in the current study can be applied to these constitutive equations as well.

For the implementation in a displacement-based FEM, a numerical algorithm is needed which computes the stresses at each point of Gauß integration as a function of the local deformation history  [29]. For the model of Shutov and Kreißig (and its further extensions), the stress computation is based on the integration of the underlying constitutive equations. As usual for elasto-plasticity of metals, the corresponding system of constitutive equations is stiff. Thus, in general, an explicit time integration yields unacceptable results,

                        For the discussion of various explicit and semi-explicit integrators, the reader is referred to  [30] and references cited therein.
                      and implicit time stepping is required to obtain a stable integration procedure. In the current study, the preference is given to the Euler Backward discretization of the evolution equations  [29,31]. Alternatively, one may consider its modification based on the exponential mapping [32–34]. A special class of time-stepping algorithms is obtained by the minimization of the integrated stress power. Such a variational approach is rather general so it can be applied to various models with nonlinear kinematic hardening  [35].

As a result of the implicit time discretization, a system of nonlinear algebraic equations is obtained. Unfortunately, in general, the closed-form solution for this system is not available. Therefore, a time-consuming local iterative procedure has to be implemented to solve this system of equations  [36,18,28,20,21]. In some cases, the overall system of algebraic equations can be reduced to the solution of a scalar equation with respect to a single unknown. Such “one-equation integrators” are already available for many models of elastoplasticity with nonlinear kinematic hardening: An efficient stress algorithm was constructed for a model which is based on the assumption of small elastic strains in  [37]. In  [38], another anisotropic plasticity model is analyzed, which is based on the additive decomposition of the linearized Green strain. The authors benefit from the simple structure of the model, which resembles the infinitesimal elasto-plasticity. In  [39], a problem-adapted algorithm was proposed for a model of hypoelasto-plasticity with the additive decomposition of the strain rate. Next, a structure-exploiting scheme for a model with nonlinear kinematic hardening was recently proposed in [40] in the small-strain context. In  [41], an anisotropic model is considered employing logarithmic (Hencky) strain measures and quadratic stored energy functions. These assumptions simplify the algorithmic treatment, since an implicit integration by exponential mapping can be carried out using small strain procedures.

At the same time, less progress has been achieved in the area of multiplicative elasto-plasticity or multiplicative viscoelasticity coupled to hyperelasticity. Due to the nonlinear kinematics, an efficient time-stepping becomes non-trivial even in the isotropic case. The construction of problem-adapted integrators is still a topic of ongoing research: An explicit update formula was proposed in  [42] for the special case of neo-Hookean free energy. Its generalization to elasto-plastic material with Yeoh elasticity is discussed in  [43]; an application to a temperature-dependent constitutive behavior is presented in  [44]. A semi-implicit scheme was proposed in  [25] for a model with nonlinear kinematic hardening implementing the Lion approach. This scheme is constructed assuming that the elastic strains are always coaxial with the plastic strain increment,
                        3
                     
                     
                        3
                        This coaxiality is discussed after Eq. 12.11 in  [25].
                      which is a very restrictive assumption in case of plastic anisotropy. Moreover, in order to simplify the algorithmic treatment, the authors assume in  [25] that the plastic strain increments are small. Another hybrid explicit/implicit procedure was proposed in  [45], which is more robust than a purely explicit procedure.

In this paper, the overall system of equations is subdivided (partitioned) into coupled subsystems. For each of the subsystems, simple closed-form solutions are obtained. An efficient time stepping procedure for the fully coupled system of algebraic equations is then constructed by a tailored combination of these explicit solutions. As a result, a new algorithm is obtained, which is called partitioned Euler Backward method (PEBM). Within PEBM, only a scalar equation with respect to a single unknown inelastic strain increment has to be solved iteratively.

In the current paper, the accuracy of the stress computation by the proposed PEBM is tested numerically using material parameters of 5754-O aluminum alloy and 42CrMo4 steel. Concerning the accuracy, the new algorithm is comparable to the Euler Backward method with subsequent correction of incompressibility (EBMSC) and the classical exponential method (EM). The novel PEBM is superior to the conventional EBMSC and EM concerning the computational efficiency: For a model with 
                        N
                      backstress tensors, the EBMSC and EM require a solution of 
                        6
                        N
                        +
                        7
                      nonlinear scalar equations at each Gauß point. At the same time, the PEBM requires a solution of a scalar equation with respect to a single unknown inelastic strain increment. In particular, the introduction of additional backstresses is possible almost without any increase in computational costs.

First, we recall the viscoplastic material model proposed by Shutov and Kreißig in  [4]. Here we consider its modification with two Armstrong–Frederick backstresses (cf.  [46]). A generalization of the algorithm to cover an arbitrary number of backstresses is straightforward. For simplicity of the numerical implementation, we adopt the Lagrangian (material) formulation of the constitutive equations.

                           The volumetric part of the strain energy function (13) was proposed by Hartmann and Neff in  [48]. It has an important advantage over many alternatives since it provides a convex function of 
                                 det

                              . Moreover, the energy and the hydrostatic stress component tend to infinity as 
                                 det

One important property of the material model, which will play a crucial role in the current study, is the weak invariance under arbitrary isochoric changes of the reference configuration. Generally speaking, the weak invariance corresponds to a generalized (weak) symmetry of the material. Like any other symmetry property, the weak invariance should be inherited by the discretized constitutive equations. For the general definition of the weak invariance the reader is referred to  [12]. For the concrete material model analyzed in the current study, the weak invariance is formulated as follows.

                         In metals, the plastic flow may exhibit a fluid-like feature that there is not any preferred configuration. This observation motivates the notion of the weak invariance from the physical standpoint. For a more detailed discussion, the reader is referred to  [12]. Some of the commonly used approaches to finite strain plasticity are compatible with the weak invariance requirement, but some of them not  [12]. The weak invariance brings the advantage that the constitutive equations are independent of the choice of the reference configuration. In particular, this property simplifies the analysis of multi-stage forming operations  [50]. In the current study, the weak invariance is utilized as a guide in constructing numerical algorithms.

                         Note that this solution exactly preserves the weak invariance since it is the solution for system (31) which itself is weakly invariant. Next, since the variable 
                           z
                         is not computed exactly, the incompressibility condition can be violated. Thus, to enforce the incompressibility, a final correction step is needed

                           Interestingly, this update formula has exactly the same structure as the explicit update formula for the Maxwell fluid which was reported in  [42]. This similarity is due to the fact that the evolution equation (18)
                              1 coincides with the evolution equation for the Maxwell fluid, in case of constant 
                                 ξ
                              . In contrast to the derivation in  [42], the derivation in the current section exploits the notion of the weak invariance as a guideline. □

                           Remark 4
                           In the current algorithm, substeps 2.2 and 2.3 are repeated for three times. In the general context of the decoupled Euler Backward method, these repetitions correspond to the so-called relaxation iterations. As an alternative to the proposed algorithm, one may consider a full relaxation which consists in numerous repetitions of 2.2 and 2.3, carried to convergence. As will be shown in the following, the full relaxation is not necessary and only three relaxation iterations yield very good results for different metallic materials. Such accurate results are achieved due to the preliminary substep 2.1, which provides a good approximation of the solution even for finite values of 
                                 ξ
                              . Without the preliminary push-forward (57), the integration procedure would be less accurate. □

The push-forward operation (57) exactly retains the weak invariance of the solution (see Appendix D). For that reason, the numerical solution exhibits the same weak invariance property as the original continuum model.

In this section, the novel PEBM is tested using two different sets of constitutive parameters pertaining to two different materials. The accuracy of the stress computation by PEBM will be compared with the Euler Backward method with subsequent correction (EBMSC) and the exponential method (EM). These conventional methods are shortly summarized in Appendix E.

We adopt the experimental data reported for 5754-O aluminum alloy in  [55,1]. Four different shear tests are employed for the parameter identification: three Bauschinger tests with different prestrain levels and a monotonic test. For this material, the rate-dependence is weak  [1]; therefore, we switch-off the viscosity by putting 
                              η
                              =
                              0
                           . The identified constitutive parameters are summarized in Table 1
                           . The comparison of the theoretical and experimental results is shown in Fig. 1
                           
                           . As can be seen from the figure, the model with two parameters for the isotropic hardening and four parameters for the kinematic hardening describes the real stress response with a good fidelity.

The experimental data for 42CrMo4 steel were reported in  [46]. For details concerning the experimental set up and simulation of the torsion test, the reader is referred to  [46]. All tests are performed with a constant shear strain rate

                           . Two different cyclic torsion tests are adopted in the current study for the identification of material parameters. The identified parameters are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen from Fig. 2
                           , the considered model describes the nonlinear stress response upon the load reversal with a good accuracy.

For all the following tests we switch-off the viscous effects: material parameters from Table 2 are taken for 42CrMo4 steel with 
                              η
                              =
                              0
                            and 
                              m
                              =
                              1
                           .

We note that the material parameters which appear in Tables 1 and 2 correspond to a very fast saturation of nonlinear kinematic hardening with large backstresses in the saturated state. From the numerical standpoint, such a type of stress response is highly unfavorable: much larger computational errors are expected for these parameters than in case of slow saturation with small backstresses. Thus, the following numerical tests are assumed to be representative for a broad class of metallic materials.

The numerical tests reveal that the proposed partitioned Euler Backward method (PEBM) and the conventional Euler Backward with subsequent correction (EBMSC) have a similar integration error even for very big time steps

The iso-error maps are useful for the visualization of the integration error within a single time step  [29,56]. In this subsection we consider only incompressible deformation paths which can be described by

                         Just as in the previous subsection, the viscous effects are switched off. Thus, the stress response is rate independent. For simplicity, the time 
                           t
                         is understood here as a non-dimensional monotonic loading parameter. Moreover, we switch off the isotropic hardening as well, by putting 
                           γ
                           =
                           0
                         for both materials. To mimic the effect of isotropic hardening, we put 
                           K
                           =

                         This prestrain is simulated by 500 time steps. After that, a single time step is performed to a new state, characterized by 
                           
                              (

                        . The numerical solution obtained for this step using EBMSC with 300 subincrements is considered as the exact solution. Using this exact solution, the error is defined as in the previous subsection (see Eq. (65)). The iso-error maps for the new algorithm (PEBM), for the Euler Backward method with subsequent correction (EBMSC), and for the exponential map (EM) are presented in Fig. 5
                         for the 5754-O aluminum alloy and in Fig. 6
                         for the 42CrMo4 steel. As in the previous subsection, the computational methods exhibit a similar numerical error. For all three methods, the error is relatively small in the recent loading direction and large in the opposite direction. The PEBM-error is slightly larger than the EBMSC-error for strain increments opposite to the recent loading direction and slightly smaller for increments in the loading direction.

Next, we consider a combined prestrain with 10% tension and 10% shear

                         The iso-error maps for free different integration algorithms are shown in Fig. 7
                         for the 5754-O aluminum alloy and in Fig. 8
                         for the 42CrMo4 steel. Just as in case of uniaxial prestrain, all three algorithms are equivalent regarding the accuracy of the stress computation. Again, small errors occur in the recent loading direction along with relatively large errors in the opposite direction.

For the novel PEBM, the computational effort depends solely on the number of Newton iterations required to resolve the incremental consistency condition (60). For the conventional EBMSC and EM, a system of 19 coupled nonlinear equations has to be resolved at each time step (cf. Appendix E). The simultaneous numerical solution of these equations is problematic for large strain increments. In order to obtain a more reliable procedure, we employ the return mapping approach. First, a numerical procedure is created which computes the unknown

                         as functions of 
                           ξ
                        . We call this a “
                           ξ
                        -step”. Each 
                           ξ
                        -step is based on the iterative process of the Newton–Raphson type where 18 nonlinear equations have to be solved. Then, the correct value of 
                           ξ
                         is found as a solution of the incremental consistency condition (105). Just as for PEBM, this scalar equation is solved using the Newton method. For the novel PEBM each Newton iteration requires a finite number of operations on 3×3 matrices (cf. Sections  3.2 and 3.3). These operations include the matrix multiplication, computation of the square root and computation of the inverse. On the other hand, for the conventional EBMSC and EM each Newton iteration calls the 
                           ξ
                        -step, which is much more expensive since an 18×18 matrix has to be built and inverted several times within the iterative process. Generally, the Newton iteration for the PEBM is approximately two orders of magnitude cheaper than the Newton iteration for the EBMSC or EM.

Since the 
                           ξ
                        -step involves the iterative process, it is (a priory) less reliable than a closed-form solution used in PEBM. For 
                           ξ
                           >
                           0.1
                        , the straightforward implementation of the Newton–Raphson method to the 
                           ξ
                        -step yields a divergent iteration process. In order to obtain a reliable numerical procedure for EBMSC and EM, the 
                           
                              [
                              0
                              ,
                              ξ
                              ]
                           
                         interval is subincremented, which further increases the computational costs.

The setting used in the previous subsection can be also adopted for the analysis of the computational efforts. Toward that end we consider a combined prestrain with 10% tension and 10% shear, as described by (68). The prestrain is simulated numerically by 500 time steps. After that, a single time step is performed to a new 
                           
                              (
                              
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                                 
                                    11
                                 
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                                 
                                    12
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                        -state. The number of Newton iterations required by PEBM, EBMSC and EM to make this step is plotted in Fig. 9
                        . Recall that for the PEBM the incremental consistency condition has to be solved for three times, since three relaxation iterations are implemented in the current study (cf. Remark 4). Within the first relaxation iteration, the initial approximation for the unknown 
                           ξ
                         is zero. For the subsequent relaxation iterations, the solution from the previous relaxation iterations acts as the initial approximation. The total (accumulated) number of Newton iterations is plotted for the PEBM. Although PEBM requires more iterations than the conventional methods, the difference in the iteration number is not large. Therefore, PEBM is still much more efficient than EBMSC or EM. In contrast to the conventional EBMSC and EM, no convergence issues are observed for the novel PEBM.

The proposed PEBM is implemented into the commercial FEM code MSC.MARC employing the Hypela2 interface. In order to demonstrate the correctness of the numerical implementation, we consider two different bending-dominated problems with finite displacements and rotations. In both problems, the material parameters correspond to the 5754-O aluminum alloy (cf. Table 1).

First, a displacement-controlled problem is solved. A cantilever beam is modeled as shown in Fig. 10
                         (left). The left end of the beam is clamped; the right end is subjected to a prescribed vertical displacement with zero rotation. A total number of 30 elements of type Hex20 with the full integration is used. A series of tests is performed with a constant time step size within each test; the corresponding reaction–displacement curves are shown in Fig. 10 (right). The numerical solution obtained using 720 time steps (with 
                           Δ
                           t
                           =

                              s
                           
                        ) serves as a reference. As can be seen, even for the large time steps (
                           Δ
                           t
                           =

                        , 24 times steps), the conventional EBMSC and the novel PEBM produce almost identical results. Both methods exhibit quadratic convergence and they require approximately the same number of iterations.

Further, a non-monotonic force-controlled loading is applied to the Cook membrane as shown in Fig. 11
                        . The mesh contains 213 elements of type Hex20 with the full integration. The obtained force–displacement curves are shown in Fig. 11(right) for different values of the time step size. The numerical solution obtained using 240 time steps (with 
                           Δ
                           t

                           80
                           
                           
                              s
                           
                        ) serves as a reference. Just as in the previous problem, EBMSC and PEBM produce almost identical results, even for the large time steps (
                           Δ
                           t
                           =
                           1
                           /
                           5
                           
                           
                              s
                           
                        ). Again, both methods exhibit quadratic convergence and they require approximately the same number of iterations.

Concluding this subsection, the conventional EBMSC and the novel EBM seem to be equivalent regarding the accuracy and stability of the global FE procedure, even if large strain increments are involved.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

A new structure-exploiting numerical scheme is proposed for the implicit time stepping. The analyzed model of finite-strain viscoplasticity is based on the nested multiplicative split combined with hyperelastic relations. The main ingredients of the new algorithm are: 
                        
                           •
                           Elastic predictor — plastic corrector approach, also known as return mapping;

Use of new analytical (closed-form) solutions for elementary decoupled problems (see Section  3.2);

Approximation of the inelastic strain within each time step by a special push-forward operation (see Section  3.3).

The performance of the new algorithm is examined using the constitutive parameters of two real materials, which is a tough test because of large values of 
                        c
                        =
                        
                           
                              c
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                        +
                        
                           
                              c
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     . The larger 
                        c
                      is, the stiffer is the problem, which makes an accurate numerical integration even more challenging. Moreover, some convergence problems are observed on the Gauss point level while using the Euler Backward method and exponential method, if working with big inelastic increments (
                        ξ
                        >
                        0.1
                     ) and large values of 
                        c
                     . At the same time, no computational difficulties are encountered within the proposed PEBM, since the problem-causing nonlinear algebraic equations are now solved analytically. The numerical tests reveal that the proposed PEBM exhibits a similar error as the EBMSC. Both methods produce numerical results close to the EM. Regarding the computational efficiency, the new local algorithm is superior to the EBMSC and EM. For example, for a model with two back-stress tensors considered in the paper, the EBMSC and EM require a solution of a system of 19 nonlinear equations whereas the new PEBM allows us to reduce the number of equations from 19 to 1. The algorithm is implemented into MSC.MARC and two boundary-value problems are solved numerically to demonstrate the correctness of the FE implementation. According to the test results, the conventional EBMSC and the novel PEBM are equivalent concerning the accuracy and reliability of the global FE procedure.

Although the advocated time-stepping method is demonstrated here using a concrete model of finite strain viscoplasticity, it can be applied to similar models with the nested multiplicative split, developed for thermoplasticity  [14], shape memory alloys  [26–28,21], and ratcheting  [57,16]. The application of the proposed method to combined kinematic/distortional hardening with a radial flow rule reported in  [13] is straightforward as well. In conclusion, the presented method leads to enhanced computational efficiency of the local implicit time-stepping for the anisotropic finite strain plasticity, based on Lion’s approach.

Let us estimate the round-off errors which appear during the step-by-step evaluation of (38). The square root in (38) can be computed exactly up to machine precision 
                        ϵ
                     . For simplicity assume that this is the only source of errors. Thus, the step-by-step evaluation of (38) yields

                         In contrast to the classical EBM, EM exactly preserves the incompressibility. Under some general assumptions, both methods preserve the symmetry of

For the material model under consideration, two conventional numerical procedures can be obtained using EBMSC and EM in the following way. First, we discretize the evolution equations (3)–(5) using EBMSC or EM. Next, the scalar evolution equations (6) are discretized using the Euler Backward method as discussed in Section  3.1. Within a nested procedure, the resulting system of algebraic equations is solved numerically for a fixed
