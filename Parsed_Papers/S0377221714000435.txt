                  This paper proposes a new algorithm to solve nonsmooth multiobjective programming. The algorithm is a descent direction method to obtain the critical point (a necessary condition for Pareto optimality). We analyze both global and local convergence results under some assumptions. Numerical tests are also given.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In reality, many problems posed for solution can be formulated as multiobjective programming which have multiple conflicting objectives (see, Das & Dennis, 1998; Handi, Kell, & Knowles, 2007). For example, consider the integration of noisy data from multiple sources using a multiple source integration technique. While a single-objective optimization is often used in this setting, rather than viewing the data as from a single information source, multiple noisy analysis of the data can yield better results if properly formulated as a multiobjective programming problem with a set of objective functions of the form

Many algorithms have been proposed for solving multiobjective programming, but only a few deal with a nonsmooth setting. The reason is mainly because it is difficult to obtain the first and second order conditions on the nonsmooth objective functions. Qu, Goh, and Chan (2011) presented a quasi-Newton method to get the critical point of the smooth multiobjective programming. This paper extends this method to solve nonsmooth multiobjective programming in which the directional derivative of every objective function exists. Further, we propose a nonsmooth version of the quasi-Newton method for finding the critical point of the multiobjective program.

There are two solution approaches for solving multiobjective programming. One is the scalarization approach, i.e., by some scalarization procedure one or several equivalent parameterized single objective problems are solved and the corresponding number of Pareto optimal points are obtained (see Das & Dennis, 1998). However, the scalarized problems may lead to scalar optimization problems that are more complicated than the individual optimization of the original objectives (see Donoso & Fabregat, 2007). Another drawback of this approach, as shown in the applications, is that the parameters are not known in advance and a modeler has to choose them.

The other approach is the non-scalarization method. In the method, based on a non-efficient solution, a Pareto optimal point that dominates the non-dominated solution is generated. Recently, to compute a point satisfying the first-order conditions for Pareto optimality which is defined as a critical or stationary point, descent-type methods have been extensively proposed to solving multiobjective programming that do not rely on scalarization approaches (see Fliege, Grana drummond, & Svaiter, 2009; Vieira, Takahashi, & Saldnha, 2012). At every iteration, these methods have two features: (i) A descent direction is generated by solving a tractable subproblem; (ii) Along the obtained direction, in order to find a feasible point that dominates the current one, a line search method is conducted. As a generalization of these ideas, Qu et al. (2011) presented a quasi-Newton method to get the critical point of the smooth nonconvex multiobjective programming. This generation has the following features: (i) By using a quasi-Newton update, the computation of a Hessian matrix is unnecessary; (ii) For the global convergence analysis, it does not require the convex assumption. However, these methods are solution methods for smooth multiobjective programming. Qu, Goh, and Liang (2013) also extended the classical trust-region method for real-valued minimization to solve nonsmooth multiobjective programming where only the standard directional derivative of each objective can be guaranteed. In addition, since the submission of our paper, Neto, Silva, Ferreira, and Lopes (2013) have recently presented a subgradient method for solving quasiconvex nondifferentiable unconstrained multiobjective programming by extending the classical subgradient method for real-valued minimization to a multiple objective case. These two methods are in contrast to our methods of extending the classical quasi-Newton method to solving nonsmooth multiobjective programming. Qu, Goh, and Liang (2013) and Neto et al. (2013) extended the classical trust-region method and subgradient method for the real-valued minimization to multiple objective cases, respectively. However they offered no numerical tests for solving nonsmooth multiobjective programming.

In this paper, we extend the quasi-Newton method proposed by Qu et al. (2011) to a nonsmooth case and present a new algorithm to compute the critical point of nonsmooth multiobjective programming under non-convexity. This work uses the nonsmooth quasi-Newton method to approximate second-order information of each objective function, although the second order derivatives may not exist. At each iteration, the descent direction is obtained by solving a linear programming subproblem with convex quadratic constraints. This subproblem improves the performance by constraining the descent direction norms with an small positive scalar which can control the descent direction approaching zero. For the new algorithm, we establish a global convergence result under suitable assumptions. The superlinear convergence result is also presented. A numerical example is given and the performance comparison of our method with the subgradient method and scalarization approach is reported to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

We organize the rest of this paper as follows. Section 2 presents some preliminaries and analyzes the relationship between criticality and descent direction for a smooth case. Section 3 considers nonsmooth multiobjective programming in which the objective functions are locally Lipschitzian.

Since no unique solution which minimizes all objective functions simultaneously exists, we must decide which objective to improve. Hence the concept of optimality has to be replaced by the concept of Pareto optimality or efficiency, as explained below:

                           -convex (i.e., if F is componentwise-convex), then local Pareto optimality is equivalent to global Pateto optimality. However, in non-convex situations, the equivalence is invalid and a necessary (but in general not sufficient) condition for Pareto optimality is defined as follows. (See Qu et al. (2011), Fliege et al. (2009) and Vieira et al. (2012) for a descent-type algorithm for multiobjective programming).

                                 By Lemma 3.2, a critical point implies that there is no descent direction for at least one componentwise objective function or in the special case, it is a stationary point for at least one componentwise objective function. In this paper, we propose a solution approach satisfying statement (i) of Lemma 3.2, i.e., the search stops only when no descent direction is found.

In general case, if F is

                                     in X as our assumption that X is open, i.e., there does not exist any j such that condition (ii) satisfied. Condition (i) is satisfied when the current iteration is critical. In this case it is impossible to find a critical point satisfying condition (ii) in X. Therefore in this paper, we seek a critical point satisfying condition (i), namely there does not exist a direction pointing away from all critical points.

                         are 0.5 and 0.5 respectively. We note that the resulting single objective optimization problem can be solved by the nonsmooth Newton method proposed by Qi and Sun (1993) or by the nonsmooth trust region method proposed by Qu, Goh, and Liang (2013). In this paper, we utilize the latter method to solve the resulting scalar optimization problem.

                         lists the numerical results for the applications of Algorithm 1 the subgradient method, and the scalarization method, respectively. The minimum, maximum and average number of iterations and the average computational time (CPU time) are reported in Table 1. The results generally show that our method is efficient in solving this problem.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In reality, many problems posed for solution can be formulated as multiobjective programming which have multiple conflicting objectives. This paper presents a new algorithm to solve nonsmooth multiobjective programming. The algorithm is a descent direction method to obtain the critical point (a necessary condition for Pareto optimality). We show that this algorithm is globally and superlinearly convergent. We illustrate the usefulness and efficiency of this algorithm to a numerical example.
