                  Data-driven modelling is used to develop two alternative types of predictive environmental model: a simulator, a model of a real-world process developed from either a conceptual understanding of physical relations and/or using measured records, and an emulator, an imitator of some other model developed on predicted outputs calculated by that source model. A simple four-way typology called Emulation Simulation Typology (EST) is proposed that distinguishes between (i) model type and (ii) different uses of model development period and model test period datasets. To address the question of to what extent simulator and emulator solutions might be considered interchangeable i.e. provide similar levels of output accuracy when tested on data different from that used in their development, a pair of counterpart pan evaporation models was created using symbolic regression. Each model type delivered similar levels of predictive skill to that other of published solutions. Input–output sensitivity analysis of the two different model types likewise confirmed two very similar underlying response functions. This study demonstrates that the type and quality of data on which a model is tested, has a greater influence on model accuracy assessment, than the type and quality of data on which a model is developed, providing that the development record is sufficiently representative of the conceptual underpinnings of the system being examined. Thus, previously reported substantial disparities occurring in goodness-of-fit statistics for pan evaporation models are most likely explained by the use of either measured or calculated data to test particular models, where lower scores do not necessarily represent major deficiencies in the solution itself.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

For model-based approaches to remain credible tools in problem solving, a systematic and repeatable approach to iterative model development and evaluation tasks is required (Alexandrov et al., 2011; Bennett et al., 2012; Jakeman et al., 2006). Many data-driven modelling studies focus almost exclusively on goodness-of-fit metrics to determine the efficacy of solutions and little attention is paid to data provenance and/or to the conceptual underpinnings of the natural system being investigated, which consequently has a detrimental effect on scientific robustness and overall transparency of any findings. The present study has been inspired by an enthusiasm for more standardised approaches to environmental modelling explorations, including improved model evaluation (Abrahart et al., 2010; Bennett et al., 2012; Blocken and Gualtieri, 2012; Jakeman et al., 2006; Robson et al., 2008), resulting in our exposition of a data-driven modelling protocol that is able to answer our principal research question: does it really matter what type of data is modelled? A key outcome of this study is a new categorisation for research outcomes termed Emulation Simulation Typology (EST). This descriptor will enable researchers to distinguish between model type (simulator or emulator), as well as differences in model performance arising from the quality and type of data used in model development and testing.

Two different types of predictive model are recognised in our study: a simulator, a model of a real-world process developed on a conceptual understanding of physical relationships using measured records (SMOD), and an emulator, an imitator of some other model developed on predicted outputs calculated by that source model (EMOD). This paper summarises the regulated exploration of two counterpart model types: i) a simulator, SMOD, used to estimate measured pan evaporation (EPAN); and ii) an emulator, EMOD, used to estimate pan evaporation values originally calculated by means of the Nordenson–Fox equation (Burman and Pochop, 1994; Kohler et al., 1955) (ECAL). Four independent model testing scenarios were envisaged in which each model that is developed is tested twice, once using EPAN data, and then again using ECAL data, as depicted by means of a 2 × 2 matrix in Fig. 1
                        . The matrix illustrates that models may be developed using either measured EPAN or calculated ECAL data, and that subsequent testing could also be performed using either measured or calculated data, thus leading to four possible sets of findings. This study questions whether or not model performance is affected by which of the four development/testing combinations a given model can be assigned and examines the question of to what extent goodness-of-fit performance is related to particular scenarios. To assist with our explanation of matters, two types of model combination are defined: Type 1 models that are developed and tested using the same sort of data i.e. measured and measured or calculated and calculated; Type 2 models that are developed using one sort of data and tested on another.

It must be stressed that this analysis is not intended to establish whether emulators are better than simulators, or vice versa. Moreover, our study is not about searching for a superior predictive model, more accurate than anything published to date, and our models are not intended to represent general purpose solutions but rather specific fits to a particular dataset and study site. Finally, our study does not compare or benchmark its prediction accuracies against other types of data-driven daily EPAN or ECAL model such as those created by means of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) (e.g. Abudu et al., 2011; Almedeij, 2012; Cooke et al., 2008; Tabari et al., 2010), Neural Network (NN) (e.g. Almedeij, 2012; Kim et al., 2012a, 2012b; Kisi, 2009; Kişi and Tombul, 2013; Moreno et al., 2010; Piri et al., 2009; Shiri et al., 2011; Shiri and Kisi, 2011; Shirsath and Singh, 2010; Tabari et al., 2010; Terzi and Keskin, 2010), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) (e.g. Chung et al., 2012; Dogan et al., 2010; Keskin et al., 2009; Kişi, 2006; Kişi et al., 2012; Sanikhani et al., 2012; Shiri et al., 2011) or Symbolic Regression (SR) (e.g. Guven and Kisi, 2010; Shiri et al., 2011; Shiri and Kişi, 2011; Shiri et al., 2013; Terzi, 2011, 2012). Such explorations have already been reported in past studies and need not be repeated. This study instead distinguishes between the different ideological contexts that underpin and separate simulator and emulator models in a new typology characterised by the different types of data that can be used for either model development and/or model testing purposes. This is done successfully by applying a standardised modelling protocol to examine EST and so in doing offers a mechanism for providing greater intelligibility of subsequently reported findings, for scientists, modellers, software developers and end users. We make this distinction between the different groups of people involved because the role each plays in inspiring, developing, evaluating and using outputs from data-driven modelling explorations will vary, as conveyed by means of a simple flow diagram in Fig. 2
                        .

Each stakeholder in Fig. 2 could take home a different message from our study. In common, is that EST is a clear and concise way of illustrating the influence that data used for development and testing operations has on data-driven modelling outputs.

Natural evaporation of surface water is routinely estimated by field measurements using a U.S. Weather Bureau Class-A Evaporation Pan (World Meteorological Organization, 2008). EPAN is a useful observation for the purpose of water resources management, especially in forecasting lakes levels by hydrologists and ecologists. It is also regularly used to estimate evapotranspiration – a type of evaporation that takes account of aerodynamic and surface effects influenced by vegetation (Allen et al., 1998). EPAN, if not effected by precipitation or other extraneous events, is considered to be the product of synergistic interactions occurring between air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind on a water surface (Allen et al., 1998). The relative importance of each variable is debated, but it is generally agreed that a combination of meteorological factors drives this process (Fu et al., 2009).

To overcome certain systematic errors and limitations associated with the collection of EPAN records (Moreno et al., 2010) it is often calculated, ECAL, by means of an appropriate equation using meteorological data. Indeed pan evaporation databases, such as those made available by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), might reasonably be expected to contain one or other, or a mix of both measured and calculated estimates (Burns et al., 2007). Deriving EPAN surrogates from simpler measurements is an active area of investigation in data-driven modelling (e.g. Abudu et al., 2011; Guven and Kisi, 2010; Keskin and Terzi, 2006; Kisi, 2009; Shiri et al., 2011; Terzi, 2011). Lately, these approaches have created a discussion about the level of accuracy that can be achieved by modelled solutions. Kisi (2009), for example, used downloaded EPA data to develop and test a daily pan evaporation model that delivered an exceptional performance that was measured using the goodness-of-fit metric, R-squared. Moreno et al. (2010) commented that such performance is difficult to achieve for models developed on measured EPAN given large amounts inherent error and uncertainty in the data, believing that the source data used by Kisi (2009) was more likely to be computed ECAL and not, as stated, observed EPAN, an argument side-stepped by Kisi (2010). This conflict and potential misunderstanding could have been avoided with an improved, more transparent, approach to modelling. The issue is that published models can sometimes be misleading, partly due to a lack of comprehensive reporting on the provenance of the data and the methods applied to them, and partly because of insufficient model evaluation. This research addresses these problems by proposing EST in conjunction with a simple six stage modelling protocol.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

The six stage modelling protocol and EST presented in this research are intended to provide a methodological contribution to data-driven modelling, that will compliment and build on earlier good practice guidelines (Abrahart et al., 2010; Jakeman et al., 2006). The modelling protocol for this study is summarised in Fig. 3
                      and its application described in Section 3. EST forms part of Stages 2–6, where the consideration of data and model type remain at the forefront of our modelling operations.

The first two stages of the modelling protocol are designed to establish the conceptual underpinnings of the physical system under examination. Stage 1 involves characterising the study site and includes a basic literature review which is then used to determine what data is available and which natural processes are operating at the site e.g. climate, weather, hydrological controls etc. Stage 2 focuses on the data, requiring the modeller to characterise them sufficiently to identify any strengths, deficiencies and general features, statistical or otherwise, prior to creating development and test period datasets.

Gene Expression Programming (GEP: Ferreira, 2001; Ferreira, 2006), was selected to perform symbolic regression modelling (Stage 3 to Stage 5). The software used in this study was GeneXpro Tools 4.0 (Ferreira, 2012). GEP has been used on several previous occasions to successfully estimate EPAN or ECAL (e.g. Guven and Kisi, 2010; Shiri et al., 2013; Terzi, 2011, 2012, Terzi & Kesin, 2005). The technique was selected since, unlike many of its data-driven modelling counterparts, it delivers transparent solutions that can be evaluated. It also permits sharing and reanalysis by others and offers potentially valuable, but to date relatively unexploited, opportunities for knowledge discovery about the natural system being under study (Beriro et al., 2012).

It is important to note that Stage 3 to Stage 5 involves two parallel modelling operations, which relate to the two different types of data being used for either development or testing purposes, i.e. measured EPAN data and calculated ECAL data, forming the basis of subsequent Type 1 and Type 2 EST testing scenarios. Stage 6 is simply a clear presentation of any preferred models.

The study area selected for this investigation is Elephant Butte Reservoir, shown in Fig. 4
                        . Situated within the southern reaches of the Rio Grande Valley at ∼1345 m above mean sea level, Datum WGS84, in Sierra County, New Mexico, USA, this 14,500 ha reservoir has a holding capacity of ∼2.5 × 109 m3. The monitoring station used in our study is installed ∼1.7 km west of the reservoir at the same elevation as the water and is where standard meteorological and EPAN measurements are automatically recorded daily: North Lake Weather Station (NLWS: 33°17′50″ N, 107°11′38″ W). NLWS has also been used in other daily pan evaporation studies (Abudu et al., 2011; Moreno et al., 2010). The weather in Sierra County is seasonal, characterised by hot summers and cool winters. The region has a typical, semi-arid climate, with maximum temperatures ranging from 36 to 41 °C, minimum temperatures ranging from −8 to −21 °C, and an average annual precipitation of 220 mm (Williams, 1986). The frost period is short and the reservoir does not freeze over.

Six years of daily meteorological and EPAN data recorded at NLWS from 1st January 2002 to 31st December 2007 were available for modelling. The original dataset contained nine standard meteorological variables and measured Class A pan evaporation, as shown in Table 1
                        . The data was filtered prior to modelling to remove some of the worst uncertainty associated with strong winds and sub-zero temperatures. Days that experienced exceptionally high winds and suspected ‘splash out’, lengthy frozen pan conditions, precipitation or had one or more missing measurements were removed. The final filtered dataset (FFD) contained 1517 daily records, reduced from an original 2191 daily records.


                        Table 1 and Table 2
                         provide summary descriptive statistics and Pearson Correlation Coefficients for FFD and ECAL. A subset of FFD comprising T
                        avg, RHavg, R
                        s, U and EPAN is used to express additional useful characteristics as a matrix of cross-correlation plots and histograms in Fig. 5
                        . T
                        avg, R
                        s and measured EPAN express bimodal leptokurtic distributions, most probably due to seasonal effects, whilst RHavg and U
                        avg show negatively skewed leptokurtic curves, characteristic of log normal distributions. Of particular interest is the relationship between EPAN and the other four meteorological variables: temperature, relative humidity, radiation and wind (Fig. 5: Column 5), these are reflective of the physical processes known to affect EPAN.

For this study daily ECAL data for each record was derived according to the Kohler–Nordenson–Fox Equation (EKNF: mm day−1) (Burman and Pochop, 1994; Kohler et al., 1955); which is the same method that the EPA use for generating unrecorded or replacing unsuitable EPAN data (Burns et al., 2007). ECAL was thereafter included in our final filtered dataset, making an enhanced final filtered dataset (EFFD). Fig. 6
                         shows a strong positive linear relationship between EPAN and ECAL for NLWS (R-squared = 0.83; bias). Note that ECAL is prone to over-predicting EPAN at NLWS, a phenomenon which delivers a slightly curvilinear scatter cloud and negative bias.

EFFD was split into an initial four year model development period (2nd January 2002 to 31st December 2005 comprising 1035 records) and a subsequent two year model test period (1st January 2006 to 27th December 2007 comprising 482 records). The periods involved conform to a traditional 2:1 partitioning of the original six year dataset and each sub-set was considered to offer a reasonable coverage of the physical processes involved.

Two parallel model development operations were performed and in each pathway the relevant model development period dataset is used: 1) S
                        MOD, created from EPAN data to deliver simulated estimates of EPAN, denoted as ÊPAN; and 2) EMOD, created from EKNF data to deliver emulated estimates of ECAL, denoted as ÊCAL. The circumflex in each scenario is used to denote an estimated model output value, including errors and residuals, as opposed to its perfect measure or calculated counterpart.

An important but neglected feature of GEP is that its internal processes are stochastic; consequently, each new run will result in a new and independent solution. To this end, ten simulators (S1MOD to S10MOD) and ten emulators (E1MOD to E10MOD) were evolved by separate runs to fit the respective EPAN and ECAL development datasets. All evolved models are time and location specific but nevertheless sufficient for the purpose of providing a simple demonstration project. Each model had eight potential inputs that it could draw upon (T
                        max, T
                        min, T
                        avg, RHmax, RHmin, RHavg, R
                        s, U
                        avg), and one output, either EPAN or ECAL. The number of generations, providing our termination criterion for each run, was set at 10,000 – all other program settings were software defaults pertaining to the ‘Function Finding’ mode of operation and are shown in Table 3
                        . It is acknowledged that other options could have been explored and may have understandably delivered superior products, however, such investigations go well beyond the scope of our intended project, which is to perform a simple comparison between two alternative types of model and critically evaluate the impact of data quality in development and testing datasets on an assessment of model skill.

Still in parallel, and again using the development period dataset, potential solutions were evaluated and irrational models rejected. The rational (i.e. passed, instead of rejected) models for each parallel pathway were further tested, using the test period dataset, in accordance with Type 1 and Type 2 of EST (Stage 5: Fig. 2). Irrational models were rejected (i.e. omitted from subsequent testing operations involving the test period dataset) using three lines of evidence: 1) goodness-of-fit metrics; 2) scatter plots; and 3) response function sensitivity analyses. It must be stressed that no test period data was involved in Stage 4.

The development dataset goodness-of-fit metrics for SMOD solutions are presented Table 4
                         and for EMOD solutions in Table 5
                        . Four metrics were used to evaluate the models evolved on the development period datasets: R-squared, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Error (ME or ‘bias’) – equations can be found in Dawson et al. (2007). For the purpose of this study, reasonable model accuracy was assumed if scores were greater than or equal to other published EPAN and ECAL models (EPAN: R-squared of ∼0.75; and ECAL: R-squared of ∼0.95). For EPAN, these values were determined from the published studies of Moreno et al. (2010) and Abudu et al. (2011); for ECAL, the findings of Kisi (2009) and Terzi and Keskin (2010) were used.

Scatter plots for SMOD and EMOD solutions are presented in Figs. 7 and 8
                        
                        . These and all subsequent scatter plots are colour coded according to the type of model developed: blue denotes SMOD and red, EMOD. Most models performed reasonably well, generally conforming to a common standard, and again compare favourably with other published development dataset results. The overall ME or bias depicted in each scatter plot is minimal.

All SMOD and EMOD solutions were subject to a local sensitivity analysis, which involved the introduction of evolved models to eight artificial datasets (corresponding to the eight meteorological inputs). Local sensitivity analysis differs from global sensitivity analysis because rather than evaluating the effect of multiple parameter changes on the response function, it examines effects arising from changing one variable at a time (Zhan et al., 2013), a technique also termed one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis (OAT). It is recognised that this technique is subject to certain limitations (Sun et al., 2012), but for the purpose of this study it is considered sufficient. The datasets were created by varying one of the eight meteorological variables within an incremental range determined by their maximum and minimum values (Table 1) – whilst all other variables were fixed at their mean. The ÊPAN and ÊCAL responses were plotted and compared to the relationships determined between EPAN and the meteorological variables for NLWS contained in EFFD (Fig. 5). If plots for all variables utilised in each model revealed a similar strength and direction of relationship to that found in the original dataset then the model was considered to “pass” the sensitivity analysis and was accepted for subsequent appraisal using test period data from EFFD.

A summary of the EPAN sensitivity analyses performed for SMOD and EMOD solutions is presented in Tables 4 and 5 respectively. As in our earlier identification of key intervariable relationships, EPAN is viewed as a convenient and comparable surrogate for ECAL and is adopted as such, so that no equivalent additional parallel ECAL sensitivity analysis is required. Results show that the ‘pass rate’ for SMOD is 40% and for EMOD it is 20%, demonstrating considerable model inadequacy. This observation is extremely interesting and potentially important for GEP modellers – noting such a high failure rate for multiple model runs questions the justification of developing and publishing single GEP solutions – an issue raised previously (Beriro et al., 2013), which to the best of our knowledge a problem that has not so far been quantified. Informed by the goodness-of-fit metrics, scatter plots and sensitivity analyses, the six preferred candidate solutions selected for EST testing were: 1) S2MOD, S5MOD, S7MOD and S8MOD; and E4MOD and E9MOD. The fourteen remaining models were rejected at this point and omitted from further consideration and/or analysis.

The SMOD and EMOD candidate solutions determined by Stage 4 were tested on either EPAN or ECAL test period data in accordance with Type 1 EST scenarios, M|M and C|C. For each test scenario goodness-of-fit statistics were calculated and scatter plots produced. A single preferred SMOD and EMOD solution for each type was thereafter identified solely on these two forms of assessment, since each solution had been previously appraised and passed our initial test of model rationality using OAT sensitivity analysis of the developed models. Type 1 EST goodness-of-fit metrics are presented in Tables 6 and 7
                           
                            and scatter plots of are shown in Figs. 9 and 10
                           
                           . The results show that for scenario M|M and C|C the SMOD and EMOD solutions perform similarly to those presented in past publications. S8MOD and E9MOD were subsequently selected as our individual preferred solutions, one simulator and one emulator: refer to Stage 6 to view the models. The overall ME or bias for both models is again observed to be minimal.

Models S8MOD and E9MOD were tested for a second time on different test period data in accordance with the Type 2 EST scenarios M|C and C|M. The purpose of this exercise was to assess what model performance is like when a model developed on one type of data (measured or calculated) is tested using another type of data. For each test scenario goodness-of-fit statistics were calculated and scatter plots produced. The results are provided in Table 8
                            and Fig. 11
                           . These show that based on goodness-of-fit metrics alone the models perform reasonably well when tested using a different type of data (M|C and C|M) – indeed performance is similar, albeit slightly less accurate, than that obtained during Type 1 EST testing of S8MOD and E9MOD (M|M and C|C).

The scatter plots nevertheless highlight several important aspects of our modelling investigation, not readily identified by standard metrics, including differing degrees of curvature, scatter and drift. ME (bias) for the Type 2 testing scenario is more pronounced than for Type 1. When the model developed using measured data (S8MOD) is tested using calculated data (M|C) over-prediction results in positive bias; conversely when the model developed using calculated data (E9MOD) is tested using measured data (C|M) under-prediction occurs resulting in negative bias. These features could probably be perceived as evidence of overfitting, necessitating some sort of early stopping operation, however, given that the purpose of the study is not to create general purpose models such matters are largely irrelevant in what amounts to a controlled experiment. Further, in comparison to other data-driven modelling procedures, evolutionary algorithms are less prone to such issues anyhow (Abrahart et al., 2007). Equally the issue might simply be a reflection of the already established relation between EPAN and ECAL occurring in the study area (Fig. 6). Given strong similarities between the two models it is not possible to say with any certainty whether one model is better at predicting EPAN or ECAL than the other.

The two preferred final models, one simulator and one emulator, are S8MOD and E9MOD. S8MOD is depicted as a GEP expression tree in Fig. 12
                         and in mathematical format in Equation (1). E9MOD is depicted as a GEP expression tree in Fig. 13
                         and in mathematical format in Equation (2). The preferred models were both selected because they passed the respective OAT sensitivity analysis and demonstrated reasonably good model accuracy defined by their Type 1 and Type 2 EST goodness-of-fit test statistics (Tables 6–8) and scatter plots (Figs. 8–11).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Two alternative types of predictive evaporation models were developed and tested for Elephant Butte Reservoir in New Mexico, U.S.A: 1) SMOD, a simulator for estimating EPAN; and 2) EMOD, an emulator for estimating ECAL. Both model types are tied to the site and time period used for their development and testing. Each model was tested separately using EPAN and ECAL data under EST Type 1 and Type 2 scenarios (Fig. 1). Introduced for the first time in this paper, EST allows users of data-driven tools such as GEP to assign a model type to their research depending what sort of data has been used for development and testing: M|M, M|C, C|C or C|M). Recent discussions (Kisi, 2010; Moreno et al., 2010) have shown that this typology is required to avoid common pitfalls attributable to an inadequate understanding or presentation of the source of the data and how it is employed and communicated in published work. The current study helps scientists, modellers and end users assess how data type affects what might reasonably be expected in terms of model performance and its validity e.g. performance is demonstrably better for models tested using calculated data. EST also assists by providing a framework to better convey the context of any findings i.e. whether models are simulators or emulators and how they have been tested.

The preferred models derived in this study (S8MOD and E9MOD) should not be confused as generalised models – this would be an easy assumption to make, given that they perform similarly, if not better than those presented in other studies e.g. SMOD (Abudu et al., 2011; Moreno et al., 2010); EMOD (Kisi, 2009; Terzi and Keskin, 2010). Our study is not aimed at comparing GEP models with other models (c.f. NN, ANFIS and MLR) but rather to demonstrate the influence of data type on development and testing operations when examined systematically using a stage-wise modelling protocol (Fig. 3). The decision to exclude benchmarking operations and not to engage in a competition with other data-driven modelling tools is important and can be justified on two counts. Firstly, as referenced above, counterpart models have been discussed and compared in previous case studies. There is little reason to expect that the performance of the models evolved for this study will offer significant benefits over previously reported developments, notwithstanding the transparency of symbolic regression and the associated sensitivity analyses of the solutions; and secondly, benchmarking models and/or comparing model performance is expected to contribute limited additional knowledge over and above that which is already documented. Indeed, additional comparison would deliver only ‘incremental refinements’ (Abrahart et al., 2012a), offering low reward and no step-change in the advancement of environmental modelling. Clarity and improved reporting is instead postulated as an issue that must be addressed, which is why EST and the associated modelling protocol is offered.

The question of what role data type has in model development can be answered by looking at the results gained by the four different model testing scenarios enforced by EST, where it would seem that it is the testing datasets that are controlling model performance rather than the development ones and that, as might be expected, calculated data produces better performing models than measured data. When either model (simulator or emulator) is applied to data different to those used for development (Type 2 EST), performance is similar to the model developed and tested using the same data (Type 1 EST) – this observation suggests that such models can be applied to different types of data interchangeably. It is evident from this study that GEP can evolve rational models from data, providing they contain sufficient information about the conceptual underpinnings of the system being examined, in this case evaporation at a water surface, and that model performance is strongly influenced by the quality of the data, the latter point reminds us of the ‘garbage in – garbage out’ analogy and as Moreno et al. (2010) rightly pointed out, systematic errors associated with EPAN seem to prevent exceptional models. Conversely, emulator models can reduce the detrimental impact of stochastic natural processes by inherent smoothing of systematic and random errors associated with a problem (Abrahart et al., 2012b). A better understanding of what might reasonably be expected from future studies in terms of model performance, facilitated by a strong modelling protocol and EST, should improve understanding of the role of data as well as model type and in so doing inject increased transparency and accountability into the modelling process. Undoubtedly further research is required to extend this work, including identification of tighter procedural boundaries, but at least initially, an awareness of data sources and the types of model produced should hopefully start to improve.

This study also shows how multiple lines-of-evidence can be used to validate decisions taken by modellers to accept or reject their models. For example, using goodness-of-fit statistics alongside OAT sensitivity analysis avoids a model being accepted simply because it delivers higher metric scores. It may seem like common sense that each model should be representative of the natural system it is attempting to represent, or indeed the equation that is being emulated, but recent commentary about the intuitiveness of data-driven model findings suggests the contrary (Beriro et al., 2012, 2013). Furthermore, the high rate of model rejection (∼30%) for the twenty separate GEP models developed should serve as a warning about ignoring the way models relate to the natural system being examined – fortunately GEP permits transparent reanalysis of its models, something more difficult with other data-driven modelling tools. Further research would potentially improve our understanding of model redundancy in GEP since to the best of the authors' knowledge this issue has not so far been recognised or fully appreciated in environmental data-driven modelling.

                           1.
                           Gene expression programming has been used to create simulator (SMOD) and emulator (EMOD) models with reasonable performance, as evaluated using four goodness-of-fit metrics, scatter plots and OAT sensitivity analysis.

Model development data has less influence over model performance than model testing data, providing that in each case the dataset is representative of the conceptual underpinnings of the natural system being investigated (for this study, pan evaporation in New Mexico).

Models tested using calculated data tend to outperform those tested using measured data.

Model inadequacy as determined by OAT sensitivity analysis is an issue in symbolic regression analysis conducted using GEP.

Data-driven modelling outputs can easily be ascribed to one or other of the newly presented EST scenarios (Type 1 or Type 2) using an appropriate modelling protocol.

Scientists and modellers should understand their data before embarking on data-driven modelling challenges – by using a systematic modelling protocol and EST, this is made easier, more transparent and increases the chances of the study being repeatable and results being reproducible.

Model end-users should be aware of the type of data used to create a model before they applying it to practical problems.
