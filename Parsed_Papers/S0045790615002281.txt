                  This paper proposes an unambiguous correlation function applicable to generic sine-phased binary offset carrier (BOC) signal tracking. In the proposed scheme, first, we view the BOC sub-carrier pulse as a sum of multiple rectangular pulses. Then, we obtain partial correlation functions by correlating the multiple rectangular pulses with the received signal, and subsequently, construct two symmetric correlation functions by combining the partial correlation functions in a specialized way. Finally, we generate an unambiguous correlation function by combining the two symmetric correlation functions. The proposed correlation function has a sharper main-peak, and consequently, provides a better tracking performance than those of the conventional correlation functions in terms of the tracking error standard deviation (TESD).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) provide positioning and timing information for location-based services including navigation, tracking, and monitoring [1], and recently, new GNSSs such as European Galileo and the modernized global positioning system (GPS) have been developed to meet the demand for more precise location-based services [1,2]. The new GNSSs are designed to employ the BOC modulation providing a higher positioning accuracy than that of the phase shift keying (PSK) modulation used in the conventional GPS [3]. The BOC signal is generated by multiplying a pseudorandom noise (PRN) code with a sub-carrier of the sine-phased or cosine-phased square wave, then being denoted as

The main drawback of the BOC modulated signal is that its autocorrelation has side-peaks incurring an ambiguity in signal tracking, i.e., causing the tracking loop to lock on one of the side-peaks [6]. The GNSSs perform the positioning function based on the timing information, and thus, a timing offset due to a tracking error could result in a serious positioning error. To resolve the ambiguity problem, recently, several unambiguous correlation functions [6–11] have been proposed. Although they allow us an unambiguous signal tracking, all of them have some weak points: [6,9] are applicable only to the

                      signal, [7,10] require auxiliary signals, increasing the hardware complexity, [8] cannot overcome the limit that the correlation function is widened as the value of k decreases, and [11] performs more poorly than even the ambiguous autocorrelation function in terms of the TESD performance.

This paper proposes a novel unambiguous correlation function, which is applicable to the generic sine-phased BOC signal, i.e.,

                           (
                           kn
                           ,
                           n

                     , does not require any auxiliary signal, and has a sharper main-peak (and consequently, a better tracking performance) than those of the conventional schemes. In the proposed scheme, we first model the BOC signal pulse as a sum of multiple rectangular pulses, and subsequently, correlate the multiple rectangular pulses with the received BOC signal, yielding partial correlations. Combining the partial correlations in a specialized way, then, we generate an unambiguous correlation function with a sharper main-peak than those of the conventional correlation functions.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the

In Section 4, tracking performances of the proposed and conventional unambiguous correlation functions are compared in terms of the standard deviation of tracking error. Finally, conclusion is drawn in Section 5.

We assume that every chip of the PRN code is an independent random variable taking on +1 and −1 with equal probability and the code period T is sufficiently large compared with the chip period

                     . It is also assumed that the pilot channel, where no data modulation is present during the code tracking (i.e., 
                        
                           d

                         (i.e., [8] is a special case of the proposed scheme). The overall process for generating the proposed correlation function is depicted in Fig. 3
                        , where we can see that the computational complexity of the proposed scheme highly depends on the value of r, i.e., the computational complexity is expected to increase as the value of r becomes larger. However, a larger value of r also provides a sharper main-peak (and consequently a better tracking performance) as seen in Fig. 2.

                         represent the early-late spacing and phase difference between the received and locally generated BOC signals, respectively. As shown in the figure, the received signal is multiplied with the early and late versions of the local signal, and subsequently, the partial correlator and combiner perform the operations shown in Figs. 2 and 3, yielding the early and late versions of the proposed correlation function. Then, we obtain the discriminator output

The clock of the local signal generator is advanced or delayed by the numerically controlled oscillator, and finally, is locked when 
                           
                              τ
                           
                         is 0. It should be noted that the improved performance of the proposed scheme comes from the fact that the discriminator output of the proposed correlation function has a much higher slope (i.e., a much higher discriminator gain) than that of the conventional correlation function as shown in Fig. 6

                      the noise power spectral density, and H and W are the height and width of a BOC correlation function, respectively. From (13), we can see that the discriminator gain becomes larger, as the value of H and W increases and decreases, respectively, when the value of 
                        
                           Δ
                        
                      is small. This explains why the proposed correlation function can offer an improvement in tracking performance over the conventional correlation functions: The proposed correlation function is higher and narrower than the conventional correlation functions, and thus, has a larger discriminator gain than those of the conventional correlation functions, improving the tracking performance as we shall see in this section.

                      in the CNR range of 15–45dBHz of practical interest and the performance of the proposed scheme becomes better as the value of r increases. This is due to the fact that the main-peak becomes sharper as the value of r increases.

                      signal into multiple rectangular pulses, which are called the partial BOC signals, and subsequently, we have modeled the BOC autocorrelation function as a sum of the partial correlations (i.e., a partial correlation is obtained by correlating a partial BOC signal with the received signal). Finally, we have re-combined the partial correlations and have constructed an unambiguous correlation function based on two key motivations that an unambiguous correlation function can be generated through the re-combination of two symmetric correlation functions overlapping only around the main-peak and a sharper main-peak can be obtained if the main-peaks of two symmetric correlation functions become narrower. The proposed correlation function is applicable to generic sine-phased BOC signals, and moreover, does not require the auxiliary signals. In the numerical results, it has been confirmed that the proposed correlation function provides a better TESD performance than the conventional correlation functions, since the proposed correlation function has a sharper main-peak than those of the conventional correlation functions.
