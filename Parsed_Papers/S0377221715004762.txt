                  This article presents a mixed integer nonlinear programming model to find the optimal selling price and replenishment policy for a particular type of product in a supply chain defined by a single retailer and multiple potential suppliers. Each supplier offers all-unit quantity discounts as an incentive mechanism. Multiple orders are allowed to be submitted to the selected suppliers during a repeating order cycle. The demand rate is considered to be not constant but dependent upon the selling price. The model provides the optimal number of orders and corresponding order quantities for the selected suppliers, and the optimal demand rate and selling price that maximize the total profit per time unit under suppliers’ capacity and quality constraints. In addition, we provide sufficient conditions under which there exists an optimal solution where the retailer only orders from one supplier. We also apply the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions to investigate the impact of supplier's capacity on the optimal sourcing strategy. The results show that, there may exist a range of capacity values for the dominating supplier, where the retailer's optimal sourcing strategy is to consider multiple suppliers without fully utilizing the dominating supplier's capacity. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed model.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Supply chain inventory management faces the challenge of a price-sensitive nature of demand for certain products; it is common in practice that product demand varies with the selling price as it plays a significant role in attracting consumers. Such environment setting is unlike the classical economic order quantity (EOQ) model that unrealistically assumes the demand rate to be fixed and independent of the selling price. Hence, product demand needs to be considered as a decision variable as it is strongly influenced by the selling price. For this reason, the simultaneous determination of pricing and inventory replenishment decisions has gained a great deal of attention in the literature and practice. To our knowledge, Whitin (1955) was the first to incorporate the concept of linking inventory theory and economic price theory in which he considered the demand rate to be linearly dependent on the selling price. Later, Kunreuther and Richard (1971) studied the interrelationship between pricing and inventory decisions, and determined the retailer's optimal pricing and ordering decisions. Thereafter, Abad (1988) found the optimal selling price and lot size when the supplier offers all-unit quantity discounts considering two types of price varying demands, namely linear and negative power functions of price. He also considered the problem when the supplier offers incremental quantity discounts.

In this direction, researchers have considered various settings and provided extensions for the joint pricing and inventory problem proposed by Abad (1988). For instance, Kim and Lee (1998) jointly determined the optimal price and lot size for a capacitated manufacturing firm facing a price-sensitive demand, and provided managerial insights on the firm's optimal capacity decisions. Deng and Yano (2006) also considered the case of a capacitated manufacturer facing a price sensitive demand for which they studied the optimal prices and production quantities for a constant and time-varying capacity. Sajadieh and Jokar (2009) developed an integrated model to determine production and inventory decisions for a two stage supply chain consists of one buyer and one vendor with a finite production rate. They also showed that, it is beneficial for supply chain members to cooperate in high competitive environments where customers can easily shift to other less expensive suppliers. Then, Wang, Huang, and Wei (2015) considered the same problem and they proposed two sequential algorithms to coordinate joint pricing and lot-sizing decisions in the case of a centralized supply chain.

In the context of incorporating coordination mechanisms such as quantity discounts the following scholars: Weng and Wong (1993), Weng (1995), and Viswanathan and Wang (2003), have addressed the effectiveness of quantity discounts and their managerial insights when price sensitive demand is considered. And, Qin, Tang, and Guo (2007), and Lin and Ho (2011) proposed an integrated inventory model with quantity discounts and price sensitive demand to find the optimal pricing and ordering strategies. Other scholars included transportation cost in determining the retailer's optimal pricing and lot-sizing decisions, e.g. Burwell, Dave, Fitzpatrick, and Roy (1997), Abad and Aggrawal (2005), Yildirmaz, Karabati, and Sayin (2009), and Hua, Wang, and Cheng (2012). While others extended the Abad (1988) model by considering a set of geographically dispersed retailers, where each has a price-sensitive demand e.g. Boyaci and Gallego (2002), Wang and Wang (2005), Mokhlesian and Zegordi (2014), and Taleizadeh, Noori-daryan, and Cárdenas-Barrón (2015).

Although, several studies have been developed in coordinating pricing and lot sizing decisions for different retailing settings, all are restricted to a single reliable supplier. However, it's a common practice that retailers would consider multiple potential suppliers to seek the best supplier(s) based on certain qualitative and quantitative criteria. Therefore, in this article we consider supplier selection decisions, which have often been neglected in related literature of joint pricing and lot-sizing problem. Some recent comprehensive surveys in reviewing previous work about the supplier selection problem are given in Aissaoui, Haouari, and Hassini (2007), Ho, Xu, and Dey (2010), Agarwal, Sahai, Vaibhav, Monark, and Vrijendra (2011), and Chai, Liu, and Nagi (2013).

Research on coordinating pricing and inventory replenishment decisions considering multiple suppliers include Qi (2007) who developed heuristic and dynamic programming algorithms to find the optimal selling price for a manufacturer who faces a price sensitive demand and procures a single product from multiple capacitated suppliers. The proposed model is considered as a fractional knapsack model, where the manufacturer needs to split the demand (i.e., the total number of products) among a set of capacitated suppliers. Thus, he was able to prove that there exists an optimal solution to the proposed problem where at most one of the selected suppliers gets a less than full-capacity order. The same result was obtained earlier by Rosenblatt, Herer, and Hefter (1998) who developed a single item EOQ model considering multiple capacitated suppliers and a constant demand. Although our model can be considered as an extension to the model proposed by Rosenblatt et al. (1988), we show in an illustrative example that the aforementioned result does not hold true and more than one supplier can be selected without fully utilizing their capacities when suppliers are also subject to quality constraints.

More recently, Huang, Huang, and Newman (2011) coordinated pricing, and inventory decisions in a supply chain that consists of multiple suppliers, a single manufacturer, and multiple retailers. The problem was modeled as a three level dynamic noncooperative game. However, they assumed that only a single sourcing strategy can be considered between the manufacturer and suppliers. Later, Rezaei and Davoodi (2012) proposed a multi-objective nonlinear programming model and a robust genetic algorithm for selecting suppliers and finding Pareto near-optimal selling prices and lot-sizes of multiple products in multiple periods considering budget, storage, and supplier capacity limitations. However, similar to the majority of the supplier-selection models found in literature, inventory management was ignored in their model. In this article, we consider a single item EOQ model with multiple capacitated suppliers. Each supplier offers all-unit quantity discounts to motivate the retailer to place larger orders for a lower unit price. The retailer faces a price-sensitive demand which is modeled as a negative power function of the selling price. In addition, the retailer can place multiple orders to the selected suppliers per repeating order cycle. A numerical example is provided to show that a suboptimal solution is obtained when the retailer is restricted to submit one order to each selected suppliers in a cycle. Thus, the goal of our supplier selection model is to simultaneously find the optimal number of orders per cycle and the corresponding order quantities for the selected suppliers, and the optimal selling price that maximize the retailer's total profit per time unit under suppliers’ limitations on capacity and quality. We also propose a model that only considers submitting equal-size order quantities to the selected suppliers in order to coordinate inventory decisions in multi-stage supply chains.

Furthermore, in this article we provide sufficient conditions under which there exists an optimal solution where the retailer only orders from a single supplier. Moreover, we study the impact of the dominating supplier's capacity on the retailer's sourcing strategies. Thus, we apply Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions to monitor the change in the retailer's sourcing strategy as the dominating supplier's capacity decreases, and to check whether the supplier's capacity is fully utilized or not (i.e., active or inactive capacity constraint). The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the problem description and two versions of the mathematical model where order quantities can be either supplier dependent or constant for all suppliers. Section 3 provides an analysis of the model for the case of an uncapacitated dominating supplier and then investigates the retailer's sourcing strategy when the dominating supplier is capacitated. Section 4 provides the results of a computational study for the proposed models. Section 5 presents conclusions and provides suggestions for future research.

In this section, we develop a joint pricing and inventory replenishment model in a supply chain that consists of a single retailer and n potential suppliers, as shown in Fig. 1
                     . Suppliers can deliver a particular type of product to the retailer. Let ci
                      denote the capacity or production rate, ki
                      be the setup cost, and qi
                      denote the quality level, which represents the percentage of acceptable units, for supplier i. In addition, let qa
                      denote the retailer's minimum acceptable quality level on the average quality level obtained from all suppliers, and let the inventory holding cost rate be r.

Also, the retailer's unit purchasing price depends on the following all-unit quantity discount mechanism that is offered by the suppliers:

                      be a binary variable that equals one if discount interval j for supplier i is selected, and equals zero otherwise.

The retailer's demand rate is a decreasing function of the selling price P given by a constant price elasticity function, 
                        
                           D
                           =
                           
                           ∝
                           
                              P
                              
                                 −
                                 e
                              
                           
                        
                     , where ∝ and e are the scaling factor and the price elasticity index, respectively. We consider the contribution made by Mendoza and Ventura (2008) who recommend allowing multiple orders to be submitted to the selected suppliers during a repeating order cycle. Thus, let Jij
                      denote the number of orders submitted to supplier i in interval j per order cycle, and m denote the maximum number of orders that can be placed to the selected suppliers in a cycle. Therefore, the goal is to find the optimal number of orders per cycle and the corresponding order quantity for the selected suppliers, and the optimal selling price that maximize the retailer's total profit per time unit subject to quality and capacity constraints.

In this section, we propose two mixed integer nonlinear programming formulations depending on the type of order quantities submitted to the selected supplies, which can be supplier-dependent order quantities and equal-size order quantities. In the first case, when the retailer receives an order quantity of size Qi
                      from supplier i, let Ti
                      be the time to consume that order under price-elastic demand; thus,

                                 ∝
                                 
                                    P

Model (M1) is subject to a number of constraints. Constraint (1) represents the sum of the order quantities submitted to all suppliers within an order cycle. Constraint set (2) insures that, on average, the number of units ordered from each supplier (i.e., the supplier's demand share) does not exceed the supplier's capacity. Constraint (3) guarantees that the average quality level computed from all suppliers,

                     , is greater than or equal to the retailer's minimum acceptable quality level qa
                     . Constraint sets (4) and (5) make sure that the ordered quantity for a particular supplier is within the proper quantity discount interval, and constraint set (6) assures that at most one of the supplier's quantity discount intervals is selected. Constraint (7) restricts the maximum number of orders that can be placed to the selected suppliers within a repeating order cycle. Note that, this constraint helps in controlling the length of the cycle time as it will be shown in Section 4. Constraint sets (8) and (9) make sure that the number of orders allocated to a certain supplier is integer and less than or equal to m. Finally, constraint sets (10) and (11) impose nonnegativity conditions, and constraint set (12) enforces binary conditions.

The second model, denoted as (M2), allows only order quantities of equal size to the selected suppliers. The independent order quantities Qi
                      in Model (M1) are replaced by an equal-size order quantity Qc
                     . In addition, constraint set (11) is replaced by Qc
                      ≥ 0. Model (M2) is useful because it can be extended to a multi-stage supply chain system, where inventory coordination between consecutive stages is essential to facilitate the inventory planning process and eliminate the possibility of having undesirable shortages. Coordination occurs when the equal-size order quantity employed at a given stage is an integer multiple of the equal-size order quantity employed at the previous stage (Ravindran and Warsing, 2012).

Therefore, Solution II is not optimal and the only optimal solution is to only order from supplier 1.□

Note that Corollary 1.1 proves the following property that was identified by Rosenblatt et al. (1998) for their model: “if no capacity constraints exist, then only one supplier with the minimum cost per time unit is selected”. However, if quality constraints are considered, then this single sourcing strategy might be infeasible.

In this subsection, we study the retailer's optimal sourcing strategy as the capacity of the dominating supplier changes. As a matter of fact, supplier's capacity (i.e., production capability) may vary over time; it can majorly be affected by several factors, such as a natural disaster, business stability, and economic crisis. Any reduction in suppliers’ capacity may ultimately disrupt the retailer's supply chain, and hence, may require the retailer to reevaluate sourcing decisions based on new supplier new capacities.

For instance, if the dominating supplier (i.e., retailer's sole source) experiences a capacity shortage, then the retailer would generally tend to either keep sourcing from the dominating supplier, switch to other supplier(s), or consider a multiple sourcing strategy with fully utilizing the available capacity of the dominating supplier. In this subsection, however, we show that for some capacity values, the retailer's optimal sourcing strategy is to consider a multiple sourcing strategy but without fully utilizing the dominating supplier's capacity.

In order to address all the above possible retailer's sourcing strategies, let us consider a special case of Model (M1), detonated as (M1*), where there are only two potential suppliers (i.e.,

Now, let the integer variables Ji
                        , and m be known in advance and assumed to be constant. Under these assumptions, we can generate the corresponding KKT conditions for Model (M1*) to address the retailer's possible optimal sourcing strategies, and analyze supplier 1’s capacity constraint to find out whether it is fully utilized (i.e., active capacity constraint) or underutilized (i.e., inactive capacity constraint) for each sourcing strategy. Therefore, let μ
                        1  and γ be the nonnegative Lagrangian multiplier associated with constraints (16) and (19), respectively. Let also λ
                        1 and λ
                        2 be the nonnegative Lagrangian multipliers for the two variables in constraint set (20). Then the Lagrangian function is written as follows:

Note that, the objective function of Model (M1*) has a singularity at 
                           
                              P

                         (i.e., the objective function is not defined at 
                           
                              P

                        ). In addition, it can be also noticed that there is a singularity when Q
                        1 and Q
                        2 are both equal to zero. Therefore, for any sourcing strategy, P > 0 which implies that 
                           
                              γ

                         (i.e., γ > 0 never happens) also at least one of Qi
                         > 0, where

                         and that implies that at least one of

                              where

                                          1. However, Model (M1*) assumes that c

                                          1 (recall that D
                                          1 is the maximum demand rate that is obtained when only supplier 1 is selected without considering capacity and quality constraints). Thus, this case results in a suboptimal solution because additional supplier 1’s capacity can still be utilized to maximize the retailer's profit per time unit.

The model proposed in this subsection can be considered as an extension to the model developed by Rosenblatt et al. (1998) who studied the problem of multiple capacitated suppliers under a constant demand rate. Since they do not use the Ji
                         variables and constraint (17), their optimal solutions may be difficult to implement since they are not guaranteed to be stationary, i.e., some solutions may not produce finite repeating cycle times. Nevertheless, they introduced the following optimality property for their model: “there is at most one supplier whose capacity is not fully utilized”. This property, however, does not hold true in our case. Note that Case 5.1.2 shows that two suppliers can be selected without fully utilizing their corresponding capacities. For instance, let us assume that the dominating supplier is only able to satisfy the majority of demand due to some capacity limitations, and hence the retailer will need to satisfy the remaining small portion of the demand by placing a very small order quantity to the second supplier. Now, since both suppliers will be used, the retailer will incur an increase in the total ordering cost per time unit because a very small order quantity will be placed to the other supplier. Then, in order to lighten this increase in the ordering cost, the order quantities submitted to both suppliers is altered to ensure that both of them are relatively large. As a result, both suppliers will be used without fully utilizing their capacity.


                        Rosenblatt et al. (1998) also provided an optimal greedy algorithm that ranks the suppliers based on their effective unit cost and orders the maximum allowed quantity from each supplier starting with the lowest cost supplier until satisfying all the demand. However, in our model, we show that in Case 3, 4.3, and 5.3, the dominating supplier is not selected at all, and instead the retailer switches to the second supplier. These cases occur when the dominating supplier's capacity is reduced significantly, and hence the retailer can only place a very small order quantity to the dominating supplier, which makes the use the dominating supplier inefficient due to the increase in the total ordering cost per time unit.

The numerical example shown in Section 4 illustrates the retailer's optimal sourcing strategy and the related cases of the KKT conditions as the dominating supplier's capacity decreases.

In this section we consider a numerical example in which the retailer's monthly demand rate is a decreasing function of the selling price:

                                 e
                              
                           
                        
                     , where 
                        
                           ∝

                           =

                     . The retailer's inventory holding cost rate is 0.3 per month, and the retailer's minimum acceptable quality level is 0.95. Table 1
                      shows the suppliers’ parameters. The retailer wants to determine the optimal number of orders per cycle and the corresponding order quantity for the selected suppliers, and the optimal selling price that maximize the total profit per time unit.

This problem is solved using the global solver in LINGO 14.0 on a PC with INTEL(R) Core (TM) 2 Duo Processor at 2.10 GHz and 4.0 gigabytes RAM. We first set m in constraint (7) to a very large value to find out the optimal value of m that obtains the absolute maximum profit per time unit. In this example, the optimal value of m is 29 (4180.98 dollars/month). However, this value of m results in a very large cycle time of 15.98 months. Therefore, a reasonable small value of m has to be selected to reduce the cycle time. For this purpose, constraint (7) is changed to equality to evaluate the monthly profit over different values of m, and hence, select a reasonable small value of m with a profit close to the absolute maximum.

                     , and Fig. 3
                      illustrates the total monthly profit and cycle time versus the total number of orders allowed per order cycle m. In this example, 
                        
                           m
                           =
                           4
                        
                      is selected because it corresponds to a short cycle time of just 2.17 months and results in a small decrease in profit of only 0.06% compared to the absolute maximum profit per time unit obtained at 
                        
                           m
                           =
                           29
                        
                     .

In Fig. 3, Label 1 represents the solution of Model (M1′) in which the retailer is restricted to place at most one order to each supplier per order cycle. As shown in Fig. 3, the proposed Model (M1)  and Model (M1′) have the same monthly profit when 
                        
                           m
                           =
                           
                           3
                        
                     . Accordingly, it can be concluded that restricting the retailer to place at most one order to each supplier results in a suboptimal solution.

To help coordinate inventory between consecutive stages of a supply chain, the placed order quantities at each stage in the supply chain need to be an integer multiple of the placed order quantities at the previous stage. Thus, as stated in Section 2, Model (M2) facilitates this coordination mechanism by placing equal-size order quantities to the selected suppliers. Table 3
                      shows Model (M2)’s detailed solutions for
                        
                           
                           m
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           
                           …
                           ,
                           
                           20
                        
                     . Also, Fig. 4
                      compares Models (M1) and (M2) with respect to the total monthly profit. Note that, the decrease in the total monthly profit from Model (M1) to Model (M2) is due to the changes in the retailer's order allocations.

Now, to study the impact of the dominating supplier's capacity on the sourcing strategy, let us consider only suppliers 1 and 2 from the previous numerical example, and assume that both suppliers have no quality restrictions (i.e., 
                        
                           
                              q
                              i
                           
                           ≥
                           
                              q
                              a
                           
                           
                              ,
                              
                              
                              i
                              =
                              1
                              ,
                              2
                              )
                           
                        
                     . In addition, assume that none of the suppliers offer all-unit quantity discounts, and the fixed unit purchase prices for suppliers 1 and 2 are 8.6 and 9.2 dollars, respectively. Let us first obtain the optimal order quantity, and the optimal selling price and demand rate that maximize the total profit per time unit when each supplier is selected separately without considering capacity and quality constraints. A summary of the results are shown in Table 4
                     . Notice that, supplier 1 is the dominating supplier (i.e., TP
                     1 > TP
                     2).

Let us assume supplier 2 has no capacity limitation. Then, as long as supplier 1’s capacity is greater than the optimal demand rate (i.e., 
                        
                           
                              c
                              1
                           
                           >
                           
                              D
                              1
                           
                           =
                           1234.10
                        
                     ), the retailer's optimal sourcing strategy will always be to select supplier 1 alone. Once supplier 1 experiences some capacity shortages, the retailer's sourcing strategy might change. Fig 5
                      is developed to illustrate the change in the retailer's sourcing strategy as c
                     1 decreases. Note that, the total number of orders allowed per order cycle is two (i.e., 
                        
                           m
                           =
                           2
                        
                     ).


                     Fig. 5 is divided into five regions, where each region represents a different sourcing strategy. Now, starting form Region I where supplier 1’s capacity is very high (i.e., 
                        
                           
                              c
                              1
                           
                           >
                           
                           
                              D
                              1
                           
                           =
                           1234.10
                        
                     ), the optimal sourcing strategy is to use supplier 1 alone without fully utilizing the corresponding capacity. This region is equivalent to solving the problem for the case of uncapacitated suppliers. Then, as c
                     1 decreases, the optimal sourcing strategy remains almost unchanged ,as shown in Region II (956 < c
                     1 ≤ 1234.10); however, supplier 1’s capacity in Region II is fully utilized which corresponds to Cases 1.1, 2.1, 4.2, and 5.2.1. Note that, the reduction in supplier 1’s capacity in Region II is not significant enough to consider the use of supplier 2.

Next, as c
                     1 keeps decreasing, both suppliers are selected without utilizing any of them at full capacity, as shown in Region III (742.15  < c
                     1 ≤ 956), which corresponds to Case 5.1.2. In this region, selecting supplier 1 alone is not enough to satisfy all the demand. Hence, instead of ordering a small order quantity from supplier 2 to satisfy the remaining portion of the demand and incurring in a significant increase in the total ordering cost per time unit, the order quantity submitted to each supplier is relatively large and, as a result, both suppliers are used without fully utilizing their capacities. For instance, the demand rate fulfilled by supplier 1 is less than all the capacity values in Region III (i.e., 
                        
                           
                              d
                              1
                           
                           =
                           742.15
                           <
                           
                              c
                              1
                           
                        
                     ). Notice that, d
                     1 becomes equal to the lower bound of Region III. Subsequently, in Region IV (438 < c
                     1 ≤ 742.15), the optimal sourcing strategy remains to order from both suppliers but fully utilizing supplier 1’s capacity. This region corresponds to Cases 4.1 and 5.1.1.

Lastly, once supplier 1’s capacity is reduced significantly, the optimal sourcing strategy is to only order from supplier 2, as shown in Region V (c
                     1 ≤ 438) that corresponds to Cases 3, 4.3, and 5.3. In this region, supplier 1 is not selected because it can only provide a small order quantity due to capacity limitations. Thus, it is not efficient for the retailer to use supplier 1 and increase the total ordering cost per time unit.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

In this article, we have proposed a mixed integer nonlinear programming model for a supplier selection problem in which the goal is to maximize the retailer's total profit per time unit under suppliers’ limitations on capacity and quality. In addition, to ensure a more realistic and practical situation, the suppliers in our model are adopting all-unit quantity discounts as an incentive mechanism for the retailer. Also, we assume that the demand is price-sensitive and multiple orders are allowed to be submitted to the selected suppliers during a repeating order cycle. The proposed model simultaneously finds the optimal number of orders and the corresponding order quantities for the selected suppliers, and the selling price that maximize the retailer's total profit per time unit. Moreover, we have considered two versions of our model based on the type of order quantity: the first one allows a different order quantity for each selected supplier and the second one considers equal-size order quantities. Furthermore, we have developed sufficient conditions under which there exists an optimal solution where the retailer only orders from one supplier. We have also investigated the impact of the dominating supplier's capacity on the retailer's sourcing strategies.

Future research topics in this area include the development of an integrated model that maximizes the retailer's and suppliers’ profits. Our model can also be extended by considering other conditions, such as multiple products and joint setup costs.
