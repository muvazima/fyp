                  This paper introduces a novel two-phase supplier selection procedure. Unlike most supplier selection researches, which are decisive based on supplier eligibility at the time of the decision making, the proposed method is based on the long term trend of value, stability, and relationship of potential suppliers. In the first phase, suppliers are evaluated and assigned a comparable value based on a set of criteria. This value is then analyzed in the long run, and fed into a multi-objective portfolio optimization model in the second phase. The model determines a supplier portfolio by maximizing the expected value and development of suppliers, and minimizing their correlated risk. The novelty of this procedure is introducing a new view toward the supplier selection problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed approach selects higher value suppliers with lower risk of failure, compared to available methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Supplier selection is a strategic and long term decision. A long term relationship with suppliers is greatly beneficial to the buyer, and offers advantages such as stability in future plans and strategies, reliability of product quality and service time, better understanding of the supply chain, potential discounts, and superior inventory utilization. The importance of a long term supplier-buyer relationship is discussed in Kalwanin and Narayandas (1995). Choosing suppliers should not solely depend on their eligibility at the time of the decision making. It is essential to predict and analyze the past changes and future potentials of suppliers, as it lowers the need to periodically assess and replace existing contracts. The overall market condition has distinctive effects and consequences on different suppliers, and so it is important to assess the relationships of suppliers and their relative changes throughout time, to assure an optimized supply chain.

The common approach taken toward the supplier selection problem is to select the best available suppliers to date, and evaluate them in periodic times. Based on evaluation results, it is determined whether superior suppliers have emerged, or the selected suppliers still remain the best choice. In the case that superior suppliers have emerged, management weighs the cost of keeping the current suppliers, and maintaining the buyer-supplier relationship, to the cost of choosing the superior emerged suppliers and starting need relationships. The focus of this paper is on improving the initial supplier selection, such that a lower need to evaluate and replace suppliers is required.

The literature is rich with research on different ways to rank suppliers, or deal with uncertainty of service in the future. However, we emphasize that this paper does not focus on these stochastic aspects of supplier selection, or neither supplier development and nurturing. We rather investigate selecting suppliers based on optimization, using the portfolio theory. The focus lies in supplier selection based on the suppliers’ own trends of development or fall, and their correlation to other selected suppliers. We show that this approach may lead to the selection of more robust suppliers, compared to available methods. The supplier set is robust in the terms of maintaining a higher value throughout time, development to better fits, and incurring a lower risk of failure. The proposed approach would thus result in better initial selected supplier, that have a higher chance to remain the best choice throughout time. In other words, the proposed approach would lower the need to weigh the cost of supplier replacement, and could lead to easier supplier development efforts. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new view and approach, taken toward supplier selection.

A popular approach toward supplier selection is to calculate a comparative value for suppliers under consideration. A high value supplier is able to provide the service the buyer needs, and perform as expected. Performance is assessed on a set of criteria, and an overall value is calculated. In addition to calculating supplier value, this paper investigates its possible change throughout time, by introducing the terms development and fall. A developing supplier is referred to a supplier with increasing value, and a falling supplier has decreasing value. There are many benefits to considering these aspects. As an example, consider two potential suppliers, one with a high overall value and the other with a lower overall value. Without investigating the change of these suppliers throughout time, any selection method chooses the first supplier. However, if supplier 1 constantly declines in value while the second supplier has an increasing trend of value, it is clear that supplier 1 remains as the best choice for long. Methods selecting supplier 1 due to its initial value, eventually fail as they have only considered a local optimal solution. We refer to such methods as static supplier selection procedures, as they only consider the characteristics of the suppliers at the time of the decision making.

Another important characteristic that needs consideration in supplier selection is supplier stability. A stable supplier is able to constantly meet the buyer’s needs. An unstable supplier fluctuates in service throughout time, and cannot provide a steady supply by the buyer’s standards. Therefore, not only should a supplier be evaluated by its value, development, or fall, but it should also be investigated in terms of its stability in service. We show that any static selection method available in the literature benefits from considering such characteristics in its selection procedure.

An essential aspect of supplier selection is defining and determining the selection criteria that form the evaluation basis of a supplier’s value. The multi-criteria decision making approach to supplier selection is shown to be efficient (Ho, Xu, and Dey, 2010), and defining these criteria is of great significance. Determining the worth of such criteria is itself another matter. Not all suppliers may be suited to any buyer, and it is the characteristics of the buyer which determine supplier suitability. Various suppliers may have very high credentials, and operate in high efficiencies, but prove to be overqualified by most firms. Therefore, it is important to truly validate suppliers according to the buyer’s current requirements, and future vision. Many of the existing methods evaluate suppliers based on overall value only, and disregard their suitability to the seeking buyer. We address this problem by introducing the term “fit” into the selection process. A supplier is said to best fit the buyer if it is well suited to satisfy the requirements of that buyer. In other words a good fit is neither unacceptable nor over-qualified, and falls into an interval the buyer seeks. The terms value and fit are interchangeably used throughout this paper.

We introduce a two-phase supplier selection procedure. The first phase concerns itself with developing a value for each supplier. A function is developed which calculates a supplier’s value, by comparing its score in a set of defined criteria, to the scores the buyer specifies. Phase I alone may be used to select eligible suppliers (as in many researches), however this approach is static, and blind to many changes and possibilities. We apply the proposed function to historical data, and obtain a trend of value, in the form of a time series. This trend is used to derive the data needed to apply the MIP portfolio model in the second phase. The proposed portfolio optimization model enables the selection of the best group of suppliers, which have a greater chance to improve and develop, maintain a higher value throughout time, and considering the relationships of the suppliers, incur lower risks of failure. Risk of failure is defined as the possibility of the supplier failing to meet the buyer’s needs. An inconsistent supplier that occasionally falls short of the buyer’s requirements is also deemed as high risk. By applying the proposed model, better suppliers may be selected in the long run, that most likely lead to lower needs of analysis and replacement, in periodic evaluation times.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature on supplier selection, and supplier-portfolio relationship. Section 3 presents the two-stage supplier selection model, and solution procedure. Numerical tests are discussed in Section 4, and the paper is concluded in Section 5.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The supplier selection problem involves the selection of suppliers, based on multiple criteria, which are both qualitative and quantitative. The best suppliers are chosen by making a trade-off between these criteria, some of which may conflict (Benyoucef, Ding, and Xie, 2003). Over the years, several techniques have been developed to solve the problem efficiently. All methods result in a set of preference, value, efficiency or any other measure to rank suppliers, and aid the decision maker. Analytic hierarchy process (Deng, Hu, Deng, and Mahadevan, 2014; Kumar and Roy, 2011; Mafakheri, Breton, and Ghoniem, 2011), analytic network process (Gencer and Gürpinar, 2007; Vinodh, Anesh Ramiya, and Gautham, 2011), linear programming, multi-objective programming (Jadidi, Zolfaghari, and Cavalieri, 2014), data envelopment analysis (Karsak and Dursun, 2014; Liu, Ding, and Lall, 2000; Wu, 2009), neural networks, case-based reasoning (Faez, Ghodsypour, and O’brien, 2009), fuzzy set theory (Amid, Ghodsypour, and O’brien, 2006; Chen, Lin, and Huang, 2006; Lee, 2009; Senvar, Tuzkaya, and Kahraman, 2014; Wu, Zhang, Wu, and Olson, 2010), or any of their combinations (Amin, Razmi, and Zhang, 2011; Guneri, Yucel, and Ayyildiz, 2009; Kilincci and Onal, 2011; Rezaei and Ortt, 2013; Shaw, Shankar, Yadav, and Thakur, 2012) have been applied in the literature. All models may be classified into the three categories of (i) multi-attribute decision-making, (ii) mathematical programming models and (iii) intelligent approaches (Wang and Yang, 2009).

All reviewed methods and procedures focus on selecting the best suppliers based on average data, and the supplier’s eligibility at the time of the decision making. Buyer preference, past or potential changes of the supplier, and its relationship with other selected suppliers are mostly not considered simultaneously. The selection process is repeated periodically, and often superior suppliers emerge. Research has been carried out to minimize the risk of supplier selection, by introducing stochastic measures into the supplier evaluation criteria, and selecting a robust supply portfolio. Works of Sawik (Sawik, 2010; 2011; 2013) in a make to order environment, Burke, Carrillo, and Vakharia (2009), Federgruen and Yang (2008), Liao and Rittscher (2007) and Awasthi, Chauhan, Goyal, and Proth (2009) are examples of such research. These methods however, mainly focus on selecting a supply portfolio that guarantees satisfying the buyer’s needs, in times of fluctuating demand, or delivery. They do not however consider the possibility that selected suppliers remain the best choice compared to other unselected suppliers.

The problem addressed in this paper aims to select suppliers based on development and overall trend of fit to the buyer throughout time. The risk of failure is long term, and based on the covariance between the suppliers’ value trends, rather than their ability to cope with stochastic environments. Therefore the outcome is a set of suppliers, that have a higher chance of improving, incurring lower risk, and remaining the best fit to the buyer.

The change and development of suppliers can be analyzed through the portfolio theory. The portfolio-supplier literature mainly focuses on supplier development and management. Works of Olsen and Ellram (1997), Wynstra and Pierick (2000), Wagner and Boutellier (2002), Talluri, Narasimhan, and Chung (2010), Tang and Rai (2012), Gelderman and Semeijn (2006), Caniëls and Gelderman (2007), Wagner and Johnson (2004), and Zhu, Dou, and Sarkis (2010) all center on developing suppliers as investments, managing the supplier-buyer relationships based on the portfolio theory, while considering supplier involvement, and potential risks. These methods investigate ways to develop and nurture current selected suppliers to sync with the supply chain. In other words, the effort is post-selection. The approach of this paper has a similar objective but is pre-selection, and aims to select suppliers that are best fit to the buyer, and are improving in that regard, before the supplier-buyer relationship is established. The objective is to select better initial suppliers, that remain the best choice throughout time, by their own trend of development. These suppliers therefore present a better potential to establish the supplier-buyer relationship, and align with the buyer’s efforts in development and nurture, post selection. Fig. 1
                      illustrates the pre and post selection efforts, and the periodic supplier evaluation and replacement procedure.

We propose a two-phase supplier selection procedure, for a buyer seeking to select one, or a group of suppliers. The first phase assigns each supplier with a comparable value. The second phase utilizes the values calculated in phase I, and applies them to an MIP portfolio model. Together, the two phases enable a robust supplier selection procedure, and introduce a new approach to supplier selection.

The aim of the first phase is to assign a comparable quantitative measure to each supplier. This phase has been thoroughly researched in the literature, and is a popular method in supplier selection. We emphasize that we do not aim to specifically improve previous research in this area. Any procedure in the literature that results in a comparable value, representing the fit of suppliers to the buyer may be used, and does not interrupt the second phase procedure. The main contribution of this paper is illustrating the benefits of the phase II view toward supplier selection. However, we develop a new procedure, that well is suited to phase II and validate it in Section 4. The developed method considers a number of supplier selection aspects, and results in values that may be utilized to a greater degree, compared to the methods of the literature. We develop a value function (VF) and use it to compare each supplier by the criteria chosen by the buyer. The below points define the basis of VF, which are summarized in Fig. 2
                        :

                           
                              1.
                              VF calculates a comparable “value” for all potential suppliers. The value of a supplier is calculated based on the “worth” of that supplier, on a set of criteria. Each criterion is of different importance to the buyer, and the weighted average of criteria worth gives the final supplier value. The worth of a criterion is calculated by comparing its “score” to that of the buyer’s needs. The score of a criterion denotes the quantity or measure of a supplier in that criterion (e.g. offered price by the supplier in criterion price). In summary, we aim to calculate a value for each supplier, which is the weighted average of the supplier’s worth in all criteria, and the worth of each criterion is calculated based on its score offered by the supplier. The terms value, worth, and score are used only in this definition throughout the paper.

A criterion worth is evaluated based on an interest interval. The interest interval consists of two threshold: an over-qualification threshold, and an unacceptable threshold. Both thresholds are buyer-dependent, meaning that different buyers may have different measures for these thresholds.

Exceeding the over-qualification threshold, or falling from the unacceptable threshold is criterion dependent. If a criterion with high scores is favorable (e.g. high scores in quality), then exceeding the over-qualification threshold corresponds to moving above the over-qualification threshold; and falling from the unacceptable threshold corresponds to moving below the unacceptable threshold. Similarly if a criterion with low scores is favorable (e.g. low scores in price), then exceeding the over-qualification threshold corresponds to moving below the over-qualification threshold; and falling from the unacceptable threshold corresponds to moving above the unacceptable threshold.

If the score of a criterion exceeds the over-qualification threshold of that criterion, the worth of that criterion is set to a maximum worth, irrelevant to the criterion’s score. Doing so prevents over-qualified suppliers from receiving any worth in the criteria, where the score exceeds the over-qualification threshold. Note that over-qualification in a criterion does not penalize the supplier, but does not lead to additional value either.

A penalty is incurred for any criterion with scores falling from the unacceptable threshold. In other words, if the score of a criterion falls from the unacceptable threshold, the worth of that criterion decreases at a higher rate than when inside the interest interval. This additional decrease penalizes suppliers failing to meet the buyer’s requirements.

The discussed attributes are commonly (however, in most cases not simultaneously) considered in the literature (e.g. AHP and outranking methods). For example, the over-qualification attribute is indirectly applied in AHP methods. To further elaborate, consider a buyer comparing two suppliers by the delivery lead time criterion. Now consider that supplier 1 has a delivery lead time of 7 days, and supplier 2 has a delivery lead time of 1 day. If the buyer requires supply within a week, with no preference, or advantage on earlier deliveries, then this buyer determines no preference between the suppliers in delivery lead time, by the AHP method. We introduce the over-qualification threshold to capture this aspect of supplier selection

Attribute 5 considers the case where the buyer starts suffering from a criterion falling from its required score. This required score is captured by the unacceptable threshold in this paper. For example a firm may afford the increase in price until a certain point when purchasing goods. However, beyond that certain point, the increase in price results in loss or unacceptable profits. In other words the rise in price affects the buyer to a greater degree, hence, the need for a greater decrease in the worth of criterion price. Another example is where the lack of quality moves beyond what the buyer seeks to offer to its customers. While customers may tolerate a lack of quality to a point, moving beyond that point results in the loss of customers. Determining how unacceptable scores affect the worth of a criterion depends on the buyer’s research and judgement. Without loss of generality we consider a linear penalty cost. Note that setting a high penalty represents a hard constraint. For example if the buyer refuses to accept a delivery lead time of more than a certain duration, the penalty for lead time may be set very high.

The developed VF aims to produce and use an interest interval based on the buyer’s needs for each criterion. All relevant criteria to the buyer are used to determine the total value of the supplier. The parameters of VF are defined on a set of i ∈ I = {1, 2, …, m} criteria and j ∈ J = {1, 2, …, n} suppliers. Let αi
                         denote the weight assigned to criterion i, representing its relative importance to other criteria (0 ≤ αi
                         ≤ 10). These important measures are determined based on management judgement. A coefficient βi
                         is defined which respectively equals 1 or − 1, if criterion i is desired to have high scores (e.g. quality) or low scores (e.g. price). The lower bound is denoted by Li
                        , and corresponds to the unacceptable threshold if β = 1, or the over-qualification threshold if β = −1. Similarly Ui
                         denotes the upper bound of criterion i, and corresponds to the over-qualification threshold if β = 1, or the unacceptable threshold if β = −1. Fig. 3
                         illustrates the correspondence of the upper and lower bounds with the two defined thresholds. The penalty coefficient is denoted as Fi
                        , and comes into effect when criterion i falls from the unacceptable threshold. Parameters Ui, Li, Fi
                         are calculated by economical equations commonly used in the industry. The interested reader is referred to Hirshleifer, Glazer, and Hirshleifer (2005) for available method to derive such measures.

The VF starts by calculating the worth of each criterion i, in all suppliers j. This is achieved by (1):

The VF considers the buyer’s desirability as the main criteria, and gives more realistic values which represent the supplier’s fit rather than its preference or rank compared to other suppliers. These values are more suited to phase II, compared to supplier preference measures or their rank.

The proposed approach may be used for suppliers with several components, or in other words, for multi-commodity supplier selection. In such cases, every aspect of the components is treated as a separate criterion of that supplier. For example if the supplier is under consideration for two commodities, and one criterion of selection is component price, then the price of each commodity is treated as two separate selection criteria i ∈ I. In that regard, each criterion of score price gives a worth in function

                              ,
                           
                         and contributes to the overall supplier value wj
                        .

The overall value of suppliers wj
                         should only be used as a comparison measure. A negative wj
                         has no significant meaning, as the algorithm above only compares the offered criterion scores, offered by the suppliers, to the mean requested by the buyer. The least negative (or more positive) wj
                         is the better supplier it represents. However, implementing wj
                         into the portfolio model requires it to be positive. Since the addition of an equal value to each wj
                         has no affect on the comparison process, it is arranged that the absolute value of the minimum calculated wj
                        , plus one, be added to all suppliers’ values. This results in the minimum calculated value to be 1, which is acceptable for the future calculations in the portfolio model.

This concludes the first phase of the supplier selection procedure presented in this paper. The next section introduces the portfolio model into the selection procedure.

Phase I alone may be used to determine the best available suppliers to date. Phase I procedures use the scores of supplier, available at the time of the decision making. However, choosing the best suppliers by the static available criteria scores is not fit for the strategic decision of supplier selection. Not considering the trend of change in suppliers may provide to be semi-optimal in the future, regardless of the method used to determine the best suppliers. We aim to develop a model, that not only tracks the changes of supplier values throughout time, but also minimizes the risk of failure. Some suppliers are affected in similar ways to certain disruptions, and selecting such similar suppliers may be crucial when such disruptions occur. This approach is different to stochastically considering suppliers. We aim to consider the correlation between suppliers in the long run. Short term disruption approaches can be simply considered in phase I, and are independent of phase II. We propose using the portfolio theory to reach the above goals.

The main idea of using the portfolio theory in supplier selection is to assess and maintain better fit suppliers, for a longer time, and to minimize risk in value correlation between suppliers. While the portfolio theory is commonly used as an investment control model, it serves a different meaning here. Using the portfolio theory does not mean the buyer is investing in the suppliers, and seeks a higher rate of return in the future. We rather seek to choose suppliers which maintain higher values of phase I, and are negatively correlated for a lower risk. To do so we calculate the value of each supplier by VF, in a number of previous periods (historical data) from the time of the decision making. This results in a time series showing each supplier’s past values, and increase or decrease rate. Using this data, the development or fall of each supplier, and its covariance with other suppliers is calculated.

The amount of required historical data depends on the aim of the research. Periodic times may be chosen as small intervals (e.g. weeks) if recent changes are sought, or new suppliers with little data have emerged, or may be chosen larger (e.g. 6 months, years, etc.), if the long standing of suppliers is required. Considering the vast data collection of firms in today’s market, these data are easily available. Note that the development or fall of a supplier does not necessarily mean the supplier has reached a stronger or weaker position, but rather it has moved toward, or away from the criteria scores the buyer seeks.

We consider three objectives in our portfolio model. The first objective is to maximize the development of suppliers. To do so, we use the same logic as maximizing the rate of return in financial investments. The rate of return of financial investments may be calculated by existing methods in the literature (Hancock, 2005; MacLean, Foster, and Ziemba, 2007; Remer and Nieto, 1995), however the development or fall of suppliers has a slightly different meaning. In supplier selection the term “rate of return” represents the supplier’s change in value. The purpose of calculating the rate of return in suppliers is to obtain their change throughout time. A supplier’s increase in value represents its increase of fit to the buyer, and not necessarily gained profit as in financial investments. For example, consider a change of value from 5 to 10, and a change of value from 10 to 5. Clearly, the development and fall percentage should be equal in both cases. This is justified by the fact that the same change in the supplier’s criteria has caused the supplier’s value alteration. This is unlike a financial investment, where the initial value plays a more significant part, and the percentage of change from 10 to 5 is lower than the percentage of change from 5 to 10. Therefore we use (8) to calculate the rate of return of suppliers in specific periods of t ∈ T = {1, 2, …, l} (e.g. every 6 months, year etc.), and use its average Rj
                         to gain the expected value of each supplier’s rate of return.

The second objective of the portfolio model is to minimize risk by minimizing the covariance between suppliers. The covariance between suppliers j and j′ is calculated by (10), and also takes into account the variance (stability) of each supplier by itself.

Generally, maximizing the rate of return and minimizing the covariance between assets are the main objectives of portfolio optimization. However, in this paper the portfolio theory is applied to suppliers, as opposed to financial investments. In this case, the average value of a supplier throughout time is also of importance, as well as its potential development. While an investor may benefit by selling a stock share after its increase in price, regardless of its starting value, a supplier’s value at each stage reflects its ability to match the buyer’s requirements. The buyer is influenced by the supplier’s value throughout time, and may even choose a slowly declining supplier with a high average value, rather than a rapidly rising supplier with a lower average value. This is justified because the first supplier meets the buyer’s requirements more efficiently. Hence, we introduce a third objective of maximizing the average value of a supplier throughout time. The average value of a supplier between periods t to t′ is calculated as:

The required parameters to formulate the portfolio model are now calculated. Supplier j has a capacity of cj
                         and a minimum order quantity of bj
                        . Let y
                        max denote the maximum number of suppliers the buyer seeks. Let xj
                         denote the fraction of demand purchased from supplier j, and yj
                         denote the binary variable determining supplier selection. The supplier selection model is formulated as:

Objective function (12) maximizes the development of suppliers. Objective (13) maximizes the average value of the portfolio, and objective (14) minimizes risk. Constraint (15) ensures demand satisfaction, and constraint (16) restricts the number of selected suppliers to y
                        max. Constraints (17) restrict the amount of product to be greater than the minimum order quantity, and lower than supplier j’s capacity. Constraints (18) are the binary and non-negativity requirements on the decision variables. Without loss of generality we do not implement any complicated constraints as it moves beyond the objective of this paper. We only aim to show the benefits of using the portfolio theory in supplier selection. Any other improvements can be added to this model if required.

The proposed portfolio model is a multi-objective MIP formulation. The solution approaches to multi-objective optimization are reviewed in Marler and Arora (2004). Considering the similar nature of the first two objective functions, the weighting method is applicable in our problem. However, the third objective function is not as the same nature as the first two objective functions, and should not be simply added to the other objectives, using the weighting method. To solve this problem, and assuming a priority of the first two objectives to the buyer, the model is linearized through a mixture of the weighting method and a modified lexicographic method. Using the weighting method and lexicographic method in this setting is proven to be efficient in supplier selection (Sawik, 2009). The first two objectives are formed into a single objective using the weighted method, and thereafter a modified lexicographic method is used to solve the derived bi-objective model. For a fair comparison of the first and second objectives, we normalize the first objective by dividing all values by their interval (as Rj
                         may be positive or negative) as in (19) and normalize the second objectives by the traditional method of (20):

                        Finally, suppliers are selected by a modified lexicographic method. In the traditional lexicographic method, the third objective would be considered as a secondary aim only, and can be improved, only if it does not lower the first two objectives. To provide a trade-off between risk and value, we introduce coefficient Γ into the lexicographic method. This value enables a buffer interval to reduce risk, while maintaining a Γ fraction of the initial objective value (21).

                        where v(*) denotes the objective value of problem (*). [P1] is a simple MIP model and [P2] has a quadratic objective formulation. Both models are easily solved by commercial MIP solvers. This concludes the supplier selection procedure introduced by this paper.

In this section we illustrate the benefits of the two-stage supplier selection model. First, we compare the first phase VF method used to obtain the value of suppliers, to the AHP method extensively used in the literature. Then, we implement the portfolio model of phase II, and show its benefits compared to static procedures of phase I. The aim is to show that the initial supplier selection decision by the proposed method will most likely be more robust than phase I methods. That is, the initial selected supplier will most likely remain the best choice throughout all periods.

We simulate six suppliers, in twelve periods, and evaluate them by the four criteria of price (measured in currency), quality (on a scale of 1–100), delivery lead time (measured in days), and financial position (on a scale of 1–10). At each period it is assumed that we only know the past information of all suppliers, and all evaluations are based on these available data. This simulates a supplier selection based on various amounts of available data, and also enables us to analyze how the supplier selection methods change their solution with more available data. In other words, we seek to observe the change in solution of the methods throughout time, which is done by re-running the algorithms in all periods. Note that this is done only to observe the solutions, and their possible differences, which provide the basis of our analysis. The input parameters of phase I are given in Table 1
                     , and all supplier data is given in Table 6 at the end of the paper.

Each supplier is simulated to represent a different scenario, and differs in at least one characteristic. Characteristics are the starting fit to buyer, change of fit to buyer, and stability (variance in change). To have a better comparison, we exclude scenarios that do not offer any insight into the selection procedure. These scenarios either dominate, or are dominated by other considered scenarios. For example, we exclude low fit suppliers with declining, or no change in fit, as they are never selected under any method; and high fit stable suppliers with increasing fit, as they are always selected. The characteristics of all considered scenarios is presented in Table 2
                     .

We compare phase I with the well-known method of AHP. A traditional AHP method is used as it is the nearest method to our algorithm, and gives relatively similar values to assess suppliers. To have a fair comparison, both algorithms are assumed under a deterministic environment in each period. Any improvements of AHP (e.g. the fuzzy AHP) are irrelevant, as any improvement or real-life condition may also be implemented into our algorithm. The pairwise comparison of the AHP method is executed by mathematically comparing the value of each criterion, between each supplier. The preference weight of each criterion is calculated by normalizing the αi
                         values. Fig. 5
                         shows the results of VF in phase I, and the preference values of the AHP method. Note that the AHP method is primarily used as a tool to rank the suppliers in terms of preference. Therefore its graph represents the change of preference and not value.

We evaluate the first two chosen suppliers by both methods as presented in Table 3
                        . Both methods choose the same suppliers in all periods except 1, 3, and 7. In these periods VF and AHP defer in at most one of the two chosen suppliers. The difference of value between these supplier is not significant and both methods are very similar in choosing the eligible suppliers in static periods. The main difference lies in the nature of results given by both methods. AHP results in a preference value. This value changes based on its comparison to other suppliers. Therefore it is possible that a supplier has no change in its criteria, but presents a higher preference. For example if all other suppliers fall in value, and supplier 1 has no change, AHP calculates a higher preference for supplier 1, compared to its previous preference. VF, however, results in a value of fit to the buyer. This value is independent of other suppliers, so its change only represents the change of that supplier alone. Therefore, VF is more suited to be applied to the portfolio model in the second phase.

In this section, we show that the static procedures of phase I are not suitable for the strategic decision of supplier selection. We show that by applying the portfolio model, a more robust group of suppliers may be selected. That is, the portfolio model will most likely, select suppliers that remain the best choice throughout all periods, rather than only the initial selection period. We show this by running the selection procedures of phases I and II in all periods, and observing the results. The selection procedure that gives the most high value suppliers throughout time, and results in a lower number of change in all periods is considered to be more suitable for the strategic decision of supplier selection. In other words the procedure that benefits the buyer by a better initial supplier selection, and leads to a lower need for supplier replacement, is considered superior. We only re-run the selection procedures to observe their solution throughout time. We seek to observe the change in procedure solutions, as more data is revealed in time. This re-run of the supplier selection procedure in every period is not a requirement, but could be used to evaluate selected supplier if required.

We first compare the solution of model [P1] with the results of VF. Thereafter we analyze the effects of including risk into the supplier selection procedure, by comparing the solutions of models [P1] and [P2]. Finally, we examine the sensitivity of [P2] to the coefficient of Γ. To execute the comparison, portfolio models [P1] and [P2] are solved at different time periods. At each period it is assumed that all previous data is known. Therefore, the solution of the portfolio models at each period represents the supplier selection procedure based on the historical data of previous periods. To perform all comparisons, we use periods 1–5 as warm up for [P1] and [P2]. These models present varying results in these periods, as only a small amount of data is used, and predictably, the addition of new data at each period affects (19) and (20) to a large degree.


                        Table 4
                         gives the results of VF, [P1], and [P2] for periods 5–12, with y
                        max = 2, bj
                         = 50, and cj
                         = 300. Results are compared by the average value (value), development (Devl), covariance (Covar), and the number of answers (Ans) resulted by each method. The average value and development are derived by calculating (19) and (20) for the selected suppliers at each time period, and then taking the average on the number of time periods. Average covariance is the sum of the variance of selected suppliers plus the covariance between them.

To illustrate the shortcomings of phase I we compare VF with [P1]. The solution of VF could only be fairly compared to the solution of [P1] with I
                        1 = 0, I
                        2 = 1. This setting only considers the value of suppliers in the selection process, as consistent with VF. Results show that VF results in a lower average value of suppliers throughout time. Although VF chooses the first two highest suppliers in terms of their value at each static period, those suppliers maintain a lower average value during all periods. Using VF, the results show different chosen suppliers at each period. Five different combination of suppliers were chosen by VF. Also in all consecutive periods except period 5–6, the selected suppliers are always changed. This is highly infeasible as no firm can maintain this amount of change, and also represent poor supplier selection decisions in each period. The buyer would thus require higher efforts to assess and develop selected suppliers, and is in most cases faced with the dilemma of keeping chosen suppliers, or replacing them with the new superior suppliers. The average improvement and covariance of selected suppliers by VF is also unpredictable as selection is solely based on the value at static periods. In our example VF resulted in a higher average improvement with a higher risk of stability. Solving [P1], however, considers the average value and development of suppliers throughout time. As observed, only one combination of suppliers is chosen which also maintains a higher average value in time, hence more stable decisions are possible. In summary, [P1] results in a 7.6 percent higher average value of suppliers throughout time, and presents 80 percent less change of suppliers.

Comparing [P1] and [P2] shows the effects of considering risk into the supplier selection procedure. Solving [P1] only considers the average value and improvement of suppliers, while [P2] finds the minimum covariance of suppliers, while maintaining a fraction of v([P1]). Table 4 gives the results of [P1] and [P2] for different values of I
                        1 and I
                        2. Results of both [P1] and [P2] show that increasing I
                        1 (decreasing I
                        2) increases improvement of suppliers at the cost of decreasing their average value in time. Increasing improvement is also consistent with increasing risk (covariance). Compared to [P1], [P2] increases the value of selected suppliers by 1.45 percent but reduces improvement by 26.88 percent. However, the incurred risk decreases by 31.51 percent. Therefore [P2] results in a lower risk of selection while maintaining a certain value and improvement of selected suppliers.

Model [P1] moves from choosing high value suppliers 1 and 2, at higher values of I
                        2, to choosing high improvement suppliers 5 and 6, at higher values of I
                        1. Even though suppliers 2 and 6 are relatively unstable, [P1] does not take any risk factor into consideration. The number of answers is averaged at 2.4 meaning [P1] is consistent when choosing suppliers, and requires very little change in each period. These results provide much better insights and aid to the purchasing department for choosing suppliers compared to the static methods of phase I. When introducing risk in [P2], the chosen suppliers relatively stay the same and only differ slightly. The reason unstable suppliers 2 and 6 are still chosen lies in the covariance between suppliers. Minimizing covariance means that unstable suppliers may be chosen if they have a negative covariance to the other selected suppliers. In other words even though a supplier may be unstable in its change, it has a negative covariance with the other selected supplier. Hence the risk of portfolio failure is minimized by the definition that even if one supplier declines, the other selected supplier has a high chance of improving and satisfying supply needs. The supplier portfolio therefore takes into account the relationship of potential suppliers. If the objective is minimizing instability of suppliers without considering their relationship, we can set all covariance values to 0 and only include the variance in Eq. (10).

To analyze the trade-off between risk and v([P1]), we decrease Γ form 1 to 0.7 in increments of 0.1. Table 5
                        
                         gives the results. When Γ = 1, the traditional lexicographic method is carried out which results in the same suppliers chosen by [P1], therefore, showing no room to decrease risk. As Γ decreases, [P2] results in lower risks and improvement, and slightly increases the average value of selected suppliers. Comparing Γ = 1 to Γ = 0.7 average value is increased by 4.5 percent, and improvement and covariance are decreased by 45.26 percent and 63.16 percent. In other words risk is reduced by selecting higher value suppliers with higher stabilities, and consequently lower chance of development.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper introduces a novel two-phase approach to supplier selection. The first phase is consistent with available supplier selection methods and derives a value for each supplier based on its criteria. By defining value as fit to buyer, suppliers are chosen based on their eligibility to the buyer itself. The second phase uses the values calculated in phase I, in a multi-objective MIP portfolio model. The portfolio model maximizes the average value of suppliers and their improvement throughout time, and minimizes the instability and covariance between selected suppliers. Compared to the static procedures of phase I, phase II considers aspects such as the value of suppliers throughout time, their development or fall, and their stability in service.

The proposed model was tested on a set of different scenarios and presented 80 percent lower need of change in periodic evaluations, 7.6 percent higher value of suppliers throughout time, and the possibility of supplier development. The overall risk of the supplier portfolio (instability of suppliers) was reduced by an average 31.5 percent. Results show that better supplier may be initially selected by the proposed approach, that may lead to a lower chance of requiring replacement. In other words, the problem of either keeping previously selected suppliers and trying to nurture and develop them, rather than selecting better emerged suppliers and starting a new buyer–supplier relationship, is lowered.

Better insights into supplier values and improvements, and the option of choosing trade-offs between value, development, and risk were also achieved. In particular it was observed that reduction in covariance is highly correlated to reduction in supplier development, and had little effect on overall portfolio value. By allowing more trade-off between value/development and risk, a reduction of 63 percent in risk was observed while supplier development was also reduced by 45 percent. Portfolio value remained fairly constant, and even showed an increase of 4.5 percent.

Future research may be carried out by introducing more constraints and decision criteria into model [P]. For example, a replacement cost may be inserted into the model to assess whether it is optimal to replace current suppliers with other emerging options, or to remain with previously selected companies. Any other real life constraints considered in the literature may be added to the current model to assess the effects of phase II. An interesting research direction is supplier nurture versus better supplier selection. A comparison may be carried out to investigate pre and post selection efforts on reaching an optimal supplier portfolio, in addition to their collaboration and its results.
