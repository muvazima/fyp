                  Our paper contributes to the literature of technology adoption. In most of these models it is assumed that the intensity rate of new arrivals is constant. We extend this approach by assuming that after the last technology jump the intensity of a new arrival can change. Right after the arrival of a new technology the intensity equals a specific value that switches if no new technology arrival has taken place within a certain period after the last technology arrival. We look at different scenarios, dependent on whether the firm is threatened by a drop in the arrival rate after a certain time period or expects the rate to rise. We analyze the effect of a mean preserving spread of the time between two consecutive arrivals on the optimal investment timing and show that larger variance can accelerate investment in case the arrival rate rises while it can decelerate investment in case the arrival rate drops. We find that firms often adopt a new technology a time lag after its introduction, which is a phenomenon frequently observed in practice. Regarding a firm’s technology releasing strategy we explain why additional uncertainty can stimulate customers’ buying behavior. The optimal adoption timing changes significantly, depending on whether the arrival rate is assumed to change or be constant over time. Adding uncertainty about the length of the time period after which the arrival intensity changes, we find that increasing uncertainty accelerates investment, a result that is opposite to the standard real options theory.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The trend in innovation arrivals regarding capabilities of digital electronic devices is strongly linked to the famous statement of Gordon E. Moore about computing hardware. He described that ‘the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years’. Observed over several periods of decades we see that several measures of digital technology are improving at exponential rates related to Moore’s law, including the size, cost, density and speed of components. Processing speed, memory capacity and sensors, all of these are improving at (roughly) exponential rates as well. His law is now used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development. However on the other hand, managers have to consider that this technological innovation progress has natural boundaries. At some point the physical possibilities of improvement are exhausted. This means that the rate of improvements approaches zero at some point. Ignoring this fact, and instead assuming that technological improvements evolve at exponential rates forever, would lead to crucial mistakes in a firm’s technology adoption decisions. However, the literature of technology adoption widely assumes that arrival rates for technological innovations are constant. This assumption has been made among others in Farzin, Huisman, and Kort (1998) and Huisman (2001). In this paper we want to relax this assumption and assume that the arrival rate of technological innovation changes.

Another example of technology adoption decisions where arrival rates should not be considered as constant, is typical for the consumer electronics industry. Big companies like Apple, release new improved versions of their most popular electronic devices on a regular basis. Apple released, for example, a first version of the iPod Mini in February 2004 and announced a second generation of the iPod Mini in February of the following year. In September 2005 Apple officially discontinued the iPod Mini line and replaced it by the iPod Nano. The first generation of iPod Nano was replaced by the second generation in September 2006. From then on Apple has updated the iPod Nano on a regular basis every year,

 for a graphical illustration of the time line of iPod models and the releases of improved versions from 2001 on.
                      while rarely giving information about new products before their official announcement and release. Therewith the company creates additional uncertainty about the release schedules of their new products. From the point of view of a single consumer this means that right after the release of a new iPod Nano generation, one does not expect a new release soon. However, after one year without any release, one would expect Apple to announce a new series of the product line. In this paper we raise the question of how such a product release policy would influence the consumer’s consumption behavior.

In this paper, we investigate a firm that decides about technology adoption with an investment to change from old to new technology facing uncertain timing of future technology improvements. The technological process advances exogenously to the firm. A large fixed cost occurs upon the adoption, which becomes a sunk cost because technology choice is irreversible. We assume that the arrival rate is changing over time, unlike the assumption of constant arrival prevalent in the technology adoption literature. Specifically, we assume a specific arrival rate to be present right after the last technology arrival. This arrival rate changes (increase/decrease) to another value if no arrival should take place for a certain time period (of Δ time units) since the last technology arrival. We do not impose a specific ordering of these two values of the arrival rate, which allows to look at two different scenarios that constitute for different technology adoption environments faced by firms or customers.

We add to a strand of papers that started with early work of Baldwin (1982), Balcer and Lippman (1984) as well as McCardle (1985). For an extensive survey about decision theoretic models of technology adoption see Huisman (2001) and Hoppe (2002).

Our approach to extend the technology adoption literature is closest related to Huisman (2001, Chapter 2). Huisman (2001) introduces an approach to technology adoption timing decisions in a real options context and extends the traditional decision theoretic models on technology adoption with a model in which the technologies arrive according to a Poisson process. We briefly explain Huisman’s basic model, which forms the starting point for our work, in Section 2.1. Huisman (2001) studies the optimal time to irreversibly switch to a new technology when the value and the arrival date of future improvements are uncertain. Technology advances according to a compound Poisson process with constant arrival rate. As in Huisman (2001) we model the technological process with a Poisson process but assume that the arrival rate changes.

Three recent papers dealing with technology adoption are Smith and Ulu (2012), Kwon (2010) and Cho and McCardle (2009). Smith and Ulu (2012) study a general model of technology adoption in which time is finite and discrete and a firm faces uncertainty on both costs and quality. They solve their model for three investment decision models: NPV, single adoption, multiple adoption. Due to their general model setup their focus is on deriving structural properties of the value function and the optimal policies. The focus of this paper is to study the effect on the adoption strategy when the arrival rate of new technologies changes over time. Kwon (2010) focuses upon investment and exit decisions of a firm facing a declining profit stream. The firm can continue operation, exit or use the one time option to undertake an investment that boosts the project’s profit rate. This leads to the result that in case of a sufficiently large profit boost upon investment, this investment threshold decreases with volatility. Cho and McCardle (2009) investigate the role of economic and stochastic technological dependence on the adoption of multiple type of new technologies. They show that the dependence among different types of technologies has a material impact on a firm’s adoption decisions. This impact is not unidirectional, it can either delay or expedite the adoption of an improved technology.

In this paper we study the technology adoption decision of a single

                        2
                        The main focus is the effect of changing arrival rate on the investment behavior. A natural extension would be to extend to a competitive setting. There is a large strand of literature in which the strategic effects of technology adoption are studied (see Hoppe, 2002; Huisman, 2001).
                      firm in the absence of strategic considerations. We describe the firm’s adoption decision as the solution of an infinite horizon dynamic programming problem in a continuous time setting.

                        3
                        
                           Alvarez and Stenbacka (2001) develop a different mathematical approach based on the Green representation of Markovian functionals for finding the optimal exercise thresholds both of the ordinary real option associated with the updating decision and of the compound real option associated with the incumbent technology.
                      The firm decides about the optimal moment to adopt a new technology, while it currently uses a less efficient technology. The improvement in the value of the available technology follows a compound Poisson process and evolves exogenously to the firm. Technologies become more valuable over time. At each moment in time the firm learns whether an innovation occurs or not.

We focus our analysis on the optimal adoption strategies of a firm facing changing arrival rate, also in comparison to the results of a constant arrival rate model. We introduce possible applications and analyze numerical examples suited to those in order to gain more insight about the optimal timing strategy for technology adoption in specific scenarios. Our numerical results suggest that a firm expecting a decrease in the arrival rate after a certain period without any arrival, should apply a different adoption timing strategy than a firm assuming constant arrival rate forever. In case a firm is confronted with a lower arrival rate right after the last technology arrival, it should invest later than a firm that considers constant arrival intensity forever.

We find that in some cases the firm optimally adopts a new technology a time lag after the innovation took place. In fact our analysis shows that the probability of a time lag between innovation and adoption can be substantially high. Introducing a model with changing arrival rate allows to account for the fact that firms often adopt new technology a time lag after its arrival. This has been criticized by Cho and McCardle (2009) in the following way: “due to the assumption of the memoryless and stationary probability distribution, their model (Huisman’s (2001) model) does not explain a time lag between the occurrence of an innovation and its adoption”. Doraszelski (2004) gives the same kind of criticism and concludes that the firm may have an incentive to delay adoption of a new technology until it is sufficiently advanced. While McCardle (1985) argues that such a time lag can be explained by a firm’s uncertainty regarding the profit potential of a new technology, we show (as in Balcer and Lippman, 1984) in this paper that such a phenomenon can be also explained by prevalent uncertainty about the arrival of new technology.

Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the variance of time between two consecutive technology innovations on the firm’s adoption decision while keeping the expected time between two technology arrivals fixed. The introduction of a changing arrival rate to the basic problem introduced by Huisman (2001) adds to the significance of our results by one additional degree of freedom. Which effect increasing variance has on the technology adoption decision depends on the scenario considered as well as the specific changes in parameters. In case the arrival rate would increase if no new arrival takes place within a certain time period Δ after the last technology arrival, we find that increasing variance by increasing the arrival rate before time Δ while decreasing it after time Δ, decelerates technology adoption. Regarding a firm’s product release strategy we can conclude that it can accelerate the buying behavior of its customers by creating additional uncertainty about its release schedule. In general we find that the effect of the variance on the investment strategy is strongly depending on the specific parameter choices. We therefore conclude that a good assessment of the arrival probabilities is essential. Assuming a constant arrival rate per se can lead to wrong strategy decisions. Furthermore, we find that increasing variance decreases the probability that the firm will adopt a better technology a time lag after it has been introduced.

In a further step we generalize the problem so that the moment at which the arrival rate switches is not known to the firm beforehand but assumed to be stochastic. This generalization leads to the result that increasing uncertainty accelerates investment, a result opposite to the standard real options result.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model with changing arrival rate and characterize the optimal investment policy. Section 3 continues with comparative statics of the optimal adoption policy and presents two numerical examples. In Section 4 we extend our analysis to the fact that the moment of change in arrival rate is not known by the firm but uncertain. Section 5 concludes.

In the following we present the technology arrival model that we consider along the paper. We closely follow notation and assumptions presented in Huisman (2001, Chapter 2, single switch case), where a constant instead of a changing arrival rate is assumed. In the remainder of this paper, we refer to this model with constant rate as the standard model.

We consider a risk-neutral firm, whose profit flow is determined by its own technology choice. Π(θ) denotes the profit function which is increasing in the technology level, i.e.

                           The profit function could, for example, be derived from a standard Cobb–Douglas production function equal to h(v, θ) = θγva
                              , where v( ≥ 0) is a variable input, θ( ≥ 0) is the efficiency parameter, and a ∈ (0, 1) and γ ≥ 0 represent the constant output elasticities of labor and technology (represented as input capital), respectively. Assuming that the output price and the input price are fixed and equal to p and w, respectively, the profit flow equal Π(θ) = max 
                                 v

                               − wv). This yields the following expression for the profit flow of the firm, Π(θ) = ϕθb

                         The firm maximizes its value over an infinite planning horizon. The discount rate r( > 0) is assumed to be constant. At the beginning of the planning horizon the firm produces with a technology whose efficiency equals ξ

                        0 and u > 0. Xt
                         denotes the time elapsed since the last technological improvement, and the sequence {Xt
                        } is a sequence of inter-renewal times. Moreover, we assume that this is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables.

Regarding the arrival rate: we assume that right after a technology arrival has happened the arrival rate is equal to λ
                        1( ≥ 0). If no arrival should happen for a time period of length Δ the arrival rate changes to λ
                        2( > 0). λ
                        2 is assumed to be strictly positive. We will denote the interval between the last arrival and Δ region 1 and the interval after Δ region 2. Therefore, the arrival rate is formally given by

                        where 1{A} is equal to one if A is true. We remark that if in Equation (3) we set Δ = ∞, so that λ(Xt
                        ) is constant and equal to λ
                        1, we recover the case addressed by Huisman (2001), the standard model.

Considering the changing arrival rate, the process {(θt, Xt
                        ), t ≥ 0}, as defined in Equation (1), is a non-stationary Poisson process. This process belongs to the group of piecewise-deterministic Markov processes that were formally addressed as a class of processes by Davis (1984).

This approach allows us to model a range of practical problems we had in mind, for example the characteristics in technological innovation process in the CPU transistor industry or the product release strategy of an electronics company, while maintaining still a certain degree of analytical tractability of the problem. In Section 4 we will extend the presented model assuming random Δ.

                        2, where the weights reflect the probabilities of ending up in each region. For example, 
                           
                              e
                              
                                 −
                                 
                                    λ
                                    1
                                 
                                 Δ
                              
                           
                         is the probability of having an arrival in region 2. Since the probability of having an arrival in region 2 equals 1 in the special case that λ
                        1 = 0, Equation (8) simplifies to Equation (6). As in Huisman (2001) we will also assume that the firm cannot influence the innovation itself, i.e. the arrival rate is assumed exogenous to the firm.

The firm can adopt a new technology by paying a sunk cost I( > 0). For simplicity and tractability we assume that the firm can invest only once.

The problem addressed concerns the timing of the firm’s technology switch. The firm needs to decide when to change from producing with old technology ξ
                        0 to producing with an improved one. The problem the firm faces is an optimal stopping problem, defined mathematically as follows:

                        is the termination payoff at time t, which is equal to the firm’s value at the moment (t) it adopts the technology with value θ. For ease of notation we will denote V(θ, 0) simply by V(θ) throughout the rest of the paper. Here stopping means that the firm invests and thus adopts a new technology and continuation resembles waiting with investing. We are looking for the optimal time τ that maximizes the expected value of the firm, which is denoted by

In the standard model, as shown in Huisman (2001), there is a unique value of θt
                         for which the firm is indifferent between investing and waiting. Moreover, we can show that this adoption threshold is increasing in the arrival rate λ for concave profit flow functions. We will use this result multiple times in proofs concerning the changing arrival rate case. This result is supported numerically in Huisman (2001).

                           Proposition 2
                           For concave profit function Π(.), the optimal adoption threshold is increasing in the arrival rate, i.e., if θ*(λ) denotes the threshold when the arrival rate is λ then for λ

Firms facing higher speed of innovations are investing in better technologies. However, one cannot conclude automatically that they also invest later, since both the speed of arrival and the desired technology level are increasing. Still in the standard model, we are able to prove that the firm will adopt a new technology only at its arrival date:

                           Proposition 3
                           In the standard model, the set of decision moments is equal to {t: Xt
                               = 0}.

Adopting a technology sometime after its arrival could only be optimal if either investment costs would go down, the firm would neglect discounting or it could gain information about the likelihood of the next arrival by waiting.

In case the arrival rate changes over time, there are two moments for each new technology at which the firm should consider adoption. The first one is still the moment of arrival of new technology. The second is the moment that the arrival rate changes in case Δ time units have passed since the last arrival without any new technology arrival, i.e. at Xt
                         = Δ. Proposition 4 determines the set of decision moments formally.

                           Proposition 4
                           If the arrival rate of new technologies is defined by Equation (3), the set of decision moments of the optimal stopping problem in (10) is equal to {t: Xt
                               = 0 or Xt
                               = Δ}.

The fact that the decision moment Xt
                         = Δ has to be considered now as well can easily be understood by considering the case where the arrival rate would drop to zero at that time, i.e. λ
                        2 = 0. The firm then faces a now or never decision if Δ time units have passed since the last arrival of new technology. In this case the firm will only adopt the technology if the discounted value generated by the increase in profit flow exceeds the investment cost (classic net present value rule).

In deriving the optimal investment strategy, both decision moments have to be taken into account and, therefore, corresponding decision thresholds need to be determined. In particular, at the decision moment Xt
                         = Δ the decision threshold, denoted by 
                           
                              
                                 θ
                                 
                                    2

                         is defined as the value of θ for which the firm is indifferent between investing now at Xt
                         = Δ or after the next technology arrival. Therefore,

                         the firm is indifferent between investing now or after the next technology arrival. At this decision moment both arrival possibilities have to be considered. It can either be the case that the next technology arrival takes place before Δ time units have passed or after Δ time units have passed. The former we refer to in the following as “arrival of type 1” and the latter as “arrival of type 2”. The resulting value matching curve is presented in the following equation.

                               = Δ are unique if those exist. If the profit flow is convex, then the uniqueness conditioned on existence also holds as long as it holds for the standard cases (both with arrival rate λ = λ
                              1 and arrival rate λ = λ
                              2).

Considering these two thresholds the optimal investment strategy can be formalized as follows: If a new technology arrives that has efficiency θ with 
                           
                              θ
                              >
                              
                                 θ
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                                 *
                              
                           
                         it is optimal for the firm to adopt that technology at the moment of arrival. Moreover, if the efficiency of the latest technology is larger than 
                           
                              θ

                              *
                           
                         when the arrival rate changes, it is also optimal for the firm to adopt that technology. Due to the fact that there is a max operator in Equation (14) we conclude that there are two candidates for threshold

                        Proposition 7 shows that the threshold in the region with the lowest arrival rate is the smallest. A direct results of this is that it is possible that there occurs a time lag between a new technology innovation and its adoption in case that the arrival rate drops from region 1 to region 2, which is formulated in the following corollary.

                           Corollary 1
                           If λ
                              2 < λ
                              1 it is optimal for the firm to invest Δ time units after the last technology innovation if the actual technology level has increased up to level 
                                 
                                    θ

                               and Δ time units have elapsed since the last innovation without having reached threshold 
                                 
                                    θ
                                    
                                       1
                                    
                                    *
                                 
                               yet. The probability that the firm would adopt a technology Δ time units after its arrival is strictly positive.

In case the arrival rate drops after Δ time units have elapsed the firm speculates on arrivals in region 1 by setting the threshold for that region high. However, if the firm ends up in region 2 it will accept a technology with a lower efficiency due to the low probability of a new arrival. Taking into account this investment strategy one can formulate the firm’s value function. The expression of the value function is stated in Table 1
                        . In case of changing arrival rate there are two cases to be distinguished. For the case λ
                        1 < λ
                        2 the firm will consider adoption of new technology only at the arrival of new technology once the threshold 
                           
                              θ
                              
                                 1
                              
                              *

                        j scenarios have to be taken into account for the definition of the value function in this subpart. The value function is equal to the probability that the next m* − j arrivals are all in region 1 times the expected value the firm would receive by investing at the decision moment Xt
                         = 0 after these m* arrivals have taken place, plus all possible combinations that the next i = 0, …, (m* − j) arrivals are in region 1 and the (i + 1)th arrival is in region 2, times the expected value that the firm gets if it invests at decision moment Xt
                         = Δ after the ith technology arrival took place.

Knowing the optimal adoption triggers we will derive the expected value of the adoption time T*. To compare the models with constant arrival rate and changing arrival rate we first state the expected time of adoption for the model with constant arrival rate as shown in Huisman (2001).

In this section we analyze the optimal adoption strategy of a firm considering a changing arrival rate and compare the results to the adoption strategy in case the arrival rate is constant. We will consider two specific applications of the model and analyze numerical examples suited to those. The applications relate to the cases of λ
                     1 > λ
                     2 and λ
                     1 < λ
                     2, respectively. In order to compare the model with changing arrival rate to the one with constant arrival rate in a meaningful way, we choose the parameter values in such a way that the expected time between two consecutive technology arrivals is equal for both models. This means that we set the parameters of the two models in the following relation:

In case the arrival rate in region 1 is smaller than the arrival rate in region 2, only the threshold in region 1,

                      is relevant for the investment strategy. Since the firm will adopt new technology right after the arrival in region 1 or region 2, respectively, an increase in either of the arrival rates will increase the adoption threshold. This is due to the fact that the speed of the technological progress makes the firm want to adopt a technology with a higher efficiency. An increase in Δ has the opposite effect since it slows down the technological progress by increasing the period with a lower arrival rate. In case the arrival rate in region 1 is larger than the arrival rate in region 2, both thresholds are relevant for the adoption strategy. The thresholds for this case are derived as if the arrival rate does not change for region 1 and region 2, respectively. Therefore, the behavior of both thresholds is that they are increasing in λ
                     1 and λ
                     2, respectively. As explained after Proposition 6 the threshold 
                        
                           θ
                           
                              1
                           
                           *
                        
                      is therefore, also not depending on Δ in this case.

Regarding the following two numerical examples, we will first consider the case of λ
                     1 > λ
                     2. This is the case where the arrival rate of new technology is assumed to decrease if a period of Δ time units has passed without any new arrival taking place. We know that in this case the probability that the firm adopts a new technology a time lag after its release is strictly positive (see Corollary 1). That is consistent with the fact that firms in practice often adopt a new technology a time lag after its introduction.

In the following we will present an application for the case of λ
                        1 > λ
                        2, and analyze the effect of several parameters on the derived investment strategy. The application we have in mind deals with the statement of Moore’s law that describes a long-term trend in the history of computing hardware. It suggests that “the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. This trend has continued for more than half a century and is expected to continue until 2015, 2020, or later” ,

                         when the possibilities of further improvement are exhausted.

We will show on the basis of the following numerical example that the probability that a firm will adopt a new innovation with a time lag between innovation and adoption can be substantially high in case the arrival rate in region 1 is higher than the arrival rate in region 2, i.e. λ
                        1 > λ
                        2. Inspired by the statement of Moore’s law and the characteristics in technological innovation process in the CPU transistor sector we introduce the following example.

Assume that on average an innovation takes place every two years, i.e. 
                           
                              E
                              [
                              Y
                              ]
                              =
                              2
                           
                        . Δ is equal to 3. The arrival rate in region 1, λ
                        1, ranges from 0.75 to 1.75 with λ
                        2 aligned so that 
                           
                              E
                              [
                              Y
                              ]
                           
                         is for all cases equal to 2. The investment costs for a new technology are equal to I = 500. The step size with which the technology process increases by technology arrival is given with u = 0.5. In order to model the fact that a new innovation doubles the efficiency of technology (for example the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit considering the example of computing hardware) we choose a profit function that approximately doubles per step of improvement in technology efficiency. We choose the profit function to be equal to the general form Π(θ) = φθb
                        . Footnote 4 shows how the profit function can be easily derived from a Cobb–Douglas production function. We assume that φ = 1000 and b = 2. The other parameters are r = 0.1, ξ
                        0 = 1, and an arrival rate of λ = 0.5 for the standard model. For a graphical illustration of transistor counts improvements from 1971 to 2011 (see Fig. 2
                        ).

We solve for the optimal investment strategy using the changing arrival rate model as well as the constant arrival rate model. The result of Proposition 6 is based on the fact that the adoption threshold for the standard model with constant arrival rate, is increasing in the arrival rate. We proved this for concave profit functions (see Proposition 2). However, for this example we choose a convex profit function of the form φθ
                        2. Therefore, it remains to show that the statement of Proposition 2 is also valid for this specific convex profit function. This is the content of the following proposition. Therewith, the statement of Proposition 6 that explicitly specifies the two cases λ
                        1 < λ
                        2 and λ
                        1 > λ
                        2 is also valid for convex profit functions of the form Π(θ) = φθ
                        2.

                           Proposition 10
                           For a given profit function of the form Π(θ) = φθ
                              2, the optimal adoption threshold is increasing in the arrival rate, i.e., if θ*(λ) denotes the threshold when the arrival rate is λ, then for λ
                              1 < λ
                              2 it follows that:

The standard model assumes that the arrival rate of new technology is equal to λ forever. This assumption ignores that at some point all possibilities for further improvements are likely to be exhausted and further improvement is not possible. We account for this phenomenon and allow that the arrival rate can decrease to a value close to zero in case the last arrival dates back long. This indicates that the natural boundary of the innovation process has been reached and that further improvements are unlikely. For our specific example we assume that in case three time periods have passed without a new arrival, the arrival rate drops from λ
                        1 = (0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 or 1.75) to λ
                        2 = (0.1306, 0.0474, 0.0193, 0.008 or 0.004). The numerical results are presented in Table 2
                        .

Recall that for the case of λ
                        1 > λ
                        2 there is a positive probability that the firm adopts new technology a time lag after its arrival. The interval in which this probability lays, is presented in the following proposition. Proposition 11 also states the expression of the expected number of jumps before technology is adopted.

                           Proposition 11
                           If λ
                              1 > λ
                              2, the following holds for the probability that the firm will adopt new technology at a level of θ such that

                              where n(θ) denotes the number of jumps necessary to reach the technology level θ when the firm’s currently used technology level is equal ξ
                              0. P(adopt at Yt
                               = Δ) denotes the probability that the firm adopts technology a time lag after its arrival at the decision moment Yt
                               = Δ.

A crucial advantage to the standard model is that we can explain a possible time lag between innovation and adoption. In case that λ
                        1 > λ
                        2 the probability of a time lag between innovation and adoption is strictly positive and it can be substantially high as the numerical results show. For the case of λ
                        1 = 0.75 and λ
                        2 = 0.1306, the firm will adopt new technology a time lag of Δ = 3 after its arrival with a probability of more than 70 percent. This shows that a firm will postpone adoption of a novel technology as a result of its investment strategy. In this strategy the firm bets on arrival of better technologies in region 1. However, the realization of the technology arrival process can be such that the firm has to update its expectations about the arrival of new technologies. If region 2 is reached, the decrease in the arrival rate makes that the firm accept the already available technology.

Another advantage of the extended model is that we gain an additional degree of freedom. It allows to show the effect of increasing variance (or standard deviation, equivalently) of time between two consecutive technology arrivals on the optimal adoption strategy while keeping the expected time fixed (in our numerical example 
                           
                              E
                              [
                              Y
                              ]
                              =
                              2
                           
                        ). Table 2 focuses on the effect of increasing standard deviation on the optimal adoption timing, presenting all relevant values of the optimal adoption strategy for increasing standard deviation (std[Y] = 3.9, 6.9, 11.4, 18.1 and 28.0). We find that an increase in the standard deviation decreases the probability of a time lag between innovation and adoption for our example. We increase the standard deviation by increasing the value of the arrival rate when Y < Δ (λ
                        1) while decreasing the value of the arrival rate when Y ≥ Δ (λ
                        2), and keeping the expected value fixed. This leads to a lower probability of reaching Y ≥ Δ (i.e. no new technology arrival within Δ time periods) while the probability of an arrival of type 1 increases. So on the one hand, increasing λ
                        1 lowers the chance that region 2 will be reached. On the other hand, lower λ
                        2 increases the expected time of a technology arrival in region 2. Therefore, the probability of a time lag between innovation and adoption decreases (see Table 2).

The amount of arrivals necessary to reach the adoption threshold increases with standard deviation. While for a standard deviation of std[Y] = 3.9, 6 technology arrivals are necessary to reach the adoption threshold, the amount of necessary technology arrivals increases to 29 for the case that the standard deviation increases to std[Y] = 28.0. Also the expected time of technology adoption is increasing in the standard deviation of time between two consecutive arrivals. Our results therefore confirm the standard real options result, that increasing uncertainty postpones investment.

For the standard model we assume that the constant arrival rate λ is equal to 0.5, so that the expected time between two consecutive arrivals is equal to 
                           
                              E

                              =
                              2
                           
                        . This leads to an expected time of adoption equal to 
                           
                              E

                        . The standard deviation of time between two consecutive arrivals in this case is equal to std[Y] = 2, the adoption threshold is equal to θ* = 5.42 and the expected number of arrivals before adoption is equal to

                        . Comparing this result to the results of the extended model with changing arrival rate one sees that the optimal adoption strategy is sensitive to specific assumptions on the arrival probabilities. While for a standard deviation of std[Y] = 3.9 (see Table 2) the firm would invest earlier than in the standard case (i.e. 
                           
                              E
                              [
                              
                                 T
                                 *
                              
                              ]
                              =
                              15
                           
                        ), it would invest later than in the standard case when the standard deviation increases to std[Y] = 28. A good assessment of the arrival probabilities therefore is essential. Considering a constant arrival rate per se can lead to wrong decision making.

Investing in new technology might provide a company in the semiconductor industry with a competitive advantage which would increase its value and therefore, might speed up technology adoption. A shortcoming of this model is that it does not account for competition. We however leave this extension to a competitive setting to future research focusing on the effect of changing arrival rate in this work.

The second application deals with technological innovations in the electronics sector and customers’ buying behavior. We look at a technology adoption problem from the point of view of a single consumer that will decide when it is optimal to buy a new version of an electronic product. While consumers as a group can have influence on the technological progress, i.e. for example Apple’s product release schedule, single consumer’s actions do not influence this progress. The technology progress therefore is exogenous to an individual consumer. However, he might have certain expectations about the arrival of new product series. Many companies in the electronics sector present new series of their product lines regularly. If Apple has just released a new line of its iPod or iPad series, consumers expect that the chance of a new release is very unlikely for a specific period of time, depending on Apple’s previous release schedules. If Apple used to release a new iPod generation once per year, consumers think that a new update is very likely in case one year has passed since the last release took place. Therefore we assume λ

                        2 and set

                              Y

                              =

                        ). Specifically, the following example addresses the technology investment strategy of a consumer that decides about the optimal moment to purchase the next generation of an electronics product. The consumer assumes that a new product generation is released on average every year once. We raise the question of how the consumer’s optimal adoption timing of a new product line depends on his expectation about a company’s product release schedule.

For the numerical example we choose Δ = 0.8 and let the arrival rate λ
                        1 range from 0.01, 0.05, 0.2 to 0.4. Considering Δ and λ
                        1, parameter λ
                        2 is chosen so that the expected time between two consecutive product releases is equal to one year, i.e. 
                           
                              E

                              Y

                              =

                        0 = 0, u = 0.5, r = 0.2 and I = 500.


                        Table 3
                         presents the numerical results. Let us first look at the resulting optimal adoption strategy when an arrival in region 1 is very unlikely (λ
                        1 = 0.01). The optimal adoption threshold is then equal to

                        . This means that the firm will always adopt a new technology at the moment of innovation which confirms what is observed in practice. Consumers do not buy a product of the old series when expecting a new release soon. Furthermore, our results show that there is no time lag effect. This finding explains the fact that companies are forced to reduce prices of old product generations when announcing a new one. Since there is no time lag effect, firms need to drop prices of the old product generation in order to increase their sales of the old product generation to empty their inventories. After Apple announced the release of iPad2 on March 2, 2011 (release in U.S. on March 11, 2011), they dropped the price of the old generation iPad 1 immediately by 20 percent in order to unload the remaining inventory of the table computer’s first generation.

                         is decreasing. For a standard deviation equal to std[Y] = 0.21 the expected time of adoption is equal to 5.38. Increasing the standard deviation to std[Y] = 0.55, (keeping the expected time equal to 1, ) the expected time of adoption drops to 4.74.

For the standard case, where an expected interarrival time of

                        . The threshold derived for the constant arrival model is higher than for the changing arrival rate model. This is driven by the fact that the variance of time between two consecutive arrivals is higher for the standard case model (std[x] = 1) than for the case of changing arrival rate with low λ
                        1.

The result that increasing variance accelerates investment is surprising when considering the standard real options result that suggests that increasing uncertainty postpones investment. It however supports the product release strategy of Apple. Apple generally keeps the time between an announcement of a new product and its actual release short and does not give information about a new product before its release announcement. The iPad2 for example was unveiled at a March 2, 2011, press conference where Apple did not disclose in advance what would be announced at the event. And from March 11, 2011 on the iPad2 was already available for purchase. This behavior makes their release schedule less predictable to customers because theoretically speaking, it increases the variance of time between arrivals from their customers’ point of view. Our results confirm that such a release strategy is successful in the sense of accelerating customers’ purchases of new product generations.

So far we have assumed that the time period after which the value of the arrival rate changes if no new technology has arrived before, is constant and known. In the following we relax this assumption and consider that the moment at which the arrival rate changes is uncertain. Specifically, we assume Δ is exponentially distributed with parameter μ, i.e. Δ ∼ Exp(μ). This means that at time τ the firm knows in which regime it is but it does not know when the value of λ changes. Therefore, the expected time between two consecutive arrivals is (in view of Equation (8)) equal to

Having derived the thresholds for both decision moments, the optimal investment strategies for both cases λ
                     1 < λ
                     2 and λ
                     1 > λ
                     2 are according to the ones in the general case. For the expressions of the expected time of technology adoption for both cases as well as its derivation we refer to Appendix A.

In the following we will analyze the effect of stochastic Δ on the optimal adoption timing for the case of λ
                     1 > λ

                     . This means that in expectation Δ is equal to 3 as in the non-stochastic case. The numerical results are presented in Table 4
                     .

Comparing these results to the results for deterministic Δ (see Table 2) shows that additional uncertainty about the moment that the arrival rate decreases (from λ
                     1 to λ
                     2), accelerates the firm’s technology adoption. The expected time of adoption for the case of deterministic Δ is equal to

The firm is threatened by the possible drop of the arrival rate to a low value which would make a new arrival and therefore an improvement in the recent technology less likely. The firm decides to invest earlier than in the case where it is aware of the moment of change. This means that increasing uncertainty accelerates investment, a conclusion that is opposite to the standard real options result. It is driven by the assumption of exponentially distributed Δ. The exponential distribution is positively skewed which makes an arrival of Δ before the expected value

                      more likely than after. Therefore, it is optimal for the firm to earlier adopt a new technology.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We extend the literature on technology adoption by assuming that the arrival rate of new technologies is not constant but changes. The arrival rate changes in case no new technology arrives within a certain time period after the last innovation. We find an explanation for the economic fact that firms sometimes adopt new technology a time lag after its innovation. Our analysis shows that the probability that a firm adopts a new technology a time lag after its innovation is strictly positive in case the arrival rate would drop after a certain time period without any new arrival. If the firm expects the arrival rate to rise, this time lag effect is not present.

We analyze the effect of variance of time between two consecutive arrivals on the adoption decision and find that increasing variance postpones investment in case the arrival rate would drop after a certain period without any arrival. In case the arrival rate is supposed to rise, increasing variance accelerates investment.

In a further step, we assume that the moment at which the arrival rate switches is not known beforehand, but uncertain. We find that increasing uncertainty accelerates investment, which is opposite to the standard real options result that a firm facing higher uncertainty waits longer with investment.

We will mention six possible directions for further research. First, we assume that the firm has a single option to adopt better technology. Allowing for several options poses an interesting extension for future work, as it would also allow for full investigation of the interactions between decisions to adopt or not adopt several technologies. Moreover, we address only the case of one optimal timing problem. Huisman (2001) analyzed the problem of technology adoption if the firm can switch technologies n times. In that case, the results for the multiple switches are basically extensions of the one switch case, although in some situations it is no longer possible to completely solve the multiple case. In our case it is not so clear that the backward induction method proposed by Huisman (2001) will also work, as it may depend on the behavior of the intensity rate λ(t).

Second, we assume that the arrival rate of new technology can take two different values. At a specific period after the last arrival took place, the arrival rate switches from one value to the other. An interesting approach for further research would be to assume that the arrival rate is a smooth increasing/decreasing function of time, which would mean that the longer the last technology arrival dates back the higher/lower is the probability of a new arrival.

Third, considering the electronics industry it would be also very appealing to include the fact that once a company introduces a new product, other companies are under pressure to introduce new products as well. When Palm, Inc. introduced the first smartphone to be deployed in widespread use in the United States, in the early 2001, Microsoft announced the “Microsoft Windows Powered” smartphone at the end of that year. In 2002 Handspring released the “Palm OS Treo” smartphone and RIM followed with the release of the first “BlackBerry” devices. One could employ a different model based on mutually exciting jump processes, known as Hawkes processes, which capture that each event generated by the process in turn generates a sequence of offspring events according to a Poisson distribution.

Fourth, analyzing strategic applications of new technologies in order to achieve competitive gains. There are several examples that illustrate that technology adoptions are often made under strategic considerations, as the adoption of new technologies allow the companies to compete in markets at lower cost and higher efficiency. One of such examples is the FedEx’s package tracking system (Zhu and Weyant, 2003). Another extension in this direction is to assume that firms have different expectations about technology arrival rates. It could be interesting to study how decisions are affected if a competitor has a similar or opposite change in the arrival rate.

Other natural directions to extend the analysis of the paper would be the consideration of time dependent investment costs or adding learning regarding the availability of the new technology.

The value of the expected time and variance for the case of λ
                           1 = 0 follows trivially from the fact that in this case it holds that Y = Δ + Y
                           2, and Δ and Y
                           2 are independent.

For the expected time of technology adoption we use again the fact that

                           2, the firm will just consider adoption of new technology immediately after a technology arrival happens, without entering region 2. Thus, similarly to the case of fixed and deterministic Δ,

In the following we derive the expectation and variance of Y which denotes the random variable corresponding to the time elapsed between two consecutive arrivals. First we derive the expected time between two consecutive arrivals. We have to distinguish two cases. Let us first assume that λ
                              1 is strictly positive (λ
                              1 > 0). Then as Y
                              1 ∼ Exp(λ
                              1) and Y
                              2 ∼ Exp(λ
                              2) (as defined in Equations (4) and (5)) are independent, it follows that:

                              1, the firm would always prefer to invest at the beginning of the time interval at t = 0, i.e. right after the arrival of new technology. This holds for each time interval between two consecutive technology arrivals. The payoff the firm gets by investing at t = 0 is given by f(0) = Π(ξ

                              For each case we show that the payoff of the firm is decreasing in t when t < Z
                              1. For the case that 0 ≤ t < Δ the payoff the firm gets investing at t = 0 is given by f(0) = Π(ξ
                              0) − I. If 0 ≤ t < Δ the P(t < Z
                              1) is decreasing in t and therefore, its maximum occurs when t = 0. So f(t), being the product of two decreasing functions of t, is maximized when t = 0. The same argument holds for t ≥ Δ. Therefore, the maximum of f(t) (when t ≥ Δ) occurs when t = Δ. This means that the only decision moments to be considered are {t: Xt
                               = 0 or Xt
                               = Δ}.

                               we closely follow Dixit and Pindyck (1994, Appendix 4.B) as well as Huisman (2001, Appendix 2.A) . The two thresholds are derived by solving the value matching conditions at

Dixit and Pindyck (1994) give conditions on the considered payoff and distribution functions that yield a division of the state space into two regions separated by a threshold θ*. On one side of the threshold (θ < θ*) continuation is optimal and on the other side (θ ≥ θ*) stopping is optimal.

In order to check the second condition, we need to distinguish the following two cases: the profit flow function is concave or it is convex. Assume first that it is concave. Considering decision moment x = Δ, the problem is equivalent to the standard problem with arrival rate λ = λ

                              is monotonic in θ. Notice that this equation is a convex linear combination of two equations that are monotonic in θ (one corresponds to the standard case with constant arrival rate λ
                              1, whereas the other one corresponds to the case of constant arrival rate λ
                              2). Therefore, this combination is also a monotonic function of θ. We conclude that both conditions for uniqueness of threshold

                               are satisfied. If, on the other hand, the profit flow is a convex function, we cannot reason that the proposition holds for any convex profit flow. Therefore, one needs to check for each specific convex profit flow if the uniqueness holds for the standard case (both with arrival rate λ = λ
                              1 and with λ = λ
                              2). If this hold one can conclude that it holds for the changing arrival rate case as well.

In view of the monotonicity of the optimal level in terms of the intensity rate of the Poisson process (see Proposition 2), we know that θ
                              ⋆(λ
                              1) < θ
                              ⋆(λ
                              2) when λ
                              1 < λ
                              2, with θ*(λ) denoting the optimal level in the standard case with constant arrival rate λ. Thus it follows trivially that

                               = Δ have to be taken into account. For each decision moment the corresponding investment threshold has to be considered for the definition of the optimal investment strategy. The resulting investment strategy depends on the relation of λ

For the derivation of the expected time of adoption assuming λ

                               is considered for adoption and therefore the derivation of the expected time of adoption follows straightforwardly assuming Equation (20). For case λ
                              1 > λ
                              2, both thresholds have to be taken into account for deriving the optimal adoption strategy and therefore, also for the expected adoption time. In this case the company will wait at least

                                       and we apply the same reasoning as the case before. As in this case F(.) does not depend on Δ neither in λ
                                       2, we just check the behavior of
