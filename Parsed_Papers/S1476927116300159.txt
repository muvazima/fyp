                  Kinesin-like protein (KIF11) is a molecular motor protein that is essential in mitosis. Removal of KIF11 prevents centrosome migration and causes cell arrest in mitosis. KIF11 defects are linked to the disease of microcephaly, lymph edema or mental retardation. The human KIF11 protein has been actively studied for its role in mitosis and its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking and density functional theory approaches was employed to reveal the structural, chemical and electronic features essential for the development of small molecule inhibitor for KIF11. Hence we have developed chemical feature based pharmacophore models using Discovery Studio v 2.5 (DS). The best hypothesis (Hypo1) consisting of four chemical features (two hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrophobic and one ring aromatic) has exhibited high correlation co-efficient of 0.9521, cost difference of 70.63 and low RMS value of 0.9475. This Hypo1 is cross validated by Cat Scramble method; test set and decoy set to prove its robustness, statistical significance and predictability respectively. The well validated Hypo1 was used as 3Dquery to perform virtual screening. The hits obtained from the virtual screening were subjected to various scrupulous drug-like filters such as Lipinski’s rule of five and ADMET properties. Finally, six hit compounds were identified based on the molecular interaction and its electronic properties. Our final lead compound could serve as a powerful tool for the discovery of potent inhibitor as KIF11 agonists.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

“Kinesin-like protein (KIF11) is the member of kinesin superfamily, which move along the microtubule tacks in the cell with the help of nanomotors. Named from studies in the early days of discovery, it is also known as Kinesin-5(Eg5) (Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2002). It has a variety of functions and is responsible for the transporter of vesicles and organelles (Miki et al., 2005). KIF11 is also required for establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, spatial organization of microtubules, chromosomes in the mitotic spindle, microtubule stabilization, and chromosome–microtubule interactions (Schmidt and Bastians, 2007). Removal of KIF11 prevents centrosome migration and it controls mitosis through bipolar spindle formation and chromosome separation (Huszar et al., 2009). KIF11 defects are linked to the disease of microcephaly with or without chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or mental retardation (Kaestner and Bastians, 2010). KIF11 is over expressed in many proliferative tissues including leukemia as well as solid tumors such as breast, lung, ovarian, bladder and pancreatic cancers. Furthermore, Eg5 is not expressed in the adult peripheral nervous system; and hence Eg5 inhibitors may not cause neuropathic side effects commonly associated with agents that primarily target tubulin (Blangy et al., 1995; Ostergaard et al., 2012). Inhibitors of KIF11 have been developed as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer. The first KIF11 inhibitor, monastrol was discovered in a chemical screen of a large library of cell permeable compounds (Sakowicz et al., 2004). Many specific inhibitors of Eg5 have been discovered including monastrol, S-trityl-l-cysteine (STLC) and ispinesib. These inhibitors exert their action through binding to an allosteric site located between helix α3 and loop 5 of the Eg5 domain (Jackson et al., 2007). A biphenyl-type inhibitor PVZB1194 binds to the helix α4/helix α6 allosteric pocket, which is located 15Å from the ATP binding pocket. Binding of the inhibitor to the allosteric pocket induces the deformation of the ATP binding pocket through the Tyr104 residue. The biphenyl-type inhibitor suppresses the binding of ATP, while the conventional Eg5 inhibitors inhibit the release of ADP (El-Nassan, 2013; Luo et al., 2007). Recent studies evidenced that the biphenyl-type inhibitor PVZB1194 binds to the α4/α6 allosteric pocket 15Å from the ATP-binding pocket that differs from conventional allosteric inhibitors that bind to the allosteric L5/α2/α3 pocket of Eg5. The conformations of α1, β3, P-loop, and α2 are unique for Eg5-PVZB1194. PVZB1194 binds to Eg5, the inhibitor pushes Tyr104 and conformations around the ATP binding site change to affect the binding of ATP (Yokoyama et al., 2015). The majority of human KIF11 inhibitors are selectively binds to a drug ‘hot spot’, composed of residues from the helix α2 and helix α3 helices and a flexible L5 loop on the surface of the motor domain. The L5 loop in KIF11 closes around the inhibitor and is open in the absence of inhibitor (Turner et al., 2001; Yan et al., 2004). For inhibitors that bind to the L5 pocket, the mechanism of inhibition is that they slow ADP release from the catalytic active site (Learman et al., 2009) and inhibit ATP-dependent directional motion (Ulaganathan et al., 2013). Other sites of inhibitor binding between helix α4 of the switch II cluster and helix α6 preceding have also been identified in the KIF11 domain. The compound had small changes in the nucleotide-binding pocket induced by ATP hydrolysis leads to the structural changes in switch II cluster and neck-linker region. It generates the molecular motion responsible for shifting two antiparallel Microtubules apart from the bipolar spindle (Cochran et al., 2005; Kwok et al., 2006). The binding site helix α4 of the switch II cluster and helix α6 had high affinity binding driven by network of aromatic interaction and hydrogen interaction with carboxylate group of Benzimadazole-8(BI8) when compare to interactions in helix α2, L5 loop and helix α3 helices binding site (Cochran et al., 2005).

In our study describes the efforts to identify the essential structural requirements to inhibit KIF11 and thereby designing novel potent inhibitors as antimitotic therapeutics. Ligand based pharmacophore modeling approaches along with virtual screening of large chemical databases for novel scaffolds, molecular docking and density functional theory studies have been successfully employed to achieve our goal.

Pharmacophore modeling approaches is the major tool to discover new and novel scaffold molecules for the specific target. It can be done either based on the ligands or on the active/binding site of proteins. For the ligand based pharmacophore model, HypoGen algorithm which uses the activity values of the compounds in the training set to generate the best hypotheses. In our present study, HypoGen have been successfully and extensively applied to build a 3D-QSAR pharmacophore model for KIF11 inhibitors using Discovery Studio 2.5 software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

A set of 61 compounds with their experimentally known KIF11 inhibitory activity (IC50) obtained from the literatures (Cox et al., 2005, 2006, 2007; Fraley et al., 2006; Garbaccio et al., 2006, 2007; Coleman et al., 2007; Roecker et al., 2007). The agonistic activity of these compounds was expressed in terms of IC50 values as an expression of drug potency. For HypoGen pharmacophore model generation, a training set of 21 compounds (Fig. 1
                           ) were selected based on the principles of structural diversity and activity range from 0.1 to 10,000nM. In Pharmacophore modeling, the selection of training set compound is most important. The activity range of the compound must be at least four orders of magnitude, responsible for determining the quality of the generated pharmacophore. All structures in the training set were built and minimized to the closest local minimum based on a modified CHARMM force field within confirm module. In this study, the best option was used, specifying 255 as the maximum number of conformers with a constraint of 20kcal/mol energy. All other parameters used were default (DS).

Ligand based pharmacophore approach; ligand pharmacophore mapping protocol were used to generate the pharmacophore modeling studies (Roecker et al., 2007). The BEST method was employed by performing energy minimization and optimizing the conformations in both torsional and Cartesian space using the polling algorithm (Mason et al., 2001). The pharmacophore generation assuming common features present in the studied compounds, chemical features such as hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), hydrogen bond donor (HBD), general hydrophobic feature (H), hydrophobic aliphatic (HYA), hydrophobic (HY) and ring aromatic (RA) were included (Sprague, 1995). Here we set the uncertainty value for pharmacophore generation was set to 2, therefore the uncertain factor for each compound represents the ratio range of uncertainty in the activity value based on the expected statistical straggling of biological data collection (Pandey et al., 2014). Top ten pharmacophore hypotheses were generated using training set of KIF-11 agonists. Among the ten hypotheses, the best pharmacophore hypothesis was selected based on significant statistical parameters (high correlation coefficient (r
                        2), lowest total cost, highest cost difference and low RMS values).

The best pharmacophore model Hypo1 was further validated by different methods namely test set, Fischer’s randomization, decoy set methods based on accurate—predictive power, statistical significance and capability of identification of the active compound from inactive respectively.

A test set consist 40 compounds of KIF11 agonists were validated by best pharmacophore hypothesis (Fig. S1). The weight cost, configuration cost and error cost was calculated during the pharmacophore generation process were initially used to validate the best pharmacophore hypothesis. Ligand pharmacophore mapping protocol with the flexible/BEST option was employed to map the test set compounds upon the best pharmacophore hypothesis. The IC50 value for each test set compound was also estimated.

The statistical parameters were also used to check the quality of our model with correlation coefficient (R
                           2), R
                           2pred for internal validation and external validation (both scaled and unscaled versions). r
                           2m(test) for external validation, r
                           2m for overall validation and rm2(rank) values was calculated from the website http://aptsoftware.co.in/rmsquare/ to find out the rank order prediction of the test set molecules (Roy et al., 2012).

Fischer’s technique is used to verify whether there is a strong correlation existing between the chemical structure and biological activities of compounds. The confidence level was set to 98%; to construct hypotheses using exactly the same features and parameters used in the original pharmacophore hypotheses generation. In addition that we calculate the squared correlation coefficient of the original model (R
                           2) surpasses the average of the squared correlation coefficient of the randomized model (R
                           r
                           2). Randomization examines the robustness of the model building process and examines the clarity of the developed model. Thus, to determine the extent of the difference in the values of R
                           2 and R
                           r
                           2 that signifies the reliability of the developed model, we used another parameter named as corrected correlation coefficient c
                           R
                           p
                           2 to determine the reliability of the model. The corrected formula of c

                           p

The decoy set comprised 1500 molecules including 1475 non-KIF11 inhibitors and 25 known inhibitors of KIF11. These decoy molecules were obtained from the Database of Useful Decoys (DUD) (Walters et al., 1998). To assess the strength of decoy set validation, we calculated the statistical parameters like hit list (Ht), number of active percent of yields (%Y), percent ratio of actives in the hit list (%A), enrichment factor (EF), false negatives, false positives, and goodness of hit score (GH). Moreover, we used the ligand pharmacophore mapping protocol implemented in DS 2.5 with best/flexible option.

Pharmacophore-based virtual screening can be efficiently used to discover novel lead identification stage of the drug discovery process. After the successful 3D pharmacophore model generation and validation methods, the commercially available databases such as Maybridge (http://www.maybridge.com) and Chembrige (http://chembridge.com) containing 59,652, and 50,000 respectively were screened to identify novel agonists. The database screening was carried out using Ligand Pharmacophore Mapping protocol implemented in DS with best/flexible search option. Sort out the molecules having the same Hypo1 pharmacophore features. The selections of compound were screened with the maximum fit values from the chemical databases. The hits were further screened by ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of a molecule within an organism. The optimization of these properties in the early stage of drug design would be very helpful to diminish ADMET problems later in the development process. The drug-like property calculation was performed by applying Lipinski’s rule of five and ADMET properties. Mainly blood brain barrier (BBB), solubility and absorption criteria's were focused on ADME (Lipinski et al., 2001). The selected hit compounds were further analyzed by molecular docking studies.

Hit molecules from the pharmacophore based virtual screening were then evaluated by docking simulation studies to identify the possible binding orientation within the KIF11 active site. We carried out docking experiments using the Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking (GOLD) program to dock hit compounds into the active site of KIF11. GOLD uses a genetic algorithm for docking flexible ligand into the active site with partial flexibility. The ability of GOLD to produce original ligand binding orientations is greater than 70% (Verdonk et al., 2003). The active site in the KIF11 crystal coordinate was defined as a region with a radius of 10Å around the KIF11- Benzimidazole-8 (BI8) ligand. Preparation for docking process; water molecules were removed; hydrogen atoms were added in the receptor using GOLD. Reproducibility of docking program was checked by the KIF11-BI8 complex and compare with original crystal structure. It yields the RMS value of 0.95Å. This result conform the reproducibility of GOLD program. The early termination option was used to skip the genetic optimization calculation when any five conformations of a particular compound predicted above the rmsd value of 1.5Å. The best lead molecules were selected based on their binding orientation in the KIF11 active site and their corresponding GOLD score.

“AutoDock Tools” was used to prepare, run, and analyze the docking simulations. It is designed to predict how small molecules, such as substrates or drug candidates, bind to a receptor of known 3D structure. In docking simulation method, all the heteroatoms were deleted. Polar hydrogens added and the water molecules removed from the crystal structure 3zcw.pdb of KIF11 for the docking preparation. Gasteiger charge was assigned and then non-polar hydrogens merged in the each atom type of ligand for the grid maps calculation. In our study, the binding site was selected based on the key amino acid residues which are involved in binding with BI8-KIF11 (PDB ID-3ZCW) would be considered as the best accurate active region. A three-dimensional grid box with dimensions X
                        =48, Y
                        =52 and Z
                        =52 was created with grid-point spacing of 0.375Å. Before running docking calculation, a configuration file was generated with information about grid size and coordinates indicated the ligand and receptor files. The Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA) was chosen to search for the best conformers during the docking process. The reports for each calculation were analyzed based on affinity energy (kcal/mol) values for each ligand conformation in its respective complex.

In our study, we carried out a DFT-based quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) study for both experimentally known KIF11 inhibitors and final hits which were retrieves from the docking analysis. DFT is today one of the best methods to study medium size and larger molecular systems (Devereux et al., 2009). The best DFT methods achieve substantially greater precision than the Hartree–Fock theory at only a modest augment in cost (Panchmatia et al., 2010). They accomplish this task by incorporating few effects of electron correlation much less affluently than traditional correlated methods. A range of functional has been defined, generally distinguished by the manner that they treat the exchange and correlation components. The best known of the hybrid functional is Becke’s three-parameter formulation B3LYP (Lee et al., 1988) complete geometry optimization for data set compounds was carried out using DFT with B3LYP, using basis set 6-31G* level. Vibrational frequencies were computed at the same B3LYP/6-31G* level to characterize the stationary points on the corresponding potential energy surfaces (Arooj et al., 2013). Likewise, our final compound retrieved from databases, showed important results with respect to all properties like key molecular orientation and interactions with the active sites. Various quantum-chemical descriptors such as LUMO and HOMO were computed. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 suite of programs.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The pharmacophore generation is based on the conformational analysis such as best and fast method offered by DS2.5.v. In our study 21 training set molecules which were associated with their conformations are submitted to 3D QSAR Pharmacophore Generation. It produces the hypothesis by undergoes constructive, subtractive, and optimization phases respectively. The geometric fit value was calculated based on the fit function checking whether the chemical feature is mapped or not and also assure whether it measures the distance that separates the feature on the molecule from the centroid of the hypothesis feature. Finally, the top ten hypotheses were generated using diverse training set of KIF11 agonists. The best pharmacophore hypothesis Hypo1 was characterized by the best correlation coefficient of 0.952, the highest cost difference of 70.63 and lowest RMS values of 0.9475. The best pharmacophore Hypothesis Hypo1 consists of spatial arrangement of four features: two hydrogen-bond donor (HBD), one hydrophobic (HY) and one ring aromatic (RA) (Liu et al., 2007).

The generated hypotheses were subjected to cost analysis. The two main values were used for cost analysis, the difference between fixed and null cost and another is the difference between the null cost and the total cost (Δcost). The total cost and a null cost value for the generated pharmacophore hypothesis Hypo1 was 90.009 and 161.646, respectively. The null cost and total cost difference of Hypo1 was 70.63, represent that Hypo1 can correlate the data by more than 90%. Hypo1 showed the maximum correlation coefficient value of 0.952 and thereby showing the high predictive ability of Hypo1. In addition, RMS value of less than 1.5Å (0.9475) was to further support the predictive ability of the pharmacophore hypothesis Hypo1 (Table1
                           ). Among the top ten pharmacophore hypotheses, Hypo1 was developed with better statistical values including higher correlation, greater cost difference, lower RMS value and low configuration cost values. Hypo1 was considered as the best pharmacophore hypothesis for further analysis.

To confirm the predictive power of Hypo1, each compound in training set was estimated through regression analysis method. The training set compounds classified into three groups. Activity scale: IC50
                           <100nM=+++ (highly active); 100nM≤IC50
                           <1000nM=++ (moderately active); IC50
                           ≥1000nM=+(low active). The Hypo1 was estimated the experimental activities of 21 training set compounds (Table 2). We classified the 21 training set compounds, 11 compounds are classified as highly active (+++), 8 compounds are classified as moderately active (++) and 2 compounds as inactive (+). The error value is calculated by the ratio between the estimated and experimental activities. The negative error value indicates that the estimated IC50 value is lower than the experimental activity whereas, the positive error value indicates that the estimated IC50 value is higher than the experimental activity. An error value of less than 10 signifies the prediction of activity lesser than one order of magnitude.

Based on the predicted values shows significant results, 11 compounds were exactly predicted that highly active compounds as highly active (+++). Of 8 moderately active, 2 compounds predicted as moderately active and the remaining 6 compounds were overestimated as highly active (+++). Of 2 inactive compounds (+), 1 compound are accurately predicted as inactive (+) and 1 compound was overestimated as moderately active (++). In training set compounds 19th and 20th compounds (Table 2
                           ) were 2–3 fold difference occurred in the predicted values were shifted to moderately active molecules into least inactive molecules and vice versa. The discrepancy occurred only in moderately active and inactive molecules respectively but not in highly active molecules. For feature fitting, the most active compounds in the training set mapped well on all the chemical features that are two HBA, one RA and one HY features of Hypo1 with good fitting score (Fig. 2
                           ). Fit value indicates that all the features in the pharmacophore overlaps the chemical features within the molecule and thereby help in understanding the chemical meaning of the hypothesis. These results emphasized Hypo1 as a consistent model to precisely estimate the experimental activity of the training set compounds.

The best pharmacophore hypotheses were validated based on test set prediction, Fischer randomization test and Decoy set.

The test prediction was employed as the first validation method. A total of 40 compounds structurally different compounds were selected as test set. Hypo1 was used to estimate the activity of test set compounds and most of the compounds were predicted correctly for their biological activity (Table 3
                           ) Hypo1 has given a correlation coefficient of 0.914 indicating a good correlation between the estimated and experimental activities (Fig. 3
                           ). The Hypo1 predictive ability against test set compounds was considered better than the estimated activity values along with the experimental and error values based on Hypo1 are tabulated. 21 Out of 40 highly active compounds, 19 compounds are predicted as highly active (+++) and remaining 2 compounds were underestimated as moderately active (++). Of 15 moderately active compounds, 7 compounds were overestimated as highly active (+++), 6 compounds are predicted as moderately active (++) and 2 compound were underestimated as inactive (+). Of 4 inactive compounds (+), 3 compounds are accurately predicted as inactive (+) and only one compounds are overestimated as moderately active (++). In Table 3 the compounds 31st and 36th were 2–3 fold difference occurred in the predicted values were shifted to moderately active molecules into least inactive molecules and 37th molecule as vice versa. Thus our results clearly indicated that Hypo1 has a good agreement with the experimental data and able to predict the activities of a wide variety of KIF11 inhibitors.

The acceptability of our developed pharmacophore model was performed on the test set molecules to evaluate the quality of the hypothesis using validation parameters (R
                           2
                           p and r
                           m
                           2 
                           (test)). The external validation provide a reasonable approximation of ability with which the pharmacophore model predicts the activity values of new compounds. The Hypo1 was produced the good result in terms of external predictivity of the model (R
                           2
                           pred
                           =0.952). The R
                           2
                           pred may not be satisfactory to specify external predictivity of a model (Roy et al., 2012). The close correlation between experimental and predicted activity data for the test set compounds were further examined based on the calculation of r
                           m
                           2 
                           (test) metrics. The important additional parameters that could quantify the stability of the pharmacophore model based on a comparison between experimental and predicted response ranking. Therefore the rank-order metric (r
                           m
                           2 
                           (rank)) was calculated based on the correlation of the ranks which was obtained and related to the response data (Table 3). The value >0.5 is a good model and has the good predictability (Mitra et al., 2010). In our correlation of Hypo1 was yielded was values of 0.968 and our Hypo1 model with the high level of assurance.

Fischer randomization test is used to evaluate the statistical relevance of Hypo1 based on the principle of randomizing the activity data of the training set compounds. To attain the 98% confidence level, 49 random sheets were generated and these compared with Hypo1 (Fig. 4
                           ). In addition to that we calculated the correlation coefficient the original model (R
                           =0.92) were significantly greater than the average correlation coefficient the random models (R
                           r
                           2
                           =0.713). The values of R
                           2 and R
                           r
                           2was indicated by strong Hypo1 model and pointed out the existence of true correlation with c
                           R
                           p
                           2 value of 0.641 (Table 4
                           ). The analysis confirmed that the total cost of all the 49 random spreadsheets is higher than the original pharmacophore and the correlation are lower. The analysis confirmed that our developed model Hypo1 was robust and not generate by chance.

Decoy molecules obtained from the DUD consisted of non-KIF11 inhibitors (1475) and known KIF11 inhibitors were selected from training set and test set. We used the GH scoring method to validate the reliability of our model by searching active molecules in the decoy database. We used our developed Hypo1 to successfully screen the decoy database. (Table 5
                           ) shows that the ligand-based pharmacophore model attained a GH score of 0.83, suggesting that our model was able to distinguish between active and decoy molecules from a large database. Generally, the goodness-of-hit (GH) score provides a good indication of pharmacophore model reliability, where 0 indicates a null model and 1 indicates an ideal model. A GH score greater than 0.60 is considered to indicate a reliable model.

Using Hypo1, this database screening was carried out, 22 compounds were retrieved as hits (Ht). The results of GH score and E-value calculation are given in Table 5. Among 25 retrieved hit compounds, 19 compounds were from known actives (Ha). The false positive value is 3 and the false negative value is 6. The calculated E value was 5.181 indicates that the model is highly efficient for database screening. We used the validated model to map lead molecules based on pharmacophore features.

In our study, the Hypo1 was used as a query to search the Maybridge and Chembridge databases, comprised of 59,652, and 50,000 compounds respectively. We modified the parameters based on the number of chemical features present in Hypo1. The Fast/Flexible search method from Ligand Pharmacophore Mapping implemented in DS was used to retrieve hits from the database. Maximum omitted features option is to select compounds that matched the maximum pharmacophore chemical features. Then the selection of compound was screened with the maximum fit values compounds ≥10 from the chemical databases. The drug like calculation was performed by ADME properties (Fig. 5
                        ). The selection of compounds based on good absorption level (level 0), good optimal solubility (level 3), and low blood brain barrier penetrability (level 3). The hits were further filtered by applying Lipinski’s rule-of-five that sets the criteria for drug-like properties (Lipinski et al., 2001). Therefore the hit compounds were screened for their predicted biological activity values using the Hypo1 pharmacophore model.

Molecular docking study was used to find the interaction and binding orientation with the receptor. In protein data bank 60 crystal structures were available for human KIF11 (PDB, www.rcsb.org). The structural differences of KIF11 domain have complex with biphenyl and benzimidazole-type inhibitors (pdb id- 3WPN with its resolution 2.8Å). In the BI8 complex, the key residues for Asn271, Ile288, Asn289, Arg297, and Thr300 were located around the entrance of the α4/α6 pocket and are also involved in inhibitor binding. In the PVZB1194 complex, Ile332 and Ala334 in β8 are located at the bottom of the pocket and are also involved in inhibitor binding. Eg5 structures including Eg5-ADP-BI8, the β3 corresponding to the bottom of the α4/α6 pocket showed high RMS derivations, indicating that binding to PVZB1194, not BI8, affects the bottom of the pocket (20). Eg5-PVZB1194 inhibitor pushes Tyr104 and conformations around the ATP binding site change to affect the binding of ATP. Recent study also favors an interpretation that PVZB1194 can work as an allosteric inhibitor binding outside the ATP-binding pocket (18).

The crystal structure with its pdb id: 3ZCW (KIF11-BI8 complex) was selected based on its resolution 1.79Å. The crystal structure 3ZCW for the KIF11 has dual binding sites. In ATP-competitive manner, helix α4 and helix α6 binds to the interface of the KIF11 inhibitors at the first binding site. Allosteric pocket formed by helix α2, helix α3 and loop L5 to show ATP-uncompetitive behavior at the second binding site. The L5 loop in human KIF11 closes around the inhibitor and is open in the absence of inhibitor. The binding site helix α4 of the switch II cluster and helix α6 had high affinity binding driven by network of aromatic interaction and hydrogen interaction with carboxylate group of Benzimadazole-8(BI8) when compare to interactions in helix α2, L5 loop and helix α3 helices binding site (Ulaganathan et al., 2013). We focused our work on helix α4 of the switch II cluster and helix α6 binding region to generate of new ligand molecules that could bind in this hydrophobic pocket as well as the non allosteric binding pocket.

The reference compound BI8 of KIF11 has shown hydrogen bond interactions with Tyr 104, Asn289, Thr300 and Tyr352 in the active site of KIF11. It has scored GOLD fitness score of 44.34 and predicted Auto dock binding energy −9.31kcal/mol (Fig. S2). The binding mode, molecular interactions, GOLD score and auto dock score of this compound were considered as reference to assess the binding modes of our hit compounds. The binding orientations of each molecule were sorted based on a scoring function, followed by visual inspection to reduce the false positive errors. The screened compounds from the database were selected for further analysis based on the ligand conformations in the active site, molecular interaction, GOLD fitness score and auto dock binding energy. The 2D structure of the 6 hit compounds named BTB01875, BTB09994, BTB14527, BTB14784Compound 2479 and BTB06317 (Fig. S3) from Maybridge and Chembridge have shown the good binding conformation, molecular interaction, GOLD fitness score and auto dock binding energy greater that the reference compound (Table 6
                        ).

The binding modes and the molecular interactions of the hit compounds were compared with the result of our reference compound. The docking analyses of our six hit compounds were shown in the Fig. 6
                           . The compound BTB 06317 was mapped on the RA feature of “Hypo1” The phenyl group. It had showed two strong hydrogen bond interactions with amine group of Asn 289 (Fig. S5a). Nitrogen group of another phenyl ring show the hydrogen bond interaction with aromatic group of Tyr 104. The compound also showed the hydrophobic interaction with Tyr352, Ala353 and Ile332 residues. It had scored the GOLD fitness score 68.38 and its predicted autodock binding energy11.15kcal/mol. The BTB09994 has scored a docking score of 54.9 and the predicted autodock binding energy −8.81kcal/mol (Fig. S5b). It exhibited hydrogen-bonding interactions with the key active site residues Asn 289 and Tyr 104. The carbonyl oxygen atoms near the side chains of the compound that mapped on the HBA features of “Hypo1” showed hydrogen-bonding interactions with Asn289 and Tyr104 residues of the active site. A ring aromatic feature was mapped on the aromatic region and makes the interaction with Tyr104. BTB09994 also showed the important hydrophobic interaction with Tyr 104, Leu 292, Gly296 and Tyr352. The hit compound BTB14527 has shown the face to face stacking interaction with active site residue Tyr104. A ring aromatic feature of Hypo1 is matched in that region. It had shown the hydrogen bond interaction with the hydroxyl group of Tyr104. Hydrogen bond acceptor features of “Hypo1” that enabled the hydrophobic interactions with the important Ile299, Leu 292, Gly296 and Tyr352 in the active site (Fig. S5c). BTB14527 has scored the GOLD fitness score of 62.95 and the auto dock binding score of −2.86kcal/mol. The carboxyl group of BTB14784 has shown the hydrogen bonding interactions with hydroxyl group of Tyr104. Hydrogen bond acceptor features of our Hypo1 were mapped in that region that accepts the hydrogen bond to the carboxyl group and hydrophobic interactions with Gly296 and Tyr 352(Fig. S5d). BTB14784 has scored a better GOLD fitness score of 54.45 with its predicted Auto dock binding energy −3.93kcal/mol. The binding mode of Compound2479 with GOLD fitness score 63.34 and its predicted Auto dock binding energy −3.30kcal/mol. It had shown the strong hydrogen bond interaction with the hydroxyl group of Tyr 104 and amine group of Asn289 (Fig. S5e) respectively. The compound had also showed the π⋯π stacking interactions between the aromatic ring of Tyr104 amino acid. The ring aromatic feature of Hypo1 was mapped on stacking region. Final hit compound BTB 01875 has scored the GOLD fitness score of 66.03 and predicted Auto dock binding energy of 11.03kcal/mol. The side chain of amine group of compound showed the hydrogen bond interactions with hydroxyl group of Tyr 104 and hetero atom of Asn289. The compound was overlapped ring aromatic features of Hypo1 and confirmed the face to face stacking interaction to Tyr 104. Hydrophobic interactions also shown with Tyr 104, Leu292 and Tyr 352. Moreover it also showed hydrophobic interactions with Tyr 352, Ala 356 and Ile332 amino acid residues of protein (Fig. S5f). The hydrophobic interactions of the final hits compounds were observed using pose view diagram (Fig. S4). The lead molecules from the docking studies were then subjected to density functional theory studies to find out the charge-transfer interaction using the frontiers orbital's HOMO and LUMO values.

The frontier molecular orbital energies, the shapes and symmetries of the HOMO and LUMO are crucial in predicting the reactivity of a group and the stereo chemical and region chemical outcome of a chemical reaction (Aihara, 1999). The higher HOMO value shows that, the molecule has good electron donating ability; as well as the lower value implies weak electron donating ability. A smaller energy gap (between the LUMO and HOMO) of the hit molecules illustrates that more reactive (Perepichka and Bryce, 2005). Consequently, the value of ΔE gap provides a measure for the stability of the formed complex on the surface (Crevel et al., 2004). HOMO and LUMO sites are plotted onto the molecular surface of the six hit compounds (BTB14784, BTB14527, BTB01875, BTB09994, Compound 2479 and BTB06317) were retrieved from the docking studies (Fig. 7 and 8
                        
                        ). We observed that HOMO and LUMO energies are small and ranging between −0.242 to −0,120eV and −0.052eV to −0.095eV (Table 7
                        ) which clearly indicates the fragile nature of the bound electrons.

In our experimental study also deduced that introduction of heteroatoms to the inhibitor of hit compounds to enhance its stability in human KIF11. The position of a benzoamine group in compound BTB14784 has instigated its stability (Fig. 7a). Electron donor rings can be identified as those with the greatest electron density from the HOMO. In the case of BTB14784, HOMO is scattered over the benzoamine group moiety together with the carboxyl group and LUMO is spread over the region N-3-acetylphenyl containing heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen. Docking results also showed that this region is involved in important interactions with the key residues of protein. In case of second compound BTB14527, HOMO is composed of phenyl acetamide that donates the electron and it has the high stability due to face to face interaction with Tyr 104 and LUMO spreads over 3-[3-[(4-cyanophenyl) sulfonylamino] group is involved in hydrogen bond interaction with hydroxyl group of Tyr 104 (Fig. 7b). LUMO plot over 2-(3, 4-dimethoxyphenyl) ethyl group in hit compounds BTB01875, the six membered ring involved in important π⋯π stacking interactions with the aromatic ring of Tyr 104 (Fig. 7c). Whereas the HOMO plot is scattered on 4-nitro-benzamide moiety showed hydrogen bonding interactions with important amino acids Asn289 at the active site of the enzyme. The fourth compound BTB09994HOMO was located mainly on 3-oxopropyl benzoate and LUMO for methyl 3-2-benzamido group. Hence the electronic transition from 3-ethoxy-3-oxopropyl benzoate to methyl 3-2-benzamido group and this result was confirmed by the hydrogen bonding interactions with significant amino acid Asn249 in the protein active site (Fig. 7d). In Compound 2479, HOMO and LUMO transition implies an electron density transfer from phenyl benzamide to chlorobenzene group. HOMO is composed of phenyl benzamide involved in hydrogen bond interaction with the amine group of ASN 249 and LUMO spreads over chlorobenzene group. It accepts the electrons and associated with the charge transfer, π⋯π stacking between inhibitor and aromatic amino acid residues Tyr 104 in the binding site of KIF11 (Fig. 7e). Analysis of HOMO maps of compound BTB06317 illustrate on 2-phenyltriazole-4-carboxylate scattered the electrons on [(5-methyl-1, 2-oxazol-3-yl) imino methyl amino] groups occupied by α MO’s and β MO’s in LUMO respectively. The docking results showed that HOMO region, the hit compound BTB06317 had two strong hydrogen interactions with hetero atom of nitrogen and oxygen with the important key residue Asn249 in the active site. In the LUMO region, it had shown the face to face stacking interaction of aromatic and phenyl ring with Tyr104 residue (Fig. 8). BTB06317 showed with the highest HOMO energy value is −0.242eV and for LUMO is −0.062eV. The small energy gap of HOMO-LUMO explains the ultimate charge transfer interaction within the molecule, and the frontier orbital energy gap is found to be −0.18eV. Thus lowest energy gap values of our molecule explains the charge transfer interactions taking place within the molecule that influences the biological activity. Hence our results of molecular docking studies on KIF11 inhibitors also proved the presence of such kind of interactions. We suggest that the hit compounds may possess equivalent or greater electronic properties and could be used to design novel classes of KIF11 inhibitors.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Ligand based 3D pharmacophore hypotheses of KIF11 inhibitors have been successfully developed using 3D QSAR Pharmacophore Generation protocol existing in DS v.2.5. The best quantitative pharmacophore model, Hypo1 was characterized by the highest cost difference, best correlation coefficient and lowest RMSD respectively. The best Hypo1 consisted of two HBA, one HY and one RA features. Hypo1 was further validated by test set, Fischer randomization test and decoy set methods. The test set containing 40 compounds was used for investigating the predictive ability of Hypo1 and resulted with a correlation coefficient of 0.914. This was further validated Hypo1 was used as a 3D query in chembridge and Maybridge database screening. The hit compounds were then subjected to filtering by maximum omitted feature values greater than 10. The compounds were sorted by applying the drug-like filter such as ADMET and Lipinski’s rule of five. Further refine the retrieved hit compounds were carried out for molecular docking studies. Finally six structurally diverse compounds BTB01875, BTB09994, BTB14527, BTB14784, Compound 2479 and BTB06317 with high GOLD score and predicted auto dock binding energy were selected based on their molecular interaction. To confirm the inhibitors potencies, we calculated the orbital energies such as HOMO and LUMO, for all six hit compounds. Based on our study, we confirmed our six hit compounds satisfied all the pharmacophore features in Hypo1 and will help in the identification or a design of potent inhibitors for KIF11.
