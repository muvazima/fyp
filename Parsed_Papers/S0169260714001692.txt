                  Intestinal abnormalities and ischemia are medical conditions in which inflammation and injury of the intestine are caused by inadequate blood supply. Acute ischemia of the small bowel can be life-threatening. Computed tomography (CT) is currently a gold standard for the diagnosis of acute intestinal ischemia in the emergency department. However, the assessment of the diagnostic performance of CT findings in the detection of intestinal abnormalities and ischemia has been a difficult task for both radiologists and surgeons. Little effort has been found in developing computerized systems for the automated identification of these types of complex gastrointestinal disorders. In this paper, a geostatistical mapping of spatial uncertainty in CT scans is introduced for medical image feature extraction, which can be effectively applied for diagnostic detection of intestinal abnormalities and ischemia from control patterns. Experimental results obtained from the analysis of clinical data suggest the usefulness of the proposed uncertainty mapping model.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Intestinal abnormalities and ischemia are medical conditions of a restriction in blood supply to the bowel, blocking oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism to keep tissues alive. There are many types of bowel disorders and such conditions are not only uncomfortable, but can also lead to further health complications when left untreated. Intestinal ischemia can either affect the small or large (colon) intestine, or even both. As a consequence, intestinal ischemia caused by the inadequate blood flow can result in pain and can permanently damage the intestine. Sudden loss of blood flow to the intestine can cause acute intestinal ischemia that is a medical emergency, life-threatening, and requires immediate surgery. Intestinal ischemia that develops over time (chronic) requires treatment because it can become acute, or lead to severe weight loss and malnutrition [1–3]. Typical symptoms of acute intestinal ischemia are sudden abdominal pain, forceful bowel movements, swollen abdomen, nausea or vomiting or both, and fever. Intestinal ischemia can be divided into two categories: colon ischemia (ischemic colitis) and acute mesenteric ischemia [3]. Colon ischemia occurs when blood supply to the colon is inadequate and this is the most common type of intestinal ischemia. Colon ischemia usually affects adults over the age of 60 years old, but may occur at any age. Acute mesenteric ischemia affects the small intestine. Acute mesenteric ischemia occurs abruptly and blood clot is its most common cause that can result from congestive heart failure, irregular heartbeats, or a heart attack [3].

Several different invasive methods are used to detect abnormalities of the small intestine. A tissue specimen can be obtained by using an endoscope (a flexible viewing tube), or by using a thin tube with a small cutting instrument at the end; while several similar types of capsules are used for tissue collection [4–6]. Abdominal CT scanning is the current gold standard for the non-invasive clinical assessment of intestinal abnormalities and ischemia in emergency care. This imaging method uses X-rays to obtain the visual information of the cross-sectional (axial) areas of the part of the body between the thorax and the pelvis. Given the increasing use of CT as a screening technique for patients because of the growing confidence in this imaging technology; in many cases, surgeons are confused with the differential diagnosis of small-bowel abnormalities and ischemia on CT scans [7]. In fact, medical experts not only find it difficult to visually detect abnormalities based on CT findings of the bowels, it is still a challenge for surgeons to evaluate the similarities and differences in the CT appearances between healthy subjects and patients in other complex disorders such as pulmonary disease, which needs the incorporation of computer methods to provide pattern-recognition approaches to enhance the interpretation of imaging findings [8–10]. In general, the radiological findings of mesenteric ischemia have different course in case of different etiology. In particular, bowel wall thinning is typical but difficult to recognize so diagnosis may be hard. The prompt recognition of each condition is essential to ensure a successful treatment [11]. Therefore, the reliable detection of intestinal abnormalities and ischemia on CT findings is important for surgical decision making.

Most computer-aided methods for the analysis of medical images involve segmentation, registration, and feature extraction. To be effective, these computer tools need to meet the clinical relevance as well as the methodological feasibility with respect to image processing, data analysis, and pattern recognition to solve real-world medical problems. For the study of medical imaging, there are various imaging modalities, such as PET, MRI, CT and X-ray, which can belong to either structural or functional imaging, depending on the type of information provided by the image. Given that radiologists are trained in producing medical images, these experts but do not always have the background in the relevant area of medicine to interpret the images with confidence [12]. As advanced diagnostic imaging is rapidly pervading into therapeutic medicine, so there is an urgent need for hospitals and medical institutions world-wide to have possibilities to perform examinations with the aide of computerized pattern recognition technology. Such a computer-aided tool should have the capacity to automatically identify normal anatomical and physiological appearances on an image and the variations of these appearances, which may be identified as indicators of pathology [13].

Medical images are intrinsically characterized with structures of spatial patterns with respect to the size, shape, and arrangement of their components. These sub-image structures are often visual features of surfaces, whose properties can be appropriately described by spatial statistics. For automated pattern classification of medical images, advanced methods for feature extraction are important because they help select concise and discriminative properties of raw-image objects while eliminate redundancy existing in a large amount of information contained in the image [14,15]. This feature extraction process is usually specific for a certain type of disease and is derived from the findings obtained by medical experts [16]. Based on the extracted features, classifiers or machine-learning algorithms can be trained with these samples to carry out the diagnostic identification of unknown objects in terms of specificity and sensitivity. This study is also concerned with the extraction of an effective feature of medical images, representing its texture. This is because the definition of texture mostly fits well into the description of appearances of medical images, which can be used to distinguish complex diseased from normal patterns. In fact, texture analysis is very helpful for the classification of different regions of interest in medical images. It is an increasingly on-going field of research which reports applications ranging from the extraction of anatomical structures and lesions to the recognition of pathological tissues from healthy ones in different organs [17–19].

Based on the motivation of developing an effective algorithm for the detection of intestinal abnormalities and ischemia, a new application of a geostatistical mapping of spatial uncertainty in images for automated pattern identification of the intestinal disorders is introduced herein. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the material and methods. Section 3 presents results together with discussions. Finally, Section 4 is the conclusion of the findings.

CT scans were obtained from patients who had surgery because of the peritonitis with the suspicion of the bowel ischemia except for one control patient who was admitted in our unit for other reason. The patients were diagnosed by physical examination, blood tests and CT scans. Important physical findings of peritonitis were the muscular defense and rebound tenderness. The lactic acidosis elevation suggested the bowel ischemia in the blood test. If the renal function of the patient was normal, intravenous contrast (IV) was used to enhance the CT. The CT finding was read by the attending radiologist. The CT patterns of the black and gray attenuation in the intestine were indicators of bowel ischemia. After the diagnosis of peritonitis with bowel ischemia, the emergency surgery was carried out. If the bowel was necrotic (of dead body tissue), it was resected.

Eleven subjects were included in this study: eight patients of ischemia, one benign and two control subjects. Four ischemic patients had surgery. The ischemic bowels were resected in eight patients because of the necrosis of the small bowels. One patient had surgery without the bowel colectomy (procedure of removing the colon). The two control subjects include a 17-year-old male, who had his whole body CT scanned due to other injury and his abdominal CT was normal; and a 30-year-old male, who was a trauma patient, had his liver and his lung injured, and his intestine was healthy. In the ischemic cohort, the 80-year-old (Patient 1) and 87-year-old (Patient 2) female patients had small-bowel resection because of small-bowel ischemia, the 76-year-old male (Patient 3) had his descending colon resected because of colon ischemia, the 81-year-old female underwent a small bowel resection because of the necrosis of the small bowel (Patient 4), the 65-year-old male (Patient 5) has the partial resection of his small bowel and subtotal resection of the large bowel because of the necrosis of the terminal ileum and large bowel, the 79-year-old female (Patient 6) had the subtotal resection of the small bowel and right hemicolectomy (the ascending colon and half of the transverse colon) because of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) thrombosis, another 65-year-old male (Patient 7) had the sigmoid colon resection because of the necrotic ischemic colitis, and the 53-year-old male (Patient 8) had the left hemicolectomy (from mid of the transverse colon to the rectum). The benign subject is the 76-year-old female who underwent surgery without bowel resection.

The CT and operation findings of the subjects were compared. This retrospective study was approved by the patients’ informed consents, which waived approval by our institutional review board. Fig. 1
                         shows typical intravenous contrast-enhanced CT scans of a control (30-year-old male), benign, Patient 6 (female), and Patient 8 (male), respectively.

Image patterns about the CT diagnosis of intestinal abnormalities and ischemia have been explored by medical researchers [20,7,21], which can be utilized for computerized extraction of features of the regions of interests in the CT images. In particular, five attenuation patterns described in [20] were adopted in this study to train computer methods for automated detection of the disease. These patterns include white, gray, water halo sign, fat halo sign, and black 
                        [20]. The interpretations of these five attenuation patterns are as follows. The white attenuation pattern describes the contrast material enhancement affecting the thickened bowel wall. The gray attenuation pattern is the sign of a thickened bowel wall with limited enhancement. This pattern of gray attenuation is often used to differentiate between benign and malignant disease. The water halo sign indicates stratification within a thickened bowel wall that consists of thickened layers. The fat halo sign presents a three-layered target sign of thickened bowel in which the middle layer has a fatty attenuation, referring to Crohn disease in the small intestine and inflammatory bowel diseases in the colon. The black attenuation pattern, which particularly shows air trapped between the bowel walls, indicates ischemia. Fig. 2
                         shows typical results of the automated searching for the regions of interest in CT scans of the five subjects, which are difficult to distinguish one from another by shape or boundary but its textural appearance. In fact, texture in images can be recognized by visual observation but it is very difficult to define [22]. A typical definition of texture is “A region in an image has a constant texture if a set of local statistics or other local properties of the picture function are constant, slowly varying, or approximately periodic.” [23]. Recently, geostatistics, which can be used as a mathematical tool for modeling spatial uncertainty to quantify texture, has been reported [15,24]. Therefore, developing a novel method for extracting texture in medical images is a technical motivation of this paper, in addition to addressing the need for the computerized analysis of a medical imaging problem presented for the first time.

A statistical technique for modeling spatial uncertainty is the method of indicator kriging [25,26], which estimates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to characterize the probability of occurrence of f

Based on the mapping of the spatial uncertainty in an image using the indicator kriging, each pixel of the image can be represented with a conditional probability given by the indicator kriging. In other words, the image can now be represented as a matrix of probabilities. To quantify a measure of uncertainty, these probabilities need to be transformed into entropy. It should be noted that each probability in either each row or column of the matrix is a conditional CDF that reflects the spatial uncertainty of the corresponding image intensity not exceeding a threshold. A possible way to integrate these multiple probabilities into a single measure of uncertainty is by the use of the fuzzy entropy [28], in which these probabilities are considered as the membership grades of an image being subject to a fuzzy content. In fact, fuzzy information has been proved that it can be uniquely decomposed into a weighted disjunction of non-fuzzy sources of information [29,30]. The fuzzy entropy applied here is defined as a “measure of the degree of fuzziness” or entropy of a generalized set [28], and mathematically expressed as

Having introduced the indicator kriging for mapping the spatial uncertainty in images and its fuzzy entropy, the issue here is how the threshold T can be determined. One possible solution is to use a threshold image segmentation method to obtain T for each region of interest (ROI) and then obtain the minimum and maximum values of T. The results are the entropy values of an image for each threshold and these entropies can be integrated using a fusion scheme, which is described in the following section.

In order to combine multiple pieces of evidence about the uncertainty degrees of the images obtained from the indicator kriging with different threshold values, these sources of uncertainty need to be integrated into a scalar value so that it can also be included with other scalar features for pattern classification. Here we present a fusion scheme, which can combine the thresholded entropy values into a conditional probability, as follows.

Let P(W|Y) and P(W|Z) be the conditional probabilistic distributions that model the uncertainty of some target variable W, given two information sources Y and Z, respectively. The interest is how these two sources of information can be combined into a fusion model probability, which is P(W|Y, Z). The determination of this combined conditional probability is often very difficult because it would require a rich data set for checking or adjusting the accuracy of observations about the target variable, and such data sets are often not available [31].

A simple and general model for the combination of probabilities has been developed and applied in this study, namely, the permanence-of-ratios-based fusion [32,33]. Based on the well-proven paradigm for the approximation of the permanence of ratios, this fusion operator asserts that the rates or ratios of increments are typically more stable than the increments themselves and assumes conditional independence between the different sources of information [32]. In other words, if P(W) is the prior probability of the occurrence of class W; P(W|Y) and P(W|Z) are the probabilities of the occurrence of class W given the knowledge provided by Y and Z, respectively; the approach based on the notion of the permanence of ratios allows the information sources Y and Z to be incrementally and conditionally dependent, and its fusion scheme gives the updated probability as follows [32]:

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Having discussed before, the five attenuation patterns (white, gray, water halo sign, fat halo sign, and black) described in [20] were adopted in this study to train computer methods for automated detection of the disease. In order to automate the detection of bowel abnormalities and ischemia, a computerized identification for potential regions of interest is developed by a forward search strategy. This forward search uses a window that has the average size of all the trained patterns to start at the top-left corner of the image and moves forward from left to right and from top to bottom of the image. The feature vector extracted from the sub-image occupied by the searching window is matched against the feature vector of each of the trained patterns using a Euclidean distance measure. If the similarity is greater than a certain threshold, then the window expands to the right, below, and diagonal positions. Each of the potential windows will be retained if the similarity satisfies the threshold criterion, which is defined using the definition of the relative error as follows.

The Otsu's method [34] for image segmentation was used to establish a threshold T for the computation of the kriging indicator. The minimum and maximum thresholds for each set of ROIs were obtained to calculate the corresponding indicator-kriging conditional probability matrices that were then used to quantify the spatial uncertainty of the image using the fuzzy entropy. The values of the fuzzy entropy provided by different thresholds were combined using the permanence-of-ratios-based fusion, and used as a feature for the pattern classification. The classification was carried out by the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method, where k
                     =1, 3, and 5. All the testing data were labeled (ground truth) so that the classification rates could be accurately determined.

Other six features, which have been recently used for the classification of intestinal abnormalities and ischemia using a smaller dataset (3 patients, 1 benign, and 1 control) [36], are also included in this study with a larger dataset. These six features are the intensity mean, intensity variance, skewness, kurtosis, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, and fractal dimension. To overcome the variations of different features that may have different dynamic ranges and features with large values will have a stronger bias in the calculation of some distance measure for pattern classification, a feature normalization is adopted to restrict the values of all features within a normalized range by transforming the features to zero mean and unit variance. Both IV contrast-enhanced and unenhanced CT scans of each subject, which contain images of the intestines, were used to test the performance of the proposed approach. The window sizes in pixels, which were selected as the average dimensions of the window sizes of all trained attenuation patterns for searching potential regions of interest are: 60 by 60 for white, 50 by 50 for gray, 40 by 50 for water halo, 60 by 50 for fat halo, 60 by 60 for black, 50 by 60 for ischemia, 50 by 50 for gray attenuation of benign, 50 by 70 for control-like intensity of benign, and 50 by 60 for control. The spatial orientation of the GLCM was selected as “one pixel to the right and one pixel down” (diagonal of 45°).

The data were randomly split into 10 subsets of 2200 samples of five attenuation patterns (white, gray, water halo sign, fat halo sign, and black) extracted from the 11 sets of CT scans for training and testing the proposed approach, where each splitting consists of half of the extracted features for training and the other half for testing.

                      are the confusion matrices using the Euclidean distance measure, k-NN (k
                     =1) classifier with seven individual features: intensity mean, intensity variance, skewness, kurtosis, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), fractal dimension (FD), and uncertainty mapping by indicator kriging (UM), respectively. The results shown in Table 1–7 were obtained by using 50% of the pattern features for training and the other 50% for testing. For classification among the ischemia, benign and control subjects; the performances of the seven individual features are observed as follows. The mean feature detects the control pattern the best (68.10%), then the ischemia (25.4%), and the benign (4.3%). The descending order of the variance feature is the ischemia (22.8%), control (12.0%), and benign (2.3%). For the skewness feature, the descending order of performance is the control (32.6%), ischemia (26.5%), and benign (5.0%). For the kurtosis feature, the order is the control (26.6%), ischemia (26.0%), and benign (8.5%). The gray-level co-occurrence matrix yields the highest classification to the ischemia (31.1%) over the control (13.4%) and benign (11.5%). The fractal-dimension also gives the highest classification to the ischemia (19.2%) over the control (13.3%) and benign (2.5%). Finally, the uncertainty-mapping feature recognized the ischemia pattern (50.1%) better than the control (33%) and benign (17.7%). In general, the uncertainty mapping obtains the highest specificity (true ischemia rate or true negative rate); while the mean feature gives the highest sensitivity (true control rate or true positive rate). The uncertainty-mapping feature also yields the best performance for the classification of the benign. However, the benign are relatively poorly classified by all the features.

The leave-one-out method was used with the random selection of training and testing data to enhance the statistics of the experimental results. The average results using six features (intensity mean, intensity variance, skewness, kurtosis, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, and fractal dimension) for the classification with k-NN (k
                     =1, 2, and 3) are shown in Table 8
                     . Table 9
                      shows the average classification results using seven features in which the another feature derived from the uncertainty mapping by indicator kriging is included, with k-NN (k
                     =1, 2, and 3) are shown in Table 10
                     . With the inclusion the uncertainty-mapping feature, the classification of all the eight patterns (white, gray, water, fat, black, ischemia, benign, and control) are improved; particularly, the classification of the benign is 2.3 times better than with the inclusion of the uncertainty-mapping feature. Furthermore, Table 10 shows the ranking of the seven features for the classification of abnormalities (white, gray, water, fat, black), ischemia, benign and control. The variance, fractal dimension (FD), and uncertainty mapping (UM) have the same ranking order. All intensity mean, intensity variance, skewness, kurtosis, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), fractal dimension (FD), and uncertainty mapping (UM) have the same last ranking of performance about the classification of the benign. Such mostly confusing detection of the benign is expected because of its inherent nature and the lack of availability of the data for the training of the pattern-extraction methods.

Sensitivity has been previously mentioned to be problematic in the assessment of emergency department patients [35]. The high sensitivity reported in this study by the uncertainty mapping appears to be promising for the detection of intestinal abnormalities and ischemia. It has been pointed out that in the assessment of patients with bowel obstruction, an important role of CT findings is to differentiate a simple obstruction from a complicated one, such as a closed-loop or strangulated bowel obstruction; however, the evaluation of this specific CT finding has been based on visual assessment [21]. The proposed feature extraction and classification for automated detection of the disease seems to be promising a potential solution to overcome such a problem. Regarding the proposed search for potential regions of interest, although the automated forward search has been shown to work reasonably well and can overcome the demand for an effective image segmentation of the intestines, an accurate image segmentation of the regions of interest would certainly speed up the analysis as well as increase the detection accuracy.

Here we carried out a study on the cohorts of diseased, benign and control subjects. Future provision of comprehensive CT datasets, particularly the benign, can be trained to uncover abnormalities in patients with or without symptoms referable to the intestinal tract to better assist the surgeon with the task of urgent diagnosis and operational decision making [20]. It has been realized that intestinal wall morphologic and enhancement abnormalities can be seen with bowel disorders in various ways [20]. This study has not considered the morphology of the CT findings, which can be accommodated using probabilistic methods to capture the spatial relationship of the bowel-wall features. Any successful automated detection of ischemia and abnormality is not only helpful to patients admitted to the emergency care, it can also be a useful computer tool to aid the radiologist in developing a systematic approach for determining the specific cause of the intestinal abnormality and ischemia of both small and large intestines.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A new method for feature extraction of CT scans for the classification of intestinal abnormalities and ischemia has been presented and discussed. The results show the promising application of the proposed uncertainty-mapping model. As geostatistics has been found useful for medical image analysis [37,38], this indicator-kriging feature can be utilized for texture analysis of CT findings of other diseases [38,39]. In this study, a binary threshold-based image segmentation method was adopted to compute the indicator-kriging conditional probability matrix. Advanced methods or strategy for the determination of the image threshold to better distinguish the object(s) and background of medical images would expect to improve the uncertainty modeling and the extracted feature. The use of fuzzy measures for information fusion of multiple features or classifiers [40,41] would be an effective strategy for a better detection of the bowel disorders.
