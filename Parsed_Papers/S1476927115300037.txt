                  Background
                  The complexity of DNA can be quantified using estimates of entropy. Variation in DNA complexity is expected between the promoters of genes with different transcriptional mechanisms; namely housekeeping (HK) and tissue specific (TS). The former are transcribed constitutively to maintain general cellular functions, and the latter are transcribed in restricted tissue and cells types for specific molecular events. It is known that promoter features in the human genome are related to tissue specificity, but this has been difficult to quantify on a genomic scale. If entropy effectively quantifies DNA complexity, calculating the entropies of HK and TS gene promoters as profiles may reveal significant differences.
               
               
                  Results
                  Entropy profiles were calculated for a total dataset of 12,003 human gene promoters and for 501 housekeeping (HK) and 587 tissue specific (TS) human gene promoters. The mean profiles show the TS promoters have a significantly lower entropy (p
                     <2.2e−16) than HK gene promoters. The entropy distributions for the 3 datasets show that promoter entropies could be used to identify novel HK genes.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  Functional features comprise DNA sequence patterns that are non-random and hence they have lower entropies. The lower entropy of TS gene promoters can be explained by a higher density of positive and negative regulatory elements, required for genes with complex spatial and temporary expression.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the human genome 5% of the DNA is estimated to be under selection pressure (Waterston et al., 2002), but only 1.5% is estimated to be coding (Lander et al., 2001). This indicates that elements of non-coding DNA are under selection pressure, and by implication have functional roles (Mu et al., 2011). Gene promoters comprise non-coding DNA but include large numbers of sequence features, including binding sites for transcription factors (TFs) that contribute to the regulation of gene expression. An increasing understanding of the importance of non-coding DNA has led to many methods being applied to the problem of differentiating functional and non-functional sites within them. Estimating the entropy of DNA, using concepts from the field of information theory (Schneider 2010), is one way in which genomic elements have been analysed.

Definitions of entropy, including topological, Shannon, linguistic complexity and lossless compression have been applied to genomic regions from diverse genomes with varying results (Table 1
                     ). Five studies, applying definitions of topological entropy (Karamanos et al., 2006), Shannon entropy (Mantegna et al., 1995; Stanley et al., 1999), linguistic complexity (Troyanskaya et al., 2002) and lossless compression (Liu et al., 2008), conclude that non-coding DNA has a lower entropy than coding DNA. In contrast, 3 studies, one applying Shannon entropy (Mazaheri et al., 2010) and a 2 applying topological entropy (Koslicki 2011; Jin et al., 2014) conclude that non-coding DNA has higher entropy than coding DNA. The variation likely results from the differing and often very small DNA datasets used (Table 1), which for some analyses reflects the emphasis on the theoretical entropy calculation rather than its biological application. In addition some studies have defined noncoding DNA as intergenic DNA only (e.g., Mazaheri et al., 2010) or intronic DNA only (Koslicki 2011; Jin et al., 2014), whilst others have included both types of DNA as non-coding (Karamanos et al., 2006). If differences in entropies between different types of DNA are small, then it is not surprising that studies using different datasets and definitions have reached different conclusions.

Two recent studies both apply definitions of topological entropy to systematic random samples of genes from all chromosomes in the human genome, and conclude that introns have a higher entropy than exons (Koslicki 2011; Jin et al., 2014). This can be explained by the fact that entropy is a measure of the randomness of a DNA sequence, and introns are expected to be more random as they have fewer functional signals and are less conserved than exons (Koslicki 2011; Jin et al., 2014). It has also been concluded that exons have a higher entropy than gene promoters (Jin et al., 2014), which could reflect the presence of multiple functional elements within the promoters which are under selection pressure. These include transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) characterised by short sequence motifs that are highly degenerate. The TFBSs are bound cooperatively by TFs to form cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), which play a key role in gene regulation (Hardison and Taylor 2012). TFBSs represent DNA sequence patterns within promoters and hence have lower entropies, as observed in Escherichia coli (Krishnamachari et al., 2004).

In addition to work comparing non-coding and coding DNA entropies, entropies have been used to create profiles for DNA sequence windows for complete chromosomes and genomes. Entropy profiles, based on linguistic complexity, created for 16 prokaryotic genomes, revealed differences in complexity between CG and AT rich genomes (Troyanskaya et al., 2002). Average mutual information (AMI) profiles created for chromosomes from eukaryotes, showed that such profiles are effective species signatures (Bauer et al., 2008). Topological entropy profiles calculated for Saccharomyces cerevisiae also proved to be effective in quantifying the level of repetitive sequences in regions of DNA (Crochemore and Verin 1999). In additional work, entropy profiles based on the theory of chaotic dynamics (Jeffrey, 1990) have been shown to quantify local DNA signatures (Dufraigne et al., 2005). This method was successfully applied to the identification of horizontal gene transfers between prokaryotic species (Dufraigne et al., 2005). In further work, profiles using Renyi entropies (a generalized of the Shannon entropy) were created and applied them to the identification of statistical significant of DNA sequence motifs, including TFBSs in prokaryotic gene promoters (Vinga and Almeida 2007).

As discussed, work has shown that entropy profiles can effectively measure both the complexity of local DNA sequences and act as global species signatures. In the current work the effectiveness of entropy profiles for measuring differences in DNA sequences at a level intermediate of the two is addressed. A topological definition of entropy is used to identify global sequence signatures in the promoters of genes with different transcriptional mechanisms in the human genome. Genes can be transcribed constitutively to maintain general cellular functions or be transcribed in restricted tissue and cells types for specific molecular events (Butte et al., 2001; Chang et al., 2011). The former are termed housekeeping genes (HK) and the latter tissue specific genes (TS). It is known that promoter features are related to tissue specificity (Schug et al., 2005; Farré et al., 2007), with TS genes having higher levels of nucleosome occupancy and higher densities of TFBSs (She et al., 2009). Such features facilitate the close transcriptional control required for expression in specific cell or tissue types. The hypothesis for the current work is that promoter features will give rise to different levels of DNA complexity that can be measured using entropy profiles. The identification of differences in DNA complexity of HK and TS gene promoters would be a first step in classifying additional genes to these two important transcriptional classes.

@&#METHODS@&#

All genes with Human and Vertebrate Analysis and Annotation (HAVANA) annotations were extracted from the human GRCh38 genome assembly in Ensembl [release 77], using the application programming interface (Flicek et al., 2012). A gene subset, that comprised those with an intergenic region (defined as nucleotides between the transcription start site (TSS) of one gene and the 3′ UTR of the proceeding gene) of ≥30K base pairs (bp), was then selected. This subset ensured that promoter regions did not include introns or exons of the proceeding gene when entropies of upstream regions >10K base pairs were calculated (see Section 2.2.2). This dataset was denoted HAV1.

A subset of housekeeping (HK) and tissue specific (TS) genes were then extracted from the HAV1 dataset. This was based on a meta-analysis of 104 microarray datasets from 43 normal human tissues, that identified 2064 human HK and 2293 human TS genes (Chang et al., 2011). The HK and TS genes from this analysis were mapped to the HAV1 dataset, and the matched gene sets denoted HAV_HK and HAV_TS, respectively. This extraction left 12,003 genes remaining from the HAV1 dataset, and this was denoted HAV_12003.

The definition of topological entropy (H
                           top) as defined by Koslicki (2011) is as follows:

In this definition H
                           top is explained in terms of a DNA sequence having an alphabet of 4 bases. For this alphabet a string of length 1028 could contain every unique 5 base pair sequence (45
                           =1024 (+(5−1) for the rolling window)). H
                           top calculates the number of unique subsequences found by taking the log base 4 (alphabet size) of the count and dividing by the length of the substring. For a 5bp subsequence within a 1028 base pair rolling window, the maximum possible number of unique subsequences is 1024 (45). If 50 unique subsequences are observed then the entropy is 0.56 (log4(50)/5), if 500 were observed the entropy would be 0.896 (log4(500)/5) etc. This means that systems with non-random sequences featuring functional patterns, have a low number of unique substrings, and hence a low entropy. Random sequences have higher entropies. Outline code of the Java module used to calculate the rolling window entropies is provided as supplementary data.

Entropy profiles were calculated for 4-mers in a forward rolling window of 259 base pairs for DNA regions surrounding the transcription start site (TSS). Profiles were initially calculated and tested on regions >10K base pairs upstream of the TSS for a small number of genes, but the compute time prohibited such large regions being analysed for the complete dataset. Hence, entropy profiles were calculated for a promoter region that extended from −2.5Kbp upstream to +0.5Kbp downstream of the TSS of each gene. For each profile a per base pair entropy was assigned by attributing the entropy of the forward rolling window to the first base pair in the window. A mean entropy profile was mapped for the complete HAV_12003 dataset and for the HAV_HK and HAV_TS datasets (Fig. 1
                           A). It should be noted that the forward rolling window of 259bp means that the calculation of entropy for base pairs from −258bp towards the TSS includes base pairs that are downstream of the TSS and potentially sample the first exons and/or introns of the gene. The resulting profiles are comparable to those presented in the entropy analysis of 21 prokaryotic genomes (Troyanskaya et al., 2002).

The significance of the differences observed in the profiles between the HAV_HK and HAV_TS datasets was quantified by calculating a P-value using the Wilcoxon signed rank non-parametric test of group differences, implemented by the Wilcox.test function in the MASS package (version 7.3-35) (Venables and Ripley, 2002) in R (R Core Team, 2014).

In order to measure the relative complexity of promoters, mean entropies were calculated for random DNA sequences. The entropies of random sequences were generated by permuting the DNA in a 259bp window repeatedly, as the window rolled across the promoter. For each random permutation of the 259bp window entropies were calculated based on a word size of 4. Random permutations of bases were generated using the Java random method. This gave random sequences that had a GC content that matched the base pairs of the forward rolling window in the real gene promoters. A mean entropy profile was then calculated for −2.5Kbp to +0.5Kbp for the HAV_12003, HAV_HK and HAV_TS datasets (Fig. 1A).

The profiles in Fig. 1A represent mean entropies for each gene dataset. In order to assess the variation in entropies, the distribution of entropies for all genes in each dataset was plotted using the geom-density function of the ggplot2 (version 1.0) (Wickham, 2009) package in R (R Core Team, 2014) (Fig. 2
                           ). The distributions were calculated for the region −2.5K to −259bp upstream of the TSS, so that the entropies were based on a forward rolling window that did not sample into the gene.

DNA entropy is influenced by GC content (Troyanskaya et al., 2002). To assess the relationship between CG content and the entropy profiles, a percentage CG profile was calculated by attributing the CG content of a 259bp forward rolling window (to match the entropy profile rolling window size) to the first base pair in the window. Mean percentage CG profiles were calculated for −2.5Kbp to +0.5Kbp for the HAV_12003, HAV_HK and HAV_TS datasets (Fig. 1B).

@&#RESULTS@&#

The HAV_12003 data set extracted from the GRCh38 human genome assembly, comprised 12,003 genes. The HAV_HK dataset comprised 507 genes and the HAV_TS dataset comprised 596 genes, which represent 4.1% and 4.9% of the HAV_12003 dataset respectively. The HAV_12003 gene dataset essentially comprises as yet unidentified TS genes (and to a much smaller extent HK genes), as well as genes with expression levels that do not fit the definition of HK and TS genes.

The mean entropy profiles for the promoter regions of all 3 datasets (HAV_12003, HAV_HK and HAV_TS) have lower entropies than random DNA, as would be expected (Fig. 1). The real promoter regions are comprised of functional regions, such as TFBSs, which are under selection pressure and hence cannot evolve randomly. The key feature of the entropy profiles is that TS gene promoters have significantly lower entropies than HK gene promoters (p
                        <2.2e−16). This is likely to be reflective of an increased density of functional sequence features within the TS promoters.

The aligned %GC profiles (Fig. 1B) show that entropy of the promoters is not simply explained by variations in GC content, as the %CG profiles do not mirror the variations in the entropy profiles. All the %CG profiles show an increase from −1.5Kbp upstream to beyond the TSS, with the largest increases when the rolling window samples into the gene, and includes coding DNA, known to be more CG rich than non-coding DNA (Vinogradov, 2003).

The definition of topological entropy used here, means that the size of the forward rolling window is related to the word sized (see Section 2.2.1): the larger the word size the larger the rolling window. To test the effect of a different word size, profiles were also created for a word size of 5 that give a forward rolling window of 1059bp (Supplementary data: Fig. S1). These profiles also showed TS gene promoters had significantly lower entropy than HK gene promoters. The same held true when a mean entropy profile for a combined word size of 4 and 5 was also calculated (as the average entropy in each window of the two word sizes) (Supplementary data: Fig. S2). Hence, whilst using different word sizes moves the trough in the entropy profiles further upstream of the TSS (as the point at which the rolling window starts to sample into the gene moves further upstream), it does not change the overall conclusion; that TS gene promoters have lower entropy than HK gene promoters.

The density plots of promoter entropies for the region between −2.5Kbp and −259bp shows that the HK gene promoters have an overlapping, yet distinct distribution (Fig. 2). The density distribution for the TS genes is shifted towards lower entropies, whilst the HK genes are shifted towards higher entropies, as would be expected from the significantly different entropy profiles (Fig. 1A). The distribution of entropies for genes in the HAV_12003 dataset is completely overlaid by the HK and TS distributions, but most resembles the TS density distribution with a long tail of lower entropies. This could be reflective of the HAV_12003 dataset comprising a greater number of unidentified TS gene promoters and only a small number of HK genes (see Section 4), but the densities are not definitive.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

By creating mean topological entropy profiles for gene datasets from the entire human genome, we effectively quantify variations in DNA complexity between the promoters of HK and TS genes. These variations can be attributed to functional features of the promoters, and not just compositional biases related to high GC content which is known to vary within promoters (Koudritsky and Domany, 2008; Jaksik and Rzeszowska-Wolny, 2012).

A gene promoter generically comprises a core promoter positioned +1bp to −120bp relative to the TSS, a proximal promoter −120bp to −1Kbp and a distal promoter at an unknown distance from the TSS (Maston et al., 2006). In some cases TFs have >25% of their binding sites positioned >20Kbp upstream of the TSS, indicating the importance of long-range gene expression regulation (Lee et al., 2012). Such data indicate that, in general, gene promoters do not have well defined boundaries, and architectures vary widely between genes (Hackanson et al., 2008; Vikman et al., 2009). However, even though promoters are ill-defined they are known to encode large numbers of sequence features, including GC rich regions, short sequence repeats, TFBS; as well as nucleosome occupancy and DNA curvature signatures. Our entropy profiles quantify the complexity of these specific features, as well as the background DNA within which they lie.

TS and HK genes can be considered as transcriptomic extremes (Chang et al., 2011), with TS genes being under complex regulatory control of multiple specific TFs, and HK genes having simpler regulatory mechanisms in which basal promoters predominate (Farré et al., 2007). In the current work promoters of TS genes were shown to have significantly lower entropies than the HK genes. The promoters of mammalian TS-genes are more conserved than HK genes due to an increased density of functional sequence regions (Farré et al., 2007) and our TS promoter entropies reflect this. A high density of binding sites is likely to be required for the control of genes with complex spatial and temporary expression profiles, such as those with expression restricted to specific tissues. The promoters of HK genes also have lower levels of nucleosome occupancy, which is partly determined by sequence signals (Segal et al., 2006). Hence, the lack of such sequence signals could also contribute to the increased entropy of these promoters.

In this analysis we selected genes with >30Kbp intergenic regions, to ensure the promoters did not include introns or exons of a proceeding gene, and increase the confidence that sequence signals in the promoter were linked to the selected gene. This selection does mean we have sampled genes from regions of lower gene density. Whilst there is some evidence that gene density is positively correlated with TFBS density the variance is large (Lee et al., 2012). Hence, whilst it is possible that the promoters we have analysed could have lower levels of TFBSs than if a smaller threshold had been used, this is not considered an important factor, and the same threshold has been applied to both the HK and the TS datasets.

In this work, we show that TS gene promoters have significantly lower entropies than HK gene promoters, and it was initially hypothesized that entropies could be used to classify additional HK and TS genes from the HAV_12003 dataset. However, the densities of entropy values do overlap (Fig. 2); and initial tests on developing a support vector machine to differentiate HK from TS genes gave a relatively low 63% accuracy in a 10-fold cross validation. Hence, it appears that the entropy values alone are not enough to differentiate HK from TS genes or alternatively that the overlap of entropy distributions could be reflective of the way in which HK and TS genes are defined.

Whilst it is known that the number of HK genes in the human genome will be relatively small, studies have identified significantly different numbers of such genes in the human genome (from 451 to 3140) (Chang et al., 2011); and the definition of HK genes is currently being debated (Fantom Consortium, 2014). The mean number of HK genes defined in previous studies comprise approximately 10% of protein coding genes (Chang et al., 2011). A more recent study estimated the number to be even smaller at just 6%, when HK genes were defined as those showing ubiquitous and uniform expression (Fantom Consortium, 2014). The definition and hence numbers of HK genes identified is dependent upon three factors: (a) the technology used to measure gene expression; these include microarrays (e.g., Chang et al., 2011), RNA-sequencing (e.g., Eisenberg and Levanon, 2013) or single molecular cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) (Fantom Consortium, 2014); (b) the analysis of expression by tissue or cell type (Shen-Orr et al., 2010) and (c) the statistical methods used to calculate expression thresholds (Dai et al., 2013).

The HK genes used in the current work were defined from 1431 samples from 42 normal human tissue types from 104 microarray data sets (Chang et al., 2011). Complex tissue types, such as the brain, have many different cell types expressed at different levels, and hence the expression measured will be strongly influenced by the sample variation on cell type frequencies (Shen-Orr et al., 2010). Hence, whilst the HK and TS genes datasets used in the current study meet one set of definitions, the use of expression data from other technologies and based on cell-type could re-classify some genes. The complexity of the transcriptional classification of genes (and whether such classifications are still valid in the light of new high-throughput gene expression data) is a key issue that needs to be considered when future models of transcription are developed.

As well as re-considering gene classification and functional DNA regions in promoter regions, future models of transcription also need to account for transcription factor specificity and affinity. These two parameters are complex; as specificity is difficult to quantify (Yan and Wang, 2012), and affinity is difficult to measure in-vitro. Binding affinities have been measured for TFs in specific systems (Prouse and Campbell, 2013; Wang et al., 2009), but methods present problems when scaling up to whole genomes. The affinity of TFs to bind specific TFBSs is also affected by flanking DNA sequences (Siggers and Gordân, 2013) and by cooperative binding of additional TFs (He et al., 2009). The future development of more realistic models of transcription regulation requires a better understanding of the relationship between TFBS occupancy, TF binding affinities and their relationship to a revised transcriptional classification of genes. This will lead to dynamic and cooperative models of binding where TFs interact with both promoter DNA and multiple copies of the same or different TFs.
