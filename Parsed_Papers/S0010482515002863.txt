                  Objective
                  Research was conducted on parametric profiles of healthy subjects and patients with cervico-brachial pain syndrome resulting from C4/5 and/or C5/6 discopathy, including magnetic remanence of tissues in marker points 1-12 (L+R) and functional parameters, and their subsequent change after treatment in group A, using method of push-pull galvanic magnetostimulation (GMT 2.0).
               
               
                  Design
                  GMT 2.0 device, comprised of one air solenoid and three galvanic solenoids in electrolytic tubs, was designed for push-pull magnetostimulation of the head, coupled with simultaneous stimulation of the limbs.
               
               
                  Setting
                  Clinical trial was conducted in Outpatient Private Clinic “VIS” under the auspices of Silesian Higher Medical School in Katowice, Poland.
               
               
                  Patients
                  55 subjects participated in the study: control group K consisted of 23 healthy individuals, whereas 33 patients in group A were treated using GMT 2.0.
               
               
                  Intervention
                  Only patients in group A were treated with GMT 2.0 during 40-min sessions over a period of 10 days.
               
               
                  Main outcome measures
                  Parametric profile of the patients was defined using various measurements: electronic SFTR test (C-Th-shoulders), HR, RR, BDI and VAS tests, magnetic remanence in marker points 1-12 (L+R) and blood parameters: HB, ER, CREA, BIL, K+, Na+, Cl− Fe2+, Ca2+ and Mg2+.
               
               
                  Results
                  There was a significant reduction in pain (VAS), increase in the range of motion (SFTR), lower depression symptoms (BDI), slower heart rate (HR), lower blood pressure (RR), greater concentration of Mg2+, K+, Ca2+ions and reduction in the concentration of BIL, CREA Fe2+ after GMT 2.0 treatment in group A. Evaluation of magnetic remanence in marker points M1-12 (L+R) initially showed higher values in group K, which after treatment were normalized to values similar to those in group K.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  GMT 2.0 treatment in group A resulted in normalization of magnetic remanence, synergically with increased range of motion (SFTR test), decreased HR and RR parameters, smaller depressive trends (BDI test), as well as increased ion levels (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) and better functional parameters of kidneys and liver.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The arms and the cervical spine, thanks to their complex range of motion, form one of the finest movement systems in the human body. They allow the individual to explore the surrounding environment by means of telereceptors and touch. They also provide people with the tools needed to shape the environment. Structurally, the cervical spine meets the requirements for perception and directional communication, providing the head with a wide range of active mobility in three planes and the hands with the highest number of degrees of freedom, a feature found only in primates. The complexity of this structure is a source of a number of conflicts, which mainly include disc-radicular and disc-vascular conflict, as failure of a single link in the system causes direct or indirect motor function disorder of the entire complex [1].

The cervical spine plays an important role in the protection of the cervical blood vessels, the spinal cord and the nerve segments, especially during the execution of individual motor behaviours. The concentration of a large number of critical structures in the immediate vicinity of the spine means that small functional and anatomic changes in its structure have a direct impact on the vessels and sensorimotor nerves. These changes can also have a modifying effect by altering the functions of other organs such as the brain, the labyrinth, heart, lungs, and even the kidneys or liver. This is also reflected in the symptomatology of cervico-brachial syndromes caused mostly by disc-radicular conflict in the C4/5–C5/6 segments (
                     Fig. 1a) where, apart from the pain and the dysfunction of the spine and upper limbs (Fig. 1b) [2], balance issues begin to appear (including abnormal heart rates and systolic-diastolic pressure). Disc-radicular conflicts, originally a consequence of functional changes (instability of the segment), lead to permanent anatomical changes resulting in long-lasting conflict with axial (sensorimotor) innervations [3], as well as autonomous innervations, causing vascular issues and disorders of distant organs, such as the heart, brain, lungs, labyrinth, liver and kidneys. As such, the syndrome affects many organs and poses a serious metrological and therapeutic challenge [4].

Many years of attempts to quantify the parameters of pathology in disc-radicular conflicts ([5–7] e.g. in cervico-brachial syndromes), have encountered a number of difficulties associated with the need to transform the facts described by means of medical language into strict mathematical and parametric formulas [8,9]. Initially, indirect, semi-quantitative methods were used, based on a subjective and numeric classification of disease characteristics, for example, by using numeric scales of quality of life (e.g. Rolland-Morris), the VAS pain scale, BDI tests and other[10–12].

The SFTR scale is successfully used in instrumental studies. Initially, it was carried out by using hand-held goniometric tools, whereas now, automated inclinometric systems are being used [13] and their correlation with survey tests [14–17].

Attention needs to be drawn to the fact that for a long time the anatomical structure of the body, including the cervical spine and shoulder girdle, can be described in electric terms, as a spatial, multi-modular system of various electrolytic compartments, separated from each other by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interlobular sections or organ-surrounding sacks, which are characterized not only by their resistivity, but also by their reactance and impedance. The similarity of these structures to capacitors, capable of storing and releasing small electrical charges, is being taken into account more and more often [18, 19]. These phenomena are approximated quantitatively by the increasingly more frequent use of electrodiagnostic methods, which are a parametric reflection of the clinical observations of the doctor, hence making the links between the descriptive clinical parameters and changes to the voltage and current parameters understood better.

In addition to imaging systems (X-ray, CT, MRI), electrographic methods are increasingly gaining more importance (ECG, EEG, EMG, ENG). They are capable of parameterising the functional changes in the tissues in health and illness. Electrographic methods utilize the consequences of the multimodal structure of the human body, in which compartments filled with piezoelectric substances (bones), basic electrolytes (ions) and complex electrolytes (colloids) can be found. Most of these substances, in addition to the obvious characteristics of type III conductivity [20], also display paramagnetic properties [21].

In many animals, such as bees, birds [22,23], fish [24], and even protozoans [25], paramagnetic and even ferromagnetic substance clusters have been found [26], which, by virtue of their receptor function [27–29] play an important role in helping the animals determine the direction of migration. It was also highlighted that the magnetic field increases the rate of chemical reactions [30], including reactions involving amino acids [31], as well as tissue perfusion [32], neuron stimulation [33] and inhibition of the inflammation response [34]. Different types of tissues have various paramagnetic properties, including magnetic remanence, which can be used for functional testing of the gastrointestinal tract [35–38], the heart [39], bones [40] or muscles [41]. There is even the possibility of using the magnetic field to map and model organs [42–44], or conduct a spatial reconstruction of their images [45]. It was also noted that tissues which have paramagnetic characteristics are magnetically susceptible under a slowly changing magnetic field [46] and react by changing the intensity of their biochemical parameters [47], secreting endorphins [49] and biosynthesising bone marrow. The field also influences the sedimentation of erythrocytes [50] and well as the activity of fibroblasts and osteoblasts [51].

In this context, the question arises whether in view of the presence of numerous colloid and ion compartments in the human body, which, in addition to their electric charge, display magnetic spin and feature defined magnetic remanence and susceptibility, is it possible to utilize this characteristic in the diagnosis of movement organs? Can the change in magnetic susceptibility between the state of health and illness recorded around the joints be used as a reliable parameter with a congruent correlation with the VAS pain threshold scale, BDI depression index and SFTR joint and spine range of movement which change in the course of treatment?

Speaking of paramagnetism and diamagnetism in molecular colloids in a living organism, it is worth drawing special attention to features, which distinguish these phenomena from processes occurring in inorganic crystals.

The presence of a magnetic field around the atoms of a substance is caused by a defined de Broglie’s standing wave fluctuating pattern presented in a simplified Bohr’s model as a fluctuating movement of electrons, which have spin angular momentum

                      and an associated spin magnetic moment (1). The spin torque of protons and neutrons also plays a role. For the sake of simplicity, it can be assumed that the direction of the spin of the electron is opposed to the direction of current flow. In this model, the electron also has an angular momentum

Striving for the creation of stable, low-energy magnetization domains, separated by Bloch walls is a natural phenomenon in inorganic crystals [54].

Depending on the functional status and the topography of the construction of living tissues, in particular membranes separating biological colloids, there are different conditions of specific physico-chemical characteristics there [55]. Thus, in a separate segment within a specific functional status, the resultant of the colloid’s discrete spin magnetic moments can be an increased (paramagnetic) value or a levelled (diamagnetic) value.

The macromolecular protein colloids (e.g. metaloprotein, glucanoprotein and phospholipids) can also display magnetic anisotropy, depending on their thermodynamic state and the dominant vector of molecular order in the network, oscillating between diamagnetic and paramagnetic state. Thus, in a multicellular organism consisting of biological, viscoelastic, quasicrystal structures, changes in the direction of order and magnetization of specific molecular crystals are possible [56], especially during muscle contraction and relaxation, generation of electric potential by the nervous tissue or changes in metabolism of tissue resulting from sectorial regulation of microcirculation [57,58].

The mathematical description of the relation [
                        χ
                     ] with the thermodynamic state of the colloid is referred to as the Van Vleck’s paramagnetism, which allows to reflect the functional state in a biological system, by evaluating the [
                        
                           H
                           →
                        
                     ] parameter in terms of diamagnetic-paramagnetic transition [59].

It is also worth mentioning that lowering the temperature of the tissue during cryotherapy (particularly for phospholipido-protein components) gives the opportunity to approach or even meet the transition criteria for the part of the system to reach the superconducting state, which results inter alia in the Meissner effect, ie the induction of a strong diamagnetic moment, which in clinical conditions is accompanied by regression of inflammation, swelling and pain [60].

The use of magnetic fields in medicine has a long tradition and at present is one of the standard tools used in physical therapy. Initially, for measurement purposes, only the experimental-subjective and clinical effects of magnetic fields were studied, which were based on simple manual tests and surveys [10].

In accordance with the EBM concept, a search began for parametric evidence of the effect of magnetic fields on chemical compounds, isolated organs and the body as a whole.

It was noted that the various types of tissues have diverse paramagnetic properties, including magnetic remanence, which can be used for functional testing of the gastrointestinal tract [35], the heart [39,57], bones [40] or muscles [41]. It was also noted that tissues, with paramagnetic properties in particular, show higher magnetic susceptibility to slow changing magnetic fields [46] and react by changing the speed of chemical reactions [30], including reactions involving amino acids [31].

After the application of a slow changing magnetic field, regulatory effects were observed in tissues, such as changes in perfusion [32], neuron stimulation effects [33], changes in the behavioural reactions of animals [57, 58], inhibition of inflammatory reactions [34], changes in erythrocyte sedimentation [50], changes in the activity of fibroblasts and osteoblasts [51], the rate of bone marrow biosynthesis [61], as well as changes in the secretion of sex hormones [47], concentrations of calcium [48] and endorphins [49].

The technical aim of this study was to construct a prototype GMT 2.0 device for galvanic magnetostimulation, according to patent application P386992 and adapt it for the treatment of cervico-brachial syndromes in such a way, that the galvanic coupling and magnetic field act simultaneously on the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, as well as the upper and lower limbs (Fig. 3).

The second technical goal was the construction of a measuring device (based on SMS102 meters) for making remanence [R] and magnetic susceptibility [S] measurements in symmetrical body marker points M1-12; R/L (
                     Fig. 2b) and design software for uploading data to a computer.

The clinical aim of the experiment was to answer the following research questions: (1) does the distribution of the remanence and magnetic susceptibility in 12-left and right-sided body marker points and the results of the SFTR, VAS BDI scales and the biochemical parameter values differ significantly between control group (K) and patients in group A? What kind of clinimetric changes will be caused after 10-day treatment using GMT 2.0 in patients of group (A)?

The experiment was carried out in the “VIS” outpatient clinic in Cieszyn on the basis of decision no. 1/2009 of the Bioethical Commission of the Physical Education Academy in Katowice. From among the patients who volunteered for the study, and who, within the framework of the clinical test underwent a physical, clinical and X-ray examination, the following individuals were selected for the experimental studies: (1) patient group (A) with cervico-brachial, disc-radicular-based pain syndrome in segments C5/6, C6/7 and (2) control group (K), consisting of healthy individuals.

All participants of the programme underwent a parametric evaluation using the SFTR, VAS, BDI, biochemical tests and magnetometric tests (in 12 marker points L+R) prior to the test (K+A), while in group A: before the 1st, after the 1st, before the 10th, after the 10th treatment session, whereas the magnetometric tests were carried out: before the 1st, during the 1st, after the 1st, before the 10th, during the 10th and after the 10th treatment session.

Research on magnetometric remanence started in November 2010 and continued until April 2011. Tests were carried out using two, parallelly operating SMS 102 meters (Fig. 2a) – their probes were fastened on patient’s body according to marker scheme presented in Fig. 2b.

(K) – control group (n=23), consisting of healthy subjects, 14 women and 9 men, aged 42.6±6.8 years;

(A) – a group of patients (n=33) aged 45.4±7.3 years, treated by means of GMT 2.0 for a period of 10 working days, 40min daily, from Monday to Friday.

VAS and BDI tests were performed using author’s proprietary computer software, based on “DELPHI 7.0 Professional” (serial number: JDKN-SUAS5D-EHA4BF-EB2S).

Measurements of the angular range of motion in the cervical and thoracic section of the spine were carried out according to the SFTR standard using a probe with and ADXL 325 accelerometer, while data was uploaded in .txt format to an EXCEL spreadsheet.

The results of systolic, diastolic pressure and pulse rate were obtained by means of the “OMRON 7051T” metre, and were subsequently sent via USB to an EXCEL spreadsheet.

Blood for biochemical determinations was collected from the cubital vein in the amount of 5ml using disposable syringes. The blood was then centrifuged in a Hermle Z 424 Kontron” device (3000rev/min – 10min) and the serum obtained was tested for K, Cl, Mg, Ca, Fe using an Aztec C1000 ion-selective analyser and for bilirubin, haemoglobin, creatinine, and glucose an Eurolyser microstrip reader was used. Data from the analysers was uploaded as .txt files via an RS232/USB converter to an Excel spreadsheet.

Magnetometric tests were carried out by means of two SMS 102 meters fitted with Hall effect single-axis probes, interconnected using a pod which provided measurement symmetry. The results of magnetic induction were sent simultaneously by two channels to the author’s proprietary software (written in DELPHI 7.0 Prof.), for further archiving and visualization.

A prototype GMT 2.0 device, built in LABIOT (Cieszyn) on the basis of patent application P386992, approved for clinical trials at “VIS” Outpatient Clinic in Cieszyn on the basis of decision No. 1/2009 of the Bioethical Commission of the Academy of Physical Education in Katowice, was used in group A.

Connecting the DC power supply to the spiral, salt bridge solenoid electrodes (
                        Fig. 3), leads to the ionization of the vulnerable components of the solution in the tub and to the clustering of uni-polar ion clouds around the polarized electrodes, which form the starting point for the process of electrolysis.

Discrete electrolysis phenomena (evolution of individual gas bubbles) result in pulse-like changes in the intensity of current in the circuit, with a frequency depending on the current and the electrochemical equivalent of ionizing substances in the solution.

The GMT 2.0 device, for contralateral, three-chamber systemic galvanomagnetic stimulation consists of (
                        Fig. 4): (a) DC power supply, (b) the main solenoid mounted vertically, covering the head and shoulders of the patient (Cu 1.5×2×256), (c) solenoid – salt bridge No. 1 installed in tub No. 1 (right hand) (d) solenoid – salt bridge No. 2 installed in tub No. 2 (left hand), (e) a magnetic field generating solenoid – salt bridge No. 3 installed in tub No. 3 operating contralaterally with respect to bridges (1), (2) and the main solenoid and generating a magnetic field, (f) digital oscilloscope.

The action of the solenoid salt bridges (1–3) causes a pulsating current to flow in the windings of the tubs (1–3) and the pulsation of current in the main solenoid with an interference frequency of f(i)=I(1–3), covering the head, neck, shoulders and the heart of the patient (Fig. 4). Adjusting the resistance between the power sections of the solenoid salt bridge (1–3) makes it possible to obtain electrical gradients (symmetrical, ascending or descending) (foot – left hand=foot – right hand) or asymmetric gradients. The tests employed a symmetrical descending gradient. Depending on the gradient distribution of the galvanic and magnetic (Fig. 4) coupling, a connection between the neuromuscular and the vegetative system can be achieved (two main frequencies were used in the experiment: 1.12Hz and 10.3Hz).

@&#RESULTS@&#

The following tables show the results of the control group (K) and the test group (A). 
                     Table 1 presents mean RR, HR, VAS and BDI values. Following 10-day GMT 2.0 treatment, there was a decrease in heart rate of 6%, a decrease in systolic pressure of 10.6%, diastolic pressure of about 7.5%, a decrease in the perception of pain of 40.9% (according to VAS) and a decrease in depression symptoms of 47.2% (according to BDI).

In goniometric tests (SFTR) (
                     Table 2), patients in group A were initially evaluated to have 79.2% of average range of motion in joints and spine as measured in control group K. After GMT 2.0 treatment, their range of motion increased to 95.5% of parameters in group K.

In biochemical tests (
                     Table 3), in the serum of patients in group A, the initial concentration of bilirubin amounted to 0.605mg/dl (111% of group K), which decreased to 0.479mg/dl (88% of group K) after treatment; the initial concentration of creatinine was 0.918mg/dl (120% of group K), which decreased to 0.802mg/dl (104.8% of group K) after treatment; the initial concentration of magnesium was 0.802mmol/l (93% of group K), which increased to 0.876mmol/l (101.6% of group K); the initial concentration of potassium was 3.99mmol/l (91.7% of group K), which increased to 4.44mmol/l (101.4% of group K) and the initial concentration of ferrum was 138.8μg/l (103.1% of group K), which decreased to 118.6μg/l (88.1% of group K) after treatment.


                     
                     Table 4 presents average values of remanence and magnetic susceptibility (mT) in 12 right-hand marker points (R) (
                     Table 5, 
                     Fig. 5) remanence and magnetic susceptibility (mT) and values in 12 left-sided marker points (L) (
                     Table 6, 
                     Fig. 6). Mean value of magnetic remanence in right-hand markers (1-12R) was 0.05mT (278.1% of group K) and after treatment decreased to 0.02mT (111.1% of group K), whereas for left-hand markers (1-12L) it amounted to 0.047mT (223% of group K) and decreased to 0.018mT (85.7% of group K) after treatment.

In studies of magnetic remanence in Group A, in marker points M1-12 (L+R), compared to the control group (K), there were higher output values recorded, which underwent partial reduction after the 1st and before the 10th treatment session and almost complete alignment after the 10th treatment session.

Magnetic susceptibility measured in marker points M1-12 (L+R) reached significantly lower values during the 10th treatment session, in comparison with the parameters in the course of the 1st treatment session (
                     Figs. 7 and 8).

The distribution of the remanence (R) symmetry and magnetic susceptibility (S) before T1, in T1, after T1 is shown in Fig. 6, while before T10, in T10, after T10 in 
                     Figs. 7 and 8.

In Table 6, the average values for magnetic remanence (R) in Group K, A before T1, T10 and after T1, T10 as well as magnetic susceptibility (S) in group (A) in T1 and in T10 are presented.

In 
                     Table 7, an analysis is shown of the difference significance level (Student׳s T-test) between the results of measurements (R, SFTR, VAS, BDI, RR, HR, CREA, BIL, K+, Mg2+) made once in the control group [K] and in the therapy group [A] before the 1st, after the 1st, before the 10th and after the 10th treatment session. Initial high level of significance of differences between parameters in groups K and A [R(p<0.009), SFTR (p<0.022) VAS (p<0.026), BDI (p<0.021)] has fundamentally changed after treatment – values in group A became similar to those in control group. Thus, the level of significance of differences (K−A) decreased significantly, reaching respectively [R(p<0.72), SFTR (p<0.62), VAS (p<0.57), BDI (p<0.63)]. It reflects normalization of the clinical status and parameter leveling between both groups.

In Pearson’s test (
                     Table 8) a high positive correlation was found between the decrease in the value of magnetic remanence and the decrease in VAS, BDI, BIL, CREA, Fe while a negative correlation was observed between the concentration of K, Mg and values SFTR.

The mean value of magnetic remanence based on 24 marker points M1-12 (L+R) in group A showed a higher output value (before T1) 0.0487mT (250%) compared to the control group K(0 (0.0194mT). This value after the first treatment (after T1), decreased to 0.0321mT (165%) (Table 6), reaching before the 10th treatment session (before T10) a value of 0.0235mT (120%), and after the 10th treatment session (after T10) parametric alignment with control group K (0) 0.019mT (Table 6).

The mean value of magnetic susceptibility based on 24 marker points M1-12 (L+R) fell from a value of S1=0.102mT during the 1st treatment session (in T1) to a value of S1=0.65mT during the 10th treatment session (in T1) (Table 6).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#


                     
                        
                           (1)
                           Following GMT 2.0 treatment, in Group A there was a decrease in heart rate, systolic and diastolic pressure, perception of pain (VAS), symptoms of depression (BDI) an increase in the mobility range of the cervical and thoracic spine, decrease in the levels of bilirubin, creatinine and iron, and an increase in the concentration of magnesium and potassium.

Tests in marker points m1-12 (L+R) in group A have shown that the output values of the magnetic remanence were significantly higher than in patients in the control group K and that they decreased after GMT 2.0 treatment to values close to those in group K.

After GMT 2.0 treatment of patients in Group A, a correlation between pain reduction (VAS), increase in the spinal range of motion (SFTR) and the increase in the concentration of K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and decrease in the magnetic remanence in marker points M1-12 (L+R), has been registered.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

After 10 magnetic field applications by means of a solenoid (the head) and three contralateral solenoids submerged in three galvanically coupled tubs (limbs), in group (A) there was a 4.3% decrease in the pulse rate, a 10.6% decrease in systolic pressure and a 7% decrease in diastolic pressure compared to the control group. The heart rate decrease and lower blood pressure achieved may partially explain the observed influence of the magnetic field on neural function observed by Roth, and the effects of the magnetic field on the heart as reported by Wolke [39] and Sieroń [57].

The observed 40.8% decrease in the perception of pain on the VAS scale and a 47% decrease of symptoms of depression on the BDI scale may explain the reason for an increase in the endorphin concentration [49]. The average increase in the mobility of the cervical and thoracic spine by 20.5% observed in Group A in goniometric tests (Table 2) may be explained by Richmond’s findings on the inhibiting effect of the field on inflammatory reactions and by the earlier cited finding [49] concerning endorphins.

In biochemical tests (Table 3), in the serum of patients of group A, there was a 20% drop in bilirubin levels (p=0.05), a 12.6% decrease in the concentration of creatinine, a 9% increase in the concentration of magnesium and a 10.5% increase in potassium. These phenomena may be caused by the effect of the field on the activity of liver enzymes as observed by Sieroń [58], on the increase in microcirculation perfusion observed by Stick [32], which involved the kidneys and liver in this particular case, and the effect of the field on the circulation of ions as observed by Coulton [48].

A 14.5% decrease in iron concentration may be causally consistent with the increase in bone marrow concentration as observed by Besmeltzef.

Magnetic remanence measured in marker points M1-12 (L+R) in Group A showed higher output values (before T1) relative to the control group K(0). These values decreased after the first treatment session (after T1) (Figs. 4, 5, 6), but before and after the 10th treatment session (before T10), (after T10), they reached values comparable to the control group (K) (Figs. 4, 5, 7). Magnetic susceptibility measured in marker points M1-12 (L+R) reached significantly lower values during the 10th treatment session, in comparison with the parameters in the course of the 1st treatment session (inT1) (Figs. 4 and 5). The remanence and magnetic susceptibility changes of the thorax and limbs may be consistent with observations of the magnetic susceptibility of bones (El Messiery) [40] and muscles [41].

The correlations between the results of simple functional, survey-based and biochemical tests with the magnetic remanence parameters justify the need to continue research on the geometry of magnetic field distribution in locomotor system dysfunctions. Perhaps this simple measurement method, or similar methods will, in the future, become one of the EBM criteria for the functional evaluation of patient’s condition.
