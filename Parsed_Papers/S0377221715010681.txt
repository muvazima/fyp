                  In this paper we address the problem of measuring the degree of consensus/dissensus in a context where experts or agents express their opinions on alternatives or issues by means of cardinal evaluations. To this end we propose a new class of distance-based consensus model, the family of the Mahalanobis dissensus measures for profiles of cardinal values. We set forth some meaningful properties of the Mahalanobis dissensus measures. Finally, an application over a real empirical example is presented and discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In Decision Making Theory and its applications, consensus measurement and its reaching in a society (i.e., a group of agents or experts) are relevant research issues. Many studies investigating the aforementioned subjects have been carried out under several frameworks (see Cabrerizo, Moreno, Pérez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2010; Dong, Xu, & Li, 2008; Dong, Xu, Li, & Feng, 2010; Dong & Zhang, 2014; Fedrizzi, Fedrizzi, & Marques Pereira, 2007; Fu & Yang, 2012; Herrera-Viedma, Herrera, & Chiclana, 2002; Liu, Liao, & Yang, 2015; Palomares, Estrella-Liébana, Martínez, & Herrera, 2014; Wu & Chiclana, 2014a, 2014b; Wu, Chiclana, & Herrera-Viedma, 2015 among others) and based on different methodologies (Chiclana, Tapia García, del Moral, & Herrera-Viedma, 2013; Cook, 2006; Eklund, Rusinowska, & de Swart, 2008; Eklund, Rusinowska, & Swart, 2007; Fedrizzi et al., 2007; Fu & Yang, 2010, 2011; Gong, Zhang, Forrest, Li, & Xu, 2015; González-Pachón & Romero, 1999; Liu et al., 2015; Palomares & Martínez, 2014 among others).

Since the seminal contribution by Bosch (2005) several authors have addressed the consensus measurement topic from an axiomatic perspective. Earlier analyses can be mentioned, e.g., Hays (1960) or Day and McMorris (1985). This issue is also seen as the problem of combining a set of ordinal rankings to obtain an indicator of their ‘consensus’, a term with multiple possible meanings (Martínez-Panero, 2011).

Generally speaking, the usual axiomatic approaches assume that each individual expresses his or her opinions through ordinal preferences over the alternatives. A group of agents is characterized by the set of their preferences – their preference profile. Then a consensus measure is a mapping which assigns to each preference profile a number between 0 and 1. The assumption is made that the higher the values, the more consensus in the profile.

Technical restrictions on the preferences provide various approaches in the literature. In most cases the agents are presumed to linearly order the alternatives (see Bosch, 2005 or Alcalde-Unzu & Vorsatz, 2013). Since this assumption seems rather demanding (especially as the number of alternatives grows), an obvious extension is to allow for ties. This is the case where the agents have complete preorders on the alternatives (e.g., García-Lapresta & Pérez-Román, 2011). Alcantud, de Andrés Calle, and Cascón (2013a, 2015) take a different position. They study the case where agents have dichotomous opinions on the alternatives, a model that does not necessarily require pairwise comparisons.

Notwithstanding the use of different ordinal preference frameworks, the problem of how to measure consensus is an open-ended question in several research areas. This fact is due to that methodology used in each case is a relevant element in the problem addressed. To date various methods have been developed to measure consensus under ordinal preference structures based on distances and association measures like Kemeny’s distance, Kendall’s coefficient, Goodman-Kruskal’s index and Spearman’s coefficient among others (see e.g., Cook & Seiford, 1982; Goodman & Kruskal, 1979; Kemeny, 1959; Kendall & Gibbons, 1990; Spearman, 1904).

In this paper we first tackle the analysis of coherence that derives from profiles of cardinal rather than ordinal evaluations. Modern convention applies the term cardinal to measurements that assign significance to differences (cf., Basu, 1982; Chiclana, Herrera-Viedma, Alonso, & Herrera, 2009; High & Bloch, 1989). In contrast ordinal preferences only permit to order the alternatives from best to worst without any additional information. To see how this affects the analysis of our problem, let us consider a naive example of a society with two agents. They evaluate two public goods with monetary amounts. One agent gives a value of 1€ for the first good and 2€ for the second good. The other agent values these goods at 10€ and 90€ respectively. If we only use the ordinal information in this case, we should conclude that there is unanimity in the society: all members agree that ‘good 2 is more valuable than good 1’. However the agents disagree largely. Therefore, the subtleties of cardinality clearly have an impact when we aim at measuring the cohesiveness of cardinal evaluations.

Unlike previous references, we adopt the notion of dissensus measure as the fundamental concept. This seems only natural because it resembles more the notion of a “measure of statistical dispersion”, in the sense that 0 captures the natural notion of unanimity as total lack of variability among agents, and then increasingly higher numbers mean more disparity among evaluations in the profile.
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        As a remote antecedent of this position, we note that statistically variance-based methods are commonly employed to measure consensus of verbal opinions (cf., Hoffman, 1994, and Mejias, Shepherd, Vogel, & Lazaneo, 1996.)
                     
                  

In order to build a particular dissensus measure we adopt a distance-based approach. Firstly, one computes the distances between each pair of individuals. Then all these distances are aggregated. In our present proposal the distances (or similarities) are computed through the Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis, 1936). We thus define the class of Mahalanobis dissensus measures.

The Mahalanobis distance plays an important role in Statistics and Data Analysis. It arises as a natural generalization of the Euclidean distance. A Mahalanobis distance accounts for the effects of differences in scales and associations among magnitudes. Consequently, building on the well-known performance of the Mahalanobis distance, our novel proposal seems especially fit for the cases when the measurement units of the issues are different, e.g., performance appraisal processes when employees are evaluated attending to their productivity and their leadership capacity; or where the issues are correlated. For example, evaluation of related public projects. An antecedent for the weaker case of profiles of preferences has been provided elsewhere, cf. Alcantud, de Andrés Calle, and González-Arteaga (2013b), and an application to comparisons of real rankings on universities worldwide is developed. Here we apply our new indicator to a real situation, namely, economic forecasts made by several agencies. Since the forecasts concern economic quantities, they have an intrinsic value which is naturally cardinal and also there are relations among them.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce basic notation and definitions. In Section 3, we set forth the class of the Mahalanobis dissensus measures and their main properties. Section 4 provides a comparison of several Mahalanobis dissensus measures. Next, a practical application with discussion is given in Section 5. Finally, we present some concluding remarks. Appendices contain proofs of some properties and a short review in matrix algebra.

This section is devoted to introduce some notation and a new concept in order to compare group cohesiveness: namely, dissensus measures. Then, a comparison with the standard approach is made. We partially borrow notation and definitions from Alcantud et al. (2013b). In addition, we use some elements of matrix analysis that we recall in Appendix B to make the paper self-contained.

                      as issue s for convenience. A population of agents or experts is a finite subset

We consider that each expert evaluates each alternative by means of a quantitative value.

This definition does not attempt to state dissensus by opposition to consensus. The literature usually deals with a formulation of consensus where the higher the index, the more coherence in the society’s opinions. The terms consensus and dissensus should not be taken as formal antonyms, especially because a universally accepted definition of consensus is not available and we do not intend to give an absolute concept of dissensus. However, consensus measures in the sense of Bosch (see Bosch, 2005, Definition 3.1) verify anonymity and neutrality (see also Alcantud et al., 2013b, Definition 1), and from a purely technical viewpoint, they relate to dissensus measures as follows.

In this section we introduce a broad class of dissensus measures that depends on a reference matrix, namely the Mahalanobis dissensus measures. We also give its more prominent properties.

Our interest is to cover the specific characteristics in cardinal profiles, like possible differences in scales, and correlations among the issues. Before providing our main definition, we recover the definition of the Mahalanobis distance on which our measure is based.

The off-diagonal elements of Σ permit to account for cross relations among the issues or alternatives. Through the diagonal elements different measurement scales can be incorporated. The Σ matrix contains variances and covariances among random variables when the Mahalanobis distance is used in Statistical Data Analysis.

                            is the number of non-ordered pairs of the N agents.

Note that the above expression is the average of all distances between the evaluation vectors provided by all pairs of agents according to the Mahalanobis distance associated with Σ (Definition 2).

It is immediate to check that δΣ
                      verifies conditions i) and ii) for each positive definite Σ matrix. But δΣ
                      fails to satisfy neutrality like the following example proves.

Nevertheless, if the Σ matrix is adapted according to a specific permutation of the alternatives then the Mahalanobis disensus measure verifies a kind of “soft” neutrality like the following result proves.

                                  This expression uses the square of the Euclidean distance between real-valued vectors, thus it recovers a version of the consensus measure for ordinal preferences based on this distance (Cook & Seiford, 1982). Henceforth δI
                                  is called the Euclidean dissensus measure.

                                 Cardinal transformations. In contrast to ordinal assessments, cardinal evaluations are dependent on scales. So an important question arises about if the scale choice disturbs the cohesiveness measures. In this regard, once we update the reference matrix accordingly, the Mahalanobis dissensus measures associated to Σ do not vary. This fact happens even if we modify the scales of all issues in different way. In addition, a simple translation of each issue by adding a number does not change the cohesiveness measure.

                                 Splitting the set of alternatives.
Suppose that the set of alternatives is divided in two (or more) subgroups, in such way that we do not consider any possible cross-effect among subgroups (perhaps because we know that there is not interdependence). Then the computation can be simplified by referring to measures of the dissensus in sub-profiles as follows.

                                  which incorporates the new agent’s assessments for the alternatives.

If the assessments of the new agent coincide with the average of the original agents’ evaluations for each alternative, then the minimal increment of the dissensus measure is obtained.

                                    Remark 2
                                    A particular case is when the Mahalanobis dissensus measure is zero, or equivalently, there exits unanimity. If we include a new agent whose evaluations coincide with the assessments of the original agents, the Mahalanobis dissensus measure continues being zero.

In practical situations we could potentially use various Mahalanobis dissensus measures for profiles of cardinal information.

                        This is the case of our real example in Section 5 below.
                      Hence it is worth studying the relations among evaluations achieved when we vary the reference matrices. This section addresses this point.


                     Theorems 1 and 2 below identify conditions on matrices that ensure consistent comparisons between Mahalanobis dissensus measures, whatever the number of agents. Based on these theorems, a final result gives bounds for the Mahalanobis dissensus measure.

This result is straightforward from Theorem 2. Observe that such Theorem can be applied because λkI (resp., λ
                           1
                           I) and M are commutable matrices and the eigenvalues of the diagonal matrix λkI (resp., λ
                           1
                           I) are all equal to λk
                            (resp. λ
                           1). Proposition 2 is used.□

In this section we fully develop a real example. It aims at giving an explicit application of our proposal and discussing some of its features.

We are interested in assessing the cohesiveness of the forecasts of various magnitudes for the Spanish Economy in 2014: GDP (Gross Domestic Product), Unemployment Rate, Public Deficit, Public Debt and Inflation. These forecasts have been published by different institutions and organizations, and each one was made at around the same time. Specifically, three waves of forecasts were published in the Spring of 2013 (Table 1
                     ), Autumn of 2013 (Table 2
                     ) and Spring of 2014 (Table 3
                     ).

We intend to measure the cohesiveness of the aforementioned predictions. Since they are expressed by cardinal valuations, we need to go beyond the traditional analyses referred to in this paper. To this purpose, we first gather the data corresponding to Tables 1–3 in the profiles

                                 )
                              
                           
                           ,
                           
                              M

                                 l

                                 )
                              
                           
                           ∈
                           
                              M
                              
                                 5
                                 ×
                                 5
                              
                           
                           ,
                        
                      respectively. Next, we select a suitable reference matrix and finally we make the computations of the Mahalanobis dissensus measures.

Once the profiles have been fixed, the following step to compute their Mahalanobis dissensus measures is to avail oneself of a suitable reference matrix Σ. The choice of such a matrix can easily raise controversy. Nevertheless, we can learn from the role of the Σ matrix in the Mahalanobis distance from a statistical point of view. This matrix contains the variances and covariances among the statistical variables, therefore, those characteristics are brought into play in this distance. We recall that covariances (or corresponding correlations) among variables reveal their interdependence. In statistics, this Σ matrix is usually unknown and it is estimated from a sample. One exception is the unlikely case when the data are generated by a known multivariate probability distribution. This is not the case of our example.

Therefore we employ a reference matrix Σ that captures the variances and covariances among the macroeconomic magnitudes of the Spanish Economy. It seems natural to produce such a matrix from historical macroeconomic data corresponding to the issues under inspection. Table 4
                         contains such recorded data, and Table 5
                         gives the corresponding correlation coefficients.

                         These values are depicted in Fig. 2
                        . Each ellipse represents the correlation between a pair of variables. The ellipses slant upward (resp., downward) show a positive (resp., negative) correlation. Moreover, the narrower the ellipse the stronger correlation represented. For example, the pair formed by GDP and Public Deficit holds the strongest negative correlation.

Note that the measure of the dissensus decreases along the time. This is what we intuitively expect, since the latter forecasts rest on more accurate and factual information.

Apart from the measure of the cohesiveness of the profiles, our proposal also produces a measure of divergence among the evaluations of different agents on a set of issues. We can answer questions like “Are the predictions of the European Commission for the Spanish Economy similar to the predictions of the BBVA Reseach?” or “Is the previous comparison more or less similar than the comparison between the predictions of the BBVA Research vs. the predictions of the IMF?”. Table 6
                         provides these items for comparison.

The choice of the reference matrix is a key point in the application of the Mahalanobis dissensus measure. As an explanatory exercise in this subsection we discuss on the more simplistic approaches where naive reference matrices are employed. If we use the identity matrix as the reference matrix (for example, because we lack data to make a better inference), then we get a Mahalanobis dissensus measure which gives the same importance to the differences in all the issues (see Section 3.1). However the choice of the identity matrix as the reference matrix discards much relevant information. We note the variance of the Public Debt is 190.52, while Inflation has a variance of 1.28 (see 
                           Σ
                        ). So, a difference of one unit in the forecasts from two agents does not signify the same if such a difference corresponds to Inflation or to Public Debt.

We could alternatively employ as the reference matrix, the diagonal matrix with the variances of the issues, that is,

                        In this case, we remove the effects of the interdependence among the economic magnitudes on the dissensus measure.

                         is decreasing along time as previously reported. This intuitively appealing feature is not captured when we utilize simpler matrices. Consequently, introducing corrections due to variances or to cross-effects is crucial for a reliable final analysis.

We explore the problem of measuring the degree of cohesiveness in a setting where experts express their opinions on alternatives or issues by means of cardinal evaluations. We use the general concept of dissensus measure and introduce one particular formulation based on the Mahalanobis distance for numerical vectors, namely the Mahalanobis dissensus measure.

We provide some properties which make our proposal appealing. We emphasize that the Mahalanobis dissensus measure on the profiles with k issues or alternatives is scale-independent for each issue and it accounts for cross-relations of issues. In addition, the comparison between different Mahalanobis dissensus measures can be made through the eigenvalues of their associated matrices.

We illustrate our proposal with a real numerical application about forecasts for several magnitudes for the Spanish Economy. We discuss the relevance of the choice of the reference matrix in this context.

                        Proof of property 1. Neutrality
                        Let us first prove sufficiency. If

                              ). Every row and every column of a permutation matrix contain exactly one nonzero entry, which is 1. A product of permutation matrices is again a permutation matrix. The inverse of a permutation matrix is again a permutation matrix. In fact,
