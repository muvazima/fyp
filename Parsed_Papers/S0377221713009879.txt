                  A tandem queueing system with infinite and finite intermediate buffers, heterogeneous customers and generalized phase-type service time distribution at the second stage is investigated. The first stage of the tandem has a finite number of servers without buffer. The second stage consists of an infinite and a finite buffers and a finite number of servers. The arrival flow of customers is described by a Marked Markovian arrival process. Type 1 customers arrive to the first stage while type 2 customers arrive to the second stage directly. The service time at the first stage has an exponential distribution. The service times of type 1 and type 2 customers at the second stage have a phase-type distribution with different parameters. During a waiting period in the intermediate buffer, type 1 customers can be impatient and leave the system. The ergodicity condition and the steady-state distribution of the system states are analyzed. Some key performance measures are calculated. The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the sojourn time distribution of type 2 customers is derived. Numerical examples are presented.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Tandem queueing systems are very important part of the queueing theory that takes into account the possibility that a customer may need service from several sequentially arranged servers. The overwhelming majority of the results in the theory of tandem queues is obtained for systems with stationary Poisson arrival process and exponential service time distribution. Tandem queueing systems with correlated arrival flows were investigated not so extensively. For background information and overview of the present state of the art in the study of tandem queueing systems with correlated arrival flows and phase-type service time distribution see, e.g., Gomez-Corral (2002a, 2002b), Klimenok, Breuer, Tsarenkov, and Dudin (2005), Gomez-Corral and Martos (2006), Klimenok, Kim, Tsarenkov, Breuer, and Dudin (2007), Kim, Park, Dudin, Klimenok, and Tsarenkov (2010), and Kim, Dudin, Dudin, and Dudina (2013a). The papers Gomez-Corral (2002a, 2002b) and Gomez-Corral and Martos (2006) are devoted to the

                      tandem queue with retrials and losses is provided in Kim et al. (2010). In Kim et al. (2013a), a tandem queueing system with more than one server in each stage, Markovian arrival flow, and phase-type service time distribution at the second stage is considered.

In this paper, we analyze a tandem queueing system with two types of customers. Type 1 customers arrive to the first stage that represents a multi-server queue without buffer. After service completion at the first stage, type 1 customers leave the system or move to the second stage. Type 2 customers arrive to the second stage directly. The second stage is a multi-server queue with a finite buffer for type 1 customers and an infinite buffer for type 2 customers. Type 1 customers have non-preemptive priority over type 2 customers. They can be impatient and leave the intermediate buffer without service.

In order to study the effect of variation and correlation within the arrival process as well as the correlation of arrivals of different types of customers, we consider a Marked Markovian arrival process 
                        
                           (
                           MMAP
                           )
                        
                      to model customer arrivals. Additionally, we assume that the service time of different types customers has a phase-type 
                        
                           (
                           PH
                           )
                        
                      distribution with different parameters. This allows us to take into account the variance of the service time. Note that using a phase-type distribution significantly increases the dimension of the system state space and complicates the investigation of the system. To overcome these difficulties to some extent, we use the method proposed by Ramaswami (1985) and Ramaswami and Lucantoni (1985), for reducing the dimension of the state spaces of systems with a phase-type service time distribution, and consider a generalized phase-type distribution of the service times at the second stage instead of considering two separate phase-type distributions for each type of customers, that greatly facilitates the investigation of the system.

The queueing system under consideration is quite general and can be applied for modeling many real-world systems. Let us introduce several examples of such systems:
                        
                           (i)
                           Contact-center with an IVR (Interactive Voice Response). Type 1 customers can be interpreted as calls and type 2 customers are the text requests (e’mails). The first stage server represents an IVR and the second stage server is a contact center operator. E’mail requests arrive to the second stage directly and are always patient. Callers are firstly serviced by an IVR. If the caller cannot solve his (her) problem by using an IVR, he (she) can request to connect with an operator and move to the second stage. Type 1 customers can be impatient. The service times of e’mail requests and calls are different.

Manufacturing system. The system processes two types of details. Type 1 details need some preprocessing while type 2 details do not require such a preprocessing. After the preprocessing, type 1 details should be processed during a limited time (e.g., if the preprocessing includes heating of details, type 1 details should be processed before they become cool).

Database. The system processes queries from external users, who need preliminary identification and are non-patient, along with the requests from the internal users to retrieve or update information.

Information transmission system. More important information should be encrypted prior transmission and transmitted more urgent than some less important information which is sent without encryption.

Medical system. Emergency surgery center has several rooms for anesthesiology and operation theatre. Depending on the type of injury, some arriving patients need more urgent treatment after a preliminary general anesthetic, while others may wait longer time and do not need general anesthetic at all.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the mathematical model is described. In Section 3, the process of the system states is considered. The ergodicity condition and the stationary state distribution are analyzed in Section 4. The expressions for the main performance measures of the system are given in Section 4. The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the sojourn time distribution of an arbitrary type 2 customer is presented in Section 5. Section 6 contains numerical examples. Section 7 concludes the paper.

We consider a tandem queueing system with two types of customers and two intermediate buffers. The structure of the system under study is presented in Fig. 1

Customers arrive to the system according to the MMAP. The customers in the MMAP are heterogeneous and have different types. The arrival of customers is directed by the stochastic process

We assume that type 1 customers arrive to the first stage, while type 2 customers arrive to the second stage directly, not entering the first stage. The first stage is described by an R-server queueing system without buffer. The service time for each server at this stage has an exponential distribution with the parameter 
                        
                           μ
                        
                     .

After receiving service at the first stage, type 1 customer proceeds to the second stage of the tandem with probability q, 
                        
                           0
                           ⩽
                           q
                           ⩽
                           1
                        
                     , or leaves the system forever (is lost) with the complementary probability. The second stage represents an N-server queue with a finite buffer of capacity K for type 1 customers (buffer 1) and an infinite buffer for type 2 customers (buffer 2).

If there is a free server at the second stage during an arbitrary customer arrival epoch, the customer occupies this server immediately. If all servers are busy and buffer 1 is not full during an arbitrary type 1 customer arrival epoch, the customer is admitted to this buffer. Otherwise, type 1 customer leaves the system forever (is lost). If all servers at the second stage are busy during a type 2 customer arrival epoch, this customer moves to buffer 2.

We suggest that type 1 customers have priority, i.e., if there is at least one type 1 customer in buffer 1 during the service completion epoch, the next service will be provided to type 1 customer. Otherwise, type 2 customer is taken for service if he (she) is presenting in buffer 2. For customers of the same type the service discipline is First-In-First-Out.

At the second stage, type 1 customers can be impatient, i.e., the customer leaves buffer 1 after an exponentially distributed time described by the parameter α, 
                        
                           0
                           <
                           α
                           <
                           ∞
                        
                     , after arrival, due to a lack of service.

The service time of type l customer for the second stage server has a phase-type distribution

                      we use the method proposed by Ramaswami (1985) and Ramaswami and Lucantoni (1985), for reducing the dimension of the state space of systems with a phase-type service time distribution. The main idea of this method is the following. Instead of the consideration of the components

If we use a generalized phase-type distribution, we do not consider the service process of each type of customers separately. Using of a generalized phase-type distribution instead of consideration of two separate phase-type distributions does not change the dimension of the state space of the Markov chain, but allows us to eliminate from the consideration of the component

                      (the number of type 1 customers in service) that greatly simplifies the investigation of the system under study and allows us to construct the generator, obtain the ergodicity condition, and find sojourn time distribution more or less easily.

Because type 1 customers have a priority, they leave the system due to impatience and restriction on the total number of type 1 customers at the second stage, the upper bound of their sojourn time is more or less clear. So, we concentrate on the consideration of the sojourn time of type 2 customers.

We will derive the distribution of an arbitrary type 2 customer’s waiting and sojourn time in terms of the LST. Let 
                        
                           W

To derive the expression for the LST 
                     
                        
                           w
                           (
                           s
                           )
                        
                      we use the method of collective marks (method of additional event, method of catastrophes) (see, e.g., Kesten & Runnenburg (1956) and van Danzig (1955)). Let us tag an arbitrary type 2 customer and keep track of its staying in the system. We interpret the variable s as the intensity of some virtual stationary Poisson flow of catastrophes. Thus, 
                        
                           w
                           (
                           s
                           )
                        
                      has the meaning of the probability that no catastrophe arrives during the sojourn time of the tagged type 2 customer.

Let us explain formula (2) in brief. The diagonal entries of the matrix in the square brackets in (2) are equal to the total intensity of the events which can happen after an arbitrary epoch: catastrophe arrival, the transition of the underlying process of the MMAP, the transition of any underlying process of the generalized PH service processes, abandon of type 1 customers from the buffer, and the service completion of type 1 customer at the first stage. The non-diagonal entries of the matrix in the square brackets in (2) are equal to the intensities of the transition of the MMAP underlying process without generation of a customer, the transition of one of generalized PH underlying processes which does not lead to the service completion (these events do not impact on the components n, r and k). The first term in the round brackets in (2) corresponds to the case when type 1 customer is admitted at the first stage of the system. In this case the number of customers at the first stage (the component r) increases by one. The second term in the round brackets in (2) corresponds to the cases when type 1 customer is rejected at the first stage upon arrival and type 2 customer is admitted at the second stage. In this case the values of the components n, r and k do not change. The third term corresponds to the cases when type 1 customer leaves the system after the service completion at the first stage. In this case the number of customers at the first stage decreases by one. The fourth term corresponds to the case when type 1 customer is admitted to the second stage. In this case the number of customers at the first stage decreases by one, and the number of type 1 customers in buffer 1 (the component k) increases by one. The fifth term correspond to the case when during the service completion epoch at the second stage there are no type 1 customers in buffer 1, the tagged customer has the first position in buffer 2 and is chosen for service.

                            defines the probability that catastrophe will not arrive during the service time of the tagged customer. The sixth term corresponds to the case when during the service completion epoch at the second stage there are no type 1 customers in buffer 1 and there are type 2 customers that arrive to the system before the tagged customer. In this case the position of the tagged customer in buffer 2 (component n) decreases by one. Finally, the seventh term corresponds to the case when type 1 customer leaves the buffer (starts service or leaves the buffer due to impatience).

                            dominate in all rows of this matrix. So the inverse matrix exists. Thus, based on (3) one can verify the validity of the theorem.□

It is clearly evident from Figs. 2 and 3 that an increase in the average arrival intensity leads to an increase in the average intensities of output flows, the loss probabilities of type 1 customers and the average sojourn time of type 2 customers. So, with increasing average arrival intensity the quality of service becomes worse. Based on figures presented one can conclude that the coefficient of correlation in the arrival process has a profound impact on the system performance measures and taking into account the correlation in the arrival flow is extremely important for adequate modeling of the system performance. For example, when the coefficient of correlation increases, the average output intensities

Additionally, the fulfillment of the ergodicity condition depends on the coefficient of correlation in the arrival flow. In the example under consideration, the ergodicity condition is not fulfilled for

                     . This finding can be explained as follows. As it was mentioned above, for arrival flows with small coefficients of correlation the loss probability of type 1 customers at the second stage is less than for arrival flows with high coefficients of correlation. Thus, for arrival flows with small coefficients of correlation more type 1 customers arrive to the second stage thereby increasing the load of the second stage and lead to an earlier violation of the ergodicity condition. It also explains the dependence of the average number L of customers in the system and the average sojourn time

In Experiment 2, let us show the impact of the coefficient of variation in the service processes of type 1 and type 2 customers at the second stage on the main performance measures of the system. To this end, we consider three cases of PH service processes of type 1 and type 2 customers.

The first case corresponds to the exponential service time distributions of type 1 and type 2 customers. We assume that the service time of type 1 customers is defined by the vector

                                 )
                              
                           
                        
                      of an arbitrary type 1 customer at the second stage on the intensity of impatience

                      for PH service processes with different coefficients of variation.

As it is seen from Fig. 4, with growth of the intensity of impatience 
                        
                           α
                        
                      the average sojourn time of type 2 customers decreases. This finding can be explained as follows. When the intensity of impatience increases, the loss probability of type 1 customers at the second stage 
                        
                           
                              
                                 P
                              
                              
                                 loss
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 2
                                 )
                              
                           
                        
                      also increases. Because type 1 customers have a priority over type 2 customers, the loss of type 1 customers decreases the average waiting time (and also the average sojourn time) of type 2 customers. For the same reason the average number of type 1 customers in buffer 1 essentially decreases with an increase in the intensity of impatience which in turn leads to decrease in the loss probability of type 1 customers due to buffer 1 overflow.

Another important conclusion from Fig. 4 is that the coefficient of variation in the service process affects the system performance measures. So, for adequate prediction of the system operation it is necessary to take into account the variation in the service process.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A tandem queueing system with Marked Markovian arrival flow and generalized phase-type service time distribution is studied. The process of the system states is analyzed, and the ergodicity condition is derived. Some key performance measures are obtained. The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the sojourn time distribution of type 2 customers is derived. The numerical results show the importance of taking into account the correlation in the arrival flow and the variance of the service time.
