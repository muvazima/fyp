                  This work explores the synthesis of nanocrystalline MgO:Cr3+ (1–9mol%) nanophosphors via solution combustion route at 400°C. The nanophosphors were well characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy. PXRD results confirm cubic phase and SEM micrographs indicate that the particles are highly porous and agglomerated. The TEM images show that the powder consists of spherical particles of size ∼5–15nm. Upon 356nm excitation the emission profile of MgO:Cr3+ exhibits an emission peak at 677nm due to 2Eg

                     4A2g transition. It was observed that PL intensity increases with increase in Cr3+ concentration and highest PL intensity was observed for 3mol% doped sample and afterward it decreases, attributed to concentration quenching. The resultant CIE chromaticity co-ordinates in the white region make the present phosphor highly useful for display applications and also for white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Rare-earth doped oxide phosphors have widely been investigated due to their several advantages over other phosphors. These phosphors have excellent thermal stability as a result they were extensively used in a variety of applications, namely lamp industry, color display screens, semiconductor light-emitting diodes, solid state lasers and X-ray medical radiography [1–4]. Even though several studies on rare-earth ions doped oxides were available in the literature [1,5,6], transition metal ions doped oxides were limited. Oxide compounds doped with transition metal ions continue to draw attention in view of their variety of applications. It was well known that impurities play an important role, because they can influence the properties of host materials. Therefore, the interest in achieving new photoluminescent materials and tunable solid-state lasers were significantly promoted the study of transition metal (Mn, Fe, Cr, Co, etc.) doped phosphors [7–10].

Trivalent chromium (Cr3+) was the most stable oxidation state, therefore widely used as a luminescent dopant and luminescence sensitizer in various host materials. Chromium a low cost activator, which can provide deep color and bright luminescence. For instance, the color of many natural and synthetic gemstones like ruby, emerald, alexandrite, etc. were due to Cr3+ ions. On this account, Cr3+ was subject of numerous spectroscopic and luminescence investigations. Further, Cr3+ doped systems were used in modern technologies, like tunable solid-state lasers [11], high temperature sensors [12] and high-pressure calibrate [13]. Cr3+ ions more effectively interact with lattice and have high luminescent quantum efficiency as dopants in several host materials. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted by several research groups on the synthesis and characterization of various Cr3+ doped host materials [14,15].

In the development of Cr3+ activated luminescence materials, MgO was an excellent host because Cr3+ ions can easily substitute Mg2+ ions in the host lattices because of crystal field strength around Cr3+ ions [16]. For red and NIR photoluminescence, trivalent chromium ions (Cr3+) favorable emitting center due to its wide-range emission from 650–1400nm, including the R-line narrow band emission around 680nm from the 2E→
                     4A2 transition and the broadband emission from the 4T2
                     →
                     4A2 transition depending on the host lattice and the crystal field strength [17].

The common WLED (white light emitting diode) device composed of chips that emit blue light and phosphors that can be excited by blue light to emit other colors. Since WLED devices were characterized by their high emission intensity, the quality of phosphors was vital to the performance of WLED device. WLEDs can save about 70% of the energy and do not need any harmful component in comparison with the conventional light sources. Therefore, WLEDs have a great potential to replace them and are considered as next generation solid state lighting devices [18]. Further, Light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been a subject of considerable interest due to their quick response time, environmental benefits, lower energy consumption and wide optical and electrical applications [19]. Taking these points into consideration, we have synthesized Cr3+ doped MgO through a relatively low-temperature initiated, self-propagating and energy saving solution combustion method. The combustion process has distinguished itself as a safe, instantaneous and capable to produce direct single phase compounds. The structural preparations of the synthesized phosphors have been studied by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) techniques. The optical properties of Cr3+ ions in MgO phosphor have been investigated to obtain information about crystal field parameters, and the local site symmetry of the doped ion.

The powdered samples of Cr3+ (1–9mol%) doped MgO phosphor was synthesized by via combustion method. For this, metal nitrates were used as the oxidizer, and glycine was employed as fuel. The stoichiometric composition of the mixtures was calculated based on the total oxidizing and reducing valences of the oxidizer and combustion fuel [20]. The molar ratio of the metal nitrates (oxidizers) to glycine (fuel) was controlled at 1:1.75. Magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2⋅6H2O), Chromium nitrate (Cr(NO3)3⋅9H2O) and glycine [NH2CH2COOH (analar)], were used as starting chemicals and were dissolved in distilled water and the concentration of the Chromium ions was varied in the range 1–9mol% in relative to Mg content. After mixing the precursors in a Petri dish and then introduced into a pre-heated muffle furnace at ∼400±5°C. The solution underwent dehydration, and finally decomposed with the evolution of gases (oxides of nitrogen and ammonia). The mixture was frothed and swelled, forming foam that ruptured with a flame. The combustion process was completed in not less than 5min. The voluminous foamy combustion product was grinded well and used for characterization and PL studies.

The crystalline nature of the powder sample was characterized by PXRD using X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu) (operating at 50kV and 20mA by means of Cu Kα (1.541Å) radiation with a nickel filter at a scan rate of 2degmin−1). The surface morphology of the product was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Hitachi table top (SEM) (Model TM 3000). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed on a (JEOL, JEM 2100) (accelerating voltage up to 200kV, LaB6 filament). FTIR studies of the samples were performed with a Perkin Elmer FTIR spectrophotometer (Spectrum-1000). Photoluminescence studies were made using Horiba, (model Fluorolog-3) spectrofluorimeter at RT using 450W xenon as excitation source and Fluor Essence™ software is used for spectral analysis.

                     Fig. 1
                      shows the PXRD patterns of undoped and Cr3+ (1–9mol%) doped MgO samples without any further calcinations. All the X-ray diffraction peaks of the samples at 2θ, 35.57 (111), 42.59 (200), 62 (220), 74.28 (311), 78.34 (222) were well indexed to pure single cubic phase and matched with JCPDS card No. 4-829 with space group fm-3m (225) [21]. The lattice parameter and unit cell volume for cubic MgO was estimated for (200) plane. The estimated lattice parameter and unit cell volume are found to be 4.3Å and 79.507Å3 respectively. From the analysis of PXRD, it was clear that the introduction of an activator (Cr3+) did not influence the crystal structure but certainly modified the lattice parameters due to the difference in the ionic radius between the dopant and the substituted magnesium ion (the ionic radii of R

                     =0.072nm). The average crystallite size (D) was estimated from the line broadening in X-ray powder using Scherrer’s formula [22]

                     θ [where, ‘K’; constant, ‘λ’; wavelength of X-rays, and ‘β’; FWHM] is found to be in the range 5–15nm. It was observed that, as the dopant concentration increases, the position of the main diffraction peaks shift to the lower angle side (Fig. 1(b)) and the PXRD intensity decreases, which indicates that Cr3+ ions were strongly capped in to the crystal lattice of MgO. The Cr3+ ions doped into MgO matrix causes expansion of the unit cell resulting in tensile stress, as a result the PXRD peaks shifted toward higher angle side [23]. The peak shift and line broadening in PXRD profiles arises due to the presence of micro strain in nanophosphors.

Further, crystallite size was calculated in MgO:Cr3+ (1–9mol%) nanoparticles prepared by combustion method was calculated using the W–H plots.

Nelson–Riley method [25,26] was also used to study size – strain parameters as shown in Fig. 2(b). In this method crystallite size was described by a Lorentzian function and the strain profile by a Gaussian function [27].

                      for all the orientation peaks of MgO. In this case, the crystallite size was determined from the slope of the linearly fitted data and the root of the intercept gives the strain. The detailed values were given in Table 1
                     . The average crystallite size calculated using Scherrer’s method, W–H plot and size–strain plots were found to decrease with Cr3+ concentration. However, the strain value found to decrease with Cr3+ concentration and was mainly attributed to the existence of non stoichiometric oxygen and grain boundary defects [28]. Due to mismatch in the radii of Cr and Mg ions more oxygen vacancies were created in the lattice as a result more lattice strain was expected in doped samples [29].

The acceptable percentage difference in ionic radii between doped and substituted ions must not exceed 30% [1]. The estimation of the radius percentage difference (Dr) between the doped ions (Cr3+) and substituted ions (Mg2+) in MgO:Cr3+ was calculated based on the formula:

                     where CN: co-ordination number, Rm (CN): Radius of host cations and Rd (CN): Radius of dopant ion and it was found that 28.19%. Thus, it is clear that the Cr3+ ionic radius (r
                     =0.143nm, CN=9) was close to that of Mg2+ (r
                     =0.072nm, CN=9), as a result Cr3+ ions would substitute with Mg2+ in the MgO host [30].

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used to study the surface interactions of adsorbed water in dynamic equilibrium with the gas phase on the MgO surface. Frequency shifts and absorbance values were carefully observed to interpret the surface structure of MgO phase. FTIR spectra of undoped and MgO:Cr3+ doped samples was shown in Fig. 3
                     . The strong bonds at 495cm−1 was associated with the characteristic vibrational mode of symmetric MgO6 octahedral of MgO and is associated with the vibration of MgO, which is similar to that reported by Mohandes et al. [31]. Further, the peaks at 550–890cm−1 (γ
                     1) higher frequency of MgO stretching and 410–500cm−1 (γ
                     2) was lower frequency stretching. The peak at 885cm−1 was attributed to MgOMg interactions. It is well-known that H2O and CO2 molecules are easily chemisorbed onto MgO surface when exposed to the atmosphere. In these spectra, the broad vibration band at 3440–3450cm−1 was associated with the OH stretching vibrations of water molecules, while those at 1630–1645cm−1 are associated with their bending mode. The absorption in the range of 1300–1800cm−1 related to hydroxyl group of molecular water at 1643cm−1 , NH3 at 1440cm−1 and it was due to CO stretching mode. The peak at ∼2400cm−1 arises due to absorption of atmospheric gas-phase CO2 on the metallic cations. Also, the absorption at ∼3455cm−1 indicate the presence of hydroxyl groups (OH mode), which was probably due to the fact that the spectra was not recorded in situ and some water re-adsorption from the ambient atmosphere as occurred [32].

For the combustion method, it was well known that the morphological features of the prepared powders were strongly dependent on the heat and gases generated during the complex decomposition. Release of large amount of gases may lead to of tiny particles and growth of crystallites. Further, the impurities might likewise impact the morphology of a given crystal by taking an interest in the nucleation and growth, in which numerous general variables coordinate to command the process. The requirement of the charge compensation by the substitution dopant ion in Mg site would require different number of dopant ions and related to vacancy states [33]. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of as-formed Cr3+ doped MgO powders were shown in Fig. 4
                     (A–D). It was observed that the particles were non-uniform and irregular size and shape, which was inherent nature of the combustion product. Further pores and voids were also formed due to a rapid release of gaseous by products during the combustion process. The irregular shape of the crystallites caused due to the non-uniform distribution of temperature and mass flow during combustion [6].

TEM studies were carried out to understand the crystalline characteristics of the nanoparticles. Fig. 5
                     (A–D) illustrates the TEM images of pure MgO nanoparticles. A TEM image of typical MgO microsphere is presented in Fig. 5(A), indicating that the nano sheets are agglomerated together, the particles were observed to be irregular shaped and highly dispersed, which clearly shows that the nanosheets are made up of nanocrystallites with the size range of 4–10nm [34]. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Fig. 5(B)) provide distinct ring pattern which was evidence for the polycrystalline and good crystalline behavior of the prepared MgO nanoparticles. Hu et al. [35] reported that nanosheets have potential application in fuel cells and methanol-based alternative energy technologies. Further, a well defined lattice fringes obtained by high resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Fig. 5(C)) pattern reveal the formation of highly crystalline pure MgO nanophosphor [18]. As seen in the spacing between the adjacent lattice fringes of the nanoparticles is 0.253nm, which was very close to that of 0.245nm for MgO. The composition of obtained MgO was analyzed by means of energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) as shown in Fig. 5(D). The EDAX result showed the presence of Mg and O without any other characteristic peaks. Hence, the results are definitive evidence to suggest that the sample do not contain any other element and are indeed free from other impurities.

The optical absorption was highly useful for investigating the band structures of semiconductors and insulators to understand their optical and electronic properties. To understand the effect of doping on band structure, UV–Vis absorption spectrum of Cr3+ doped (1–9mol%) MgO powders were measured in the region 200–700nm (Fig. 6
                     ). The spectra exhibit two broad bands at 273nm and 370nm which arise from the spin-allowed d–d transitions of Cr3+ ions and these bands were assigned to 4A2g(F)→
                     4T2g(F) and 4A2g(F)→
                     4T1g(F) transitions [36] respectively. The observed bands were due to Cr3+ ions in the octahedral symmetry. It was to be noted that charge transfer transitions in transition metal ions were not well investigated, unlike those in rare earth ions. The band in the UV region at 273nm could be assigned to charge transfer band of Cr6+–O2−. Chromium was known to exhibit charge transfer transitions, depending on the oxidation state. Smith and Cohen [37] observed absorption bands at 4.68eV (265nm) due to Cr6+ ions in (Na2O) 0.3 (SiO2) 0.7 glass containing 0.37% Cr. Zhu et al. [38] recorded optical spectrum of calcined dehydrated chromium containing silica tube molecular sieves. They observed intense bands around 259nm and these bands could be assigned to Cr6+–O2− charge transfers of a chromate species. On the other hand in the diffuse reflectance spectrum at room temperature, two ligand field bands in the UV–Vis region were observed. Based on these two bands, we concluded that Cr3+ ions were in the octahedral symmetry. A large number of absorption bands may be obtained if we perform the experiment at low temperatures. Then only we can interpret the observed bands due to different symmetries. It is known that experimental data cannot be interpreted in terms of Cr3+ alone, but have to be analyzed in view of the coexistence of Cr ions of different vacancies [39].

The optical energy gap (Eg) of MgO:Cr3+ ions was calculated using Wood–Tauc relation [40], α (hν)∼(hν
                     −
                     E

                      , where, hν; the photon energy and α; optical absorption coefficient near the fundamental absorption edge. The absorption coefficient ‘α’ was calculated from these optical absorption spectra. The energy gap values were observed by extrapolating the linear portion of the plot to (α
                     
                     h
                     
                     ν)2
                     =0. The optical energy band gap for Cr3+ doped (1–9mol%) phosphors were estimated in the range of 5.2–5.6eV and values were comparable to those reported in the literature [41].

Optical spectroscopy of Cr3+ in solids provides important information for understanding the fundamental interactions between the luminescent ions and the lattice. Fig. 7
                      shows the excitation spectrum of Cr3+ doped MgO recorded by monitoring the emission at 677nm. The energy level diagram of the Cr3+ ion in an octahedral crystal field consists of the ground 4A2 state and the 2E and 2T1 doublet state and two 4T2 and 4T1 quartet states [42]. The spin allowed 4A2
                     →
                     4T2 and 4A2
                     →
                     4T1 transitions were responsible for most intense two broad absorption bands appearing at 356nm and 413nm.


                     Fig. 8
                      shows the emission spectra of Cr3+ (1–9mol%) doped MgO phosphor excited at 356nm. The spectra consists of three emission bands, sharp band centered at 483nm located in blue region, band centered at 582nm due to Cr3+ d–d transition from its excited state of 4T2g
                     →
                     4A2g and it is located in green region and a sharp and high intensity band centered at 677nm due to Cr3+ d–d transition from its excited state of 2Eg
                     →
                     4A2g and it is located in red region [43,9]. The narrow emission peak at 677nm was due to 2Eg
                     →
                     4A2g transition Cr3+ 
                     [44]. For low crystal field materials, the quartet (4T2g) was lower and the luminescence emission at 300K of the system was dominated by spin allowed broad band transition. This is due to the fact that the valence electrons in the 3d3 configuration were not shielded from their environment by the core electrons. Thus the crystal field, or the lattice environment, has a significant effect on the quantum states of these electrons. Further, the configurational coordinate model was successful in explaining the shape of the broadband transition [45].

For red and NIR photoluminescence, trivalent chromium ion (Cr3+) was favorable emitting center due to its wide-range emission from 650 to 1400nm, including the R-line narrowband emission around 680nm from the 2E→
                     4A2 transition and the broadband emission from the 4T2
                     →
                     4A2 transition depending on the host lattices crystal field strength [46]. The emission spectra consists of an intense narrow emission line centered at 677nm corresponding to 2Eg
                     →
                     4A2g transition of Cr3+ ions. Kingsley et al. [47] observed are demission at 687nm in MgAl2O4 lattice mainly attributed to the substitution of Cr3+ in Oh sites of Al3+ ions.

Cr3+ doped MgO show sharp emission peak at 677nm and the distinct sharp red emission peak arises from recombination of bound exciton between a shallow Cr3+ donor level and a recombination center of intrinsic origin which was probably a V
                     Mg
                     2+ acceptor center. Since substitutional doping of trivalent Cr3+ in divalent Mg2+ position in MgO would require that two Cr3+ ions were substituted for three Mg2+ ions for charge compensation, overall charge neutrality in the lattice could be maintained by creating one Mg2+ vacancy for incorporation of each two Cr3+ ions [37].

Since, the intensity of 677nm emission increases with increase in Cr3+ content, it can be said that the origin of 677nm red emission was due to recombination of bound exciton between Cr3+ donor level and a V
                     Mg
                     2+ acceptor center since intensity of both species is expected to increase with increase in Cr content. As the effect of Cr doping can be best understood in a single host system with varied amount of Cr doping, we doped Cr in different atomic% (1–9%) in MgO under same synthesis conditions and measured PL emission spectra of all the samples under same experimental condition of incident light intensity. When the Cr3+ ions concentration increases more than 3mol%, PL emission intensity begins to decrease indicates the concentration quenching (Inset of Fig. 9
                     (a)). The concentration quenching might be explained on the basis of following two factors: (i) the excitation migration due to resonance between the activators gets enhanced when the doping concentration is increased, and thus the excitation energy reaches quenching centers, and (ii) the activators are paired or coagulated and are changed to quenching centers. The energy can also be transferred non-radiatively by the radiative reabsorption or multipole–multipole interaction [48]. Also, increase in Cr3+ concentration can result in cross-relaxation processes in close Cr3+
                     Cr3+ pairs, the quenching of Cr3+ luminescence often occurs at low concentration. As mentioned above, with introducing more Cr3+ ions into the MgO host, only a minor portion of Cr3+ ions would go into the Mg substitutional positions, most may be absorbed at the surface of the nanocrystalline MgO or in form of a second phase, which offers much more opportunity for the cross-relaxation processes and similar results were reported by Ravikumar et al., in Cr3+ doped Wollastonite nanophosphor [36].

The energy transfer mechanism in phosphors was essential in order to obtain the critical distance (R
                     c) i.e. the critical separation between Cr3+ and the quenching site [49]. Another important parameter, which was sensitive to the nature of the Cr3+ ions environment in the host lattice, the asymmetric ratio (A
                     21) [6] (Fig. 9(a)) which, gives a measure of the degree of distortion from inversion symmetry of the local environment surrounding the Cr3+ ions in the host matrix.

The values of A
                     21 decrease with increase of Cr3+ ions. However, it was reasonable to believe that the doping of Cr3+ will introduce lattice defects, which will undoubtedly reduce the symmetry strength of the local environment of Mg2+ sites. Consequently, the symmetry ratio of MgO:Cr3+ decreases with the increase of doped Cr3+ concentration. Estimation of the critical transfer distance (R

                     Cr3+ distance was more than 5Å the exchange and reabsorption interaction becomes ineffective. Therefore, the energy transfer between Cr3+ ions in MgO phosphor should occur only by electric multipolar interaction. According to the report of Van Uitert [51], when the concentration of Cr3+ was greater than the critical one, the emission intensity of multipolar interaction per activator ion can be determined from the equation

The concentration dependence curve log (I/x) v/s log (x) was shown in Fig. 9(b). It was observed that the dependence of log (I/x) on log x was linear, and the slope was equal to −1.1198. The value of ‘Q’ can be calculated as 6.424, which was close to ∼6. The result further indicates that the concentration of self quenching mechanisms of Cr3+ in MgO was dipole–dipole (d–d) interaction.

The QE for the MgO:Cr3+ (3mol%) phosphor with 356nm excitation was estimated by integrated emission counts from the 400–700nm by the method described by De Mello [53] and Palsson [54]

The Commission International de l’Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity coordinates for MgO:Cr3+ (3mol%) phosphors as a function of Cr3+ concentration for the luminous color were depicted by the PL spectra. The CIE chromaticity coordinates calculated from the PL spectra (x
                     =0.32, y
                     =0.33) was shown in Fig. 10
                      
                     [57,29]. It was observed that the CIE co-ordinates of Cr3+ activated MgO:Cr3+ phosphor was very close to the National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard values, they fall close to the white region of chromaticity diagram and their corresponding location was marked with star in white region. Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) can be estimated by Planckian locus, which was only a small portion of the (x, y) chromaticity diagram and there exist many operating points outside the Planckian locus. If the coordinates of a light source do not fall on the Planckian locus, the Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) was used to define the color temperature of a light source. CCT was calculated by transforming the (x, y) coordinates of the light source to (U′, V′) by using following equations, and by determining the temperature of the closest point of the Planckian locus to the light source on the (U′, V′) uniform chromaticity diagram (Fig. 11
                     ) [58,59].

Also, CCT was found to be ∼6162.5K using U′=0.21 and V′=0.4666. Therefore, the present phosphor was highly useful for the production of artificial white light to be similar to those of natural white light owing to its better spectral overlap in white LEDs and in solid state display applications.

The Racah parameters were generated as means to describe the effects of electron–electron repulsion within the metal complexes. The Racah parameters are A, B and C. Here, A was ignored because it was roughly the same for any metal center and C is approximately ¼ of B. The most important parameter B signifies the approximation of the bond strength between the ligand and metal [60]. This parameter B can be calculated by measuring ΔE, the energy difference between the 4T1 and the 4T2 energy states from the absorption spectrum. From the experimentally derived optical absorption spectrum spectra the ΔE (8588cm−1) that corresponds to energy difference between γ
                     1 (=273nm; 36,635cm−1) and γ
                     2 (=370nm; 27,027cm−1) was calculated.

Using the above equations, the Racah parameters B and C were experimentally determined to be 152.62cm−1 and 625.76cm−1 respectively for MgO:Cr3+. The strength of octahedral field (Dq/B) was calculated to be 2.4. This value indicates that chromium ions were in octahedral field. Comparison of free ions Racah parameter in free ion and in complex gives the strength of Nephelauxetic ratio. The B value for free ion was 1030cm−1 
                     [60] whereas, for MgO:Cr3+ it was 152.62cm−1. This shows that there was a reduction in the Racah parameter indicating the moderate Nephelauxetic effect. Nephelauxetic effect means “cloud expansion”, which was related to a decrease of inter-electronic repulsion parameters of valence electrons in the ligand field in comparison with their free-ion value due to covalence of bonds [61].

It was possible to obtain Cr3+ doped MgO red-emitting phosphors using a low temperature solution combustion synthesis method involving temperature range about 400°C in a short time interval (∼5min). The advantages of the combustion synthesized include simplicity and economy method, as the starting materials are low cost and easy available. The XRD data shows that simple cubic phase. SEM micrographs indicate that, the prepared samples were agglomerated from few microns to a few tens of microns, fluffy and porous in nature. TEM images exhibit agglomerated particles. The IR spectroscopic analysis data confirms that the IR peaks were due to MgO. In optical absorption spectra consists of two intense optical absorption bands are appeared at 273nm and 370nm. The optical energy gap of the samples was found to be in the range 5.2eV to 5.6eV. The narrow red emission peak, observed at 677nm in MgO:Cr3+ was identified as due to 2E→
                     4A2 transition from Cr3+ ions. From the excitation spectrum the crystal field splitting (Dq) and Racah inter-electronic repulsion parameters (B and C) have been calculated. The ratio Dq/B indicates that Cr3+ ions were in strong ligand field sites. Further, the excellent white emission properties and the estimated CIE chromaticity co-ordinates (x
                     =0.32, y
                     =0.32) were very close to NTSC standard value. Hence, the present nanophosphor can be used as promising material for optical display system applications and also for WLEDs.
