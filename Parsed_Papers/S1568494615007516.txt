                  Differential evolution (DE) algorithm is a population-based algorithm designed for global optimization of the optimization problems. This paper proposes a different DE algorithm based on mathematical modeling of socio-political evolution which is called Colonial Competitive Differential Evolution (CCDE). The two typical CCDE algorithms are benchmarked on three well-known test functions, and the results are verified by a comparative study with two original DE algorithms which include DE/best/1 and DE/rand/2. Also, the effectiveness of CCDE algorithms is tested on Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) problem including 10, 15, 40, and 140-unit test systems. In this study, the constraints and operational limitations, such as valve-point loading, transmission losses, ramp rate limits, and prohibited operating zones are considered. The comparative results show that the CCDE algorithms have good performance and are reliable tools in solving ELD problem.
