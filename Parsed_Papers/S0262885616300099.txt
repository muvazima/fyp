                  This paper investigates the problem of cross-domain action recognition. Specifically, we present a cross-domain action recognition framework by utilizing some labeled data from other data sets as the auxiliary source domain. It is a challenging task as data from different domains may have different feature distribution. To map data from different domains into the same abstract space and boost the action recognition performance, we propose a method named collective matrix factorization with graph Laplacian regularization (CMFGLR). Our approach is built upon the technique of collective matrix factorization, which simultaneously learns a common latent space, linear projection matrices for obtaining semantic representations, and an optimal linear classifier. Moreover, we explore the label consistency across different domain and the local geometric consistency in each domain and obtain a graph Laplacian regularization term to enhance the discrimination of learned features. Experimental results verify that CMFGLR significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Human action recognition has received extensive attention in computer vision community due to its many potential applications such as video surveillance, video retrieval, and man–machine interaction [1–5]. Over the last few decades, remarkable progress has been made in conventional action recognition systems, which often use a robust classifier trained by sufficient human annotated data under the assumption that testing data and training data are drawn from the same feature space and the same distribution. However, the discriminative power of the trained model may be undermined by two facts in real-world scenarios. On one hand, it is often expensive or impossible to label large amount of training data. On the other hand, the assumption that testing data share the same feature space and the same distribution with training data cannot be always guaranteed. Therefore, it is reasonable to resort to training data in other domains as compensation to boost the performance of action recognition systems.

Recently, cross-domain dictionary learning for sparse representation has emerged as a useful tool to tackle this issue [6–9]. Although formally diverse, all these methods are built upon an assumption that the sparse representations of the same action in the source domain and the target domain tend to be similar. The gap of sparse representations is bridged by cross-domain dictionary learning methods, which are mostly based on the K-Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD) [10] algorithm. We have also witnessed that collective matrix factorization (CMF) produced impressive results in the related field of cross-modal hashing. In [11], CMF is used to learn a latent factor model from different modalities of an instance in an unsupervised manner, and the learned factor model can well preserve the semantic similarity between multiple modalities.

Enlightened by these works, we put forward a novel cross-domain action recognition algorithm named Collective Matrix Factorization with Graph Laplacian Regularization (CMFGLR). The proposed method is illustrated in Fig. 1
                     . First, we make use of the collective matrix factorization technique to learn a common latent semantic space and the features of data from different domains are projected into a common latent semantic space. Second, in order to make the learned semantic feature more discriminative, we incorporate the label consistency between different domains and the local geometric consistency in each domain into our framework. In addition, an optimal linear classifier is learned simultaneously. The main contributions of our work are described as follows.
                        
                           (1)
                           We propose a novel cross-domain action recognition framework, which employs collective matrix factorization to learn a common latent semantic space, narrowing the semantic gap of features of data from different domains.

To further enhance the discriminative power of the learned semantic features, we integrate a graph Laplacian regularization term to exploit the label information between different domains and the local manifold structure of each domain.

We incorporate a term of classification errors into the objective function, which enables that the latent semantic representation of actions and a multiclass linear classifier are jointly learned.

The remaining sections are organized as follows. We review the related work in Section 2. Section 3 presents the proposed approach and describes the optimization of the objective function in detail. Section 4 presents experimental results and analysis on human action recognition, followed by the conclusion in Section 5.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

The related work are surveyed from four aspects.

Generally speaking, the approach to action recognition consists of two phases, i.e., feature extraction and representation and action classification. We center the review on the first stage. Traditional handcrafted methods for feature extraction and representation can be roughly categorized into three groups: local feature based, trajectory based, and holistic feature-based methods. Local representations describe a video sequence as a collection of local descriptors. Spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs) are first detected by cuboid detector [12] or 3D Harris corner detector [13] to capture the sudden changes of movement in video sequences, and local feature descriptors [14,15] are extracted from the cuboids around the detected STIPs. The bag-of-features (BOFs) strategy is subsequently used to construct a codebook and maps local features into histogram representations. Trajectory-based representations [16,17] track spatial points over time and encode motion information by modeling human actions as sequences of spatio-temporal trajectories. In contrast, holistic methods [2,3] describe human actions using visual information extracted from all the raw frames in a video sequence. Although holistic methods are able to capture more spatial and temporal structures of human actions, they are notoriously sensitive to background clutters and partial occlusions. In recent years, learning-based approaches have attracted much attention due to their excellent flexibility and discrimination. Liu et al. [18] used genetic programming to learn spatio-temporal features based on a population of primitive 3D operators. Yu et al. [19] proposed a structure-preserving scheme to learn fused binary representations for RGB-D video data. Wang et al. [20] proposed a trajectory-pooled deep convolutional descriptor for action recognition, which possesses the advantage of both handcrafted features and deep-learned features.

Dictionary learning for sparse representations is an overwhelming research topic. Here we only review the literature related to our study. One representative work is the KSVD algorithm [10], which generalizes the K-means clustering process to efficiently learn an over-complete dictionary by adapting the dictionary to a set of training samples. To learn more discriminative dictionaries, some supervised KSVD variants [21,22] were proposed by integrating class label information into the original objective function. Zheng et al. [8] proposed a method for cross-view action recognition based on sparse representation using pairwise dictionaries, which are constructed leveraging correspondences between the source view and the target view. [6,7] borrowed the idea from [8,21], which are dedicated to improving the performance of action recognition by introducing auxiliary source data. The difference of the source domain and the target domain is reduced by learning discriminative dictionary pairs. Zheng et al. [9] extended the work of [8] by learning a common dictionary simultaneously, which is used to obtain view-shared sparse representations between different views.

CMF [23] is a simple yet effective method for jointly factorizing multiple matrices, each of which denotes a relation between two entity types. Apart from its successful application in movie rating prediction, it can fit into many scenarios where multiple interlinked sources of data are available [24]. By virtual of CMF, the approach in [11] learns unified hash codes from multi-view sources and yields promising results.

A considerable number of methods showed that the geometric information of data is pivotal for discrimination. The method in [25] learns sparse representations in consideration of the local manifold structure of data, resulting in a graph Laplacian term combined into the objective function. The method in [26] explicitly takes into account the Fisher discrimination criterion, rendering the obtained sparse representations having small within-class scatter and large between-class scatter. Lu et al. [27] proposed an approach that is able to preserve both the non-local self-similarity and the local manifold structure in learning sparse coefficients.

Our work differs from the reviewed literature in two aspects. First, although learning features for action recognition is discussed in this paper, we focus on enhancing recognition performance by borrowing data from auxiliary data sets. Second, we apply CMF to cross-domain action recognition and build a novel graph Laplacian regularization term to make the learned features more discriminative.

In this section, we present the details of the proposed CMFGLR and then describe the optimization procedure of the given objective function.

Let A
                        
                           t
                         be a set of n-dimensional N target domain input signals, i.e., A

                           N
                        . As stated above, the training data of the target domain may be insufficient; thus, we need to use data from other domains as compensation to improve the present action recognition system. Suppose that A
                        
                           s
                         is an auxiliary source domain with sufficient data, we sample N input signals from A
                        
                           s
                        , i.e., A
                        
                           s
                        
                        =[a
                        
                           s
                        
                        1,...,
                        a
                        
                           s
                        
                        
                           N
                        ]∈
                        ℜ

                           N
                        . As these N input signals are from another domain, the features may hold different distribution. We aim to map data from different domains into a latent semantic space, where similar samples tend to be as close as possible. That is, data with the same label are encouraged to share a similar latent semantic representation, otherwise dissimilar. To this end, we use CMF to jointly decompose A

As discussed in Section 3.1, our method maps data from different domains into a common latent semantic space by means of CMF. To make the obtained semantic representations more discriminative, we turn to investigate the label consistency between different domains and the local manifold structure information of each individual domain in the obtained semantic space. This problem can be formulated as minimizing the following objective function:

                        (⋅) denotes the set of k nearest neighbors. The second and the third terms manage to preserve the local geometric consistency in each domain, which encourage data in the same domain to retain the neighboring relationship, i.e., the local manifold structure, in the latent semantic space.

By some simple algebraic calculation, Eq. (5) can be rewritten as

We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on two data sets, in which 12 categories of the UCF-101 data set are employed as the target domain and 12 corresponding categories of the HMDB51 data set are used as the source domain. The UCF101 [30] data set is an extension of the UCF50 data set, which comprises 13,320 clips from 101 action categories. The HMDB51 [31] data set is a challenging realistic data set collected from a wide range of sources such as movies, Prelinger archive, YouTube, and Google videos. It contains 6849 clips grouped into 101 categories, each category containing at least 101 clips. The 12 chosen categories of the target domain are archery, baseball pitch, basketball shooting, biking, boxing punching bag, fencing, golf swing, horse riding, pull ups, push-ups, rock climbing indoor, and sky diving. The 12 corresponding categories of the source domain are shoot bow, throw, shoot ball, ride bike, punch, fencing, golf, ride horse, pull up, push up, climb, and dive. Fig. 2
                      and Fig. 3
                      show some example frames extracted from video sequences in the UCF-101 data set and the HMDB51 data set, respectively.

In our cross-domain action recognition framework, we use dense trajectories [17] as the low-level features, which are generated using the open-source code provided by the authors. The adopted parameter settings of dense trajectories are the same as those in [17]. Following [6,7], we use locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) [32] to encode dense trajectories. Due to the high number of dense trajectory descriptors extracted from a raw action video, we randomly select 200 dense trajectories features from each video to reduce computational cost and memory consumption during codebook construction. The codebook size is set to 4096 and the number of local bases is set to 30 in the LLC scheme applied to the dense trajectories features.

We compare the proposed CMFGLR approach with KSVD [10], D-KSVD [21], LC-KSVD1, LC-KSVD2 [22], and WSCDDL [6]. We randomly choose 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 samples as the training data and the rest as the testing data. To make a fair comparison, all the reported results are averaged over 5 independent trials. Tables 1 and 2
                     
                      show the details in the case of excluding or including the source domain data. For the convenience of comparison, we also show the result of CMFGLR in Table 1. From Table 1, we can observe that the supervised D-KSVD and LC-KSVD yield better results than the unsupervised KSVD. Moreover, CMFGLR beats all the compared methods due to the effective usage of the auxiliary training data. From Table 2, we can see that the recognition results delivered by KSVD, D-KSVD, and LC-KSVD are not significantly improved, and even some methods degrade with the augment of training samples. It demonstrates that the brute-force approaches cannot effectively handle cross-domain data that may hold different feature distribution. CMFGLR and WSCDDL outperform the alternatives when using source domain data, which indicates the importance of knowledge transfer for cross-domain data. Meanwhile, CMFGLR defeats WSCDDL in all the evaluations, showing its superiority to WSCDDL. Fig. 5
                      plots the confusion matrices returned by CMFGLR and the compared approaches in the case of 90 training samples.

The number of latent semantic factors k, the classification error term parameter α, the graph Laplacian regularization parameter β, and the regularization parameter λ are tuned as 720, 20, 2, and 0.1, respectively. We finally perform parameter-sensitive analysis on these four parameters. Fig. 6
                      plots the experimental results, which are obtained by varying the studied parameter while fixing the others. These experiments show the robustness of CMFGLR as it can produce satisfactory results under a wide range of parameter values.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have proposed a novel cross-domain action recognition approach, i.e., collective matrix factorization with graph Laplacian regularization. Our goal is to utilize some data from other domain as an aide to enhance action recognition. CMFGLR simultaneously learns a common latent semantic space, linear projection matrices for obtaining semantic representations, and an optimal linear classifier. Meanwhile, a graph Laplacian regularization item is integrated into the objective function to enhance the discriminative power of semantic representations. Our algorithm significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.
