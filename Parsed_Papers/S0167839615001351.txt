                  We derive explicit formulas for the μ-bases of conic sections and planar rational cubic curves. Using the μ-bases for planar rational cubic curves, we find explicit formulas for their implicit equations and double points. We also extend the explicit formula for the μ-bases of conic sections to μ-bases for rational curves of degree n in n-dimensions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     μ-bases for rational curves are important since we can use μ-bases to implicitize rational planar curves (Chen and Wang, 2003). Moreover, μ-bases for rational curves in arbitrary dimensions can be applied to locate and analyze their singularities (Song et al., 2007; Jia and Goldman, 2009, 2012; Shi and Chen, 2010). There are fast algorithms to compute μ-bases for rational curves based mainly on Gaussian Elimination (Chen and Wang, 2003; Song and Goldman, 2009). However, we do not know what the μ-bases look like before we run the algorithm; this drawback prevents us from finding closed formulas for the singularities or the implicit equation for rational curves based on the method of μ-bases.

Here we give explicit formulas for the μ-bases of conic sections and planar rational cubic curves. As fundamental objects in Computer Aided Geometric Design and Computer Graphics, conic sections and planar rational cubic curves have a wide range of applications, for example, in animation control and font design. Implicit equations for planar rational cubic curves will also help us when we deal with intersection algorithms (Sederberg and Parry, 1986; Thomassen, 2005).

Special attention has been devoted to computing implicit equations for planar rational cubic curves. Sederberg et al. (1985) treat planar rational cubic curves as monoids, that is, degree n curves with a singular point of order 
                        n
                        −
                        1
                     . This approach simplifies the derivation of the implicit equation. Floater (1995) proves that the implicit equation of every planar rational cubic curve can be represented by linear combinations of six basis functions. Using the results of Busé and Jouanolou (2003), one can also derive a closed formula for the implicit equation of a rational cubic curve

                        2
                      Bezoutian matrix – for the implicit equations of planar rational cubic curves. Moreover, we also provide closed formulas for the double point of planar rational cubic curves. Explicit formulas for implicit equations of planar rational cubic Bézier curves are also presented recently in Barrowclough (2014). But our explicit formulas for these implicit equations based on μ-bases are more compact. Moreover, using μ-bases for planar rational cubic curves, we get explicit formulas for their double points in a simpler, more straightforward way.

This paper is structured in the following fashion. In Section 2 we review the notion of μ-bases for planar rational curves. We give the explicit formulas for the μ-bases and closed form expressions for the implicit equations of conic sections and planar rational cubic curves in Section 3 and Section 4. We also provide explicit formulas for the double point of planar rational cubic curves in Section 4. Section 5 extends the explicit formula for the μ-bases of conic sections to μ-bases for rational curves of degree n in n-dimensions. We close in Section 6 with some observations about our methods.

In this section we briefly review the concept of μ-bases for planar rational curves. We begin with the notion of syzygies.

Every planar rational curve has a μ-basis. Moreover, there is an algorithm for computing μ-bases based on Gaussian elimination (Chen and Wang, 2003). In contrast, we shall find closed formulas for a μ-basis of conic sections and planar rational cubic curves.

One important property of μ-bases is that the implicit equation of the planar rational curve

In this paper, our investigations of planar rational curves focus only on conic sections and planar rational cubic curves. Moreover, all the rational curves studied in this paper are assumed to be non-degenerate. It is well known that there are no singular points on non-degenerate conic sections and there is always exactly one double point (i.e., a singular point of order 2) on every non-degenerate planar rational cubic curve. So by Theorem 2, for every non-degenerate planar rational cubic curve there is a linear moving line that follows the curve, and the axis of this linear moving line is the unique double point of the cubic curve.

In this section we shall find explicit formulas for a μ-basis of an arbitrary conic section. We shall then use this μ-basis to derive a closed formula for the implicit equation of a conic section from its rational quadratic parametrization.

Every rational space curve has a μ-basis. Moreover, the method to compute μ-bases for planar rational curves, which is based on Gaussian Elimination (Chen and Wang, 2003), has also been generalized to compute μ-bases for rational space curves in n-dimensions (Song and Goldman, 2009).

Next we shall show how to find μ-bases for degree n rational space curves in n-dimensions.

Our goal here, however, is to find an explicit formula for a μ-basis of the curve 
                           F
                           (
                           t
                           )
                        . To find such an explicit formula, we can simply compute the adjoint matrix of

                                       ˜
                                    
                                 
                              
                              
                                 T
                              
                           
                        . It is easy to verify that the adjoint matrix of

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have constructed explicit formulas for μ-bases of planar rational cubic curves and degree n rational curves in n-dimensions 
                        (
                        n
                        ≥
                        2
                        )
                     . But the formulas for the μ-bases of planar rational cubic curves are not so concise as the formulas for the μ-bases of conic sections. We need to treat several different cases of the planar rational cubic curve. So we can imagine that it will be harder and harder to write down explicit formulas for the μ-bases of rational planar curves of arbitrary degree: there are more and more cases and many more conditions to consider.

We also generalized our results to these rational curves expressed in terms of the Bernstein basis, so we can also write down their μ-bases directly without messy conversions between the power basis and the Bernstein basis.

We would like to thank the anonymous referees for providing us with constructive comments and suggestions. We would especially like to thank the anonymous referee who pointed out a different way to get closed formulas for the implicitization matrices of conics and rational cubic curves without the help of any explicit μ-bases. The same anonymous referee also pointed out that the columns of the matrix
