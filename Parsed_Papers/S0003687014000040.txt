                  A total of 58 healthy subjects participated to elucidate the influence of indoor and outdoor temperatures on blood flow. After walking outdoors for 20min, the blood flow rate of a subject was measured. The subject then entered a classroom and studied for 120min, and afterwards, the blood flow rate was measured again. The subjects were exposed to outdoor temperature ranging from −2.5 to 33.7°C. During the summer, the average blood flow rate after walking outdoors was 45.95±25.790TPU (tissue perfusion units); after the class, this decreased to 36.14±21.837TPU (p
                     <0.05). During the autumn, the blood flow rate decreased from 27.69±12.334TPU to 12.47±12.255TPU (p
                     <0.001). When the outside air temperature was below 3°C, the blood flow rate indoors increased significantly from 6.74±3.540TPU to 13.95±11.522TPU (p
                     <0.05). In a comfortable and healthy environment, the blood flow rate was not constant but fluctuated between 15TPU and 40TPU.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The human body is exposed to indoor and outdoor environments during daily life. A comfortable outdoor climate leads to a comfortable indoor environment (Ahmed, 2003). Song et al. (2012) found that a person who comes indoors from a hot outdoor environment sets the air conditioner to a low temperature because the heated human body should be cooled to a comfortable temperature range. Thermal sensation and thermal physiology are affected by the state of the outdoor environment and the time spent outdoors, and the outdoor climate affects clothing style and the clothing insulation value (Nikolopoulou et al., 2001). Thermal comfort theory has been developed based on psychological responses; the acceptable temperature range is calculated using the subjective thermal sensation vote (TSV) (Fanger, 1970; ISO 7730, 1994; ASHRAE Standard 55, 2004). Psychological responses are used to evaluate productivity indoors (Parsons, 2003). However, many people enjoy hot saunas, and some people like swimming during the cold winter season. These preferences cannot be explained by the traditional thermal comfort theory. Physiological responses are used to evaluate the health of humans exposed to different thermal environments. The skin temperature and blood flow rate can be used to assess the quality of a healthy space.

The environment is sometimes extreme in a transitional space or outdoors. During the summer, the outdoor temperature is extremely high, and during the winter, this temperature is extremely low. The human body should maintain homeostasis; therefore, human thermal behaviours have been developed to allow people to adapt to extreme environments. The level of clothing insulation varies, with light clothes worn during the summer and heavy clothes worn during the winter. A person's metabolism can be changed by low-speed or brisk walking. When a person is exposed to an extreme environment, the person feels uncomfortable, and blood flow is controlled by vasomotor functions. If the body is exposed to an extremely cold environment, blood flow is minimised to maintain homeostasis. In contrast, if the body is exposed to an extremely hot environment, blood flow is maximised along with sweating to dissipate heat from the body's core (Schimidt and Thews, 1989). A high blood flow rate indicates that high levels of oxygen are transported to cells. This high-oxygen environment induces oxidative stress and the dysfunction of hormones, and the DNA can be damaged (Marczynska et al., 1980; Ivell, 2007; Song, 2010).

Exposure to low temperatures induces pain (Yarnitsky and Ochoa, 1991), cold drafts (Griefahn et al., 2001) and the loss of manual dexterity (Heus et al., 1995). Tissue ischemia leads to limited angiogenesis and associated disorders, such as Raynaud's phenomena, pain, numbness, paleness, cyanosis swelling, or tingling. Furthermore, exposure to extremely cold environments can result in tissue necrosis (Yu et al., 2006). Indoor environments should mitigate these extreme outdoor environments and serve as a comfortable shelter for occupants.

Several researchers have investigated changes in the blood flow rate depending on the indoor environment. Song (2008) measured the blood flow in the toe contacting a floor's surface and reported that the blood flow rate increased proportionally with the skin temperature of the foot. Song argued that the surface temperature of the floor should be maintained in the range of 23–33°C. Tanaka et al. (2003) investigated peripheral blood flow in the hands and feet. They concluded that an ambient temperature of 17°C may be too low for comfort due to decreased blood flow. These studies were performed in an artificial climate chamber, and the duration of the experiment was short (approximately three months). Human responses in climate chambers are different from responses in the field, and the human body changes seasonally. Studies on blood flow performed in the field and covering all seasons are limited. The aim of the current study was to investigate the seasonal changes in blood flow in the field. The fingertip blood flow was measured during (1) the summer, which is hot and humid; (2) the autumn, which is mild and comfortable; and (3) the winter, which is cold and dry. The purpose of this work was to elucidate the influence of indoor and outdoor environments on blood flow.

Many students know that physiological experiments using human subjects are performed continuously in the author's laboratory. Three research staff supported this study, and their friends and classmates were recruited as subjects. After preparing the experimental protocol, a research staff member posted a recruitment announcement on the bulletin board at Bucheon University and used a smart phone message system. The notice explained that students with severe cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal or other diseases were not eligible to participate in the experiment (Frank et al., 1999). Because obesity can influence thermal sensations (Magnusdottir et al., 2005; Cho et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2003), only subjects with a BMI (body mass index) below 25 were eligible. The length of time since consuming a meal also affects blood flow (Munkelwitz and Gilbert, 1998; Song et al., 2012), and subjects were not allowed to eat for 1h prior to the experiment.

The research staff informed the applicants that the blood flow measurements would be taken by attaching a probe to the fingertip. The Laser Doppler Meter is a non-invasive tool that is used to measure blood flow. Applicants who agreed to the terms of the investigation provided written consent. A total of 58 healthy students (33 males and 25 females) were recruited. The mean age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were22.7±2.94 years, 169.4±8.9cm, 62.1±12.3kg and 21.52±2.91, respectively. The subjects that participated in the investigation were paid 20,000 Korean Won (approximately18 US dollars) for participating.

The clothing insulation value (Clo) of the subjects was not controlled. All subjects wore their clothes as normal according to their personal habits or the weather conditions. When a subject arrived at the laboratory, he or she was asked to check his or her clothes, and a research staff member calculated the clothing insulation value according to the recommendation of ASHRAE Standard 55 (2004).

The blood flow rate was measured in the middle left fingertip using a Laser Doppler Meter (Model: BLF21, Transonic Systems Inc., New York, USA). Because the blood flow rate constantly fluctuates (Song, 2008), it should be measured dozens of times per second. The DI-158U Data Logger (DATAQ Instrument Inc., Ohio, USA) is designed to appropriately measure the fluctuating blood flow rate. The blood flow rate was measured 50 times per second using the aforementioned tools.

The first measurement of the blood flow rate was performed for duration of 10min after the subjects arrived at the laboratory. The second measurement was performed over 10min after the subjects had left the laboratory and walked outdoors from the school to the subway station (20min). During the walk, the climate conditions were measured using a portable temperature and humidity recorder (Model: TR-72S, T and D Corporation, Japan), each subject put the portable recorder into a small bag, and the sensor that measured temperature and humidity was located outside of the bag. The subjects were asked that the sensor should not come into contact with the subject's body. Data on the insolation and wind speed were obtained from the Bucheon weather station.

After the second blood flow measurement, the subjects entered a classroom and studied for 120min. The third blood flow rate measurement was taken over 10min after the subjects had studied for 2h.

The number of measurements was 105 during the summer, when air conditioning was used; 63 during the autumn, when no air conditioning was used; and 96 during the winter, when heating was used. A total of 264 measurements were taken. Fig. 1
                         shows how the blood flow measurements were taken during the summer, and Fig. 2
                         shows the composition of the measuring instruments. Fig. 3
                         shows a subject and the data logging system in the winter after the subject had arrived at the classroom after walking for 20min in the cold outdoor conditions of the winter season.

Korea has four seasons, and during the winter, a heating system should be used because the climate is very cold. During the summer, a cooling system is often used due to the hot weather conditions, and during the spring and autumn, air conditioning systems are not operated because the climate is mild.

Measurements were taken between July 20, 2010 and January 06, 2011 to estimate the blood flow rate during multiple seasons. During the summer, from July 20, 2010 to September 17, 2010, a cooling system was operated, and during the autumn, from September 30, 2010 to November 13, 2010, an air conditioning system was not operated. During the winter, from November 23, 2010 to January 6, 2011, a heating system was operated.

@&#RESULTS@&#


                        Table 1
                         shows the results for the measurements of the outdoor environment. The outdoor air temperature and relative humidity were measured by the subjects using a portable recorder (Model: TR-72S, T and D Corporation, Japan), and the insolation and wind velocity values were obtained from the meteorological weather station in Bucheon. During the summer, the outdoor air temperature ranged between 26.4°C and 33.7°C, and the average temperature was 30.3±1.93°C. During the mild season, autumn, the average outdoor temperature was 19.4±2.25°C, and during the cold winter season, the outdoor air temperature ranged between −2.5 and11.9°C, with an average of 4.55±4.90°C. The difference in the air temperature between seasons was statistically significant (p
                        =0.000). The average outdoor relative humidity was 64.6±12.86% during the summer, 51.6±15.86% during the autumn, and 54.9±19.18% during the winter, and the differences between seasons were not significant. The average insolation during the winter was 0.83±0.32MJ/m2, the smallest value for the three seasons. The differences between summer (1.74±0.75MJ/m2) and autumn (1.53±0.56MJ/m2) were statistically significant (p
                        <0.01). The average air velocity was 3.2±1.03m/s during the summer, 2.8m/s during the autumn and 4.1m/s during the winter. The differences between seasons were not significant.

During the summer, an air conditioning system was operated, and consequently, the indoor air temperature was maintained between 24 and 27°C. During the autumn, the air conditioning system was not operated, and the room air temperature was ranged between 22 and 27°C. During the winter, a heating system was operated, and the indoor air temperature was ranged between 20 and 23°C.

Each subject's clothing insulation value (Clo) was calculated according to the ASHRAE Standard 55 recommendations. The average clothing insulation value was 0.52±0.076Clo during the summer, 0.90±0.242Clo during the autumn and 1.09±0.276Clo during the winter. Table 2
                         presents the seasonal average Clo. The Clo value during the summer was significantly different from those during the autumn and winter (p
                        <0.001), but the difference in Clo value between autumn and winter was not significant (p
                        =0.06).


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the profile of the changes in clothing insulation value according to the outdoor climate. The Clo was inversely proportional to the outdoor air temperature, and the relationship between the Clo and the outdoor air temperature was statistically significant (p
                        <0.01). Based on this result, it can be inferred that changing the Clo is a strong thermal adaptation behaviour used to maintain comfort.


                        Table 3
                         shows the results of the measurements of the blood flow rate. The first blood flow rate measurement was taken over 10min when the subjects arrived at the laboratory; they had been exposed to various environments, including indoor and outdoor environments. The second blood flow rate measurement was taken after the subjects had walked for 20min; during the walk, they were exposed to the ambient outdoor environment. The third blood flow rate measurement was taken after the subjects had spent 2h in class; during this time, they were exposed to an indoor environment that was cooled during the summer, not cooled or heated during the autumn, and heated during the winter season. After walking for 10min, the average blood flow rate was 45.75±25.79TPU (tissue perfusion units) during the summer, 27.69±12.33TPU during the autumn and 18.18±17.22TPU during the winter. During the summer, the average ambient temperature was 30.30±1.93°C, and during this season, the highest blood flow rate was recorded, 45.75±25.79TPU. In contrast, during the winter, the average ambient air temperature was 4.55±4.90°C, and during this season, the lowest blood flow rate was measured, 18.18±17.22TPU. The difference in the blood flow rate after walking outdoors for 20min between summer and autumn was statistically significant (p
                        <0.05), and the difference between summer and winter was also significant (p
                        <0.001); however, the difference between autumn and winter was not significant (p
                        =0.253).

After the subjects had been in class for 2h, the average blood flow rate was 36.14±21.84TPU during the summer, 12.47±12.25TPU during the autumn and 14.95±11.44TPU during the winter season. The difference in the blood flow rate after being in class for 2h between summer and autumn was 23.67TPU, and this difference was statistically significant (p
                        <0.001). The difference in the blood flow between the summer and winter was 21.19TPU, which was statistically significant (p
                        <0.001). However, the difference in the blood flow between autumn and winter was not significant (p
                        =0.867).


                        Fig. 5
                         shows the relationship between the blood flow rate and outdoor air temperature. The blood flood rate was measured when the subject had finished a 20-min outdoors walks. The blood flow rate increased proportionally with the ambient air temperature (R
                        2
                        =0.3092, p
                        <0.001). Interestingly, the minimum blood flow rate was increased when the outdoor temperature was above 5°C. The maximum blood flow rate also increased proportionally with the outdoor air temperature.


                        Fig. 6
                         presents the blood flow rate in the fingertip after the subjects had been in class for 2h. The subjects were exposed to the indoor air temperature. During the winter, the indoor air temperature was maintained between 20 and 23°C, and a heating system was operated when the outdoor air temperature was below 12°C. During the autumn, the indoor air temperature was between 20 and 26°C without cooling or heating, and during this time, the outdoor temperature was in the range of 12–25°C. During the summer, an air conditioning system was operated to maintain an indoor temperature between 24 and 27°C, and the outdoor air temperature was above 26°C (see Table 1 for details). The blood flow rate after the subjects had been in class for 2h increased proportionally to the outdoor temperature (p
                        <0.01, r
                        2
                        =0.193, n
                        =88). The blood flow rate indoors was influenced by the outside weather conditions. However, the minimum value of the blood flow rate indoors did not increased proportionally to the outdoor air temperature. This phenomenon is in contrast to that presented in Fig. 5. Several subjects maintained a calm sedentary posture in the classroom. In contrast, subjects had to walk outside in the ambient air, and this activity induced an in increase in the blood flow rate, as illustrated in Fig. 5.

During the summer, when the air conditioning system was used, after 2h of class, the blood flow rate decreased from 45.95±25.790TPU to 36.14±21.837TPU, and this change was statistically significant (p
                        <0.05). During the autumn, the blood flow rate after exposure to outdoor air was 27.69±12.334TPU, and the blood flow rate after being in class for 2h indoors was 12.47±12.255.The difference in the blood flow rate was 15.22TPU, which was statistically significant (p
                        <0.001). During the winter when the heating system was used, after subjects the had been exposed to the outdoor environment for 20min, the blood flow rate was 17.12±16.396TPU, and after the subjects had been in class for 2h, the blood flow rate was 15.00±11.623TPU. The difference was 2.11TPU and was not statistically significant (p
                        =0.487, n
                        =31). However, when the outside air temperature was below 3°C, the blood flow rate was 6.74±3.540TPU after exposure to the outside air, and the blood flow rate increased to 13.95±11.522TPU indoors. The difference between these was 7.22TPU, which was statistically significant (p
                        <0.05, n
                        =14).

The comparison of the data in Figs. 5 and 6 shows that, during the summer and autumn, the blood flow rate decreased after the subjects had been in class for 2h. However, during the winter, when the outside air temperature was below 3°C, the blood flow rate was significantly increased after the subjects had been in class for 2h.

During the measurement of the blood flow rates of 88 subjects, several blood flow patterns were observed. Fig. 7
                         shows the blood flow pattern representing a comfortable body state; these data were obtained during the autumn. The heart rate was normal, and the blood flow was controlled not proportionally but intermittently by the external environment. During the autumn, subjects were exposed to ambient air temperatures of 13–24°C, and the blood flow rate fluctuated from 15 to 40TPU.


                        Fig. 8
                         shows a blood flow pattern representing the hot state. Generally, this pattern was observed during the hot summer season when the ambient temperature was approximately 30°C. Many subjects had blood flow patterns similar to that in Fig. 8. Although it was hot during the summer, low blood flow was observed when the subjects moved slowly (refer Fig. 5). By contrast, even though the season was mild and the ambient temperature was approximately 26°C, a pattern similar to that shown in Fig. 8 was observed when the subjects walked or ran at full speed.


                        Fig. 9
                         shows a representative blood flow response when a subject was in a cold state. The blood flow rate was below 10TPU. This pattern was generally observed in the winter. When the outside ambient temperature was below 0°C and the subjects had walked outdoors for 20min, most of the subjects had blood flow patterns similar to that in Fig. 9 (refer Fig. 5). In contrast, even during the summer, a blood flow pattern similar to that presented in Fig. 9 was observed for several subjects after they had been in class for 2h in an air-conditioned room (refer to Fig. 6). When subjects were sedentary and kept still in the classroom for 2h, blood flow patterns similar to that in Fig. 9 were observed during every season. However, when the outdoor temperature was maintained above 30°C, the pattern shown in Fig. 9 was not observed.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The blood flow rate is controlled to maintain homeostasis in a varying environment (Schimidt and Thews, 1989; Sakoi et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2007), and there are many factors that affect the blood flow rate, including sex, age, body build and composition, physical fitness level, the external environment, shivering, and the application of pressure to the tissue (Tanaka et al., 2003; ASHRAE, 2001; Burton and Bazett, 1936; Tomas, 1996; Vanos et al., 2010). ASHRAE (1993) documented that vasodilation is governed by a warm signal from the body core. For each 1°C increase above the neutral core temperature (36.8°C), blood flow increases by 56g/sm2; m2 indicates the body surface area. Vasoconstriction is governed by a cold signal from the skin, for each 1°C decrease below the thermo neutral body skin temperature (33.7°C), there is a proportional resistance to blood flow on average. The skin temperature and core body temperature which are related to blood flow, are affected by exposed environments (Song and Seo, 2006; Song, 2008, 2010), and the skin temperature is consequently related to thermal comfort (Song, 2008; Sakoi et al., 2007; Yao et al. 2007; Vanos et al., 2010). In the present study, the blood flow rate in the fingertips was measured during different seasons with air temperatures ranging from −3°C to +34°C; this temperature range included almost all weather conditions that are experienced in Korea. This study revealed that the blood flow rate of subjects who exposed their body outdoors as well as indoors increased proportionally with the outdoor ambient temperature (p
                     <0.001).

According to the thermal comfort theory, a comfortable temperature can be calculated based on psychological responses (subjective thermal sensation vote) from the PMV (predicted mean vote) value between −0.5 and +0.5 (Fanger, 1970; ISO 7730, 1994; ASHRAE Standard 55, 2004). In contrast, based on physiological responses, the comfortable and healthy temperature range is defined as the environmental temperature range in which homeostasis can be maintained by controlling the blood flow rate without sweating or shivering (Schimidt and Thews, 1989; Song, 2010). During the autumn season in Korea, the use of a heating or cooling system is not required. Autumn is a comfortable and healthy season, and people can stay comfortable by varying their level of clothing insulation. In this investigation, the recorded outdoor temperature was in the range of 13–26°C during the autumn, and the indoor temperature was between 20°C and 26°C even without the operation of a heating or cooling system. During this comfortable season, the average blood flow rate was 27.7±12.33TPU after walking for 20min outdoors, and it was 12.5±12.25TPU indoors. According to previous research performed by Rock and Robinson (1965) and Powell and Blair (1994) showing that sedentary living habits are detrimental to human health, the blood flow rate outdoors is a meaningful value for human health. In a comfortable and healthy environment, the average blood flow rate was 28TPU, and the blood flow pattern was not constant but fluctuated between 15TPU and 40TPU. Parsons (2003) described the hierarchy systems in thermo regulation; a number of body systems cannot be affected by all desirable responses. Thermoregulation is often relatively in competition for blood flow between systems. The fluctuating blood flow pattern was seen the result of competition with other systems. Previously, Lutzenhiser (1992) reported that occupants preferred manual operation to automatic temperature control based on the results of an air conditioner use survey. In the forum of ‘Roomvent 2009’, Zhu proposed that remaining in air-conditioned spaces for long periods has a negative effect on an occupant's health and the body's ability to thermoregulate (MOF3B in Roomvent, 2009, Busan). In a recent study, Song et al. (2012) investigated air conditioner operation behaviour, and they reported that students selected a fluctuating temperature range of 23.7–27.4°C and that the automatic control mode was never used to maintain a constant temperature. It is hypothesised that a comfortable and healthy environment is one in which the air temperature is not maintained at a constant temperature but fluctuates and in which the blood flow rate is not constant but fluctuates.

The thermal behaviour of occupants is diverse and depends on many factors, including age; sex; clothing insulation value (Clo); activity (metabolism); posture (Parsons, 2003; Sakoi et al. 2007; Yao et al. 2007); emotions such as joy, love, fear, loneliness, stress and anger (Saldmann, 2008); cultural habits; race; location (Nicol et al., 1995); genetic characteristics (Song, 2010); personal disease history (Frank et al., 1999); obesity (Magnusdottir et al., 2005); the length of time since consuming a meal (Munkelwitz and Gilbert, 1998; Cho et al., 2013); wealth; social norms; and organisational policies (Charles, 2003). Among the various thermal behaviours, varying the clothing insulation value (Clo) is the most powerful thermal adaptation behaviour to maintain homeostasis in the human body and to maintain comfort (Havenith et al., 2002; Nikolopoulou et al., 2001). In this investigation, the clothing insulation value was significantly correlated with the outdoor air temperature (n
                     =87, R
                     2
                     =0.5749, p
                     <0.001). When our findings are compared with previous investigations by Nikolopoulou et al. (2001), Koreans wore lighter clothing than Britons. During the autumn and winter, the Clo range was wider than during the summer season: 0.64–1.67Clo during the autumn, 0.64–1.74Clo during the winter and 0.26–0.66Clo during the summer (see Table 2 for details). During the autumn, the clothing insulation value should be varied to adapt to the wide range of outdoor air temperatures (13–24°C). During the winter, due to the large difference in temperature between indoor (20–23°C) and outdoor (−3 to 12°C) environment, the Clo should be varied. In contrast, during the summer, the outdoor temperature was high (26–34°C), and the indoor temperature was also high (23–26°C); therefore, thin clothing is suitable for adaptation to these weather conditions.

Insufficient microcirculation leads to cold drafts, pain, numbness and cyanosis; skin can turn blue when the oxygen supply is depleted, and oxygen depletion can cause tissue ischemia, the loss of manual dexterity, delays in wound healing, delays in development and growth and eventually tissue necrosis (Griefahn et al., 2001; Heus et al., 1995; Yu et al., 2006; Dano et al., 2001; Toyokawa et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2006). In this study, the blood flow decreased to below 10TPU after exposure to cold outdoor temperatures when the outdoor air temperature was below 3°C during the winter (see Fig. 5 in detail). After the subjects had been in class for 2h, the average blood flow rate was increased by approximately 7TPU, and this increase was statistically significant (p
                     <0.05). Warm indoor air increased the blood flow rate during the cold winter season. The operation of a heating system is important to increase microcirculation.

Although the subjects stayed in the heated indoor classroom for 2 hours, for many subjects, the blood flow rate was below 10TPU (see Figs. 5 and 6) when the subjects stayed still in a sitting posture in a chair. Furthermore, a low blood flow rate was found in several subjects even during the hot summer season, when an air conditioner was operated. Some women who work for a long time in an air-conditioned office suffer menstrual disorders because this environment might reduce the level of angiogenesis. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the blood flow rate decreased in many subjects when moving from outdoors to indoors. A reduced level of angiogenesis can lead to many disorders and diseases (Kim, 2005; Powell and Blair, 1994). Fig. 9 shows the blood flow pattern after exposure to cold air. This type of pattern was observed for all subjects at air temperatures below 0°C. Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) is a process in which the blood vessels in the fingertips rapidly vasodilate approximately 5–10min after the hand is exposed to cold conditions. CIVD is believed to reduce the risk of cold-induced injury (Daanen, 2003). As shown in Fig. 9, although the subjects were exposed to cold air, the blood flow rates were not always sustained at a low level; sometimes the blood flow rates increased. This phenomenon of hunting reaction protects against cold injuries and occurs not only when subjects are exposed to low temperatures but also when subjects are in indoor environments in which the temperature is regulated by air conditioning (see Fig. 6 for details). This phenomenon was not observed when the subjects were exposed to outdoor temperatures above 13°C. Exposure to mild outdoor air while walking outside is considered a good way to improve human health.

It is well known that heat induces skin ageing, skin lesions, keratosis, and dermal elastosis; loss of elasticity in the skin (Arrington and Lockman, 1979; Schieke et al., 2003). Kim et al. (2006) suggested that the effects of heat play an important role in skin angiogenesis in humans. Furthermore, chronic or excessive exposure to heat increases the supply of oxygen to cells and leads to oxidative DNA damage (Marczynska et al., 1980; Ivell, 2007). Sperm quality is better during the winter than during the summer because the ambient temperature is lower during the winter than during the summer (Levine et al., 1992; Andolz et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2003; Chia et al., 2001). In this study, the average blood flow rate was 45.75±25.79TPU when the subjects were outdoors during the summer, and the average blood flow rate decreased to 36.14±21.84TPU when the subjects were indoors. The indoor environment mitigated the high blood flow rate (see Table 3). As shown in Fig. 5, the blood flow rate was indicative of extremely high perfusion in several subjects at outdoor air temperatures of approximately 30°C. This blood flow pattern is presented in Fig. 8. This phenomenon was not observed for all subjects. Five subjects among the 35 subjects exhibited high-perfusion blood flow. Subjects were not asked to walk at a high speed but were asked to walk at their normal speed. All subjects walked to or from home every day. The walking speed varied among subjects; several subjects walked at full speed, whereas several subjects walked very slowly.

People are very sensitive to the heat when they walk outdoors during the hot summer season. This study found that the blood flow rate increased proportionally with the air temperature. This increase in blood flow indicates an increased supply of oxygen to cells in the body. This oxidative stress is harmful to human health. Several researchers have proposed the use of urban greening to mitigate the extreme outdoor environment during the hot summer season; trees block solar radiation and consequently decrease the air temperature and the radiation temperature (Park et al., 2011; Dimoudi and Nikolopoulou, 2003; Hwang et al., 2010). Providing shade is one of the most important ways to enhance thermal comfort and increase health for citizens. In contrast, the blood flow rate during the winter season was below 10TPU due to the extreme outdoor air temperature, which was sustained below 3°C. This low blood flow rate could not be increased even by wearing heavy clothes. A cold body with low blood perfusion should be warmed indoors. Public office buildings, cafés or restaurants could serve as shelters in which pedestrians can increase their blood flow rate.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The blood flow rate in the fingertip was measured during several seasons and analysed to elucidate the influence of indoor and outdoor air temperatures. The measurements yielded the following conclusions.
                        
                           (1)
                           In a comfortable and healthy environment, the average blood flow rate is approximately 30TPU, and the blood flow pattern is not constant but fluctuates between 15TPU and 40TPU.

The clothing insulation value was strongly correlated with the outdoor air temperature and ranged from 0.26 to 1.74 during the studied seasons (p
                              <0.01). Changing one's clothing style is one of the most powerful adaption behaviours.

When the outside air temperature was below 3°C, warm indoor air could increase the blood flow rate from 6.74TPU to 13.95TPU (p
                              <0.05). The operation of a heating system is important in increasing microcirculation.

A low blood flow rate below 10TPU was observed indoors during all seasons. Working while sedentary for a long time indoors could reduce the level of angiogenesis, which can lead to many disorders and diseases. Exposure to a mild climate outdoors with light exercise is recommended to improve human health.

During the summer, the increased blood flow observed outdoors was decreased significantly indoors from 45.95TPU to 36.14TPU (p
                              <0.05). The building's air conditioning system mitigated the extremely high blood flow rate, and harmful angiogenesis maybe inhibited indoors.
