                      queuing system with two heterogeneous servers under new queue disciplines when the classical First Come First Served ‘(FCFS)’ queue discipline is to be violated. Customers are served either by server-I according to an exponential service time distribution with mean rate μ or by server-II with a general service time distribution

                     . Sequel to some objections raised in the literature on the use of the classical FCFS queue discipline in heterogeneous service systems, two alternative queue disciplines (Serial and Parallel) are considered in this work with the objective that if the FCFS is violated then the violation is a minimum in the long run. Using the embedded method under the serial queue discipline and the supplementary variable technique under the parallel queue discipline, we present an exact analysis of the steady state number of customers in the system and most importantly, the actual waiting time expectation of customers in the system. Our work shows that one can obtain all stationary probabilities and other vital measures for this queue under certain simple but realistic assumptions.

We consider the 
                        
                           M
                           /

                      queuing system with an exponential server (server-I) and a general server (server-II). Customers arrive according to a Poisson process at a rate λ for service with much expectation of spending the least waiting time in the system. Server-I has a faster service rate compared with server-II. This information is not new to prospective customers. Thus, server-I is always busy when there is at least a customer in the system. The service times of customers

                        Which are independent of inter-arrival times.

                      are assumed to be a sequence of mutually independent and identically distributed random variables with finite moments. In addition, services are without preemption. For customers serviced by server-I, the service time

Generally, a number of literature sources on queuing systems raises some objections to the use of the classical First Come First Served (FCFS) queuing discipline in systems with heterogeneous structures (Krishnamoorthy, 1962; Alexander, Marcus, & Cristobal, 2014
                     
                        2
                        Implied in this work also.
                     
                     
                        2
                     ). This stand can be justified. For instance, if clerks in a reservation counter provide service with varying speeds then customers might prefer to choose the fastest clerk for service. On the other hand, if one chooses the slowest clerk randomly then customers that entered the system after him may clear out earlier by obtaining service from a clerk with a faster working rate. Apparently in this case, 
                        the FCFS queue discipline
                      is violated due to heterogeneity in service speeds of the clerks. This and similar real life scenarios make the FCFS queue discipline unrealistic in queuing systems with embedded heterogeneity because of the high probability of violation therein. Hence, there is the need for designing alternative queue disciplines that can reduce the impact of the violation so that the resulting waiting times of customers are almost identical with that of the FCFS. Similarly in a business center, one may come across a scenario where both the salesman and the boss
                        3
                        Or even a salesman and a supervisor or a senior colleague.
                     
                     
                        3
                      (owner) are providing services together. If there is only one customer then he is serviced by the salesman provided that no any other one arrives during his service period. On the other hand, if at least an arrival occurs then the boss joins the salesman either serially (working jointly with the salesman to serve the initial customer) or in parallel (attending a different customer). As a schedule, if there are up to two customers in the center then the boss will join the salesman in service
                        4
                        Jointly but independently (one customer at a time) in the first model but independently paralleled in the second model.
                     
                     
                        4
                      so that customers do not get bored by excessive waiting and choose to renege or balk thereby making the business loose market. We refer to the first service approach as serial service as implied in the serial queue discipline below and the later as parallel service as in parallel queue discipline also below. Note that the class of serial queuing systems is not extensively studied in the literature in contrast to the parallel case systems (see Emrah, Ceyda, & Irem, 2013) even though, significant areas of application are found in reality. Our motivation stemmed from these numerous physical applications of the proposed models (both serial and parallel) in shops, malls, supermarkets, offices, banks and several other business outfits where heterogeneity of servers is embedded. An in-depth analysis therefore is an excellent tool for decision making relative to congestion management, better service provision, etc. For instance, a business mogul owning two shops each with two staff (servers) of varying work speed may wish to understand which of the two models above

                            model under the serial queue discipline while the other shop adopts the parallel service order of the 
                              
                                 M

                                 ,

                            with service schedule following a parallel queue discipline
                     
                     
                        5
                      minimizes waiting times better.
                        6
                        This is one of the many physical scenarios involving the applications of the two models under the designed serial and parallel queue disciplines.
                     
                     
                        6
                      Similarly, he may wish to understand whether an equilibrium point exists under which one model is to be preferred to the other or even when the two models are identical. These kind of questions are vital for performance evaluation and better management practice since heterogeneity is a natural embedding in reality and is the necessitating factor leading to server discrimination. For instance between a well experienced shop seller and an apprentice, a senior doctor and a junior doctor, a professor and a bachelor, etc. Basically, customers hate to wait for a longer time arising from the in-effectiveness of a slow server and in several instances may prefer to wait for the remaining service time of a customer being served by a fast server even when the slow server is idle. Over the years, a lot have been written on homogeneous service systems for instance, Hoksad (1978), Hoksad (1979), Senthamaraikannan and Sivasamy (1997), Tijms, Vaan Hoorn, and Federgruen (1981), etc. The reader is referred to these and many others to refresh. Similarly research works on heterogeneous service systems has grown tremendously in the last two decades; Kim, Ahn, and Righter (2011), Kumar, Madheswari, and Venkatakrishnan (2007), Krishnamoorthy (1962), Shenkar and Weinrib (1989), Singh (1968), etc. In the models described in these works, the heterogeneity structure is saddled on servers following relatively the same distributions. A model of the general service type is studied by Boxma et al. (2002) unfortunately, due to complex structuring, formations and assumptions, it could not estimate certain areas in the general case. Part of this complexity may be saddled on the assumption of the FCFS queue discipline adopted in such a heterogeneous structure.

In this article, we have introduced two queue disciplines (serial and parallel) whose effects on the two models described below can all be computed numerically. Most importantly, the serial queue discipline is relatively close to that of Boxma et al. (2002) and the parallel queue discipline is that of Krishnamoorthy (1962). Thus, our work in this sense is a base for comparing the effects of these queue disciplines on the models for better use and adoption in real life business applications. The rest of the article is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe the model together with the preliminary assumptions employed. Section 3 deals with the steady state analysis of the

Here, the Probability Generating Function (PGF) of the number of customers in the system, the LST of the waiting time distribution and their mean values have been obtained. Similarly, a numerical illustration is provided to support the results on mean waiting times.

                        A realistic scenario for the serial model occurs for instance in a shop with two servers when a customer is being serviced by the first server. Upon arrival of another customer the second server joins the first server to service the first customer to hasten his service process there by reducing the waiting time of the second and subsequent customers. The other model i.e. the

                            comes into picture if the second server decides to serve the second customer independently.

Two alternative queue disciplines (serial and parallel) are proposed in this work. We suppose that an arbitrary shop whose queuing features are that of the

Suppose that the decision reached above favors the installation of an additional general server (server-II) jointly in series with the exponential server (server-I) such that:

                           If a customer arrives during the idle state of the system, his service is immediately initiated by server-I (since server-I is faster than server-II). This customer receives service at exponential rate μ if no other customer arrives during his ongoing service period; otherwise if at least one more customer arrives, then the initial customer is served jointly by both servers but independently according to the service time distribution

Server-I is engaged; he waits for service from server-I whether or not server-II is free. But if the number of customers waiting for service from server-I becomes m (a positive integer), he goes to server-II for service if that server is free; otherwise he waits as the

Thus, this queue discipline achieves the objective that the least amount of waiting time is spent in the system according to the conditions present upon its arrival (for this specific choice of m) and also, it reduces the violation of first-in first-out principle. Generally, results on methodologies for choosing m under any specific queue discipline is limited. However, the work of Efrosinin and Sztrik (2011) is worth mentioning here. Efrosinin and Sztrik (2011) have shown that, if m is chosen such that

Thus, one can conclude that though, some violations of the FCFS principle occurred because of heterogeneity of servers in

                      queue under the serial queue discipline differ insignificantly as observed in Tables 2a and 2b.

Similarly, we infer from these results that, if 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ρ

                      is relatively far from one, then it is operationally better to allocate a customer to a server instead of joint service when another customer is present. As can be seen in the tables above, both the mean queue length and the mean waiting time in the latter under the parallel queue discipline is stationary smaller than that of the former. Hence, the parallel queue discipline is a better alternative when arrival rates is not approaching the combined server rates.

Similarly, if

                     , then it is operationally better to join service than allocating servers to distinct customers. This is evident from Tables 2a and 2b that when

                     , the expected behavior of the serial model becomes better than that of the parallel model. The results obtained here can be applied in service systems where customer distribution are required for better practice. Most importantly is the new result of our work that under serial queue discipline applied on the two connected servers as in the

                      holds. This ensures that the associated Markov chain for the customer distribution is ergodic. There is a scope to studying the models discussed here via Markov-renewal theory. This will ensure an equality relationship between the arrival distribution and those specified in Lemma 4.1. Finally, we are grateful to all the sources of literature used and to those that encourage us to see the great work of Boxma et al. (2002) model in a different way.
