                  With constant growth in size of analyzable data, ranking of academic entities is becoming an attention grabbing task. For ranking of authors, this study considers the author's own contribution, as well as the impact of mutual influence of the co-authors, along with exclusivity in their received citations. The ranking of researchers is influenced by the ranking of their co-authors, more so if co-authors are seniors. Tracking the citations received by an author is also an important factor to measure standing of an author. This study proposes Mutual Influence and Citation Exclusivity Author Rank (MuICE) algorithm. We performed a sequence of experiments to calculate the MuICE Rank. First, we calculated Mutual Influence (MuInf) considering three different factors: the number of papers, the number of citations and the author's appearance as first author. Secondly, we computed MuICE incorporating all three factors of MuInf along with the exclusivity in citations received by an author. Empirically, it is shown that the proposed methods generate substantial results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Analysis of academic social networks has considerable applications in academic recommendation tasks. Citation, co-citation and co-authorship networks are formed when researchers cite each other's work and work in collaboration. Some general activities in academic social networks are ranking of authors (Ding, Yan, Frazho, & Caverlee, 2009; Liu, Bollen, Nelson, & Van de Sompel, 2005), expert finding (Daud, Li, Zhou, & Muhammad, 2010; Zhang, Tang, & Li, 2007), author interest finding (Daud, 2012) and author name disambiguation (Shu, Long, & Meng, 2009). This study calculates the rank of authors with respect to their mutual influence on each other and exclusivity in their received citations. A novice researcher who may get an opportunity to collaborate with a leading researcher can have more chances to prosper in the future. Considering author's own contribution in a work, as well as the impact of influence of his or her co-authors, gives a comprehensive representation of the position of an author in an academic networks.

Existing approaches find the rank of authors based on their in-links (number of nodes pointing to a node) information (Ding, 2011a; Ding et al., 2009; Gollapalli, Mitra, & Giles, 2011). The proposed method involves in-links information of a node, as well as it also considers out-links (number of nodes pointed to by) of an author. Co-author relationships from network are used to find the out-links information. This study considers a bibliographic network and presents three ways to find out the mutual influence of authors on each other, these are; with respect to the number of papers, the number of citations and the appearance of an author as first author. MuInf is based on PageRank (Brin & Page, 1998; Page, Brin, Motwani, & Winograd, 1999). We also tried to track the citations received by an author; i.e. Citations are received from how many exclusive sources. For this purpose, a bibliometric measure “f-index” (Katsaros, Akritidis, & Bozanis, 2009) is used. The term exclusivity here can be explained with the help of a simple example. Suppose there are two articles, if the first article receives three citations from three different authors and the second article receives three citations from the same author, then the first article must receive more weight as the citations received by it are from more exclusive authors. Due to the aforementioned reasons we are motivated to propose Mutual Influence and Citation Exclusivity (MuICE) Rank algorithm. Main contributions of this research are (1) finding the impact of authors based on their mutual influence on each other, with respect to the number of publications, the number of citations, the number of publications as first author and (2) ranking of authors by considering the exclusivity in their received citations along with their mutual influence.

The study conducts a detailed experimentation which shows that proposed MuICE method generates satisfying results when compared to existing methods. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of link analysis based ranking methods in academic social networks. Section 3 gives an overview of the existing methods used as baselines and the details of our proposed method. Section 4 describes the dataset, performance evaluation, parameter settings with results and discussions and at the end Section 5 concludes the study.

The following sets of terms are used interchangeably throughout the text, (academic social networks, bibliography network, co-author networks), (paper, article, publication) and (author, researcher) etc.

Author ranking methods based on analysis of link structure of a network can be classified into two groups: (1) Iterative methods and (2) Non iterative methods. This study includes the review of the former methods only.

Iterative link analysis methods execute a set of instructions iteratively for a decided number of times or until convergence of the algorithm. PageRank (Brin & Page, 1998; Page et al., 1999) is a state-of-the-art iterative link analysis algorithm and is the foundation of a large number of approaches that have been proposed for author ranking. These methods consider the authors or the publications of authors as vertices instead of pages while forming a graph. These graphs can represent co-authorship, citation or co-citation relationships. PageRank asserts a page to be significant if there are many other significant pages referencing it. The rank of a page is evenly dispersed among all the pages it is linking.

Another prevalent iterative technique based on link structure analysis is Hyperlink Induced Topic Search (HITS) which discriminates the pages as Hubs and Authorities (Kleinberg, 1999). The pages that function as directories by providing links to informative pages are known as Hubs. The pages that contain actual information and are pointed to by the hubs are called Authority pages. Fiala, Rousselot, and Ježek (2008) provided a modification of PageRank for ranking of authors in a bibliographic networks that considers the co-authorship graphs and citations. A variation of PageRank was proposed for finding experts from digital libraries to include various available facts from different objects and relations (Gollapalli et al., 2011). An alternative of centrality measure for analyzing the properties of academic networks was presented as Author-Rank algorithm (Liu et al., 2005). Author-Rank finds the impact of an author in an undirected co-authorship network contemplating collaboration frequency. Two variations of weighted PageRank were proposed for ranking of authors by Ding et al. (2009) and Yan and Ding (2011) where they studied a co-citation network and a co-authorship network respectively. Li and Tang (2008) explored the temporal dimension for the problem of expert finding. A generalization of PageRank for bibliographic networks was presented that included the time based statistics by exercising the forward and backward propagation process and combined the social networks with the random walk model. Fiala (2012) presented a method that weighs the citation between two authors on the basis that whether and when these authors have collaborated with each other. The time of publication and citation is also considered in this time-aware algorithm. Radicchi, Fortunato, Markines, and Vespignani (2009) proposed a new weighted version of PageRank, in which ranking was conducted by considering the diffusion of credits traded by the authors. Ding (2011a) measured the popularity and prestige of an author in a co-citation network. The primary focus of study was to assign high weight to the citations from prestigious authors as compared to the citations from less known authors. Wei, Barnaghi, and Bargiela (2011) semantically ranked documents and demonstrated the web surfing activities of a scholar instead of a random surfer. For this purpose, they introduced a knowledge base which contains a terminological topic ontology and academic research entities like authors, journals/conferences and papers. Ding (2011b) presented a topic sensitive extension of PageRank algorithm. The novelty was to enhance the semantics of authors ranking by introducing topic dependent weights in PageRank algorithm. Recently, a topic based model was presented for simultaneous modeling of academic entities including authors, papers and journals in a heterogeneous network (Amjad, Ding, Daud, Xu, & Malic, 2015).

The concept of mutual influence of authors was presented by Li, Foo, Tew, and Ng (2009). They introduced PubRank algorithm for finding the rising stars. Using the same concept of mutual influence Daud, Abbasi, and Muhammad (2013) proposed StarRank for finding the rising star in co-authors network. This study adopts the term, mutual influence, in an intuitive manner for ranking of authors. To identify the exclusivity in citations received by an author, we used f-index (Katsaros et al., 2009), which is a bibliometric measure to evaluate an author by considering the citations received by an author. The f-index introduced the concept of co-terminal citations. Co-terminal citations are a generalization of co-citations and are introduced as an attempt to find the trends that prevail among communication in scholarly networks. They gave fair credit to self-citations, instead of eliminating their effect, while keeping track of multiple author citations.

In literature, mutual influence and exclusivity in citations of an author are not being integrated for ranking of authors. This encourages us to propose Mutual Influence Rank (MuInf) and Mutual Influence and Citation Exclusivity Author Rank (MuICE).

Before giving the details of our proposed methods, a brief introduction of the baseline methods goes first. The first baseline method is weighted PageRank presented by Yan and Ding (2011), which considers the number of citations as weight.

                      and d is the damping factor.

The second baseline method is also a weighted PageRank presented by Yan and Ding (2011), which considers the number of publication as weight instead of citations count.

This research considers a co-authorship network for evaluation of authors. We delineate a co-authorship network as a directed, weighted graph G = (V, E), where V is a set of vertices representing authors in the graph and E is a set of edges which represent the co-author connections. Formally, V = {vi
                        |vi
                         is an author in considered dataset} and E = {(vi, vj
                        )|co-auth (vi, vj
                        ) > 0, vi, vj
                         ∈ V}, where co-auth (vi, vj
                        ) represents the papers in which authors vi
                         and vj
                         are co-authors. it should be noticed that in the proposed weighted directed graph the edge (vi, vj
                        ) and (vj, vi
                        ) are not the same. The weight of the edge (vi, vj
                        ) is the influence of author vi
                         on author vj
                        , while in edge (vj, vi
                        ) it is the influence of author vj
                         on author vi
                        .

This section introduces the mutual influence based ranking of authors. It is believed that an author who co-authors with eminent authors, has more chances to become a renowned author. An extension of PageRank algorithm is proposed to find the mutual influence of authors on each other in three different ways. The proposed method integrates the mutual influence based weights in the original PageRank formula along with publications, citations and first author publication weights.

This method studies the influence of co-authors on each other considering their number of publications. Senior researchers have more influence on their co-workers as compared to the junior because the senior researchers have more publications. Mutual influence method is inspired from PubRank (Li et al., 2009) and is based on PageRank. As mentioned in Section 3.1, we consider a graph in which nodes represent authors and edges represent the co-author relationship among them. When the authors Ax, Ay
                            are co-authors of an article, weight (Ax, Ay
                           ) shows the influence of Ax
                            on Ay
                            and likewise (Ay, Ax
                           ) is the fraction with which Ay
                            influences Ax
                           .

This can be explained with in a simple example. Consider two researchers, Ax
                            with 8 papers and Ay
                            with 6 papers. If they are co-authors in 3 publications, their mutual influence based weight can be calculated as under:

                            is given by WP
                           (Ax, Ay
                           ). It can be seen from Eq. (2) that author Ax
                            influences author Ay
                            more due to higher weight of WP
                           (Ax, Ay
                           ). This shows seniority of author Ax
                            over author Ay.
                            Mutual influence with respect to number of papers can be calculated as follows.

In this section we calculate the influence of co-authors on work of each considering the number of citations received by their papers. Authors with a higher number of citations are believed to be more influential. Difference of MuInfC from MuInfP becomes more evident in situations when an author having a lower number of publications, yet receives a higher number of citations due to the high quality of work.

To explain the phenomena, consider a simple example with two different scenarios shown in Table 1
                           . Consider scenario 1 in which there are two authors, Ax
                            with 8 papers and Ay
                            with 6 papers and they have co-authored 4 papers with each other. The citations obtained by their co-authored publications are 8. The author Ax
                            has 22 citations (Cix
                           ) and author Ay
                            has 14 citations (Ciy
                           ). The citation weight WC
                            with which they influence each other is calculated as follows:

                            and Ay
                            are given by TCix
                            and TCiy
                            respectively, sum of citations of their co-authored papers is given by (Cxy
                           ) and (Cyx
                           ) and the weight with which author Ax
                            influences author Ay
                            is given by WC
                           (Ax, Ay
                           ). It can be seen from Eq. (4) that author Ax
                            influences author Ay
                            more due to higher weight of WC
                           (Ax, Ay
                           ). This shows seniority of author Ax
                            over author Ay.
                            Substituting the values given in scenario 2 of Table 1 in Eq. (4) we get WC
                           (Ax, Ay
                           ) = 0.57 and WC
                           (Ay, Ax
                           ) = 0.66 which shows that when the citations of author Ax
                            were lowered, the weight with which Ay
                            influences Ax
                            increases. It must be noticed here that only the number of citations is considered, the number of publications of both authors in two scenarios is the same.

Mutual influence with respect to number of citations can be calculated as follows:

This section cogitates whether authors to be ranked appear as the first author in their publication or not. Author whose name appears as the first author of an article will be given more weight in this strategy. However, otherwise they will be given half weight assuming that normally the first author is the main contributor. A novel link weighting strategy is proposed to find the contribution of an author based on the author's position in list of co-authors of an article, along with their mutual influence. To demonstrate the phenomena an example is included here. Consider two researchers, Ax
                            and Ay
                           . Author Ax
                            has 4 publications while Ay
                            has 3 publications and they have 2 co-authored publications. Table 2
                            shows the author's name's position (y if its first author, n otherwise). The bold faced letters show the common/co-authored publications of Ax
                            and Ay
                           . Non bold letters show the publications of Ax
                            and Ay
                            with other authors. For example, Ax
                           : 1(y), 2(n), 3(y), 4(n) means that Ax
                            has four publications 1, 2, 3 and 4. Bold faced 1(y) shows that paper 1 was co-authored by Ay
                           , and (y) shows Ax
                            was the first author. Non bold faced 4(n) shows that publication 4 was not co-authored by Ay
                            and (n) shows Ax
                            was not the first author. Authors who appear as the first author are given full credit while half credit is given to all other authors.

                           where WFA
                           (Ax, Ay
                           ) is the contribution weight with which Ax
                            influences Ay
                            and vice versa for WFA
                           (Ay, Ax
                           ). ∑Cx
                            and ∑Cy
                            is the contribution on the basis that they are first authors or not. ∑TCx
                            and ∑TCy
                            is the total contribution of authors Ax
                            and Ay
                            in all papers written by them. In scenario 1, both authors have 2 papers as the first author. In their co-authored papers they both appear as the first author once, but author Ax
                            influences author Ay
                            more because Ax
                            has more number of papers overall.

In scenario 2, the author Ax
                            having four papers, appears as the first author in only 1 paper. While author Ay
                            having three papers, appears in two papers as the first author. Solving Eq. (6) for scenario 2 one can see that WFA
                           (Ax, Ay
                           ) is 2 and WFA
                           (Ay, Ax
                           ) is also 2. This shows that, although Ax
                            has more number of publications, but Ay
                            is equally influential. The reason behind this is that Ay
                            appears in more publications as first author. In scenario 3, the author Ax
                            having four papers, appears as the first author in 2 papers while author Ay
                            having three papers, appears as the first author in only one paper. Solving Eq. (6) for scenario 3 we can see that  WFA
                           (Ax, Ay
                           ) is 2.5 and WFA
                           (Ay, Ax
                           ) is 1.7. This demonstrates how the influence of authors on each other is changing with a changing number of papers as first author.

The equation of mutual influence with respect to author's name appearance as first author is:

All three mutual influence based formulas follow a similar sequence of steps in the main algorithm, while the calculation of weights is different. Fig. 1
                         gives a pseudocode for the main algorithm followed by the MuInfP method.

The idea of exclusivity of citations articulates that if two papers of an author have the same number of citations, but with a different number of unique authors citing his or her work, then the paper with larger number of citations by different authors must be given more weight. Such as, if there are more unique authors in citing authors of paper A, as compared to paper B, paper A will be given more weight as it is read by more authors as compared to paper B.

To further explain the concept of exclusivity of citations a simple example is given below. Suppose that paper P is cited by three different papers, of which paper one was co-authored by a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and a7, paper 2 was co-authored by a1, a2 and a3, while paper three was co-authored by a3, a4 and a5. The point to be noted here is the existence of author a3 all citing documents. This pattern of citations, where some author has cited one paper multiple times in different papers originated the term of co-terminal citations. The scenario is represented in Fig. 2.

                        . Thus, for calculating the f-index of an author, exclusivity in citations of an author are considered. The example calculates the f-index for one paper by an author. For experimentation, one has to calculate f-index values for all papers of an author and assign the average value to an author as f-index. The same process will be followed for all the authors in the dataset.

Now we are going to introduce the formula for Mutual Influence and Citation Exclusivity (MuICE) Rank. We combined the weight factors of mutual influence that were introduced in Eqs. (3), (5) and (7) along with f-index as follows:

The results are discussed in Section 4.5 which demonstrate that considering only the number of papers or the number of citations for ranking of an authors is not a sufficient criteria. Assimilation of exclusivity of citations along with mutual influence of authors will produce effective and dependable results.

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

In this study, we considered a co-authorship graph which was extracted from version 5 of datasets available at AMiner

                         website (Tang et al., 2008). It entails all papers from DBLP and the citation relationship between these papers in the form of references. Author name disambiguation has also been considered while making this dataset. In this dataset the total number of papers are 1,572,277 and 2,084,019 citation relationships in the form of references. The set of references was incomplete for some papers present in this dataset. We extracted a component from available references information in such a way that citations of papers in our dataset can be calculated. The statistics of retrieved dataset component are given in Table 3.
                        
                     

Performance measurement normally requires the ground truth values, which are absent in case of ranking of authors. For assessing our proposed methods we evaluated the results of MuInf and MuICE with two different weighted PageRank algorithms proposed by Yan and Ding (2011). We implemented these baseline methods on selected dataset using the same parameter settings as for proposed methods to ensure impartial assessment. We will discuss the impact of the factors like the number of publications of an author, the total number of citations received by an author, the number of co-authors an author has worked with, the number of papers in which author appears as first author in the results and discussion section. For the purpose of evaluation a brief list of profiles of the top ranked authors is compiled in order to see whether they are prestigious authors or not, as in this field ground truth values are not available for purpose of comparison.

To conduct experimentation, the proposed method is tested on three different values of the damping factor ‘d’, i.e. 0.15, 0.5 and 0.85. The standard PageRank algorithm uses 0.85 as default value of the d, which means that there is 85 % chance that an individual will follow one of the links given by a page and 15% chance that he or she will open a totally new page. We tested our proposed method on d = 0.85, d = 0.5 and d = 0.15. First two values of d are based on the discussion by Maslov and Redner (2008). In the event of citations, they suggested that the most suitable choice of d is ½ i.e. 0.5 because for citations, it is more likely to follow a chain up to two links. When the value of d is lowered (as 0.15) as per analysis by Yan and Ding (2011) emphasis on co-authorship topology is reduced and citation count become more prominent.

For the purpose of comparison and evaluation, two methods are implemented as baseline: weighted PageRank with respect to the number of citations (W-PRc), and weighted PageRank with respect to the number of publications (W-PRp) (Yan & Ding, 2011). The original W-PR (Yan & Ding, 2011) considered the citation count as the weight. They calculated the total number of citations/publications of the author to be ranked, and it is divided by the total number of citations/publications in the whole network and this value is multiplied by (1 − d), the rest of the formula is the same as PageRank formula. We computed 200 iterations of each method and selected the top 25 authors ranked by each method.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

We proposed three variations of MuInf and final formula of MuICE. This section includes the comparison and discussion about proposed and baseline methods. We also include the results with respect to different values of d. The number of publications, citations and ranks of authors discussed in this section are subject to the selection of dataset. The tables are calculated with d = 0.5. The averages are rounded to the nearest decimal places in all tables. “Cit” stands for the number of citations, “Pub” denotes the number of publications, “NoCA” symbolizes the number of Co-Authors and “AFA” stands for As First Author, “Avg” represents Average or mean value and “Stdev” shows standard deviation in all tables.

As discussed in Section 3, we considered the co-authors network and calculated the influence of all pairs of co-authors in our dataset. Due to the resemblance of weights, we compared MuInfP with W-PRp and MuInfC with W-PRc. In MuInfP the publications count is considered as ranking parameter. Table 4
                            shows top 25 authors ranked by W-PRp and MuInfP. Apart from the factor of mutual influence of co-authors, MuInfP and W-PRp used similar weights in the formula. The average number of publications of top 25 authors (Table 4) by W-PRp method is 91, the average number of publications of MuInfP, is 114. Both methods have ranked the same authors on first two positions. Jiawei Han was ranked on position 3 with 150 co-authors and 152 publications, while Alberto L. Sangiovanni-V position 3 of W-PRp has moved to position 15. Luca Benini was ranked on next position with 160 co-authors and 145 publications. It is observed that not only the number of co-authors is influencing the ranking of an author, but co-authorship with a prestigious author is making a great impact as well. This observation is based on traversal of co-authors list of authors ranked by MuInfP. Philip S. Yu is present among co-authors list of Jiawei Han, Ming-Syan Chen, and Christos Faloutsos in top 25. Mahmut T. Kandemir appears among co-authors list of Luca Benini, David Blaauw, Mary Jane Irwin and Francky Catthoor. Similarly, Jiawei Han appears among co-authors list of Ming-Syan Chen. From Table 4 we noticed that Ming-Syan Chen has the least number of co-authors (42) but, amongst these 42, two researchers are substantially prominent, causing him to appear among top 25 authors. To have an insight about the strength of proposed method we calculated the standard deviation along with the mean values. We noticed that proposed method yields greater average and smaller standard deviation for number of publications, showing the strength and stability of proposed method as compared to baseline method.

In MuInfC and W-PRc used the number of citations as ranking parameter. In addition, MuInfC also involves the mutual influence based citations weights. Table 5
                            shows top 25 authors ranked by W-PRc and MuInfC. We realize that the mean of citations count of the top 25 authors of W-PRc is 2525, while the mean of citations of MuInfC is 2535. We noticed that the top 25 authors of these two approaches are coinciding, with some variation in positions. David E. Culler is ranked on top by both approaches. Rakesh Agrawal and Hector Garcia-Molina are replacing positions (2 and 3) with each other in two methods and they are co-authors of each other as well, hence they influence each other.

Hari Balakrishnan secured 4th position making Deborah Estrin and Philip S. Yu go down one position respectively, due to high influence of his greater number of citations, hence more impact of mutual citations weight as well. Analogous examples are spotted all through
Table 5. The rationale behind this patterns is that MuinfC and W-PRc are based on PageRank which is highly influenced by citations. Once again like MuInfP, MuinfC method appears to be stable as the standard deviation value for citations of this method is comparatively smaller than baseline method.

The ranking criterion of the proposed method is quite different from the existing and baseline methods and it offers a different perspective for ranking authors. Hence, MuInfFA and MuICE cannot be compared with any existing method as they incorporate entirely new features which have not been used before.

Some reservations are observed from literature regarding use of these indices to determine ranking because papers are referred for reasons which can be discrete from quality or effectiveness of a study (Kelly & Jennions, 2006; Leimu & Koricheva, 2005). Costas and Bordons (2007) emphasize that h-index is heavily subjective towards the number of publications and citations and that it cannot recognize the scholars who are very careful about choosing a journal for publication of their manuscript and who do not have high levels of productivity, but have a high level of international impact. Moreover, Bartneck and Kokkelmans (2010) and Ferrara and Romero (2013) pointed towards the effect of self-citations that can be used to manipulate h-index and simple measures like this. On the other hand, the main strength of the proposed method is that it cannot be tempered or manipulated easily, as it does not only involve the number of publications or citations. It integrates a combination of weighing parameters along with mutual influence of co-authors and exclusivity of citations. The results of MuInfFA and MuICE are shown in Table 6
                           . In MuInfFA we used the number of first author publications by an author as ranking parameter. However, the effect of link structure in PageRank and the effect of co-authors is still in the formula, with the help of which Philip S. Yu managed to gain the first position in these results as well with 11 publications as first author. A very interesting thing to note is that Jason Cong is on 2nd position with 88 publications as first author out of total 127. He was ranked on 8th position by W-PRp, and MuInfP. However, he was not among top 25 in W-PRc and MuInfC (65 in W-PRc and 45 in MuInfC). We google scholar and DBLP to verify that Jason Cong has a prestigious profile. As generally it is assumed that first author has most of the contribution. MuInfFA method can give the reward to such authors who write most of the papers as first author.

MuICE method incorporates the exclusivity of citations received by an author in a combination of MuInf methods. For this purpose, we calculated the f-index (Katsaros et al., 2009) values of authors. From Table 6, we see that average citations of the top 25 authors of MuICE method is 2008. It can be noticed that receiving a very high number of citations is not the only criteria sufficient enough to rank the authors. From Table 6, we can also notice the effect of more number of co-authors on rank of an author. For confirmation of our results, we visited profiles of the authors to identify whether they are among prestigious award winners (e.g. ACM SIGMOD E. F. Codd Innovations Award), prestigious journal's editorial board members and leading conferences program committee members in the selected research field. The profiles of authors also confirms the strength of our proposed methods.

                           Table 8
                            shows a change of position of ranks of the top 25 authors of MuICE as compared to their positions in W-PRp and W-PRc. In this table an up arrow ‘↑’ means increase in rank, a down arrow ‘↓’ represents decrease in rank, ‘’ no change in rank and * represents author's name was not in top 200 authors. This implies that ↑↑ means rank in MuICE is increased with respect to WPRc as well as WPRp, for example, researcher Jiawei Han shows ↑↑. Similarly, ↑↓ means rank in MuICE is increased with respect to WPRc and decreased with respect to WPRp for example, researcher Mahmut T. Kandemir shows this pattern. Likewise, ↑ shows rank in MuICE is increased with respect to WPRc and was not changed with respect to WPRp for example, researcher Philip S. Yu shows this pattern. Out of 25, 11 authors show increasing pattern ‘↑↑’ and none of them show complete decreasing pattern ‘↓↓’. This represents that effect of mutual influence along with criterions like number of publications, citations, first author publications and exclusivity of citation resulted in bringing forward successful authors to top, which baseline methods were not capturing. On the other hand absence of ‘↓↓’ shows that there were no such authors who were ranked among top positions but were ignored by proposed method. A mixture of increase and decrease patterns like ‘↓↑’ and ‘↑↓’ show that authors have changed positions in listing with respect to impact of their weighting factors in proposed and baseline schemes.

Empirical evaluation was performed using three different values of d, these are 0.85, 0.5 and 0.15. We establish from Figs. 3
                            and 4
                            that impact of d is present only in MuInfP. This shows that MuICE Rank is independent of value d and we can attain uniform results with any value of d. We performed 200 iterations for all proposed schemes and witnessed that the process converges more quickly with d = 0.15.


                           Figs. 3 and 4 show the results of top 25 authors. To verify that the proposed method shows persistent results for an increasing number of top authors, we have calculated the mean of citations and publications for top 15, 25, 50, 75 and 100 authors. This is shown in Figs. 5
                            and 6
                            respectively for citations and publications. These figures show that the results of proposed methods are intuitive and promising.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

This research evaluates the influence of authors when they work in collaboration. We presented three different variations of Mutual influence method. These are: (1) MuInfP, which finds the mutual influence of authors with respect to their number of publications and ranks them accordingly. (2) MuInfC, which ranks the authors after finding their mutual influence with respect to their number of citations. (3) MuInfFA, which finds the mutual influence of authors on each other by considering the number of publications in which they appeared as first authors. Afterwards, we presented MuICE method to evaluate the effect of exclusivity of citations received by authors along with mutual influence. For finding the exclusivity in citations received by an author we used f-index (Katsaros et al., 2009). The results depict the authors are substantially influenced by the work of their co-workers, especially in the case if the collaborators are senior researchers.

We computed all the methods with three different damping factors (d = 0.85, 0.5 and 0.15). For purpose of assessment, the ground truth is unavailable; thus, we computed the mean and standard deviation of publications as well as received citations of the top 25 authors for all approaches. We conclude that the proposed MuInfP method provides satisfying results when compared with baseline method W-PRp which uses the paper count as a weighting criteria. Analogously, when considering citations, results of MuInfc method are also substantial. The ranking criterion of the proposed MuICE is quite different from the existing methods and it involves a unique combination of different parameters instead of publication and citations count based weights. Hence, instead of comparing it with any existing method, we gathered the statistics of top authors of MuICE method from AMiner website and establish the fact that selected authors are the prestigious ones. These statistics make us conclude that only the number of publications or citations is not a sufficient criteria to rank authors. It is further concluded that collaboration has great impact on standing of an author and number of collaborators makes a difference. We also observed that MuICE produce the same results with all three values of the damping factor, however, the algorithm converges more quickly when damping factor is 0.15.

In the future, we are planning to extend our work to incorporate the ranking of papers, along with the impact of time dimension. We are also interested in applying this method for topic specific author ranking. The dataset must be divided into topic specific clusters before applying these methods.
