                  Prior experimental research shows that, in aggregate, decision makers acting as suppliers to a newsvendor do not set the wholesale price to maximize supplier profits. However, these deviations from optimal have rarely been examined at an individual level. In this study, presented with scenarios that differ in terms of how profit is shared between retailer and supplier, suppliers set wholesale price contracts which deviate from profit-maximization in ways that are either generous or spiteful. On an individual basis, these deviations were found to be consistent with how the profit-maximizing contract compares to the subject's idea of a fair contract. Suppliers moved nearer to self-reported ideal allocations when they indicated a high degree of concern for fairness, consistent with previously proposed fairness models, and were found to be more likely to act upon generous inclinations than spiteful ones.
               
            

Pure profit maximization is often assumed to motivate operational decision making, but community and social pressures also guide individual decision makers (Gorman & Kehr, 1992; Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1986). For example, in the “fair-trade” movement, relatively powerful retailers pay higher prices for comparable order quantities in order to more fairly allocate supply chain profits to their relatively vulnerable suppliers (Moore, 2004). Managerially, it is crucial to identify the underlying causes that would influence a decision-maker towards or away from maximum profits. A growing body of research has attempted to model individual social preferences in objective functions. (Bolton, 1991; Bolton & Ockenfels, 2000; Charness & Rabin, 2002; Cui, Raju, & Zhang, 2007; Demirag, Chen, & Li, 2010; Fehr & Schmidt, 1999; Katok, Olsen, & Pavlov, 2014; Rabin, 1993; Wu & Niederhoff, 2014). Our paper attempts to show to what extent and in what direction an individual's concept of fairness will guide deviations from profit-maximization.

But why consider fairness? Alternative utility functions and experimental work have considered risk-averse newsvendors (e.g., Eeckhoudt, Gollier, & Schlesinger, 1995; Schwietzer & Cachon, 2000) and newsvendors with reference-dependent preferences regarding stock outs and leftovers (e.g., Ho, Lim, & Cui, 2008). The newsvendor's supplier, though, faces no demand risk; and reference-dependent utility with loss-aversion cannot explain generous supplier behavior where less profit and lower allocations are intentionally chosen over higher profits or higher allocations (Koszegi & Rabin, 2006). Wu and Niederhoff (2014) address the impact of individual fairness concerns in a traditional newsvendor setting. They show analytically that suppliers may over- or under-price relative to the profit-maximizing optimal wholesale price, w
                     *, if the allocations achieved at w*
                      do not match the decision maker's ex-ante preference for profit allocations. The degree and direction to which they respond to this discrepancy—if at all—depends on the weight that the decision maker assigns to fairness concerns. They find that the supplier's fairness preferences have a stronger overall effect on the supply chain's performance than the retailer's, supporting the idea that maintaining fairness in a distribution channel “should be the supplier's first concern” (McCarthy, 1985, p. 33).

Based on the importance of the supplier, this behavioral paper further probes this fairness preference model – this time primarily from a supplier's decision perspective. In order to isolate the effects of individual fairness concerns on suppliers, our work differs from existing research in three primary ways: (i) we focus on the supplier facing a retailer with known order quantities, (ii) we pre-measure subjects and correlate individual preferences to individual results across the population, allowing maximum heterogeneity to be explored, and (iii) we automate the decisions of the human retailers in our study so there is no private information or risk of rejection. Human subjects play the role of retailers in order to motivate human-to-human fairness motivations. However, the actual decisions of the retailer subjects (order quantity) are automated to ensure consistency and remove uncertainty for the subjects acting as suppliers.

Prior experimental work in supplier price-setting has focused largely on deterministic price-sensitive demand and has analyzed the behavior based on observed results (Katok & Pavlov, 2013; Katok et al., 2014). These studies show that subjects do deviate from profit-maximization. Using a maximum likelihood estimate, Katok et al. (2014) estimate a homogenous parameter of ideal allocations (identical for all suppliers and retailers) and then use observed decisions relative to this fairness point to calculate individual disutility parameters for the retailer. Our paper builds on these studies by considering two primary suspects for sub-optimal deviation: calculation error and fairness preferences. Further, our experimental design allows for full heterogeneity of both ideal allocation and disutility weights. Individual deviations in decision making are used to test analytical models of fairness-based utility maximization. By studying personal-level biases, this paper approaches the questions of bias from the perspective of individual utility functions and analyzes the decisions relative to these measures. This focus on individual behavior through pre-and post-experimental tests about individual preferences and intentions is unique to our paper.

Additionally, prior studies (Katok & Pavlov, 2013; Katok et al., 2014) have either implied or explicitly included privately-held information about the partner's fairness motivations. As a result, a subject's decisions are as much a function of his own preferences as his beliefs about his partner's decisions. A subject with no concerns for fairness himself may deviate due to beliefs that his partner will react based on fairness or other concerns. To isolate the supplier's motivation, in this study the retailer response is known by the supplier to be automated. The supplier's task is to set a price given the retailer's response curve which includes the resulting order quantity, expected sales, and expected profits for both parties. The retailer response curve is provided directly to the decision maker, to reduce computational burden for the subjects and allow more control over treatment conditions.

Methodologically, the closest paper to ours is that of Moritz, Hill, and Donohue (2013) who look at pre-measured problem solving skills in the newsvendor problem to study how individual heterogeneity in pre-measured analytical skills relates to observed order quantity of newsvendors. We apply a similar individual focus on the price-setting supplier under the analysis of fairness concerns. To our knowledge we are the first to incorporate individual measurements of ideal fairness allocations separately from degree of concern for fairness; and then test the contract decisions against the commonly used fairness utility function.

We have chosen the newsvendor model under wholesale pricing for two main reasons: its pervasive application in practice and its structure which provides no intrinsic motivation to reduce supplier profits through either generosity, spite, or risk-aversion. Other work in supply chain coordination and pricing focuses on more sophisticated contracting models, such as the two-part or three-part tariff (Ho & Zhang, 2008; Lim & Ho, 2007), as well as revenue sharing and buy-back contracts (Katok & Wu, 2009; Niederhoff & Kouvelis, 2014). However, the ubiquitous nature of the wholesale price contract in practice makes it an important contract to understand, both in its predicted implementation and in the cause of deviations from optimal results. Further, its structure reduces the possible external motivations for deviation (through either generosity, spite, or risk-aversion) compared to the risk-sharing coordinating contracts, and thus is a natural starting point for studying individual motivations. Without demand risk, the supplier's decision is much like a dictator game; a well-studied construct in experimental economics and game theory (cf. Camerer, 2003, pp. 43–100). The supplier calculates the retailer's optimal order quantity given the distribution of demand and then makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the retailer in the form of a unit price (Lariviere & Porteus, 2001). The important distinction is that the supplier's profits are concave in wholesale price and are maximized at a price which yields positive profit to the retailer. The retailer's optimal order quantity and the expected profits of both the retailer and the system are monotonically decreasing in wholesale price. Due to the supplier's concave profit function, deviations from the supplier's profit-maximizing contract will always hurt the supplier's payoff, making generosity or spite a costly social preference to enact. The ability to both help and hurt in a dictator setting has been explored by Bardsley (2008), List (2007), and Krupka and Weber (2013). These show that the frequency of giving, neutral, or taking decisions are consistent with a utility function that incorporates social acceptability of an action. From this, one would expect to see almost no hurtful deviations from profit maximization (which hurt both parties) and very few generous deviations (which help the retailer at the supplier's loss).

The major goal of this paper is to analyze supplier decisions in setting a price to a newsvendor at an individual level. Based upon prior studies, only a subset will choose to maximize profits. This paper explores the direction and magnitude of deviations from profit-maximizing behavior – both errors and intentional – and compares the observed behavior to the predictions of fairness-based utility maximization models to better understand the part that fairness plays in the decision making process. The wholesale contract is predicted to be inefficient due to double-marginalization (Lariviere & Porteus, 2001; Spengler, 1950); this paper studies if and when those inefficiencies occur within individual decision-maker profiles.
                     
                  

Based on traditional fairness-minded utility functions and their role in the newsvendor problem (Bolton, 1991; Cui et al., 2007; Fehr & Schmidt, 1999; Katok et al. 2014; Wu & Niederhoff, 2014), the utility-maximizing result for fairness depends on two factors: the degree of concern a subject has for achieving fairness and the subject's ideal allocation. This ideal allocation is sometimes modeled using a scale factor, k,
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Note that the supplier model in Cui et al. (2007) uses γ for the supplier's scale factor and k for the retailer's scale factor. To avoid confusion with Wu and Niederhoff's (2014) use of γ as the allocation percentage, we use k here to denote the supplier's scaler.
                      which identifies the ideal scaling of profits such that πs
                      = kπr
                     
                     , or equivalently, that the retailer earns allocation πR
                     /(πs
                      + πR
                     ) = 1/(1 + k) (Cui et al., 2007; Katok et al., 2014). Alternatively, Wu and Niederhoff (2014) use a percentage allocation, γ = πR
                     /(πs
                      + πR
                     ), to indicate the ideal fairness allocation to the other player, leaving (1−
                     γ) to the supplier. Our paper elicits preferences as in Wu and Niederhoff (2014), using the percentage allocation to the supplier, denoted as Fair Allocation Ideal Reference (FAIR). All results are the same as the classic model using k = FAIR/(1
                        −FAIR).

The degree of concern the subject has for fairness is represented with disutility weights within the utility function. Traditionally, utility is modeled as a piecewise function with advantageous disutility (β) and disadvantageous disutility (α) associated with the magnitude of unfair allocations. It is important to note that the standard assumption gives 0 ≤ β ≤ α; i.e., a decision maker is more strongly influenced by disadvantageous inequality than by advantageous inequality (De Bruyn & Bolton, 2008; Fehr & Schmidt, 1999). Wu and Niederhoff (2014) use algebra to re-write the utility function as a piecewise function with spiteful (As
                     ) and generous (Ag
                     ) disutility weights, As
                      ≤ 0 ≤ Ag
                     . These weights are a simple algebraic replacement of the traditional parameters but allow more intuitive understanding of the relationship between supplier and retailer profits. Specifically,

The active preference is determined by how a given contract's allocation compares to an ideal allocation. We first report our experimental results for FAIR, Ag
                     
                     , and As
                      and then translate them to traditional parameters in the results.

In the newsvendor model the supplier's profits are increasing in w for w < w

                     *. The retailer's profits are monotonically decreasing in w (i.e.,

                      and Ag
                      values from the chosen contract, and then calculate the traditional α and β of the classic fairness utility function using the relationships in Eq. (1).

Our hypotheses come directly from Proposition 5 of Wu and Niederhoff (2014).

The study had five between-subject treatments. These five treatments differed in their underlying demand distribution for the retailer, and therefore the treatments yielded different order quantities to the supplier at any given price (see Figs. 2 and 3
                      for two of the treatments). In this way, the price which optimized the supplier's profit (calculated as (price - $5)*(order quantity)) occurred at a low price in Treatments 1 and 2, a mid-range price for Treatment 3, and high prices for Treatments 4 and 5. These resulted in differing profit allocations by treatment, which were chosen such that spiteful, generous, and profit-maximizing behaviors would manifest in supplier decision making. See Appendix A for the parameters. Suppliers set a price between manufacturing cost ($5) and an upper limit ($10); retail sales price was set at $11 per unit. Suppliers could choose prices in 50-cent increments and, therefore, had 11 possible choices.

In each treatment, there was one price (w*
                     ) which maximized the supplier's profits. In all treatments, the retailer's order quantity decreased as price increased. Expected sales were calculated as an increasing percentage of order quantity, with nearly 100 percent of inventory expected to sell as the order quantity fell to very small quantities. Treatments were designed to allow for a range of perceptions from extremely disadvantageous (treatment one (T1) earned the supplier 17 percent of system profits at w*
                     ), moderately disadvantageous (T2: 33 percent), moderately advantageous to neutral (T3: 51 percent) and advantageous (T4: 90 percent and T5: 96 percent). Key parameters are summarized in Table 1.
                     
                  

In each treatment, subjects as suppliers were informed that another subject would be assigned the role of retailer and then would be paid based on the supplier's decisions. The subject assigned the role of retailer was a real human with no active decision task. The supplier's task was to set a wholesale price based upon a menu of the retailer's order response, expected sales, and the resulting profits for each party in a single anonymous decision period (Figs. 2 and 3). Subjects were pre-screened to select only those with experience as entrepreneurs, buyers, or product line managers as suppliers. This was done to best represent true biases of experienced supply chain professionals. Retailers were assigned from general participants with no particular background. This human counterpart increased the relevance of fairness concerns for the supplier without adding negative reciprocity (fear of rejection or retaliation) or other retailer-side uncertainty to the supplier's decision.

Subjects were paid a proportion (0.1 percent) of their total earnings and had to correctly answer a question regarding the payoff structure before starting the decision screens. Marginal production costs ($5) and retail prices ($11) were fixed and identical in each treatment. Figs. 2 and 3 show two sample decision screens. The study was coded in Qualtrics.

We asked each individual subject to identify his ideal allocation: the Fair Allocation Ideal Reference (FAIR). Subjects view a contract as disadvantageous and feel spiteful if it gives them less than their FAIR or as advantageous and feel generous if the resulting allocation is more than their FAIR. Approximately half of the subjects were asked before the price-setting decision stage and the remainder were asked after the price-setting stage to avoid priming self-reported fairness with the condition or priming actions in the decision stage with their self-reported fairness. These ordering effects are discussed in Section 4.1
                  

Comparing the reported FAIR term to the treatment's allocation at w*
                     , we can begin to calculate the subject's disutility at w*
                      using the difference of (Treatment–FAIR). For example, someone indicating a FAIR of 60 percent placed in each condition would have a fairness disutility based on the discrepancy −43, −27, −9, 30, and 36 for the 17, 33, 51, 90, and 96 percent treatments respectively. Specifically, we calculate ΔF as the number of price points above (−) or below (+) the profit-maximizing price a subject must move to achieve his or her FAIR. Given the heterogeneity of FAIR values across subjects, ΔF was a nearly continuous metric across participants. Fig. 4
                     (b) shows the distribution of ΔF among our subjects as well as the frequency distribution of the reported FAIR by treatment (a). Table 2
                      summarizes descriptive statistics.

Likewise, degree of concern about fairness influences the magnitude of deviation. Two subjects may each believe that 50/50 is fair, but one is generally indifferent to achieving it while another feels very concerned about fairness. A contract that yields 90 percent to these two subjects is perceived as unfair by both with equal magnitude of discrepancy, but the degree of concern acts as a multiplier on this disutility to drive behavior. Mathematically, the latter would be more likely to deviate from the profit-maximizing wholesale price (Wu & Niederhoff, 2014). To measure this individual motivation, we asked subjects to rank their fairness and profit motivations on a 7-point Likert scale of strongly disagree to strongly agree. The six-item measure included evaluating the statements “I tried to be fair”, “I tried to maximize profits”, “Fairness is important in contracts”, “Fairness is important in general” and comparable reverse statements. The Cronbach's alpha reliability of the six-item measure (after reverse scoring the appropriate items) was 0.756. The average of these measures creates a “fairness concerns” metric, C, which ranges from one to seven. This weight will be used as an individual parameter within the regression to estimate the disutility weights of advantageous and disadvantageous allocations. There was no statistically significant difference in average fairness concerns between treatments. Female subjects reported slightly higher degrees of fairness concern (mean difference = 0.427, p < 0.05).

Additional questions made certain that participants were generally profit-seeking in a non-social context: we told each subject that they had won a prize and could choose which of three prizes to add to their total earnings: $50, $5, or $0. These values were chosen such that they should not create a significant endowment effect relative to the maximum possible supplier profits in each treatment. Several other questions checked their understanding of the payoff structure, their decision and results, the optimal result, and the roles of supplier and retailer.

Subjects were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Subjects ranged from ages 18–65 with 47.1 percent coming from the 18–29 year old age group and an average age of 36.2 years. All MTurk subjects signed up for a general business decision making study and were pre-screened for work experience across a wide range of options. Those that indicated appropriate experience from a subset of choices continued to this study as suppliers while those without were sent to the role of retailer, or to other studies related to their indicated careers, or to a general consumer behavior study. Average supplier payoff was $0.95 for a 10-minute task; average retailer payoff was $0.55. Both payoffs are average or high by MTurk standards (Mason & Watts, 2009). Table 2
 summarizes demographic details for the subjects working as suppliers while Fig. 4 shows the distribution of individual preferences.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In order to gauge their social preferences, subjects were asked to identify what they felt was a fair allocation to themselves in general. To determine if the ordering of the questions influenced pricing decisions and/or the reported FAIR values, the question of FAIR was posed prior to the decision for about half of the subjects (54.8 percent). The remaining subjects (45.2 percent) were asked after pricing decisions were made, thereby avoiding priming for fairness before the decision screens.

No significant differences in FAIR values were found within or between treatments based on the timing of the FAIR measurement (Table 3
                        ).

In a setting devoid of social bias, subjects were asked to simply choose a prize of value $0, $5, or $50 to add to their total. As expected, subjects were generally profit-seeking: 94.2 percent of subjects chose the larger prize amount. 91.3 percent of subjects correctly identified the role that they played in the study (supplier); 86.5 percent correctly identified that the retailer was a “human acting as a retailer” as opposed to a “computer labeled as a retailer”. In aggregate, 59.6 percent of subjects self-identified as having intentionally chosen a price other than that which gave them the highest profits. However, there is also evidence of human mistakes: Twelve subjects (11.5 percent) claimed to have set the profit-maximizing price but actually failed to do so, even though choosing the maximum meant simply reading across eleven profit results and choosing the highest value. Additionally, four subjects acknowledged that they did not maximize profits and, in the open-ended response regarding their decision, explicitly stated that they were confused and made mistakes (see Appendix B for more details). In a more complicated setting, human error may be a larger component of deviation both in frequency and magnitude. However, without measuring, researchers in other studies can only speculate on the subject's motivation or intention behind observed deviations.

In studying fairness versus profit motivations, these sixteen subjects are removed from the data as errors. The remaining analysis, then, is based on the 88 subjects who identified as intentionally maximizing profits and did so (N = 30; 34.1 percent), or intentionally chose not to maximize profits and worked under alternative motivations (N = 58; 65.9 percent).

When asked to recall how profits were allocated in their chosen contracts, subjects were somewhat accurate, with a mean absolute difference (|actual percentage claimed – percentage they thought they claimed |) of 14.7 percent (std dev 16.3). These errors could be due to misremembering the actual allocations or failure to translate a profit scenario into an accurate percentage (e.g., $100 to supplier, $500 to retailer should be 16.7 percent of total profits but subjects may misuse the 1:5 ratio and report 20 percent). The consistency measure between the achieved and reported values was 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0.798
                           
                        , indicating a high degree of consistency.

The majority of subjects reported a FAIR which would have resulted in either spiteful or generous motivations rather than satisfaction regarding fairness. Indeed, only 13.6 percent of subjects indicated a FAIR value which fell within one contract above or below the allocation achieved at w*
                        . Yet, in aggregate, 40.9 percent of subjects chose to set w at the w*
                         value and maximize profits. Spiteful behavior was observed far less frequently than predicted by FAIR values, indicating that subjects have a low motivation to act upon spiteful preferences which would hurt themselves as well as the retailer. Conversely, subjects frequently acted on generous motivations.


                        Table 4
                         summarizes predicted and observed behavior and Fig. 5
                         shows the overall resulting decisions compared to FAIR-achieving (diagonal line) and profit-maximizing (horizontal line) contracts in each treatment.

Hypothesis one considers how observed behavior compares with predicted behavior regarding the direction of deviation. We find that 92.3 percent of subjects that chose not to maximize profits moved in a direction consistent with their stated FAIR. Four subjects deviated from the predicted direction by acting generously despite a prediction of spiteful behavior. All were within $1 of the profit maximizing price, and in their text response, all indicated concerns consistent with creating a long-term relationships with a buyer. No subject acted spitefully when predicted to act generously.

H2:Magnitude:


                        Wu and Niederhoff (2014) show that the wholesale price should fall between profit-maximization at w*
                         and FAIR-achieving at

                         Across treatments, 85.2 percent of subjects fell within this range. Of those that were outside the range, 30.8 percent were those previously discussed subjects who acted generously despite spiteful expectations; all were within $1 of profit maximization. The remaining 69.2 percent of subjects who were out of their predicted range set the price in the predicted direction (generous or spiteful), but over-shot the 
                           
                              w
                              ¯
                           
                         value and were one (55.5 percent), two, (33.3 percent) or three (11.1 percent) price points too far. Note that, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, allocations were not calculated for the subjects.

We analyze the correlations between the subject's predicted contract (Delta_F), the degree to which they care about fairness (C), and the final chosen price (w_shift). ANCOVA analysis shows that there is a significant effect of both covariates, Delta_F and C, on the chosen price across treatments , (Delta_F: F(1,81) = 7.30, p < 0.01, C: F(1,81) = 7.96, p < 0.01). The model is significant (p < 0.001).

As discussed in Section 2, if the supplier feels generous at w*
                        , the supplier will decrease the price in the direction of the FAIR-achieving

Thus, for those that do not achieve their FAIR contract, the model predicts that the ratio of changes in supplier profit to changes in the retailer profit should be correlated to the degree of fairness concern of each subject. For those that do achieve FAIR, the final movement should be more strongly predicted by the shift necessary to achieve fairness (Delta_F) than by the degree of fairness concern (C_Directional). This is because someone that achieves their FAIR value can only be said to have a minimum absolute fairness concern to reach this point, but higher absolute values of C_Directional could also pool at this FAIR value.

Based on this utility function, we calculate the dependent variable as the negative change in supplier profit divided by the change in retailer profit, both relative to their values in the supplier's profit-maximizing contract. That is, if the supplier's profit-maximizing contract achieved (π
                        R, π
                        s)=($400, $200), but the supplier chose a generous contract earning ($491, $171), the ratio of profit differentials would be –(171−200)/(491–400) = 0.319. If this contract does not achieve FAIR, we treat the decision as solving

                        . We set the independent variable as the degree of concern, C. The regression coefficients provide a scalar by which we can interpret C to advantageous or disadvantageous disutility. Table 5

                         details the results of our regression analysis.

Model 1 considers all data. Model 2 breaks the analysis down by those that do or do not achieve their FAIR value. Model 3 considers the different effects of positive (generous) fairness perception versus negative (spiteful) perceptions. As predicted, in Models 2 and 3 fairness concerns (C_Directional) are significantly related to the direction and magnitude of profit differentials when subjects do not achieve their FAIR contract, but was not significant for those that stopped at FAIR. Conversely, Delta_F was the only significant factor for those that did achieve FAIR but was not significant in predicting the behavior of those that stopped before FAIR. In Model 3, positive (generous) fairness adjustments were more common than the negative adjustments (which were a lose–lose strategy). C_Negative was not-significant as most subjects predicted to act spitefully chose to maximize profits instead. There were no significant effects based on when the FAIR questions were asked (order). Treatment was not significant in Model 2 or 3, but was marginally significant in Model 1. This was likely due to the infrequent spiteful behavior (negative differentials) in treatments four and five compared to treatments one and two. Similar analysis found no significant effect for gender, age, or country of origin.

Combining the results of the regression coefficients and the C values, we can estimate each subject's Ag
                         or As
                         value. In distribution, we find Ag
                         has a mean of 0.42 with standard deviation 0.08; As
                         has mean −0.14 with standard deviation 0.03. Translating these back to the alpha and beta of the traditional formulation, this yields the distributions of alpha and beta as shown in Fig. 6
                        
                        . The distribution of alpha (spiteful) values is comparable to that of Katok et al. (2014) (mean 0.11, std. dev 0.08). However, where they find no generous behavior (average of zero), we find that generous behavior (beta) is significantly higher than spiteful behavior (mean 0.67, std. dev. 0.65).

The fact that we find advantageous disutility where others do not could be a result of several factors. First, our suppliers had more opportunity to exhibit generous behavior, where subjects as retailers rarely have strong advantages. Second, the heterogeneity of FAIR in our study reveals that using a homogenous value for the ideal allocation would misrepresent the motivation for many subjects. Prior work using a single homogenous allocation may have underestimated generous behavior among those with a lower true ideal allocation; or underestimated spite for those with a higher ideal allocation. Third, errors are not able to be screened out of prior studies, which makes the interpretation of intention difficult.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Within each treatment, our decision makers’ aggregate results are consistent with prior results: in treatments where the supplier could greatly benefit at the expense of the retailer and system (those with high double marginalization), the average price was set below the profit-maximizing price. This result yielded an average 42.3 percent (39.4 percent) reduction of the double marginalization penalty to the system relative to the supplier's profit-maximizing contract for the T4: 90 percent treatment (T5: 96 percent treatment) (both are statistically different from zero with p < 0.001). However, in less advantageous contracts, the difference from profit-maximizing prices was not statistically significant.

Studying these improvements at an individual level, those with strong fairness preferences for generosity (C_Directional >4.5) come closer to coordinating the contract by cutting the system's predicted profit loss from double-marginalization in half, while those with highly spiteful preferences (C_Directional < −4.5) can significantly worsen the system and reduce overall profits, as shown in Table 6. This result shows experimental support for the analytical predictions of Wu and Niederhoff (2014).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The fact that the wholesale contract does not perform exactly as prescribed by traditional profit maximization analysis is not a surprise. Prior experimental results show that, in aggregate, decision makers as suppliers do not set contracts to maximize supplier profits. While misunderstanding or poor calculations contribute to some of the errors, we show that the majority of suppliers who deviate from the optimal contract are willing to sacrifice their own profits to reach a more equitable split, in ways that are either generous or spiteful, consistent with prior modeling work incorporating individual fairness concerns. Suppliers in our study generally moved nearer to what they self-reported to be their ideal allocations, especially when they indicated a high degree of concern for fairness. These deviations, then, are predictable in both direction and magnitude and are consistent with the inequity-averse models of prior literature. Critically, this indicates that not only we can analyze what decision makers are not doing (namely, maximizing profits as an aggregate result) but we can also analyze what they are attempting to do (that is, addressing fairness concerns).

Prior literature has shown that in aggregate groups the average wholesale price is close but not equal to the predicted optimal. We find similar results in aggregate, but are more interested in the heterogeneity that is masked in the aggregate results. By understanding the underlying behavioral causes of deviations we can better predict the likely choices of a real decision maker. We find that suppliers tend to act on generous motivations more frequently than spiteful motivations. From Lariviere and Porteus (2001), we also know that most commonly-studied demand distributions result in the supplier, as first mover, earning more than 50 percent of system profits, thereby putting most suppliers in a neutral or generous mind-set. For suppliers with a higher fair allocation reference point, spite may still be a factor. Given a supplier's fairness ideal and degree of concern, we can better understand why the wholesale price contract is often set below the predicted profit-maximizing price in a typical wholesale price contract experiment (where profit-maximizing allocations are more than 50 percent) and therefore are not as inefficient as double-marginalization would predict.

Managerially, choosing not to extract the full profit from the wholesale price in order to maintain fairness can be a necessary part of long-term supply chain management. Behaviorally and anecdotally this is consistent with subjects’ social preferences for fairness and reciprocity. Our work finds these motivations are present even in a simple experimental setting in a single, anonymous interaction with only basic cues for social interaction. In practice, suppliers have long-term relationship and fairness considerations, and thus it is not surprising that the wholesale price contract would perform better than predicted by traditional profit-maximizing theory. In conditions where double marginalization has the most potential to reduce system performance to the supplier's benefit, we find that suppliers tend to act on generous preferences and the system performs better than predicted. This might indicate that wholesale price contracts could be more efficient than traditional theory would predict due to the positive effects of social influences.

The tables provided to decision makers were set such that specific allocations could be achieved. To create these allocations, we started with the decisions and results from a normal distribution with the parameters shown in Table A.1
                        . We adjusted the buyer's order quantity to the nearest whole unit and expected sales to the nearest half unit. We then adjusted the values further to create the preferred allocations for the listed price points. In this way, the demand distribution is perhaps best considered a discrete distribution with an approximately normal distribution.

Recall that the focus of our study is the supplier's response to the retailer's order pattern which is directly provided. The subjects as suppliers do not have to calculate the retailer's expected response to a price given a demand distribution; they have this provided with certainty. They also have expected sales calculated. Therefore, the technical details of the demand distribution are not necessary for the supplier's decision process.

Subjects were told that in addition to a small participation payment (0.35), they would be paid a bonus payment based upon the profits they earned in the study. They were not informed of the actual percentage. Total profits earned could range from $0 to $425 depending on decisions and treatments. Subjects earned 0.1 percent as their bonus with an average bonus paid of $0.60 – nearly double the participation payment. These values are average or high compensation for a typical 10-minute MTurk task. Prior experimental work has shown that payment scale has little effect on results and that subjects will maximize the payment medium even when it has no effect on final payment (Holt and Laury 2001; Hsee et al., 2003).

                              70–30 was what I agreed to earlier as the split

Because at maximum profit for me, there is almost no profit for the retailer, which is highly unfair.

For only a $6.50 drop in my profits, the retailer got a $44 increase in profits. That seemed like a more fair thing to do.

I chose a price fthat would give a retailer profit, as well as me. We both should benefit

I chose not to set maximum profit because both the retailer and I would not profit as much as we would like from it.

I decided it would be more fair to do a 50/50.

I figured it would make sense to have each side to profit

I just based ot on what seem to be a fair market value given the retailers pricing and the suppliers cost of securing or manufacturing.

I set the price to a good margin

I wanted to be fair

I wanted to be more fair to my retailers because if they make a lot of money of my product, the more they will promote it for me.

I wanted to get a balance so that neither party got the minimum or the maximum possible, but some reasonable amount in between

I was trying to be fair to the retailer as well, I opted for the choice that benefited us equally

In maximinzing my profits I would minimize them for the reseller... This could lead the reseller to find a comparable/competing product where they make a higher profit margin.

the other person's profit was too low

The price was set to maximize profit but to also ensure the retailer will continue to stock and sell the product.

The retailer also has to make a profit or they will find a better deal with another wholesaler.

wanted the retailer to earn enough

                              As the retailer has costs associated with buying and holding inventory, retail location, etc. I thought it fiar that he should make the majority of the profit.

Bad business, I want returns to continue, not have competition beat me out. Fair split seemed good like a good business practice to bring the retailer back to me.

I figured it will be beneficial in the long run, raise prices over time

I also wanted my customer to be successful. If they do not make enough money, then they might go to another supplier

I chose the price poin to ensure the retailer made money thus allowing me to build and retain a strong customer base.

I saw that my maximum profit seriously decreased the profit for the other person involved and as such I decided to pick a more fair price.

I thought the purchaser would not like take a contract that they did not make a significant amount of money for

I want to build a profitable relationship for the retailer. Once my product is moving in his store he will have an incentive to order more.

I wanted to be fair and to get another order.

I wanted to be fair to the seller.

I wanted to be fair, so that is why I chose the price I did. In business I wanna make as much as I can, but I want others to succeed also.

In a real life situation, the retailer would not order if you simply try to maximize your own profit as the supplier. you have to make it fair to them too.

It would create too little of a profit for the retailer which I want to keep good relations with.

To set up good relationsions with them

Wanted to keep retailer happy, too

Wished to maintain a profitable relationship between myself and retailer.

You need to have a close to fair so they dont feel like they are being ripped off and wont sell your item but you need a profit too.

                              Allows retailer greater flexibility, and thus more incentive to buy more units, with option to run a sale to move old merch.

I choose a fair price because I want to retailer to trust me and to have me be competitive enough where he does not have to look elsewhere for a different product. I want to be able to sell in the long term and have more orders sent to me. If the retailer is able to make a lot of profit the more likely they are to continue to order from me.

I chose something that would be appealing for the retailer to keep them on the buying side, but something that would also give me a nice profit too.

I took place in this study as if it were a real scenario. In this circumstance I added the way I did not so much out of fairness but in practical business sense. A happy customer is a repeat customer. My offering the retailer an equal share in the profit I gain his trust, return business, and overall customer satisfaction. In the long term lower rates on wholesale items mean more business from retailers. By taking less profit I gradually gain a greater share of the market which eventually makes outside competition impossible, thus becoming the walmart of my trade.

I tried to balance volume and profits.

I tried to pick a price that was fair for both me and the retailer. I chose this option because the cheaper I set the price the more the retailer will potentially purchase from me in the future.

I tried to set a price point that would allow for profit in my position to allow for future expansion and lower wholesale costs in the long term.

I wanted to let retailer maximize profits so he would continue ordering from me and i could sell more volume.

I wanted to maximize my money while at the same time getting a good deal for the retailer. This would secure me more work with them in the future and if my clients are strong, they will remain in business and therefore so will I.

I would rather sell more units and gain some profit for the company and hopefully gain market share at an affordable price.

If I maxed my profit then they wouldnt sell any products which means they wouldnt buy from me again which means less in the long term.

The profit was lower but the sales were better.

                              I did not quite understand the concept at the time.

I did not understand the math involved. If i understood the math better I would have maximized my profit.

I had trouble understanding what I was looking at, and was happy with the 10 percent profit for the supplies.

I just chose hieghest price. I didnt look.

It was a higher price

It was in the middle

More equal

The higher price will pay off

Because I found the chart to be quite confusing, so I did it in my head.
