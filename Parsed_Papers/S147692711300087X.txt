                  In this paper, the physical and chemical characteristics, biological structure and function of a non-specific nuclease from Yersinia enterocolitica subsp. palearctica (Y. NSN) found in our group were studied using multiple bioinformatics approaches. The results showed that Y. NSN had 283 amino acids, a weight of 30,692.5ku and a certain hydrophilic property. Y. NSN had a signal peptide, no transmembrane domains and disulphide bonds. Cleavage site in Y. NSN was between pos. 23 and 24. The prediction result of the secondary structure showed Y. NSN was a coil structure-based protein. The ratio of α-helix, β-folded and random coil were 18.73%, 16.96% and 64.31%, respectively. Active sites were pos. 124, 125, 127, 157, 165 and 169. Mg2+ binding site was pos. 157. Substrate binding sites were pos. 124, 125 and 169. The analysis of multisequencing alignment and phylogenetic tree indicated that Y. NSN shared high similarity with the nuclease from Y. enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica 8081. The enzyme activity results showed that Y. NSN was a nuclease with good thermostability.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Nuclease is a class of enzymes that can degrade DNA and/or RNA molecules by cleaving the phosphodiester bonds that link adjacent nucleotides. According to consensus criteria, nucleases can be classified into RNase, DNase, and non-specific nuclease. Non-specific nucleases can attack both DNA and RNA in the presence of Mg2+ or other bivalent cations (Li et al., 2005). Various non-specific nucleases, such as Serratia marcescens nuclease that is one of the best-studied non-specific nuclease (Friedhoff et al., 1994, 1996, 1999; Miller and Krause, 1996; Miller et al., 1994; Shlyapnikov et al., 2000, 2002), nuclease from white spot syndrome virus (Li et al., 2005), and mitochondrial EndoG that is a sugar non-specific nuclease (Schäfer et al., 2004), have been reported.

Protein structure, function and biological properties of Y. NSN are very important for its industrial applications. In biotechnology field, bioinformatics can be used as a tool to process biological data and provide answers to some biological questions. It has been playing an important role in analyzing sequences of nucleic acids and proteins, and predicting the characteristics of protein structure and function (Ouyang et al., 2009; Bai et al., 2012; Yang and Shang, 2007). Bai et al. (2012) studied the physical and chemical characteristics, signal peptide, transmembrane domain and topological structure of a novel protein TgIMP1 through bioinformatics methods. Hu et al. (2013) found that the second thermonuclease from Staphylococcus aureus (Nuc2) was a more conserved protein when compared with the first thermonuclease from S. aureus (Nuc1) by sequence alignment and phylogenetic methods.


                     Yersinia enterocolitica is a common food-borne pathogen which can cause yersiniosis in humans (Hanifian and Khani, 2012). It has been paid much attention due to the cause of intestinal infectious disease outbreak. A non-specific nuclease from Y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica (Y. NSN) has been found in our group. Therefore, in this study, bioinformatics method was used to analyze and predict protein structure and function, including hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, signal peptide, transmembrane structure, secondary structure, structure domain and the three dimensional structure. Meanwhile, the evolution relationship of the nucleases was studied by the analysis of multisequencing alignment and phylogenetic tree. Thermostability of the available nucleases was also investigated. It is the first report on the study of the characteristics of structure and function from Y. NSN using bioinformatics methods.

The gene sequence and amino acids sequence of Y. NSN were obtained from the GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The accession numbers are FR729477.2 and YP_006005337.1, respectively.

The bioinformatics web sites and software used in this study are showed in Table 1
                        . The nucleases for the analysis of multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree are shown in Table 2.

Enzyme activity was determined by the degradation degree of DNA. Approximately 2.0μl of diluted enzyme solution was incubated in 36μl DNA of calf thymus (100ng/μl) as a substrate. After incubation at 37°C for 5min, the reaction was stopped by adding 8.0μl of 6× DNA loading buffer (10mM Tris–HCl, 60mM EDTA, 40% sucrose, 0.05% bromophenol blue, pH 7.6). The reaction products were then subjected to 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. The degradation degree of nucleic acid could be visualized and calculated by staining with 0.25μg/ml ethidium bromide.

@&#RESULTS@&#


                        Y. NSN had 283 amino acids residues. The theoretical pI was 5.94. The formula and molecular weight of Y. NSN was C1357H2142N372O425S7 and 30,692.5ku, respectively. As regards amino acid composition of Y. NSN, the most abundant amino acids were Ala, Leu, Thr and Asn, with a proportion of 11.3%, 9.5%, 9.2%, 7.1%, respectively. The calculated instability index (II) was 28.56.

Protscale was used to analyze the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of Y. NSN. Ampholyte amino acids were between −0.5 and +0.5. The strongest hydrophilic amino acid and hydrophobic amino acid was Lys (−2.533) and Leu (2.522), respectively (Fig. 1
                        ).

In this study, C-max 0.215, Y-max 0.437, S-max 0.960, S-mean 0.887 and D 0.680 were obtained by the tool of SignalP. Cleavage site was between pos. 23 and 24 (Fig. 2
                        a). According to the results presented in Fig. 3
                        , Y. NSN only had one transmembrane domain (the score of the region above 600). And transmembrane helix was N-terminus inside, a 24bp sequence from 3 to 26.

The results of PredictProtein showed that Y. NSN was a coil structure-based protein. The percent of α-helix, β-folded and random coil in the secondary structure of Y. NSN was 18.73%, 16.96%, 64.31%, respectively (Fig. 4
                        ). 59.36% of the residues were exposed to more than 16% of their surface according to the predicted solvent accessibility composition. Meanwhile, it was observed that disulphide bonds did not exist in the protein sequence. PredictProtein also was used to predict structure domain of Y. NSN. The results showed there were four potential motifs named N-glycosylation site (70), protein kinase C phosphorylation site (231, 271), casein kinase II phosphorylation site (18, 34, 215) and N-myristoylation site (51, 136, 220). In addition, the function domains of Y. NSN were also analyzed by CDD. The results indicated Y. NSN had two function domains. One had a high homology with NUC superfamily (48…274), the other was Endonuclease_NS (63…263). Furthermore, the information of Y. NSN, such as active sites (pos. 124, 125, 127, 157, 165 and 169), Mg2+ binding site required for enzyme activity (pos. 157) and substrate binding sites with hydrolyzing DNA or RNA (pos. 124, 125 and 169), were also obtained through CDD (Fig. 5
                        ).

In order to study three-dimensional structure of Y. NSN, SIWSS-MODEL was used in this study. Sequence identity was 60.17%. QMEAN Z-score was −1.67 (Fig. 6
                        a). Besides, Phyre was also used to study three-dimensional structure of Y. NSN. The confidence was 100%, and the coverage was 84% (Fig. 6b).

The sequences were analyzed by DNAMAN. The multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 7
                        ) showed that all sequences shared 57.24% homology. The conservation degree could be obtained through the shading degree of amino acids. In this study, as shown in Fig. 7, all active sites were shaded (in black).

In order to study the evolution relationship of the nucleases from different species, the phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of the nuclease was constructed by MEGA 5.05. The results were presented in Fig. 8
                        . The nucleases from Y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica and Y. enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica 8081 had the high homology, and formed a branch. The nuclease from Yersinia frederiksenii ATCC 33641 was relatively close to the nuclease from Y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica. Surprisingly, although belonging to the same genus with Y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica, the nuclease from Yersinia ruckeri ATCC 29473 was located in another branch, thus indicated amino acid sequences of it were less conserved.

In order to study the nucleases’ differences among different species, enzyme activities were measured. The results (Fig. 9
                        ) showed the nuclease from Y. frederiksenii, Y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica, Y. enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica, Serria marcescens, Salmonella choleraesuis had enzyme activity. And Y. NSN had the highest enzyme activity.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Bioinformatics has been widely applied in the fields of structural biology, proteome and evolutionary biology. Due to its speed, effectiveness and low-cost, many software for the prediction of protein structure, functions and other biological characteristics, have been designed (Romano et al., 2011; Bai et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2011). In this paper, the physical and chemical characteristics, biological structures and functions of Y. NSN, such as signal peptide, transmembrane structure, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, secondary structure, three-dimensional structure, molecular phylogenetic evolution and thermostability were analyzed and predicted by bioinformatics methods.

The parameters including molecular weight, theoretical pI, amino atomic composition, estimated half-life and instability index can be calculated by the tool of ProtParam. The speculative molecular weight of Y. NSN was 30,692.5ku. The theoretical pI was 5.94. Y. NSN was rich in Ala, Leu, Thr and Asn which was the same as those nucleases presented in Table 2
                     . The instability index was 28.56. Generally, the estimated half-life of a protein in mammals, yeast and Escherichia coli were 30, >20, >10h, respectively (Fu et al., 2011; Bai et al., 2012). According to the formula, if the instability index of a protein is less than 40, it can be predicted as stable. If the value is above 40, the protein may be unstable. The instability index of Y. NSN was computed to be 28.56. Thus, Y. NSN may be stable.

Hydrophobicity plays an important role in protein folding, which can provide the evidence for the prediction of secondary structure and functional domains of protein (Bai et al., 2012). According to the law the higher the score was, the stronger the hydrophobicity was, and reversely, the lower the score was, the stronger the hydrophilicity was. Protscale output results showed the strongest hydrophilic amino acid was Lys (−2.533) (Fig. 1). There were many hydrophilic amino acids in the sequence, which indicated Y. NSN was a hydrophilic protein.

Some secreted proteins and membrane proteins have been synthesized in the form of precursor peptide, of which N-terminal contains about 15–25 amino acid sequence called signal peptide (Ouyang et al., 2009). The prediction and analysis of signal peptide are of great significance in understanding the sorting and localization of the protein. SignalP was used to predict the signal peptide of Y. NSN. In SignalP, S value is the prediction score of each amino acid in the submitted sequence. The amino acid with a high score is part of a signal peptide, while a low score is component of a mature protein (Chen et al., 2011). C value is used to predict signal peptidase cleavage site. To predict cleavage site more accurately, Y value can be calculated through S value and C value. Secretory protein is determined by D value (a mean value of S-mean and Y-max). The obtained results showed Y. NSN had a signal peptide, and the cleavage site was between pos. 23 and 24 (Fig. 2a). At the same time, we also predicted the widely studied extracellular endonuclease from S. marcescens WW4. The obtained results were analogical, except that the cleavage site of S. marcescens nuclease was between pos. 21 and 22 (Fig. 2b).

In order to understand the function and structure of protein and its action site in the cell well, it is necessary to analyze and predict the transmembrane domains. Here, we used TMPRED to predict the transmembrane domains and orientation. The TMPRED program predicts membrane domains and their orientation based on the statistical analysis of TMbase. The results showed that Y. NSN only had one transmembrane domain (Fig. 3). Transmembrane helix was N-terminus inside, a 24bp sequence from 3 to 26. The result was consistent with the prediction of signal peptide. Therefore, we could infer transmembrane helix was the signal peptide.

In order to form unique physical and chemical properties and biological activity, peptide chain of protein molecule usually folds into a relatively stable secondary structure (Ouyang et al., 2009). The information of the secondary structure is a foundation on understanding three-dimensional structure. PredictProtein is a service to analyze protein sequence, predict protein structure and function. The results showed that Y. NSN was a coil structure-based protein. 59.36% of the residues were exposed to more than 16% of their surface (Fig. 4). So, most of amino acids were exposed to the solvent interface, only few of the amino acid residues buried in the interior of Y. NSN. These results were in accordance with the work of Bai et al. (2012). The function domains of Y. NSN were analyzed by CDD. The results indicated Y. NSN had two function domains named NUC superfamily (48…274) and Endonuclease_NS (63…263) (Fig. 5).

As we all know, protein three-dimensional structure is very important to understand protein function. Many methods for analysis protein three-dimensional structure, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR have been reported (Bai et al., 2012). The principle of SIWSS-MODEL used in this study, is based on the prediction of the target protein homologous (Guex and Peitsch, 1997; Arnold et al., 2006; Schwede et al., 2003). The predicted model in this study was based on 4e3yB, a S. marcescens endonuclease. Sequence identity was 60.17%. QMEAN Z-score was −1.67 (Fig. 6a). Phyre, one of thread/fold methods, was also used in this study. The model is based on template d1g8ta, a DNA/RNA non-specific endonuclease. The confidence was 100%, and the coverage was 84% (Fig. 6b). Compared with Phyre, SIWSS-MODEL is a more general approach, but only limited to the sequences with more than 30% sequence identity to a known protein. However, Phyre overcome this shortcoming, which is more accurately to detect and model protein sequences with less than 20% sequence identity to a known protein (Lawrence and Michael, 2009). In addition, Ab initio is suitable for the prediction of small molecular proteins.

The sequences of Y. NSN had different sequence homology with those of nucleases from other species after compared with GenBank database using BLAST algorithm. The results were analyzed by DNAMAN. All sequences shared 57.24% homology. All predicted active sites were shaded, which indicated these active sites were totally conserved (Fig. 7).

The history of the evolutional development was studied by MEGA 5.05. In this method, the branch length of the phylogenetic tree represents the evolutionary distance. Evolutionary distance of the two sequences was compared with each other. Analysis of the molecular evolution indicated that Y. NSN appeared to be more closely related to Y. enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica 8081 and Y. frederiksenii ATCC 33641 (Fig. 8). The different location of Y. ruckeri ATCC 29473 and Y. NSN indicated amino acid sequences of the nuclease were less conserved.

The nuclease activities from Y. frederiksenii, Y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica, Y. enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica, Serria marcescens, Salmonella choleraesuis were observed. Y. NSN showed the highest enzyme activity (Fig. 9). The nucleases from Y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica and Y. enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica 8081 shared high similarity (Fig. 8), but they showed quite different nuclease activity. Only 17 amino acids are different between these two nucleases. Thus, we can hypothesis these different amino acids play important roles in the nuclease activity. It is a very interesting phenomenon, and gives us a hint to study active sites of Y. NSN. The nuclease from Y. frederiksenii had the close relationship with Y. NSN in genetic tree (Fig. 8), it also showed a good nuclease activity.

In conclusion, the physical and chemical characteristics, structure and function of Y. NSN were comprehensively studied by bioinformatics approaches in this work. All the obtained information will lay the initial foundation for further study on its evolution and the application in the industries.
