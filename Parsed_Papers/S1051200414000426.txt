                  A kind of weighted orthogonal constrained independent component analysis (ICA) algorithms with weighted orthogonalization for achieving this constraint is proposed recently. It has been proved in the literature that weighted orthogonal constrained ICA algorithms keep the equivariance property and have much better convergence speed, separation ability and steady state misadjustment, but the convergence is not yet analyzed in the published literature. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap. Firstly, a characterization of the stationary points corresponding to these algorithms using symmetric Minimum Distance Weighted Unitary Mapping (MDWUM) for achieving the weighted orthogonalization is obtained. Secondly, the monotonic convergence of the weighted orthogonal constrained fixed point ICA algorithms using symmetric MDWUM for convex contrast function is proved, which is further extended to nonconvex contrast functions case by adding a weighted orthogonal constraint term onto the contrast function. Together with the boundedness of contrast function, the convergence of fixed point ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint using symmetric MDWUM is implied. Simulation experiments results show that the adaptive ICA algorithms using symmetric MDWUM are better in terms of accuracy than the ones with pre-whitening, and the fixed-point ICA algorithms using symmetric MDWUM converge monotonically.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

ICA consists of recovering statistically independent but otherwise unobserved source signals from their linear mixtures without prior knowledge of the source signals and the mixing coefficients. As a hot topic in the field of signal processing, ICA has been widely applied in seismic exploration, mobile communication, speech processing, array signal processing and biomedical engineering, etc. [1].

The algorithms in ICA are derived from searching methods aiming to maximize a given contrast function that reflects a measure based on independence or non-Gaussianity of the source signals. Whitening is the prerequisite of ICA, however, there is no equivariance property in the ICA algorithms based on pre-whitened data. To solve this problem, by transforming the pre-whitening into weighted orthogonal constraint, a new definition of contrast function is proposed in [2], various weighted orthogonal constrained adaptive ICA algorithms and a weighted orthogonal constrained Fast ICA algorithm are proposed in [2–5].

In the past, a major result about the convergence of the one-unit ICA algorithms was provided in [6], where it is shown that the one-unit Fast ICA algorithms have cubic convergence for the special choice of kurtosis contrast function. In [7], Regalia and Kofidis have shown the monotonic convergence of the one-unit fixed point ICA algorithms for a larger set of contrast functions. In [8], Hao and Huper used a dynamical systems framework for the local convergence analysis of Fast ICA. For the convergence analysis of the symmetric ICA algorithms, Oja proposed a convergence analysis for the symmetric Fast ICA algorithm based on a kurtosis contrast function [9], which also appeared in [10]. Furthermore in [11], both one-unit and symmetric ICA algorithms are shown to approach the Crammer–Rao lower bound for certain scenarios. Recently, a comprehensive result on the convergence of ICA algorithms with symmetric orthogonalization was reported in [12].

The goal of this article is to contribute to the convergence analysis of the recently proposed ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint. Firstly, we introduce the weighted orthogonal constraint and the symmetric MDWUM for achieving this constraint. Secondly, a convenient characterization of stationary points of both gradient ascent and fixed point ICA algorithms with this constraint using symmetric MDWUM are provided. Then, we analyze the monotonic convergence of weighted orthogonal constrained fixed point ICA algorithm using symmetric MDWUM based on convex contrast functions, and extend it to nonconvex contrast functions case. Finally, we prove the relevant analysis results by simulation experiments.

Except for the observed signals and the statistically independent assumption of the source signals, nothing can be used in solving ICA problem. Therefore, a contrast function based on independence or non-Gaussianity of the source signals is first designed, then the maximum point of it yields the optimal separating matrix. Generally, two kinds of optimizing updates are used in ICA algorithms.

Equivariance property is a significant property of adaptive ICA algorithms, which means the evolution law of the global transfer matrix

                      is independent of the mixing matrix [3,14]. However, because of the accumulated error in pre-whitening stage, the ICA algorithms based on pre-whitened data often have no equivariance property. As a result, when the condition number of mixing matrix is bad or some source signals are weak, the separated results may be very poor. To overcome the above weakness, supposed the pre-whitening matrix is obtained, and instead of multiplying from left to observed signals

                      is the covariance matrix of observed signals. In other words, the separating matrix B is weighted orthogonal when observed signals are not pre-whitened. Based on this, a new definition of contrast is proposed by transforming the pre-whitening into the condition (8) which is called weighted orthogonal constraint.

                      weighted orthogonal matrices. In this case, the shortcoming that the accumulated error in the estimation of pre-whitening matrix degenerates the equivariance property of the ICA algorithms based on pre-whitened data will be evaded.

For this constrained optimization problem, we can use projection method to solve it [13,15–17]. That is to say, we solve the above optimization problem with an unconstrained learning first, which might be gradient ascent update or fixed-point update, then after each iteration step, the updated B is projected weighted orthogonally onto the constraint set so that it satisfies the constraint. To sum up, the ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint based on projection method are composed of the following two steps [1,3]:


                     Step 1: an unconstrained ICA learning based on classic contrast (3) or (4), ignoring the weighted orthogonal constraint.


                     Step 2: the enforcement of the weighted orthogonal constraint (8), namely, to make the updated B be weighted orthogonal.

In this section, the symmetric MDWUM is introduced first, then two important Lemmas about symmetric MDWUM are proposed and one Lemma about generalized eigne-decomposition of matrix pencil is introduced. For simplicity, from now on, we assume that 
                        m
                        =
                        n
                     .

According to the above ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint based on projection method, for achieving this constraint, we need to do weighted orthogonalization to B after the traditional update. Generally, two methods are used [12,18,19], one is Gram–Schmidt procedure based on QR factorization, which is applied to the updated B to convert its columns to weighted orthogonal vectors, the other is symmetric MDWUM, in which case, the argument is mapped to the closest weighted orthogonal matrix in both Frobenius norm and induced-2-norm sense. In other words, given Q a nonsingular square matrix, then symmetric MDWUM maps the Q to

This Lemma shows that the eigenvalue problem of regular matrix pencil is similar to one of Hermitian matrix of this matrix pencil.

On the convergence of ICA algorithm, we should analyze “which points” the algorithm converges to and “how” it converges. In this section, we will first obtain a general characterization of the stationary points of ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint using symmetric MDWUM.

A separating matrix is referred as the stationary point of ICA algorithm if the algorithm iterations starting from this point will remains at the same point, and once the algorithm reaches to one of these stationary points, it becomes “trapped” at that point. Based on this, we propose the following two Theorems, which provides the stationary point characterization of ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint using symmetric MDWUM based on gradient ascent update and fixed-point update respectively. Here, we assume that the gradient of the contrast function with respect to B exists and is of full rank over the constraint.

For the ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint using symmetric MDWUM, the convergence analysis is obstructed by the complication caused by symmetric MDWUM. In this section, we will analyze “how” this fixed-point ICA algorithm converges. First, we will concentrate on the monotonic convergence analysis based on the convex contrast functions. Then, extend it to the nonconvex contrast functions case.

Based on Theorems 1 and 2, we first propose the following Theorem which will give the solution of (10) and be useful in the proof of monotonic convergence.

To sum up, together with the boundedness of contrast functions, the monotonic convergence of the fixed-point ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint using symmetric MDWUM is implied.

The weighted orthogonality in this paper is the extension of the orthogonality (the weighted matrix is extended from unit matrix I to covariance matrix of the mixture

                        ), so, the conclusions in this paper are the extension of the conclusion in Ref. [12]. What is more, the ICA algorithms without pre-whitening using symmetric MDWUM have the equivariance property, which makes that corresponding ICA algorithms work more reliable, so the relevant convergence analysis is necessary. In addition, like in extension of monotonic convergence to nonconvex contrast functions case, our proof is much more complicated than the corresponding proof in [12], meanwhile, we will use simulation experiments to support our analysis.

In this section, we will provide 3 groups of experiments to illustrate the convergence, stability and accuracy of the ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint using symmetric MDWUM, and prove the monotonic convergence of this new ICA algorithm based on fixed-point update. In experiments, we use 4 observation sensors, the following signals and some speech signals [2–5,22–24]:

By Figs. 1, 4 and 7
                     , we can see that crosstalk error of ICA algorithms with pre-whitening are convergent gradually, so are the ICA algorithms with symmetric MDWUM, but the values of latter in the adaptive NG-ICA algorithm are smaller when the algorithm is convergent, which shows that the new adaptive NG-ICA algorithm with weighted orthogonal constraint using symmetric MDWUM is more accuracy. Meanwhile, although we do not do pre-whitening on observed signals in weighted orthogonal constrained ICA algorithms, but the convergence speed and stability of the batch algorithms are basically same to the ones based on pre-whitened data. By Figs. 2, 3, 5 and 6, we can see that using batch NG-ICA and Fast ICA algorithms with symmetric MDWUM to separate speech signals is effective. In addition, by Fig. 8
                     , we can also see that the Fast ICA algorithm with symmetric MDWUM is monotonic convergent, the mean values of kurtosis contrast functions of separated signals increases monotonic to be invariant, whose track is the same to the Fast ICA algorithm with pre-whitening.

In this paper, various analytical results related to the convergence behaviors of the ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint are presented. In particular,

1) A convenient characterization of the stationary points of the ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint using symmetric MDWUM is obtained where it is shown that a weighted orthogonal matrix

                      is the stationary point if and only if the corresponding gradient of the contrast function with respect to B is equal to

                     , multiplied from right by a symmetric matrix.

2) For convex contrast functions in the fixed-point ICA algorithm with weighted orthogonal constraint using symmetric MDWUM, the monotonic convergence of the corresponding algorithm is proved, which can be extended to nonconvex contrast function case by adding a weighted orthogonal constraint term onto the contrast function.

3) Simulation experiments results show that these new adaptive ICA algorithms using symmetric MDWUM are better in terms of accuracy than the ones with pre-whitening, and the new fixed-point ICA algorithms using symmetric MDWUM converge monotonically.

Furthermore, the global stationary point of these new ICA algorithms with weighted orthogonal constraint can be obtained by the conventional ICA optimization followed by symmetric MDWUM.
