               Abstract
               
                  In this paper, we propose fuzzy logic-based cooperative reinforcement learning for sharing knowledge among autonomous robots. The ultimate goal of this paper is to entice bio-insects towards desired goal areas using artificial robots without any human aid. To achieve this goal, we found an interaction mechanism using a specific odor source and performed simulations and experiments [1]. For efficient learning without human aid, we employ cooperative reinforcement learning in multi-agent domain. Additionally, we design a fuzzy logic-based expertise measurement system to enhance the learning ability. This structure enables the artificial robots to share knowledge while evaluating and measuring the performance of each robot. Through numerous experiments, the performance of the proposed learning algorithms is evaluated.
