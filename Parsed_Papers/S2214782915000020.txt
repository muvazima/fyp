                  Objective
                  Research has convincingly demonstrated that Internet interventions are effective for anxiety and depression and it is suggested that these interventions can reduce therapist time and thus save costs. Therefore, many Dutch mental health organizations have started to implement these treatments into their services. They usually apply the Internet interventions in combination with the face-to-face treatments, i.e. blended treatments. To date, no empirical work has examined if implementing blended treatments actually contributes to treatment effects and cost savings. The objective of this naturalistic study was to examine this issue, using routine mental health care data for patients with depression or anxiety.
               
               
                  Methods
                  All 4448 records of patients with depression or anxiety seeking help at a large mental health service between October 2009 and December 2012 were obtained. Data on GAF-index, therapist time, and therapist costs of patients who received face-to-face treatments were compared with those who received blended care, using propensity score matching.
               
               
                  Results
                  Blended care was applied in 3.6% of all patients and was given more frequently to younger patients and patients with an anxiety disorder. There were no significant differences in symptom severity at baseline between the two treatment groups, nor were there significant differences between the two groups in symptom improvement. Patients who received blended care had more treatment sessions (face-to-face plus online sessions) than patients who received standard treatment, which resulted in significantly more treatment time and higher costs.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  Findings suggest that in this sample blended care is more expensive compared to established face-to-face treatments and doesn't lead to additional benefits in terms of general functioning. This might be caused by suboptimal implementation strateges.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Anxiety and depressive disorders are common and have major consequences for the individual as well as for society (Kessler et al., 2005). Effective psychological treatments for these disorders are available. However, the impact of these treatments in reducing the global burden of disease is limited. A major reason for this is the significant gap between treatment availability and treatment demand. There is a lack of adequately trained and qualified professionals who can provide evidence-based psychological treatments (Weissman et al., 2006; Bower and Gilbody, 2005; Goldberg and Gournay, 1997; Lovell and Richards, 2000). This results in long waiting lists for psychological treatment and high caseloads for clinicians (Lovell and Richards, 2000). Many have suggested to use Internet-delivered treatments to reduce clinician time and increase access to treatment for those suffering from anxiety and depression (Hedman et al., 2014a,b; Titov, 2011; Nordgren et al., 2014). We define Internet delivered treatments as structured programs offered via the Internet which are based on evidence based therapies. Patients can work through these programs independently. It might be offered with coaching via telephone, email or face-to-face in order to keep patients motivated and to help them better understand the techniques and assignments.

Several meta-analyses support the effectiveness of such Internet-delivered treatments for common mental disorders such as depression, social phobia, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (Andersson, 2012; Andersson and Cuijpers, 2009; Andrews et al., 2010; Cuijpers et al., 2009; Richards and Richardson, 2012; Van't Hof et al., 2009) and several studies demonstrate that guided treatments lead to better outcomes compared to unguided treatments (Palmqvist et al., 2007; Richards and Richardson, 2012). The effect sizes for guided Internet interventions are substantial, and the results indicate both short term and long term benefits. Furthermore, patients adhere to, and are satisfied with the Internet treatments (Gun et al., 2011; Andrews et al., 2010). Next to these randomized controlled trials there are a number of studies available on the effects of Internet treatments in routine mental health care. They also demonstrate that Internet treatments are effective and acceptable for depression (Williams and Andrews, 2013; Hedman et al., 2014b; Hoifodt et al., 2013), general anxiety disorder (Mewton et al., 2012), mixed depression and anxiety (Newby et al., 2014), and panic disorder (Hedman et al., 2013). Furthermore, studies indicate that Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) can be more cost-effective than face-to-face treatments because Internet treatments are usually administered with limited professional support (McCrone et al., 2004; Hedman et al., 2011, 2012; Wright et al., 2005).

Because of all the advantages of Internet treatments and a strong healthcare policy from the Dutch Ministry of Health that aims to increase online treatment, Dutch mental health centers (MHCs) are interested in its implementation in routine practice. However, the therapists often voice concern about the possible negative impact on therapeutic rapport and treatment outcomes (Becker and Jensen-Doss, 2013). Therefore, rather than to offer those treatments on its own the MHCs prefer to blend them into their face-to-face treatments. This ‘blended care’ means that part of the treatment is carried out face-to-face, while other parts are delivered through online treatment sessions. The idea is that fewer face-to-face treatment sessions are necessary since patients can do part of their treatment online at home where they have unlimited access to treatment materials and exercises that might facilitate learning and retention. The face-to-face sessions however ensure that the patient will benefit from a therapeutic relation.

Unfortunately, we know little about the optimal way to blend Internet and face-to-face treatments. The Internet interventions in previous studies are mostly offered as standalone treatments (i.e. not in combination with face-to-face sessions) or as a first step in a stepped care model in which patients start with a low intensity treatment and, if needed, step up to a treatment of higher intensity (van Straten et al., 2014). We do not yet know if blended treatments are (cost-)effective in comparison to pure face-to-face treatments or pure Internet treatments when delivered routine mental health care by clinicians. Nor do we know what the optimal dosage of online and face-to-face therapy is, or which elements can best be incorporated online and which can best be incorporated in face-to-face sessions.

In this paper we evaluate for one large MHC in the Netherlands, that had implemented blended care in order to improve their service, the effects of blended care for patients with a depression or anxiety disorder. We compare the effects (GAF index) and costs (number of sessions, therapist costs) between blended and face-to-face treatments.

@&#METHODS@&#

This was an observational study in routine care using data obtained from the electronic patient records of a MHC. Annually this MHC offers mental health care to approximately 25,000 in- and outpatients for a variety of psychiatric disorders on 60 different locations in the eastern part of the Netherlands.

Predicated on economic arguments and clinical evidence, this MHC integrated blended CBT in their mental healthcare delivery with the aim to save costs and clinician time by delegating session to the Internet. In October 2009 the MHC started with adding Internet treatment to routine treatment. Four Internet programs for anxiety (panic disorder, specific phobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder) and one for depression were chosen. These programs were all based on cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) and therefore could be blended into the standard CBT face-to-face treatments.

In December 2012 we queried the electronic patient database, and retrieved records from all patients with a primary diagnosis of anxiety or depressive disorder, as determined by a trained psychologist, that started treatment from October 2009 and finished treatment before December 2012. The electronic records provide data that were routinely collected before treatment and immediately after treatment.

Patients referred to the mental health center underwent a routine face-to-face assessment, in which the diagnosis was determined based on the intake interview. They were hence allocated to either blended or face-to-face (FTF) treatment. This decision was made by the therapist in collaboration with the patient.

Patients with mild symptoms of depression or anxiety, sufficient computer literacy, sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language, who preferred a combination of Internet and FTF treatment were considered eligible for blended treatment. The MHC specified no other in- or exclusion criteria for the use of blended care.

The blended program was CBT-based and designed to facilitate treatment tailoring. The Internet-delivered treatment sessions could be offered prior, simultaneously, or after the FTF treatment, depending on the needs of the patient and preferences of the therapist.

The online part of the blended treatment consisted of four to five core modules that were based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (see Table 1
                        ). These core modules were disorder specific and could be supplemented with specific exercises such as: keeping thought records, mood diary and/or activity diary, making an anxiety hierarchy, and doing relaxation exercises. One exercise took about 45min for the patient to complete. A module consisted of multiple exercises. Patients were encouraged to complete one or two exercises of a module per week.

The online exercises involved therapist support which consisted of personalized written feedback via the online platform and motivational techniques to enhance the impact of the intervention, to ensure that patients understood the purpose of the treatment program and to ensure that patients did the exercises as prescribed. During the face-to-face sessions CBT was offered and the online activities of the patient were discussed.

The standard face-to-face treatment consisted of an intake assessment, after that, all subsequent sessions were delivered face-to-face. The type of treatment could vary depending on the preference of the therapist and patient.

There were 630 mental health professionals employed by the mental health center of which 250 (39.6%) finished training in online mental health care. Training was only available for therapists, psychologist and psychiatric nurses with an additional training in CBT. The training consisted of two 4-hour sessions with a six week time-interval. During the training clinicians learned how to navigate through the online platform and practiced with the different modules. The first groups were trained by external experts in the field of e-mental health. The later groups were trained by the previously trained therapists from the MHC, who were selected by the management from the clinical staff of the departments.

We extracted the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) index from the electronic patient file. The GAF index was rated by the clinician at the first and last face-to-face assessments. The GAF is included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and indicates overall psychological, social and occupational functioning. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning.

The electronic patient file provided also data on the following treatment process variables: direct treatment time (time in minutes the time therapists actually spent with the patient), indirect treatment time (time the therapists spent on preparation, consultation and administrative tasks), the number of treatment sessions (both online and face to face) and the hourly tariff of the mental health professionals. The costs were calculated as the sum of the total treatment time times the hourly therapist tariff.

Finally, we extracted socio-demographic and clinical information from the electronic file: age, gender, ethnicity, presence of comorbid disorders, and use of medication.

In 790 patient records (17.7%), scores on the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis, 1975) were available. The BSI is a 53-item self-report scale used to measure nine primary symptom dimensions (somatization, obsessive–compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism). We used the (available) BSI scores, measured at intake, as one of the variables to match patients in the blended group to several patients in the standard treatment group.

As this is an observational study there is a risk of selection bias when comparing the effect between the blended CBT and standard treatment groups in the absence of a matching or other bias-correcting procedure. In order to minimize selection bias in the effect estimates we matched each patient in the blended CBT group to five patients in the standard group using propensity score matching (D'Agostino, 1998). Analysis and matching were done separately for the groups of patients treated for anxiety and depressive disorders. Patients were matched on all available demographic and clinical variables as described in Table 1 as well as on the BSI scores. Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression with treatment group as the dependent variable and the matching variables as independent variables. Separate logistic regression models were used for the groups with anxiety and depressive disorders. Matching and estimation of the treatment effect was performed using the NNMATCH module (Abadie et al., 2004) in Stata SE 12 (StataCorp. 2011). Each patient in the blended CBT group was matched to the five patients in the standard CBT group whose propensity scores were closest (i.e. one-to-five nearest neighbor matching). The choice to match five patients from the standard treatment group to each patient in the blended CBT group was made because this number still allowed for good matching of blended CBT and standard treatment on baseline characteristics. The gain in statistical power as a result of matching more than five patients was only very limited, whereas increasing the number of matched standard CBT patients may introduce bias in the estimates as a result of less accurate matching.

For the outcome measures GAF index, treatment sessions, costs and treatment time an average treatment effect for the treated (ATT) was computed for the blended CBT intervention. The ATT is an estimate for the average causal effect of adding the Internet sessions to the standard face-to-face CBT. For each individual i let Y
                        1i
                         denote the outcome measure for the individual at the end of blended CBT therapy treatment and let Y
                        0i
                         denote the outcome measure for this individual after receiving face-to-face therapy only. Note that in this naturalistic study either Y
                        1i
                         or Y
                        0i
                         is observed for an individual, but not both. The Ti
                         denotes the treatment received such that Ti
                        
                        =0 if individual i received standard face-to-face therapy only and Ti
                        
                        =1 if individual i received the blended CBT intervention. The ATT is defined as:

When we look at the GAF index, the first expectation on the right-hand side can be estimated by the average GAF index in the group that received blended CBT. The second expectation on the right-hand side cannot be observed directly but can be estimated using the GAF indices in the propensity-score matched control-group. The ATT estimates the treatment effect in a group with baseline characteristics similar to the blended CBT group. The ATT was chosen rather than the average treatment effect (ATE) defined as E[Y

As total costs, total time of treatment and number of sessions were skewed we used their log-transforms in the analyses.

@&#RESULTS@&#


                        Table 2
                         shows the baseline characteristics of the patients in the full study sample (N
                        =4448) before propensity matching. The sample comprised 2006 men (45.1%) and 2442 women (54.9%), between 18 and 91years (M
                        =47.1, SD=18.7). Most patients were born in the Netherlands (N
                        =3753, 84.3%). With regard to diagnoses, 3410 participants (72.8%) of the total sample had a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of depression, and 1273 (27.2%) of an anxiety disorder.

Out of all patients, 168 (3.6%) received blended treatment offered by 45 therapists (18% of the trained therapists). The 45 therapists were mostly fully qualified psychologists (basic qualification plus two years of additional clinical training; 49.4%), psychologist with only a basic qualification (35.1%), and psychiatric nurses with additional CBT training (12.5%).

Patients treated with blended CBT were on average younger than those treated with standard treatment. In addition, the group of patients treated with blended CBT appeared to be more homogenous than the group of patients which received standard treatment in terms of their baseline GAF index (the standard deviation around the mean score was much smaller).

The propensity score matching resulted in a selection of a subsample from the face-to-face group that was similar to the blended CBT group on all variables included in the estimation of the propensity score (Table 3
                        ). We based all our analyses on this subsample.

There were no significant differences between the blended CBT group and matched standard treatment group regarding average GAF-index at the end of treatment, however both the blended and the standard treatment groups showed significant improvement in GAF-scores at the end of treatment (Table 4
                        ).

The total number of sessions was significantly higher in the blended treatment group than in the standard treatment group. This was true for depression (geometric mean of the blended CBT group=24.5 sessions, geometric mean of the matched standard treatment group=13.1 sessions, ATT (on log scale)=0.61, p
                        <0.001), as well as for anxiety (geometric mean of the blended CBT group=23.4 sessions, geometric mean of the matched standard group=12.0 sessions, ATT (on log scale)=0.66, p
                        <0.001). Patients who received blended care had an equal number of face-to-face sessions to patients who received standard care. However, patients who received blended care received on average 11.2 online sessions for anxiety, and 7.8 sessions for depression on top of the face-to-face sessions. This means that the total amount of therapist time was higher for the blended care patients than for the standard care patients (depression: geometric mean of the blended group=1198min, geometric mean of the matched standard treatment group=734, ATT (on log scale)=0.48, p
                        <0.001; anxiety: geometric mean of the blended CBT group=1106, geometric mean of the matched standard treatment group=679, ATT (on log scale)=0.48, p
                        <0.001). The increase in therapist time in the blended care group is also reflected in the costs: blended care was more expensive than standard face-to-face care (depressive disorder: geometric mean of the blended CBT group=1912 euro, geometric mean of the matched standard group=1327 euro, ATT (on log scale)=0.36, p
                        <0.001, anxiety disorder: geometric mean of the blended CBT group=1762 euro, geometric mean of the matched standard group=1153 euro, ATT (on log scale)=0.42, p
                        <0.001).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Existing evidence for the effectiveness of online treatments for depression and anxiety is strong (Andrews and Titov, 2010; Andersson, 2012; Richards and Richardson, 2012), however implementation in routine care only just started. This naturalistic study evaluated the costs and effects of blended treatment (combination of Internet treatment with face-to-face treatment) versus standard face-to-face treatment in routine care for patients with a depression or anxiety disorder. Our analyses first of all showed that the uptake of blended treatment was low, both for therapists and patients. Next to this, the treatment effects of blended care were not different to those of standard face-to-face treatments. Finally, blended treatments resulted in longer treatment durations and subsequently higher costs compared to standard face-to-face treatments in our sample, as the Internet sessions were provided on top of the face-to-face treatments.

The finding that blended care leads to more treatment time and costs is unexpected. One explanation as to why the treatment time in the blended group was higher might be that the online sessions may not have led to sufficient symptom reductions for these patients, which explains the equal amount of face-to-face sessions in both groups. An alternative explanation for this finding might be the suboptimal implementation of blended care. Previous research in the field of implementation science shows that interventions or new treatment modalities will not be effective if not implemented well (Meyers et al., 2012). Several issues are important in the implementation of new treatments.

First, the number of therapists trained. In our study 39.6% of the therapists were trained. In order to treat a substantial part of the patients via the Internet, it seems necessary to train a larger percentage of therapists, perhaps even therapist with lower qualifications. A recent review showed that the level of experience and qualifications of clinician performing Internet-based treatment was of less importance in the outcome of treatment, but that the skills needed for Internet interventions differ from skills needed in conventional treatments (Baumeister et al., 2014). The authors suggest that the training of therapists might be an important effect moderating factor. We therefore stress the importance of more extensive training sessions in which clinicians are able to master the specific skills needed for Internet treatment.

Secondly, only a minority of the trained therapists (18%) actually offered the online treatments and they offered it to only a small part of their caseload. This might indicate several things. It might well be that the clinicians in our sample were still learning how to use the tools due to insufficient training or that despite the training the therapists might not have been convinced of the advantages of blended treatment. It has been shown that clinicians are not always positive about Internet interventions (Stallard et al., 2010). They might also have encountered problems in accessing the online treatments and explaining the platform and treatments to patients. Another explanation as to what caused clinicians to hold back on blended treatment is that there might have been a confusion about the in- and exclusion criteria for blended care. It was suggested by the MHC to offer blended care only to patients with mild depressive or anxiety symptoms. However, no clear guidelines were provided on the definition of ‘mild’. It is very likely that many therapists evaluated the symptoms for most of their clients as moderate or severe. After all, it is an outpatient mental health service which patients can only access after referral by their GP.

A third important issue is the way online sessions were blended into face-to-face treatment. The MHC did not provide clear guidelines on this. It was left to the therapist to decide how many online sessions would be used, and how many face-to-face, and what to discuss in both.

In sum, the present study illustrates that integrating Internet treatments with existing mental health services is challenging and that offering these interventions in routine practice do not automatically lead to a more efficient way of using the scarce therapeutic resources. For a new intervention to be successful in routine care quality implementation is critical (Wandersman et al., 2008). The Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation (Wandersman et al., 2008) and the Quality Implementation Framework (Meyers et al., 2012) both give an overview of all the steps involved to move evidence-based interventions from research settings to everyday practice. In order to aid dissemination of a new treatment modality, in this case blended care, it is according to both frameworks necessary to create proper manuals and treatment protocols, and more importantly, to train clinicians in mastering the skills needed for the new intervention and to provide ongoing (technical) support for the clinicians executing the new treatment (Wandersman et al., 2012). With a support system in place it increases the likelihood for a new treatment to be effective in routine care.

Although there is an extensive body of literature on the importance of implementation, more research is needed that examines how to increase the likelihood of quality implementation of blended care. First, we need to strengthen the evidence base for blended treatment. Although there is strong evidence for Internet-based treatments we need to explore whether blended treatment can be added as an additional tool for clinicians in routine mental health care. We do not yet know what the optimal dosage of Internet combined with face-to-face treatments is, and which treatment elements can best be incorporated online and face-to-face. At the moment the European study e-Compared examines these issues and will provide evidence-based recommendations on how blended care can be integrated into routine healthcare and outpatient clinics.

Subsequently, research needs to focus on how Internet-delivered treatments can be implemented into routine practice while maintaining the effects found in research settings. The European study Mastermind currently examines barriers and success factors of implementation of Internet treatments on large scale in different settings. Understanding these factors is crucial for successful implementation of promising Internet treatments, such as iCBT, in routine care. Because even though the treatment effects of blended care in this study were not better compared to the effects of standard face-to-face treatment, blended care can still offer an additional service to patients as it has the benefits from both online treatments as face-to-face treatments.

The online platform provides patients unlimited access to treatment material and exercises, which allows them to practice and re-read the materials in the comfort of their own home. This could be especially appealing to patients with less time to visit the clinic. Also, Internet sessions are less costly (McCrone et al., 2004; Hedman et al., 2011, 2012; Wright et al., 2005), because non-medical costs like traveling to the clinic and taking leave from work, are eliminated. In addition, Internet sessions often require less therapist time compared to face-to-face sessions. The face-to-face sessions in the blended care are also of high importance. A study by Wilhelmsen et al. (2013) showed that some participants expressed face-to-face consultations to be absolutely necessary to participate in iCBT and that the short face-to-face sessions with a general practitioner helped increase the acceptability of iCBT. The face-to-face part of the blended treatment also ensures that patients benefit from a therapeutic relationship.

Blended care might be appealing to both patients and clinicians if indeed the blended care is implemented well and online sessions are not offered on top of face-to-face sessions.

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

As this was a naturalistic study, using routinely collected data from patients' files, we are aware of the potential selection bias associated with those patients and clinicians who performed blended care. The patients received either blended or standard care based on clinician and patient preferences. This selection is likely based on illness severity, treatment expectations, and motivational factors. In order to minimize the impact of selection bias on our conclusions we used a matching procedure to minimize the imbalance on important baseline measures between the groups. The matching resulted in groups that were comparable on all relevant factors that were measured. However, we only had data for a limited amount of factors. So although we carefully matched the samples, there may be hidden bias and residual confounding due to unassessed covariates such as levels of depression and anxiety. Another limitation is that the total sample size was large but became restricted because of the propensity analysis. Thus, the statistical power needs consideration.

With regard to severity of symptoms the GAF-index was the only available measure. The GAF-index indicates overall psychological, social and occupational functioning but does not measure the level of symptoms of depression and anxiety. Overall reliability can be good, but most studies of the GAF reliability are done in research settings and on special conditions such as prior training of clinical staff and test awareness. Studies that investigate inter-rater reliability of GAF scores in routine clinical context show that inter-rater reliability of GAF scores seems to be insufficient and is too low for assessment of change for the individual patient (Vatnaland et al., 2007; Grootenboer et al., 2009). However, the GAF index can still be used to measure change at group level (Soderberg et al., 2005; Tungstrom et al., 2005).

Another limitation of this study concerns the diagnostic process. Patient diagnosis was based on information from the intake interview and no standardized questionnaires were used to assess psychiatric disorders according to the DSM-IV criteria.

And lastly, the results of this paper are based on a small selection of data from one mental health center in the Netherlands and need to be interpreted with caution. The results may not generalize to other mental health centers in Western countries, or countries with less resources.

Despite the limitations, it is important to make use of routinely collected information that are beyond data from randomized controlled trials to observe what happens after publication of all these trials that demonstrate the (cost-)effectiveness of Internet interventions.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Existing evidence for the effectiveness of face-to-face treatments for depression and anxiety is strong; the same is true for online interventions. However, this study showed that adding Internet treatments to routine practice does not automatically lead to a more effective or efficient way of treating outpatients. By blending Internet and face-to-face treatments the effects are maintained but treatment time increases and therefore costs, as the Internet sessions were offered on top of the face-to-face sessions. Mental health services need to have stronger implementation procedures in order to achieve the positive results as demonstrated in the literature. Quality implementation does not happen naturally but requires more effort than just a short training of staff.

Awareness of clinician's attitudes and barriers to use of Internet treatments should be carefully considered in developing training and online tools. Treatment protocols and ongoing support for clinicians should be offered in order to assist implementation of these treatments and to maximize benefits. To our knowledge this is one of the first studies which examines the costs and effects of Internet interventions combined with face-to-face treatment in routine mental health care.
