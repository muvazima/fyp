                  A novel non-intrusive reduced order model (NIROM) for fluid–structure interaction (FSI) has been developed. The model is based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation method. The method is independent of the governing equations, therefore, it does not require modifications to the source code. This is the first time that a NIROM was constructed for FSI phenomena using POD and RBF interpolation method. Another novelty of this work is the first implementation of the FSI NIROM under the framework of an unstructured mesh finite element multi-phase model (Fluidity) and a combined finite-discrete element method based solid model (Y2D).
                  The capability of this new NIROM for FSI is numerically illustrated in three coupling simulations: a one-way coupling case (flow past a cylinder), a two-way coupling case (a free-falling cylinder in water) and a vortex-induced vibration of an elastic beam test case. It is shown that the FSI NIROM results in a large CPU time reduction by several orders of magnitude while the dominant details of the high fidelity model are captured.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Fluid–structure interaction is an interaction phenomena between deformable or movable solid structures with a surrounding or internal fluid flow  [1]. The FSI problem plays an important role in many scientific and engineering areas such as aerospace wings design, biology, turbomachinery and blood flow in veins and arteries. However, the computational cost for simulating the FSI problem is intensive. In this paper a new reduced order modelling method is presented to resolve complex FSI problems at a low computational cost.

Over the past decades, the reduced order modelling method has proven to be a powerful tool of reducing the dimension of large dynamic systems. Among model reduction techniques, the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is the most widely used method. POD is capable of representing large systems using a few number of optimal basis functions and it has been applied successfully to various research and engineering fields such as ocean models  [2], air pollution  [3], mesh optimization  [4], shape optimization problems  [5], porous media  [6,7], shallow water  [8–10], aerospace design  [11] and neutron/photon transport problems  [12].

In POD reduced order modelling, Galerkin projection methods are usually used to generate a reduced order model (ROM) by projecting the governing equations onto POD bases  [13]. However, the main issues in reduced order modelling are stability and non-linear inefficiency  [14–17]. Various stabilization methods have been proposed such as Petrov–Galerkin method  [2,18], calibration  [19,20], regularization  [21] and Fourier expansion  [22]. A number of non-linearity treatment methods have also been presented, including empirical interpolation method (EIM)  [23], discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM)  [17], residual DEIM (RDEIM)  [24], Petrov–Galerkin projection method [19], Gauss–Newton with approximated tensors method (GNAT)  [25] and the quadratic expansion method  [26,27].

Recently, the reduced order modelling method has been applied to fluid–structure interaction problem  [28–33]. However, those methods are dependent on the governing equations, that is, they are intrusive ROMs. The disadvantage of intrusive ROMs is that the source code describing the physical system has to be modified in order to construct the ROM. The modifications could be complex or may be impossible if the source code is unavailable (e.g. in commercial software)  [34]. To overcome this disadvantage, various non-intrusive reduced order modelling (NIROM) methods have been proposed. Xiao et al. proposed a non-intrusive ROM for the Navier–Stokes equations using the POD and Smolyak sparse grid interpolation methods  [35]. This method constructs a hyper surface that replaces the equations of reduced system. Chen et al. proposed a non-intrusive ROM based on black-box stencil interpolation method  [34]. Walton et al. proposed one for unsteady fluid flow using radial basis function (RBF) interpolation and POD  [36]. Audouze et al. proposed a two-level non-intrusive reduced order modelling approach for nonlinear parametrized time-dependent PDEs using RBF and POD  [37,38]. Xiao et al. also presented a non-intrusive reduced order method for Navier–Stokes equations using POD and RBF interpolation  [39].

This paper uses, for the first time, the non-intrusive method to derive a reduced order model for fluid–structure interaction problems using the POD and RBF methods. This has been implemented under the framework of an unstructured mesh finite element model (Fluidity) and a combined finite-discrete element solid model (Y2D). The novelty of this work lies in the use of non-intrusive method to represent solutions of fluid–structure interaction problems on reduced spaces.

In this approach, the solutions to the high fidelity model are recorded as a sequence of snapshots and a number of POD bases are generated through these snapshots that optimally represent the fluid–structure interaction problem. The RBF multi-dimensional interpolation method is then used to construct a hyper-surface that represents the FSI ROM. After obtaining the hyper-surface, the solution of the new FSI ROM at the current time levels can be calculated through inputting POD coefficients at earlier time levels into this hyper-surface. The capability of the new fluid–structure interaction reduced order model (FSI NIROM) has been assessed through three coupling test cases: a one-way coupling test case—flow past a cylinder, a two-way coupling test case—a free-falling cylinder in water and the case—vortex-induced vibration of an elastic beam. Comparisons between the high fidelity full model and the proposed FSI NIROM are made to validate the accuracy of the new FSI NIROM.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section  2 presents the governing equations of fluid–structure interaction problems; Section  3 derives the methods of constructing a non-intrusive reduced order model for fluid–structure interaction problems using the FSI NIROM method; Section  4 demonstrates the capability of the derived methodology by three numerical examples: a one-way coupling test case (flow past a cylinder), a two-way coupling test case (a free-falling cylinder in water) and a vortex-induced vibration of an elastic beam test case; Finally in Section  5, summary and conclusions are presented.

In this section, the governing equations of the fluid–structure interaction are described, which consist of governing equations for fluid dynamics and solid dynamics.

In this section, the method of constructing NIROM for FSI problems using POD–RBF is described. The essence of this method lies in how to construct a set of interpolation functions or hyper surfaces that represent the reduced FSI system using POD–RBF non-intrusive reduced order modelling method  [39]. Table 1
                      lists the variables used in the formulation below.

The POD method is used to form a set of POD basis functions from the snapshots which are the solutions to the high fidelity model recorded in time. The POD basis functions are optimal in the sense that they capture the most energy from the snapshots. This is achieved by performing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the snapshots matrix

The FSI NIROM algorithms consist of both offline and online processes and can be described as follows: 
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  


                     
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  

The FSI NIROM has been implemented under the framework of a combined finite-discrete element solid model (Y2D) and an advanced 3D unstructured mesh multi-phase fluid model (Fluidity).

The solid model, Y2D, uses a finite-strain formulation to solve the structural dynamics equations and is capable of modelling fracture network with any stiffness and shapes, vibration modes and stresses  [45–48]. It is coupled with the fluid multi-phase model Fluidity  [49] to solve the fluid and solid coupling problem.

The fluid model, Fluidity, is capable of solving the Navier–Stokes equations and accompanying field equations on unstructured 1D, 2D and 3D finite element meshes. In order to obtain more accurate and stable solution from the high fidelity full model, a

                      element pair is used in this work to accurately represent velocity and pressure changes between heterogeneous domains. The discontinuous Galerkin method is used for velocity while the continuous Galerkin method is used for pressure. One advantage of this FE pair is the mass matrix for velocity is a block diagonal matrix so that it can be trivially inverted. Another advantage is that it allows the order of the pressure to be increased to quadratic whilst maintaining Ladyzhenskaya–Babuska–Brezzi (LBB) stability  [50]. This element also has the ability to represent very accurately the balance between the pressure or free surface gradients and the Coriolis force as well as buoyancy forces.

The first case for numerical illustration of the method proposed in this paper is a one-way coupling test case: flow past a solid cylinder case. This problem domain consists of a rectangle of non-dimensional size 2.2 
                           ×
                         0.41 and the radius of the solid cylinder is 0.05.

The problem was discretized with a mesh of 20,058 nodes during the simulation time period 
                           
                              [

                         with a time step size of 
                           Δ
                           t

                           0.001
                         which ensures the Courant number is smaller than 0.5. 100 snapshots were taken from the pre-computed solutions at regularly spaced time intervals 0.04 and a number of POD bases were generated for variables 
                           
                              u

                         through these snapshots.


                        Fig. 1
                         shows the singular eigenvalues in order of decreasing magnitude. In general, the more POD bases are chosen, the more energy can be captured. In this case, as shown in Fig. 1, the singular eigenvalues decrease satisfying the Kolmogorov criterion drastically in the first 2 leading singular eigenvalues, which means the first 2 POD bases captured most energy (79.28%). This figure provides a criterion for choosing the number of POD bases.


                        Fig. 2
                         shows the velocity solutions at time instances 
                           t
                           =
                           2.0
                         and 
                           t
                           =
                           3.2
                        , as calculated using the high fidelity full model and FSI NIROM with 3, 6 and 20 POD bases. It can be seen that the FSI NIROM attains closer agreement to the full model as more POD bases are chosen. The FSI NIROM has captured 82.90%, 90.99%, 98.35% of energy in fluid dynamics using 3, 6 and 20 POD bases respectively in this example.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the error in velocity solutions predicted by the FSI NIROM using 3, 6 and 20 POD bases at time instances 2.0 and 3.2. The error in velocity solutions is decreased by 80% when the number of POD bases is increased from 3 to 20. The FSI NIROM with 20 POD bases exhibits an overall good agreement with the high fidelity full model.

To further assess the accuracy of the FSI NIROM, the velocity solution at a particular point 
                           
                              (
                              x
                              =
                              0.27543
                              ,
                              y
                              =
                              0.29336
                              )
                           
                         is displayed in Fig. 4
                        . Again shown in this figure, an increase in the number of POD bases results in improved accuracy, which is consistent with the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

The second illustrative case is a 2D free-falling case, that is, a square that falls through a vertical domain is subjected to the gravitational force. The domain has a non-dimensional size of 2.5×10 and the size of the solid square is 0.25×0.25. The number of nodes on the mesh is 93,000. The length of the simulation time period is 2.5 s. The time step is set to 0.01 s which ensures the Courant number is smaller than 0.5. 250 snapshots were recorded at each time step.


                        Fig. 5
                         shows the singular eigenvalues in order of decreasing magnitude. Fig. 6
                         shows the first 72 POD bases. It can be seen that most of flow features are captured within the first 12 leading POD bases while the small-scale flow features are represented by the 36th–72nd POD bases. The first few POD bases are capable of capturing most of the energy. In this work, 12, 36 and 72 POD bases are chosen to illustrate how to improve the accuracy of results by increasing the number of POD bases.

It can be seen that the FSI NIROM performs well using 12 POD bases, better results are obtained by increasing the number of POD bases to 72, which captured almost 99% of the total energy.

The third case is the vortex-induced vibrations of an elastic beam embedded in fluids. The computational domain is presented in Fig. 9
                         which has an elastic solid beam with a density of 100 enclosed within a rectangle computational domain. The rectangle computational domain has a non-dimensional size of 6

A slip boundary condition is applied to the top, bottom and left sides, an open boundary condition applied to the right side. The inlet velocity at the left side is set to 20. The simulation period is

                         which ensures the Courant number is smaller than 0.5.

The vortex-induced vibration problem was solved using an unstructured mesh of 28,800 nodes illustrated in Fig. 9. 100 snapshots were taken at a regularly spaced time interval 0.005. From these snapshots, a number of POD bases were generated.

                         presents the velocity solutions obtained from the high fidelity model and FSI NIROM with 6, 12 and 50 POD bases at time instances

                        . It illustrates that the solutions from FSI NIROM are in close agreement with the high fidelity full model. It can be seen from the figure that only 6 POD bases already captured the velocity profiles well. The complex flow patterns are captured very well by using a larger number of POD bases—as shown in Fig. 10(g) and (h). It is also shown that the solution of FSI NIROM is closer to that of high fidelity full model as the number of POD bases is increased. This is illustrated by Fig. 11
                         which shows the error of velocity solutions predicted by the FSI NIROM with 6, 12 and 50 POD bases at time instances

                           0.5
                        . It is evident that FSI NIROM with a larger number of POD bases exhibits less error.

                        . It is shown that the FSI NIROM with 50 POD bases is in closer agreement with the high fidelity full model. In order to investigate the difference between the high fidelity model and FSI NIROM, the pressure solutions at a particular point

                        . The figure shows that FSI NIROM with 12 and 50 POD bases exhibits a very good agreement with the high fidelity full model.

To validate the accuracy of FSI NIROM, the correlation coefficients, root mean squared error (RMSE) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of pressure solutions are provided in Fig. 14
                        . In this work, the RMSE and NRMSE are used to measure the pressure differences between the high fidelity model and NIROM at all nodes for every time level, which are calculated below:

In this section, the computational cost required for running three test cases from the high fidelity full model and FSI NIROM is provided. The simulation workstation has 12 processors and a 48 GB random-access memory (RAM). The processor used in workstation is Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5680 
                           @
                         3.33 GHz. In this work only one single processor with frequency of 3.33 GHz was used since the test cases were performed in serial. Table 2
                         shows the online CPU time (seconds) required for running the full model and FSI NIROM ROM at one time step for three test cases. It can be seen that the computational cost of FSI NIROM required for the test cases is reduced significantly by 5–6 orders of magnitude. Only interpolating the POD coefficients and projecting the POD coefficients back onto the full space are involved in the online calculation of FSI NIROM. In addition, the FSI NIROM is expected to gain more CPU savings if a finer mesh is used.

The offline CPU cost includes the time required to form the POD bases and the interpolation functions. It is found that the time for calculating the interpolation functions can be ignored. Fig. 15
                         illustrates the offline CPU time required to form the POD bases. The offline CPU time is dependent on the number of POD bases and nodes. It is seen that for a given number of nodes, the relationship between the offline CPU time and number of POD bases is linear. The offline CPU time increases with the increased number of POD bases. For a given number of nodes, the gradient of lines (representing the increased rate of CPU time when the number of POD bases increases) is 0.09 for cases 1 and 3 while 0.88 for case 2. In the three test cases, the offline CPU time required for the NIROM is 0.1%–7% of that required for the full simulation when using the maximum number of POD bases.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A POD–RBF method has been, for the first time, used to construct a non-intrusive reduced order model for the fluid–structure interactions (FSI) problem and developed under the framework of the combined finite-discrete element method based solid model (Y2D) and unstructured mesh finite element multi-phase model (Fluidity). A RBF multi-dimensional interpolation method is used to construct a set of interpolated hyper surfaces representing the reduced FSI system. Due to non-intrusiveness, the novel FSI NIROM for fluid–solid coupling modelling is independent of the original system and source code for fluid and solid simulations, therefore, it is easy to be extended to future developments and applications.

The performance of the novel FSI NIROM has been demonstrated by three test coupling cases: a one-way coupling case (flow past a cylinder), two two-way coupling cases (a free-falling cylinder in water and a vortex-induced vibration of an elastic beam case). A detailed comparison between the high fidelity model and FSI NIROM has been carried out. An accuracy assessment has also been made for the FSI NIROM. The numerical simulations show that the FSI NIROM exhibits comprehensive good agreement with the high fidelity model. The results of FSI NIROM can be improved by choosing a larger number of POD bases. A significant CPU speed-up has been obtained by the FSI NIROM method and additional speed-up can be expected as the number of nodes is increased. Future work will investigate applying this model to more complex coupling problem such as blasting and parametric cases (variable material properties).
