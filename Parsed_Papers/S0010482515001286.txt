                  This work is focused on the detailed computer simulation of the key stages involved in a shape memory alloy (SMA) osteosynthesis bone stapling procedure. To this end, a recently developed three-dimensional constitutive SMA material model was characterized from test data of three simple uniaxial-isothermal-tension experiments for powder metallurgically processed nickel-rich NiTi (PM/NiTi-P) material. The calibrated model was subsequently used under the complex, thermomechanical loading conditions involved in the surgical procedure using the body-temperature-activated PM/NiTi-P bone staple. Our aim here is to assess the immediate and post-surgical performance characteristics of the stapling operation using the material model. From this study: (1) it was found that adequate compressive forces were developed by the PM/NiTi-P bone staple, with the tendency of this force to even increase under sustained thermal loading due to the intrinsic “inverse relaxation phenomena” in the SMA material, (2) the simulation results correlated well with those from experimental measurements, (3) the body-temperature-activated PM/NiTi-P staple was proved to be clinically viable, providing a stable clamping force needed for speedy coaptation of the fractured bones, and (4) these realistic assessments crucially depend on the use of suitable and comprehensive SMA material models.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Depending on the pattern and severity of a bone fracture, different (internal/external) fixation techniques are considered for the treatment of damaged bones. This operation typically involves realignment of the fractured ends into an appropriate orientation and proximity, conducive enough to re-establish and maintain the integrity of the fractured bone pieces [1]. Adequate compression forces are then applied on the fractured segments to initiate coaptation of the fractured pieces. The procedure is expected to be minimally invasive (without causing further damages to other surrounding vital organs, especially those supplying blood to the osteotomy site). Since the rate of healing is significantly affected by the applied compression (by increasing both the size and densities of the fractured bone [2,3]), it is obviously advantageous for this applied clamping force, barring any discomfort and surgical trauma [4] to be maintained during the whole healing period.

With this intent, bone staples of different geometrical configurations (i.e., cross sectional areas, tip contours and back/base shapes, thicknesses) and material (traditional or advanced) make-up are currently accepted for carrying out bone fixation operation. For instance, there are varieties of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) bone staples (ranging from “simple” to more “sophisticated” shapes) in the market for utilization. Different studies [5–10] have highlighted some of advantages achieved from using SMAs for design of medical devices over their traditional material counterparts. Moreover, newer (also known as “next generation”) bone staples (making use of barbs, serration along the staple legs, etc.) are considered to provide a more secured compressive forces (i.e., less pull-out of the staple) along the length of the fractured pieces. A typical fracture in the third metatarsal foot bone and a U-type foot staple inserted at a fractured site are shown in 
                     Fig. 1a and b, respectively.

Due to the high degree of sensitivity attached to medical operations, it seems appropriate for such surgical procedures (involving the use of devices like bone staples), to be simulated using the right computational tool(s) before their “practical” utilization in a patient. In particular, after judicious selection of a specific size and type of staple, a systematic numerical simulation could furnish surgeons with the pertinent information needed at each critical step in the “yet-to-be-performed” surgical operation [9]. Accurate prediction of the anticipated compressive stress/force and its variation with time will help to estimate the viable activation conditions needed for the effective application of a selected SMA bone staple device, viz. its short and long term (post-surgery) performance capability.

Such investigative study will require a set of essential ingredients like: (i) an application-driven “comprehensive” SMA material model, that is sufficiently wide in scope to capture the non-linear response characteristics of the SMA material, and is also easy to calibrate from data of simple tests; (ii) the ability of such model to handle contact-interaction effects between the SMA metallic staple and the host bone tissue, and (iii) treat complex thermomechanical loading conditions involving large displacements and rotations as well as multi-axial states of stresses.

As described in the flow chart of 
                     Fig. 2, our approach here is to carry out an engineering simulation using a nonlinear finite element procedure which incorporates an SMA constitutive framework model [11] to ascertain the crucial role played by a powder metallurgically processed nickel-rich NiTi (PM/NiTi-P) SMA material on the functional performance of an SMA bone staple. Among the other schemes of activating the SMA staple [12], the staple used for our current demonstration is designed to self-generate the compression force needed for the fixation once it gets heated to the body temperature.

Our targeted goals here are to: (1) predict the anticipated compressive clamping force practically needed for the actual “physical” bone fixation operation, as well as (2) investigate the post-operative (short and long term) stability performance of the SMA staple device during its utilization. This involved (1) obtaining all the material parameters of the nonlinear model from the “simple” isothermal, uniaxial, tensile tests, and (2) applying the calibrated model to the real condition in the stapling surgery to evaluate crucial information regarding the response under complex transient (short-term response) as well as sustained (long-term response) multi-axial loading conditions. This will be further aided by the experimental validation provided by comparing the present predictions of our simulation to the test results reported by Krone et al. [13].

Different micromechanical and phenomenological SMA models have been developed to expound on the underlining mechanisms responsible for the unique characteristics observed in SMAs (see Lagoudas et al. [14] for examples of such models). The SMA material model selected for our current study is formulated using multiple inelastic mechanisms to capture the nonlinear, hysteretic, cyclic evolution responses of ordinary and high temperature SMA materials [11,15]. The model, in its scheme of implementation is made “general”, targeting applications involving medical- and engineering- SMA-based devices which are predominantly subjected to different degrees of displacements and rotations during their operation. It is designed to allow easy implementation into large scale finite element software, like as ABAQUS®standard [16]. A brief outline of this formulation is given below.

To simplify the writing of the fundamental equations underlining the general model, the language of small deformations was used. In view of its practical application, especially for investigations involving biological materials, where geometric distortion/deformation behaviors are predominantly large [17], all tensorial quantities in our generalized model are simply formulated in the rotated configuration to account for such impending effects. For instance, for the Cauchy stress tensor, one has

As the SMA material structure experiences stresses, strains, and/or transformations, the viscoelastoplastic mechanisms, b=1–6 (used in the equations below) are employed to regulate the energy stored, and/or dissipated, through the Gibbs complementary energy function, 
                        Φ
                     , and the dissipation potential, 
                        Ω
                     , respectively. In particular, the subscripts “R” and “IR” are used to denote the reversible and irreversible components of the scalar energy function,
                        Φ
                     , respectively.

                     The partitioning of the energy storage and the energy dissipation in the development of the above equations (and their subsequent evolution functions) allow the capturing of all nonlinear hysteresis loops of the stress–strain–temperature responses in both the superelastic and the pseudoplastic regimes [11]. The mechanisms, b=1–3 are devoted to regulate the energy stored, and those for b=4–6 correspondingly regulate the energy dissipated.

It is important to note that the above equations are stated only to give the general overview of the model and have been reduced for the specific application described in this paper. Consequently, the stated equations do not account for the terms originally incorporated into the model to capture the intrinsic asymmetry in tension–compression–shear response (ATC) that might be exhibited by the material. The reason for this omission is the unavailability of experimental data for the compression and shear loading cases during this study. For in-depth exposition to such mathematical equations and guidelines to the model’s utilization, readers are referred to our cited Refs. [11,15].

In summary, considering the above simplifications in the SMA model, there is a total of 23 material parameters that are needed to calibrate the present model for the PM/NiTi-P. This task will be completed in Section 3 using the experimental test data of the PM/NiTi-P material.


                     Two different engineering materials are considered here for the SMA staple-bone interaction surgical simulation procedure. In particular, the bone (considered stiffer than the staple counterpart) was assumed to be a linear, isotropic elastic material whiles the SMA staple device was modeled using the powder metallurgically processed nickel-rich NiTi (PM/NiTi-P) material. The PM/NiTi material contains pre-alloyed NiTi powder (54.6wt% Ni and 45.4wt% Ti), with two polymer additives; i.e. amide wax and a polyethylene wax (68vol%, 19vol%, 13vol%, respectively) [13,19]. From the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the phase-transformation characteristic temperatures for PM/NiTi-P alloy were M
                     
                        f
                     =−43°C, M
                     
                        s
                     =−23°C, A
                     
                        s
                     =−13°C, and A
                     
                        f
                     =29°C.

Since only small levels of stresses and strains are expected to develop in the bone, it was described using the linear elastic material model in Abaqus [16] with Young’s modulus, E=164,000MPa and Poisson’s ratio, ν=0.3. Our focus here will therefore be on calibrating the PM/NiTi-P material as described in the sequel.

Material parameterization of the constitutive model for the PM/NiTi-P was based on the results of three “simple” uniaxial–isothermal–tension experiments. The specific temperatures selected for these tests i.e., −48°C (pseudoplastic state), 13°C (transition state), and 37°C (pseudoelastic state), covered the material’s transformation temperature range. Considering the 23 material parameters alluded to above, “empirical” handbook values of the Young’s modulus of elasticity, ‘E’ and the Poisson’s ratio, ‘v’, were taken from SMA literature to describe the elastic portions of the deformation responses, hence leaving us to evaluate only 21 remaining parameters to describe the inelasticity part of the model.

Amongst these 21 remaining parameters, the values for the two rate-related parameters, i.e., exponent, ‘n’=5, and modulus, ‘μ’ =105
                        MPas were selected based on our assumption of “weak rate-dependency” of the SMA material response (see Section 3.2 for further explanation regarding this viewpoint). The key reference thresholds; ‘

The responses of SMA under sustained loading conditions involving material creep, and relaxation, have been observed experimentally for various equiatomic NiTi SMAs at temperatures higher than the Austenite finish, A
                        
                           f
                         and as well as at temperatures below the Martensite finish, M
                        
                           f
                         
                        [20,21]. In particular experimental evidence reported by Helm [20] clearly shows periods of stress relaxation under constant strain at both higher temperatures above A
                        
                           f
                         (as shown in Fig. 4a), and lower temperatures below M

                         (as shown in Fig. 4b) for the NiTi SMA alloy. At present, there appears to be lack of elaborate experimental tests pointing out the definite intrinsic factors causing such rate dependent responses in SMA materials. The generation and absorption of latent heat at such times of holding during the loading and unloading stages of the test conducted at temperatures higher than A

                         (where only stress-induced detwinning/reorientation of the martensite occurs; i.e., there is no likelihood of latent heat generation), show evidence of genuine rate-dependent effects (due to material viscosity) in the form of creep and relaxation (see 
                        Fig. 4c).

From our standpoint, since the temperature is always treated as a controlled variable in our simulations and the mechanical and/or thermal loadings are applied with moderate or slow rates, all factors which could account for high rate effects in the response of the material are unlikely. Therefore, we have opted to incorporate a degree of rate dependency (referred to here as “weak-rate-dependency”, justifying the selected values of ‘n’ and ‘μ’), particularly to imply that the model is still capable of exhibiting the important creep and relaxation phenomena alluded to above.

Under certain conditions, such time-dependent material behavior can become very relevant, especially in applications involving sustained loading, like our current bone stapling procedure. This section is therefore devoted to the prediction of the time-dependent response of the present PM/NiTi-P material, which will provide a useful insight into the long term global performance of the SMA bone staple device (as will be discussed in Section 4).

The model responses of the calibrated PM/NiTi-P material is first studied in uniaxial, strain-controlled (with a strain rate=1E−4/s), isothermal, tension tests with hold times at both temperatures higher than A
                        
                           f
                         and temperatures lower than M
                        
                           f
                        . These tests include multiple periods (of 3-h duration each) during which the strains are held constant along the loading and unloading branches of the test. The corresponding calibrated model results are depicted in Fig. 4d (with strain holding at 1%, 2%, and 3%), and Fig. 4e (with strain holding at 0.5%, 1.5%, 2.5%, and 3.5%), respectively. The calibrated model responses during the loading branches in the tests performed at T=37°C (>A
                        
                           f
                        ) and at T=−48°C (<M
                        
                           f
                        ) exhibit the “conventional” phenomena of stress relaxation; i.e., where the magnitudes of the tensile stresses decrease during the periods of constant strain. This is in conformity with the experimental evidence indicated in Fig. 4a and b alluded to above.

However, there is a significant difference in the character of the stress changes occurring during the strain-hold periods along the unloading branch of the test at high temperature (T=37°C). More specifically, an inverse-relaxation phenomenon occurs, resulting in an increase in the magnitude of the tensile stress during the hold period. This also is in good agreement with the experimental result counterpart shown in Fig. 4a.

Finally, the model simulation for stress-controlled (with stress rate=0.125MPa/s), tensile test conducted at low temperature, T=−48°C, with multiple periods of stress-holds (at stress values of 100, 150, 200, and 225MPa) shows the conventional creep phenomena resulting in an increase in the tensile strain magnitude during stress-hold periods. As can be seen be seen in Fig. 4f, the model calibrated response is qualitatively similar to the experimental results shown in Fig. 4c.

Although not shown here, further study on the case of Fig. 4d, was conducted to reach the final equilibrium hysteresis loop, using much longer strain holding periods (i.e., more than the 3h). It is worth stating that, in these latter cases, the corresponding changes in stresses after 3h hold periods were essentially negligible, thus indicating that the material has essentially attained the final steady-state/equilibrium stage. More specifically, the height of the equilibrium hysteresis loop (in stress unit), can be very accurately estimated as the difference in magnitude of stresses occurring at the end points of the strain-hold periods at loading and the corresponding unloading states in Fig. 4d (with respect to a given strain-hold value, i.e., 1%, 2% and 3% here).

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

For clarity and convenience in discussing the results of the simulated surgical operation, the presentation in this section is divided into four subsections. The first part (i.e., Section 4.1), briefly describes the selected geometry, mesh, boundary/loading conditions and contact interaction procedure. The next Section 4.2 illustrates the mechanical preloading stage of the stenting surgical procedure. In Section 4.3 we outline the thermal activation phase of the staple. Finally, we discuss the long-term variation of the clamping force under sustained thermomechanical loading in Section 4.4. As alluded to in Sections 1 and 3, the last Section 4.4, is very relevant for evaluating the post-operative effect of the utilized SMA-stapling device on the treated bone.

The staple configuration shown in 
                        Fig. 5a with the dimensional details was used for this study. This particular geometry was selected in order to validate the simulated results with that of the experimental test responses reported in Krone et al. [13] (using the same geometrical dimensions). The legs of the staple are 17.1mm long and the base/back is 9.3mm wide with a 4.4mm gap between the top of the legs. The dimensions (stated above) constitute the initial memory configuration of the staple i.e., the configuration to which the staple will try to return to once it is activated by thermal heating. The cross-section of the staple is 1.8mm×2.2mm, hence in short, the SMA staple will be referred to as 9.3mm×17.1mm, 1.8mm×2.2mm cross-section. In this figure, the specific location of element ‘C’ (in the upper region of the base) is marked, and the resulting states of stress and strain inside this element will be extracted and reported for the purpose of upcoming discussions.

The bone segment (as shown in Fig. 5b) measures 9.3mm wide (matching the width of the base of the staple), 18.0mm high, and 3.0mm deep (thickness). In our simulation here, it is assumed that all the necessary clinical steps, such as bone surface preparation, regional anesthesia of the osteotomy site and appropriate re-alignment of the fragmented bone pieces, are already established [12], hence leaving us to focus on the mechanical and thermal activation aspects of this fixation operation.

Due to symmetry in both the staple geometry and the applied loading condition (with the axis of symmetry as 2 in Fig. 5a), the simulation was reduced to a symmetric half and modeled in a two-dimensional space under condition of plane stress (justified by the out-of- plane dimension, 2.2mm, being small compared to the leg and the back dimensions of the staple). The centerlines of the staple and bone segment were fixed horizontally for the symmetric boundary conditions. A mesh convergence study was performed for the staple and the bone with respect to the predicted results of the displacement at the top part of staple leg and the effective stress magnitude developed in both the staple and bone segment. Based on this convergence study, the finalized meshed model utilized 844 and 1760 four-noded bilinear plane stress (CPS4 in ABAQUS) elements for the staple and bone geometry, respectively.

To model the subsequent contact interaction between the bone surface and the staple (i.e., at the thermal activation stage), a soft, frictionless, surface-to-surface contact with the exponential overclosure function was set up between the outside of the bone and the inner side of the staple leg (i.e., N1–M1 and N2–M2 faces of the bone and staple, respectively), as shown in Fig. 5c.

All the mechanical (as well as the subsequent thermal) steps will be described in reference to marked roman numerals (i)–(vi) in the resulting figures; i.e., 
                        
                        
                        
                        Figs. 6–9 and 12. The initial, load-free state (i), corresponds to the condition of the bone staple specimen at the original, undeformed, memory configuration (at −48°C<M
                        
                           f
                         where the crystallographic structure of the SMA material is dominantly made of the twinned martensite variants). Making use of the soft material (pseudoplastic) response of the PM/NiTi-P at such lower (−48°C) temperature, the bone staple is easily deformed to open the legs (i.e., state (ii)) by applying a uniformly distributed pressure loading of 1MPa intensity, acting perpendicularly on the inside surface of the staple legs (i.e., N2-M2 in Fig. 5c) at a rate of 6.25×10−4
                        MPa/s. At the same temperature of −48°C, the initial force applied to open the staple is removed; i.e., state (iii), by releasing the reaction forces developed during the previous deformation step, at an unloading rate of 6.25×10-4
                        MPa/s. As a result of the force release, a small “elastic” rebound/spring back of the deformed staple occurs leading to the final opened configuration of the staple shown in part (iii) of Fig. 6. By the end of the last two steps; i.e., (ii) and (iii), most of the variants within the material would have been reoriented to align with the axis of loading (i.e., at the detwinned martensite state).

Note that the magnitude of the applied pressure load was selected to ensure that the final width at the top part of the SMA bone staple after the rebound will be greater than the width of the targeted fractured bone. Our decision to deform the staple at the martensite state (instead of deforming it at the austenite state) was guided by the experimental test results shown in Fig. 3, as well as the recent rise in the use of this methodology for deforming SMA medical devices before their subsequent deployment into the human body [10] in comparison to other possible alternative ways [12].

When the PM/NiTi-P bone staple was initially deformed at psuedoplastic state (i.e., −48°C<M
                        
                           f
                        ) which corresponds to state (ii) in the figures, the staple base bent easily allowing the staple legs to separate, thus producing bending stresses in the cross-section of the staple base. As can be seen in state (ii) of Fig. 7, a tensile stress (component 1-1) of 190MPa was developed in the element ‘C’ at the end of applying the 1 MPa pressure loading. Upon releasing the applied surface pressure at temperature of −48°C, small amount of rebound (as shown by the reduction of the logarithmic strain from state (ii) to (iii) in Fig. 8) occurs in the deformed staple; i.e., corresponding to mechanical path (ii)–(iii) in Figs. 6 and 7. Here, the staple was not able to recover its initial shape because of the pseudoplastic behavior that the PM/NiTi-P exhibits at the martensite state (note the significant value of residual strain and stress at state (iii) in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively). The bone staple is delivered to the surgeon in this cold state which ensures that the deformed configuration of the staple is maintained until it later comes into contact and gets heated to the human body temperature.

In summary, the above series of steps for the mechanical deformation led to (a) using relatively lesser magnitude of force (i.e., about 4 times less than the case of deforming at the austenite state) to open the staple device, as well as (b) maintaining the deformed shape (due to the pseudoplastic property of the SMA material at the martensite state) even after the applied forces were removed, thus keeping the opening of the staple constant until thermal activation.

Subsequently, after the staple (from state (iii)) is carefully inserted into the specific osteotomy site of the body (see stage (iv)), it gradually gets self-heated from −48°C to the higher human body temperature (over a period of 100s, using a heating temperature rate of 0.85°C/s here). This causes the staple material to undergo a martensite→austenite phase transformation, demonstrating a period of the well-known one way shape memory effect (OWSME) occurring (a) initially freely under zero load with the progression of heating (from −48°C till the staple establishes contact with the bone at −11.67°C), followed by (b) the constrained recovery period (occurring between the −11.67°C and 37°C body temperature). The succeeding path (iv)–(v) describes the response of the SMA staple over a period of time after it had established first contact with the bone (i.e., state (iv)); i.e., during the time of heating to the 37°C body temperature. This particular period of constrained recovery leads to the development of increasing compressive contact forces as the staple gets more adjusted to the higher body temperature of 37°C.

To accurately evaluate the immediate and post-surgical response of the clamping force, the above described simulation (termed here as “actual” case) procedure was assessed against the results of a separate reference analysis case in which the staple was allowed to freely recover its shape without coming into contact with the bone. Following the similar description pattern used for the above “actual” simulation case in Fig. 6, the reference (unobstructed recovery) scenario corresponds to the paths (i)–(ii)–(iii)–(v′), i.e., with the difference between the actual and the reference cases occurring only after stage (iii).

Here, it is seen that once the SMA staple device established contact with the bone (during the period of heating to 37°C), significant amount of stress (~295MPa at state (v)) was developed in the SMA bone staple as shown for the element ‘C’ in Figs. 7 and 9. In particular, comparing the stress values generated from the two cases, it is evident that a meaningful contact force (corresponding to the ~295MPa stress) is developed from the “actual” simulation case (in comparison to the ~0MPa stress resulting from the reference case scenario).

Moreover, restraining the staple from recovering its initial memory configured shape (due to its contact with the bone) is also demonstrated by the nearly constant and significant value of strain at element ‘C’ (1.68–1.54%) along the path (iv)–(v) as opposed to the much bigger strain decrease from 1.68% to nearly zero value along the path (iv)–(v′) in the free OWSME reference case (see Figs. 7 and 8.) From the temperature-vs-strain/stress response curves in Figs. 8 and 9 respectively, the staple (as heated to the body temperature) comes into contact with bone at a temperature of −11.67°C, corresponding to a time of 42.74s out of the total 100s heating period.

The variation of the contact stresses along the height of the bone surface (that comes in contact with the staple) developed in the bone during the heating of the SMA staple to clamp the fractured bone segment was extracted at different temperature stations; i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 37°C. As can be seen in Fig. 10, the contact stresses (measured here as the normal (1-1) component stresses) increased and the corresponding peaks of the stress distribution along the height of the bone moved towards the middle region of the bone segment, which translates into the compressive clamping force, while the staple is heated from the −48°C to the 37°C. From the experiment performed by Krone et al. [13], a clamping/contact force of 33.1±1N was found to be generated at 25°C. In order to compare our result to this experimental value, the normal stress distribution along the height of the bone at 25°C (see 
                        Fig. 10) was integrated over the area of the contact region in the bone segment, and it resulted in a value of 36.7N at this particular temperature (i.e., 25°C). Relatively, this is in a good agreement with the experimental value reported by Krone et al. [13]. 
                        Table 2 shows the values of the clamping forces developed at the above stated temperatures during the heating step.


                        
                        Fig. 11 shows the distribution of the normal stresses generated in both the SMA staple and the bone segment at selected temperatures of 10°C, 15°C, 25°C, and 37°C during the period of heating. Evidently, the base of the staple experienced the majority of the bending stresses as the staple material (PM/NiTi-P) transformed from the martensite to the austenite phase. As illustrated by the legends of the stress distribution, the base of the bone staple clearly shows the effect of bending. The range of the tensile and compressive normal stresses increased with increasing in temperature from 10°C to 37°C, i.e., during heating of the bone staple. At 37°C, the normal stresses in the base of the staple ranged from +330MPa (thus tensile) to −300MPa (thus compressive) in the height of the base of the staple. During this heating period, the region of stress concentration in the bone region was growing and moving downward as the staple gets heated to the body temperature (37°C) and the final stress state settles about halfway up the height of the bone, with the development of approximately −10MPa (compressive) normal stress in the bone.

The above described scheme of staple activation (in comparison to other modes) appears to be clinically efficient since it requires lesser number of human interferences. More importantly, the operation occurs at the exact “natural” temperature of the body, hence no need for an additional controllable-temperature device to ensure that the thermal heating does not go beyond the 60°C temperature limit [23] above which there is likelihood of bone cell damage.

Furthermore, to study the post-operative (long-term) performance of the SMA bone staple device, an extended analysis was performed for a waiting period of 24h to observe the nature of the changes (if any) in the clamping force as the staple remains in contact with the bone during the patient’s healing period. This required us to observe the state of the normal stress in staple and the contact stress in the bone segment over the 24h period of time (path (v)–(vi) in schematics of Fig. 6).

Here, the normal stress was plotted at the element “C” for the holding period of 24h after the staple had established initial contact with the bone at the 37°C body temperature (i.e., state (v) in Figs. 7 and 9). As shown along path (v)–(vi) in 
                        Fig. 12, it is observed that the stress tends to grow higher from the 295MPa at state (v) to 325MPa after 6h and finally to 327MPa at state (vi) after 24h. The clamping force provided by the staple at state (v), i.e., at the beginning of 24h waiting period was 56.6N; however, at the end of this waiting period, it increased to 64.2N (as stated in Table 2). Similarly, the maximum value of the contact stress in the bone increased from 9.6MPa to 10.1MPa during this waiting period. The pattern of variation in the contact force developed in the SMA staple device during this waiting period is qualitatively similar to that of the experimental response (conducted for a period of 0.5h) reported by Russell [12].

The tendency of the dynamic force produced by the SMA staple to increase under the sustained body temperature is due to the intrinsic rate property of the SMA material referred to as the inverse relaxation as described in Section 3.2. This provides a beneficial clinical outcome in the sense that the body temperature-activated-SMA staple will provide further self-retightening of the bone staple even after the operation, hence eliminating the need for frequent visits to the hospital for post-operative tightening of the staple device, as would have been done for the case of conventional staples.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A systematic investigation was carried out using an SMA material model developed by Saleeb et al. [11] to predict the immediate- and post-surgical interaction effects of an SMA bone staple on the treatment of a fractured bone. For this demonstration, we utilized the body temperature activation scheme for the bone staple made of a powder metallurgically processed NiTi (PM/NiTi-P) SMA material. Test data from three “simple” uniaxial–isothermal–tension experiments were used to calibrate the SMA model which in turn was used in the overall simulation of the complex, thermomechanical loading conditions involved in the surgical procedure.

From the results of this study, the following conclusions can be made:
                        
                           (a)
                           Despite the simplicity of the test data used in its calibration, the present SMA material model has been able to handle the rather complex conditions involved in simulating the stapling procedure to mimic the actual operational environment.

The compressive force generated from the staple upon its immediate contact with the bone (i.e., during surgery) as evaluated from the numerical simulation compared well with that measured experimentally by Krone et al. [13].

Considering the post-surgical performance of the staple, the clamping force exhibited a favorable pattern of an actively dynamic compressive force having the tendency to steadily increase with the hold time. This predicted increase in the clamping force, with its important implication for speedy healing, also compares very well with the experimental test results reported by Russell [12].

The results in part (b) above were connected to a rather unique set of intrinsic SMA response characteristics referred to as the inverse relaxation phenomena. In this, the rate dependency of the material under sustained loading was found to play a major role.

Applying the present SMA constitutive model for the stapling surgical procedure has provided important information which could only have been obtained from a rather expensive (in time and cost) and often difficult set of physical experiments. This indicates the great potential of utilizing such material models as a tool to ultimately optimize the procedural controls and clinical forces of other SMA medical devices.

These realistic assessments of the clinical performance of the SMA staple crucially depend on the use of mathematical SMA material models that are sufficiently accurate and comprehensive in scope to capture the experimentally-observed behavior; i.e., to simultaneously capture the three important characteristics of superelasticity, shape memory effect, and inverse-relaxation due to the time-dependent nature of the material response.
