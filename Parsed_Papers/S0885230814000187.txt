                  This paper outlines a comprehensive system for automatically generating a phonetic transcription of a given Arabic text which closely matches the pronunciation of the speakers. The presented system is based on a set of (language-dependent) pronunciation rules that works on converting fully diacriticised Arabic text into the actual sounds, along with a lexicon for exceptional words. This is a two-phase process: one-to-one grapheme to phoneme conversion and then phoneme-to-allophone conversion using a set of “phonological rules”. Phonological rules operate on the phonemes and convert them to the actual sounds considering the neighbouring phones or the containing syllable or word. This system is developed for the purpose of delivering a robust Automatic Arabic Speech Recognition (AASR) system which is able to handle speech variation resulting from the mismatch between the text and the pronunciation. We anticipate that it could also be used for producing natural sounding speech from an Arabic text-to-speech (ATTS) system as well, but we have not extensively tested it in this application.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Arabic is the most common Semitic language in terms of the number of native speakers (Lewis, 2009). There are two main forms of Arabic used at the present time: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is used in formal writing and speech (e.g. education, newspapers, broadcast news, etc.) and is considered to be the official language in all Arabic speaking countries. In contrast, people generally speak in their own dialects in daily communication. These dialects are neither taught in schools nor even have any organised written form. Arabic dialects differ substantially from MSA in terms of phonology, morphology, vocabulary, and syntax.

With the increasing role of the computer in today's society, there is an ever growing desire to develop robust ASR systems to communicate with computers in a more natural way. In ASR systems, the lexicon is the main source for finding the pronunciation of the words. Providing a comprehensive pronunciation lexicon for Arabic requires a huge amount of memory and lots of effort to cover the enormous number of word forms generated due to the richness of Arabic morphology. Furthermore, the “correct” pronunciation of the word which can be found in the lexicon is not always the real pronunciation, especially in continuous speech and with languages. Deriving a phonetic transcription from a given Arabic text is made worse by the problem of the boundary effects on pronunciation and the influence of the regional dialect when speaking in MSA.
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        We will refer below to the systematic variations in pronunciatiom that arise from the influence of regional dialects as ‘accents’.
                      This variation may result in a mismatch between the speech and the text used in modelling the ASR system. Mismatch between the text and the pronunciation is one of the main issues encountered by ASR researchers, as they confirm that the pronunciation variation has the greatest influence in the system's performance when compared with the other factors (McAllaster et al., 1998; Fosler-Lussier et al., 1999). Therefore, modelling pronunciation variation during recognition in order to predict the phonetic realisation of the input speech is essential to enhance recognition performance (Slobada and Waibel, 1996; Saraclar et al., 2000).

The current study aims to develop a comprehensive system for grapheme-to-allophone conversion of MSA. The motivation behind developing this system is to map the written text onto phonetic content that can be used in designing the acoustic model of the Arabic ASR system and therefore to enhance the quality of the recogniser and to reduce the Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words.

This paper is divided into four sections. Section 1 gives a brief overview of the Arabic phonetic system, followed by laying out the theoretical dimensions of the pronunciation modelling approaches and reviewing the related works in the literature. Section 2 describes the design of the developed grapheme-to-allophone system. The developed system is assessed in Section 3 of this paper. Finally, the last section reflects on what has been discussed throughout the paper and gives suggestions for future work.

The Arabic alphabet consists of 29 letters, 26 of which are consonants. The remaining three letters represent the long vowels (the phonemes /i:/, /a:/, /u:/). Arabic is written in script from right to left. Each letter in the alphabet can appear in up to four different shapes, depending on its location in the word. For example the letter ‘h’ 
                           
                         can appear in the following shapes (
                           
                        ).

The Arabic writing system has available nine optional orthographic symbols (diacritics) that normally appear above or between the letters (three short vowels 
                           
                        , dagger Alif 
                           
                        , three nunation diacritics 
                           
                        , gemination diacritic 
                           
                        , and sukun 
                           
                        ). These diacritics are extremely helpful for the readability and understanding of the text. Diacritics, however, are mainly restricted to religious texts and language learning textbooks, and are absent in most other texts.

The correspondence between the spellings and the pronunciation of the lexical items, when all the diacritics are included, is deterministic, unlike for example English or French. However, transcribing Arabic texts does not just involve converting the graphemes into phonemes but also converting them to phones that represent the actual sound of the language. This task is done partly by analysing the boundary effects on pronunciation. The issue here is that the local context can have considerable impact on what a phoneme sounds like. This can have substantial consequences for speech recognisers, since it means that the phonetic transcription which is required for any speech recogniser needs to be sensitive to the local context.


                        Table 1
                         illustrates how the acoustic realisation of the word varies depending on its position in the context. The table provides the result of generating the phonetic transcription of the preposition ‘min’
                           2
                        
                        
                           2
                           Throughout the paper we used Buckwalter transliteration scheme, italicised and single-quoted, in the examples to present Arabic script, and IPA when transcribing actual speech sounds (between two slashes for the phonemic representation or two square brackets for the phonetic representation). We use the ASCII-friendly SAMPA presentation of the IPA in rules
                         
                        
                           
                         “from” when occurring in different phonetic context. This process is called nasal assimilation and will be discussed fully later.

Modelling the pronunciation variation is a crucial step in any ASR system. Such models can help to improve the performance by shrinking the mismatch between the speech and the text used in training the acoustic model. There are two main methods used in the literature in modelling the pronunciation variation (Amdal and Fosler-Lussier, 2003; Wester and Fosler-Lussier, 2000):
                           
                              •
                              Knowledge-based approach, which uses phonetic and linguistic knowledge to write phonological rules that can generate variants in pronunciation.

Data-driven approach, which uses a corpus of real speech to derive the variation in speech.

Each method has its advantages and disadvantages and choosing which method to use depends mainly on the type of variation that needs to be specified and the purpose of modelling this variation (Strik and Cucchiarini, 1998).

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

There are a number of studies that are interested in modelling the pronunciation variation in Arabic. For instance, El-Imam has investigated transcribing standard Arabic written text into sounds (El-Imam, 2004). The aim of this study is to formalise the pronunciation rules of standard Arabic into a framework that can be used by researchers to develop computer-based implementations. These hand-constructed rules were assessed by testing them on a set of examples to see if they match the researcher's expectations. However, the developed rules were not validated in terms of their existence in real speech.

In the domain of Arabic ASR, many researchers have realised that modelling the pronunciation variation can enhance the performance of the ASR systems. They have proposed different approaches, of which the classical approach involves generating an Arabic multi-pronunciation dictionary. For instance, Biadsy et al. have generated a multi-pronunciation dictionary using pronunciation rules and then MADA (Habash et al., 2009), as a morphological disambiguation tool, to determine the most likely pronunciation of a given word in its context (Biadsy et al., 2009). The proposed method reported a significant improvement of 4.1% in accuracy compared to the baseline system. Ali et al. have provided a limited set of phonetic rules for automatic generation of an Arabic phonetic dictionary (Ali et al., 2008). The rules were mainly direct grapheme-to-phoneme with a few rules for the assimilation of ‘lAm’ with solar letters, the conversion of /n/ to /m/ when followed by /b/, and emphatics with pharyngeal vowels. The effectiveness of using the generated dictionary was tested using a large-vocabulary speaker-independent Arabic ASR system and achieved a comparable accuracy with the same vocabulary-size English ASR system. The work of (Ali et al., 2008) was then implemented in many other publications such as in Alghamdi et al. (2009), Abuzeina et al. (2011), and AbuZeina et al. (2012).

This section reviews the outlines of our transcription algorithm for MSA. This system utilises a set of comprehensive pronunciation rules which includes the grapheme-to-phoneme mapping and phoneme-to-phone conversion to produce the actual sounds of the language. This process must be preceded by preprocessing texts. This is an essential front-end for any system that deals with transcribing text. Basically, it manipulates the information from textual input and prepares the text to undergo further processing by the system. Besides, a lexicon for exceptional words, numbers, abbreviations, symbols, and acronyms is introduced. Fig. 1
                      describes the architecture of the developed grapheme-to-allophone system.

The pronunciation rules, which are implemented as a set of two-level finite state automata, are formalised in the following way:


                     
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  

The rule has two main parts separated by a colon. The first part describes the conversion process by indicating what sound(s) is changed and what the sound changes to (the abstract representation to the actual sound). The second part of the rule indicates in what environment the conversion rule is applied. X is the backwards context and Y is the forwards context. The double hashes represent the location of the sound(s) that is to be changed. Square brackets are used to represent the individual sounds or features the sounds have in common (represented in curly brackets) or null.

To illustrate the format of these rules, consider the well-known English pronunciation rule for converting the /n/ sound to /m/ whenever it precedes a bilabial consonant, e.g. the word ‘impossible’ which was originally ‘in-possible’ but because the /n/ was followed by a bilabial sound /p/, the /n/ sound has been converted to /m/.
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                              .
                                 3
                              
                              
                                 3
                                 Rules describe insertion, deletion and exchange of characters. Characters, however, have phonetic correlates, and in many cases rules refer to these in order to capture the appropriate generalisations.
                              
                           

This rule applies to all sounds that share the feature bilabial (in English /b/, /p/, and /m/). The triple question marks [???] in the backwards context means it can contain any sequence of items.

This section describes the task allocated to each step in converting the text to its phonetic transcription.

Text normalisation or pre-processing may include the following:
                           
                              •
                              Restoring the diacritics of the text, as the absence of the diacritics means losing a large amount of the phonetic information, which leads to a considerable ambiguity when processing the text. In the work discussed here, we work on fully vowelised text extracted from the Penn Arabic Treebank (Maamouri and Bies, 2004), and hence there is no need for this step in our work.

Text segmentation into words, syllables, and phoneme boundaries. This process is crucial in enhancing the quality of the conversion rules since many rules are restricted to special boundaries. For instance, the insertion of the short vowel /i/ (Section 2.2) only occurs between two words when the first one ends with a consonant and the second one starts with ‘hamzatu Alwasl’ 
                                    
                                 . Furthermore, the syllable plays an essential role in writing the rules, as many phonetic phenomena seen in Arabic are syllable-internal, e.g. the spread of pharyngealisation (Section 2.3.1.2) and the pronunciation of the semi-consonants ‘w’ 
                                    
                                 , ‘y’ 
                                    
                                 , which is dependent on their position within the syllable.

Deleting unnecessary symbols like sukon 
                                    
                                 . The function of this symbol is to indicate that the consonant to which it is attached is not followed by a vowel. Because this symbol does not correspond to any sound it can be deleted.

Removing the letters that do not correspond to any sound in the word's pronunciation. Such letters may appear in certain words in which case the best way to deal with them is to introduce and map them with their correspondent pronunciation in the lexicon. Furthermore, a letter may appear in special contexts like the silent ‘Alif’ 
                                    
                                  which follows ‘the group waw’ 
                                    
                                  indicating masculine plural morpheme in verbs. For example: the verb ‘katabuwA’ 
                                    
                                  “they wrote” is pronounced /katabu:/. Another silent ‘Alif’ appears after the ‘fatH nunation’ 
                                    
                                 .

This step also includes removing short vowels that precede a long vowel. These short vowels usually appear in automatically diacritised text before their long vowel counterparts such as ‘taquwl’ 
                                    
                                  /taqu:l/ “she said” and ‘turiyd’ 
                                    
                                  /turi:d/ “she wants”. Because these short vowels do not have any phonetic function, they need to be removed from the text as they are merely used in the text to help distinguish between cases where semi-consonants are realised as consonants and ones where they are realised as vowels.

Remove the gemination marker ‘shadda’ ‘∼’ and duplicate the previous consonant. Whenever shadda appears after a character, that character is geminated. For example, the word ‘say∼id’ 
                                    
                                  “master” is pronounced /sayyid/.

This section is concerned with the sound-spelling correspondences. The outcome of this step will be used as an input to the phonological analysis. Generally speaking, sound-spelling correspondence is a straightforward process in Arabic with one pronunciation for each grapheme. However, certain irregularities can be noticed with some graphemes in Arabic that have multiple pronunciations. Three of them are the semi-consonants 
                           
                        , namely: ‘Alif’ ‘A’ 
                           
                        , ‘wAw’ ‘w’ 
                           
                        , and ‘yA′ ’ ‘y’ 
                           
                        . The fourth one is the feminine marker ‘ta’ marbwTa” 
                           
                        . Besides, some graphemes may appear in the text but be deleted during the pronunciation and some phonemes are pronounced although they do not have an orthographic representation. These issues will be investigated in this section before going through the process of direct one-to-one grapheme-to-phoneme mapping.
                           
                              •
                              The pronunciation of ‘wAw’ ‘w’ 
                                    
                                  and ‘yA′ ‘y’ 
                                    
                                 
                              

The Arabic writing system has one grapheme to represent two different sounds from various phonetic classes. There is ‘w’ 
                                    
                                  to present both the long vowel /u:/ and the consonant/w/, and there is also ‘y’ 
                                    
                                  to present long vowel /i:/ and the consonant /j/ at the same time. This variety in the phonetic representation for the two mentioned letters causes a great deal of confusability in analysing the language, since it affects not only the pronunciation of the word, but also the syllabic structure of the word as the two representations come from different phonetic classes. Consider the examples: ‘yadEw’ 
                                    
                                  “he prays” which is pronounced /jadʕu:/ and the dual form of the same verb ‘yadEuwAn’ 
                                    
                                  which is pronounced /jadʕuwa:n/. The ‘w’ character is pronounced as a long vowel in the first example and as a consonant in the second example. To give an example of the ‘y’ character, consider the form: ‘yarmy’ 
                                    
                                  “he throws” pronounced /jarmi:/, and compare it with the dual form of the same verb ‘yarmiyAn’ 
                                    
                                  which is pronounced /jarmija:n/.

Many researchers have recognised this problem and tried to offer solutions. The most widely used method is to identify the sounds of ‘w’ and ‘y’ by looking at the preceding vowel; if ‘w’ or ‘y’ is preceded by its counterpart short vowel /u/ or /i/ it will then be pronounced as a long vowel. In contrast, they will be pronounced as a consonant when preceded by ‘fatHa’ /a/ (Ali et al., 2008; Hyassat and Abu Zitar, 2006). We argue that the presented solution is not based on a real understanding of the Arabic phonetics and phonological system for two reasons. (a) By saying that a long vowel (‘w’ or ‘y’) is preceded by a short vowel, we are violating a fundamental phonetic rule that does not allow a vowel cluster in a single syllable (Watson, 2007). (b) A quick glance over Arabic texts would show that this rule does not always apply. For instance, despite the fact that ‘w’ and ‘y’ in the words: ‘yarjuwAn’ 
                                    
                                  “they hope” and ‘yabniyAn’ 
                                    
                                  “they construct” both have a short vowel predecessor (/u/ and /i/), they are pronounced as consonants.

The best way then to determine whether it is a consonant or a vowel is to look at the immediately preceding and following context in which the ‘y’ or ‘w’ occurred. The Arabic phonetic system, for instance, does not allow a syllable to start with a vowel and does not allow for adjacent consonants within a single syllable apart from the final syllable in the word. Therefore, the ‘w’ and ‘y’ are considered vowels in two cases: when they are preceded and followed by consonants and when they come at the end of the word and are preceded by a consonant. Otherwise, they are consonants.

The pronunciation of ‘Alif’ ‘A’ 
                                    
                                 
                              

The ‘Alif’ letter can be pronounced as ‘hamza’ 
                                    
                                  “glottal stop” /
                                    
                                 /, or ‘long Alif’ 
                                    
                                  /a:/. It is pronounced as hamza when it comes after a pause or at the beginning of an utterance. i.e. it is either a part of the definite article ‘Al’ 
                                    
                                  as in ‘Almadrasap’ 
                                    
                                  “the school” or a verb or noun initial as in ‘A*hab’ 
                                    
                                  “go” and ‘AntiSAr’ 
                                    
                                  “victory”. The mentioned examples are pronounced as follows: /
                                    
                                 almadrasa/, /
                                    
                                 i*hab/, and /
                                    
                                 intiSa:r/, respectively. Otherwise, it will follow hamzatu AlwaSl deletion rules which will be covered later in this section.

On the other hand, the ‘A’ letter is pronounced as the long vowel /a:/ if the above conditions do not apply. In other words, when it occurs in words medially or finally like: ‘kitAbuhumA’ 
                                    
                                  “their book” which is pronounced /kita:buhuma:/.

The rules developed to cover the phonetic variants described above are:


                                 
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              

According to these rules, the ‘A’ is pronounced as hamza whenever it occurs initially in the utterance and pronounced as long vowel /a:/ when occurs word's medially or finally. The notation c0, c1, …means any sound that has the feature +consonant, and likewise v0, v1, …means any sound that has the feature -consonant.

The pronunciation of the feminine marker ta’ marbwTa

The main standard way to form a feminine noun from the masculine in Arabic is by adding a morpheme called ta’ marbuTa to the word's final syllable and looks like 
                                    
                                  or 
                                    
                                  depending on the type of character to which it is connected. The feminine marker in Arabic has two different pronunciations; it is silent when not followed by a vowel, otherwise, it is pronounced as /t/.

The following pronunciation rule explains this transformation:


                                 
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              

The first part of the rule says that the feminine marker ‘p’ is pronounced as ‘t’ when followed by a vowel and it is deleted when occurs at the end of the utterance.

Deletion and insertion

The deletion phenomenon, sometimes referred to as “elision”, is mainly about deleting graphemes where the pronounced form has no corresponding sound. Insertion, some times referred to as “epenthesis”, is the process of inserting a phonetic element into a string without having an orthographic representation.

The main deletion process that can be observed in MSA is the deletion of hamzatu Alwasl. Arabic phonetic structure does not allow the syllable to begin with two consonants (CCV). However, because Arabic is a morphologically driven language, some words may begin with a two-consonant cluster. Therefore, hamzatu Alwasl is added as an initial hamza to many morphological forms to avoid violating this dominant phonetic rule. The pronunciation of hamzatu Alwasl is totally dependent on the context. For instance, it is not pronounced when it is preceded by a vowel because if that happens the first consonant after hamzatu Alwasl will be the coda of the last syllable of the preceding word and in such cases the “beginning with two consonants” restriction does not apply. For example: a phrase like ‘>uHibu AibtisAmatak’ 
                                    
                                  “I love your smile” is pronounced as /
                                    
                                 uℏibu btisa:matak/. It is worth remembering here that while hamzatu Alwasl can be found in Arabic nouns and verbs, it can also be a part of the definite article ‘Al’ 
                                    
                                 .

Insertion is another phenomenon that can be seen in Arabic. The general rule in pronouncing two successive words in MSA when the last sound of the first word is a consonant and the first sound of the second word is hamzatu Alwasl is to introduce a short vowel /i/ after the first word and to delete the hamzatu Alwasl accordingly as discussed previously. This can be seen in phrases like ‘man AlqAdim’ 
                                    
                                  /manil qa:dim/ “who is coming?”. The short vowel /i/ is inserted in line with the basic phonetic rule in MSA that does not allow having two successive consonants except at the end of the utterance. After inserting the short vowel, the hamza deletion process takes place.

The rules below express the short vowel insertion process before hamzatu Alwasl and the process of deleting the phonetic representation of the letter ‘A’ 
                                    
                                 :


                                 
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              

A short vowel /i/ is inserted before the letter ‘A’ according to the first rule. The second rule says that hamzatu Alwasl, which occurs at the start of the word, must be deleted whenever it is preceded by a vowel and followed by two adjacent consonants. Also, the vowel that preceded it must be shortened if it was long. For example, ‘fy Almadrasap’ 
                                    
                                  “in the school” is pronounced as /fi lmadrasa/.

Another case where the insertion takes place is when hamzatu Alwasl is in the position (+initial) in the utterance. In this case, hamzatu Alwasl will be pronounced as a glottal stop, as we discussed previously, which needs a following vowel. Two kinds of short vowels maybe inserted depending on the type of the first vowel in the word. If it has the feature (-rounded), an /i/ is inserted e.g. the word ‘AinfataH’ 
                                    
                                  “opened” is pronounced /
                                    
                                 infataH/ when it comes at the beginning of the utterance. If the first vowel has the feature (+rounded), then a short /u/ is inserted e.g. ‘At
                                 ∼
                                 uhim’ 
                                    
                                  “he has been accused” is pronounced /
                                    
                                 uttuhima/.


                                 
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              

The process of mapping graphemes to phonemes also includes a set of one-to-one rules that inspect the graphemes and convert them into phonemes. This type of rule is straightforward; the task of these rules is to map the Arabic letters to their matching phonemes. All Arabic letters have only one form except ‘hamza’ “glottal stop” 
                                    
                                  /
                                    
                                 / and the long ‘Alif’ 
                                    
                                  /a:/. ‘hamza’ has multiple forms depending primarily on its vocalic context ‘>’ 
                                    
                                 , ‘&’ 
                                    
                                 , ‘<’ 
                                    
                                 , ‘’’ 
                                    
                                 , ‘}’ 
                                    
                                 . There are special orthographic rules for using each form. For example, ‘<’ 
                                    
                                  is used when ‘hamza’ is followed by the short vowel /i/, while ‘hamza’ form ‘&’ 
                                    
                                  is used in a word medially and finally when preceded or followed by an /u/ vowel. Similarly, the long ‘Alif’ has three different forms in Arabic. Beside the main form ‘A’ 
                                    
                                 , it can be presented as a diacritic in the middle of words (dagger‘Alif’ 
                                    
                                 ), or at the end (‘y’ 
                                    
                                 ). These multiple forms of writing ‘hamza’ and long ‘Alif’ do not affect how they are pronounced, so they are not a problem for deriving pronunciation transcription.

In the created grapheme-to-phoneme rules, we use the Buckwalter transliteration scheme and an extended version of the Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet (SAMPA) phonetisation scheme to present the letters and the sounds of the language, respectively (see Appendix A). The reason we use the SAMPA notation rather than the IPA in writing the program is because the IPA is not an ASCII friendly scheme. There are a number of alternative ASCII-oriented versions of the IPA. We use SAMPA in particular because in other parts of our work we use various pieces of software (the natural language toolkit (NLTK), the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK), and the speech synthesis engine MBROLA) which make use of this notation.

This part describes the development of a set of phonological rules that convert phonemes into phones. These rules are intended to control the allophonic variation. In other words, these are context-sensitive rules that operate on phonemes to convert them to phones in specific contexts. In writing these rules we used common Arabic pronunciation rules along with some tajweed rules (the tradition of the Holy Qur’an's recitation) which were found to comply with the MSA speech, and a number of novel rules obtained by analysing spoken MSA by speakers from different regions.

Rules are split into two categories–position independent and position dependent, where position independent rules apply in any appropriate situation and position dependent ones apply only to specified positions within the word or syllable. We apply position independent rules before position dependent ones, as the result of a position independent rule may affect the syllable structure. Within each group, rules are applied in an empirically determined sequence.

The rules introduced in this study include assimilation (total and partial), neutralisation, and emphasis.

Assimilation refers to the influence of one sound upon the articulation of another so that the two sounds become alike or even identical (Crystal, 2003). From this perspective, the change in sound may be either total or partial. The assimilation is total in the English phrase ‘ten men’ /tem men/, where the sound /n/ is influenced by the succeeding sound /m/ so that they become identical. The assimilation is partial in ‘ten books’ /tem bʊks/ where the sound /n/ is influenced by the following sound /b/ and has adopted its bilabiality, but not its plosiveness. This process can also be described depending on the direction of assimilation; it is progressive when the phoneme is changed to match the preceding phoneme, and regressive when the phoneme is changed to match the following phoneme.

“Assimilations are not compulsory in many languages, including English. A speaker may, if he chooses, avoid making them” (Abercrombie, 1967). Arabic presents different cases of total and partial assimilation that can either be obligatory or optional. Assimilation can be observed in spontaneous speech. However, in careful speech the assimilation may not occur for different reasons, such as the appearance of short pauses which will separate the consonants from close points of articulation. This part will introduce the aspects of assimilation in MSA, providing phonological rules that control this kind of variation.

Speakers tend to assimilate certain sounds where the places of articulation are close together. This section will address: (i) the assimilation of the ‘lAm’ consonant 
                                 
                               in the definite article ‘Al’ 
                                 
                              ; (ii) the assimilation of the nasal consonant 
                                 
                               /n/; (iii) the assimilation of the stop alveolar consonants 
                                 
                               /t/ and 
                                 
                               /d/; (iv) the assimilation of the dental consonants 
                                 
                              /θ/, 
                                 
                               /ð/, and 
                                 
                               /ðʕ/.
                                 
                                    •
                                    The total regressive assimilation of /l/

The major aspect of total assimilation in Arabic is that of the ‘lAm’ consonant /l/ of the definite article ‘Al’ 
                                          
                                       . The lateral of the Arabic definite prefix has different phonetic realisations depending on the type of initial consonant of the noun to which it is prefixed. The ‘lAm’ consonant, for instance, can be totally assimilated when followed by any one of a group consisting of fourteen consonants called the ‘solar letters’ 
                                          
                                       . On the other hand, the pronunciation of the ‘lAm’ is not affected when attached to a word which begins with a consonant of a group called the ‘lunar letters’ 
                                          
                                        (both listed in Table 2
                                       ).

For example, consider the word ‘Al
                                       $
                                       ams’ 
                                          
                                        /

                                       aʃ] when it occurs in combination with ‘$’ 
                                          
                                        /ʃ/.

The following pair of rules describe this process.


                                       
                                          
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    

The first of these rules says that whenever /l/ is preceded by ‘A’, where the ‘A’ is the first sound in the word, the /l/ should be assimilated with the following solar consonant. The same process applied in the second rule except for a change in the backwards context to cover the case where the prepositional ‘li’ introduces the defined word.

This phenomenon is described in Arabic resources as a morphological inflection process since it is concerned with prefixing the definite article ‘Al’ to nouns in order to get the definite forms and it does not affect arbitrary /l/+coronal sequences (Ryding, 2005). However, this can be explained phonetically in terms of the close articulation area of /l/ and the solar letters as they all originate from between the teeth to the lower part of the palate (Akesson, 2010).

The total regressive assimilation of /n/ An Arabic speaking person would find it difficult to utter a phrase like ‘man ra>Y’ 
                                          
                                        “who saw” or ‘min liqA’ ’ 
                                          
                                        “from meeting” without assimilating the sound 
                                          
                                        /n/ with the liquid lateral 
                                          
                                        /l/ or the liquid trill 
                                          
                                        /r/ to be pronounced in this way [marra
                                          
                                       a:] and [milliqa:
                                          
                                       ]. The /n/ shares with the liquid consonants the same place of articulation since they are all alveo-dental consonants.

The /n/ consonant can also be totally assimilated when followed by /m/ which shares nasality with /n/. Take for example: ‘TAlibN muha*ab’ 
                                          
                                       
                                       
                                          
                                        “a polite student” which is pronounced [tʕa:libum muhaððab]. The assimilation takes place either at a word boundary or at a phrase boundary. Nasal assimilation is mandatory in Arabic if it occurs within a word, but optional between two words (Watson, 2007).

The following rule expresses this type of assimilation:


                                       
                                          
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    

By applying this rule, the /n/ consonant is assimilated with the following consonant if this consonant belongs to one of two categories (nasal or liquid).

The total regressive assimilation of /t/ and /d/

The 
                                          
                                        /t/ consonant is assimilated when followed by (
                                          
                                       /θ/, 
                                          
                                        /ʤ/, 
                                          
                                        /d/, 
                                          
                                        /ð/, 
                                          
                                        /z/, 
                                          
                                        /sʕ/, 
                                          
                                        /dʕ/, 
                                          
                                        /tʕ/, or 
                                          
                                        /ðʕ/). These consonants are articulated from close articulatory points. In the same manner, the /d/ consonant can be assimilated when followed by the mentioned consonants (with /t/ instead of /d/). This assimilation takes place at word and phrase boundaries. This type of assimilation is stated in tajweed rules. However, according to tajweed rules, the /t/ is totally assimilated only when followed by /d/ and /tʕ/ whilst the /d/ is totally assimilated only when followed by /t/ (Cserepinski, 2000; Siddiqui, 2003). Table 3
                                        shows examples of this type of assimilation.


                                       
                                          
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    

The rule presented here is applied to any consonant that has the features alveo-stop and non-emphatic to assimilate it with the following consonant which has the feature dental-fricative or alveo-stop regardless of the preceding letter.

The total regressive assimilation of the dental consonants /θ/, /ð/, and /ðʕ/

There are three dental fricative consonants in the Arabic phonetic system, namely: 
                                          
                                        /θ/, 
                                          
                                        /ð/, and 
                                          
                                        /ðʕ/. These consonants are normally assimilated when preceded or followed by a consonant from the same point of articulation. Table 4
                                        gives examples of this process subdivided on the bases of the type of assimilated consonant.

The rule for assimilating dental consonants has the form:


                                       
                                          
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    

Partial assimilation is a linguistic process by which a sound becomes similar to the adjacent sound but not identical. MSA presents two major partial assimilation phenomena, namely: the nasal assimilation and the spread of pharyngealisation.
                                 
                                    •
                                    The nasal assimilation

MSA has two nasal consonants: one alveo-dental nasal consonant 
                                          
                                        /n/ and one bilabial nasal consonant 
                                          
                                        /m/. Different kinds of assimilation can be observed in the MSA for the /n/ consonant: total assimilation as discussed earlier in terms of assimilating /n/ with /l/, /r/, and /m/, and partial assimilation where the /n/ is converted to another sound that shares some features with the adjacent consonant. The /n/ is assimilated to /m/ when followed by the bilabial consonant /b/ such as the Arabic word ‘minbar’ 
                                          
                                        “platform” which is pronounced [mimbar]. The /m/ consonant shares the nasality with /n/ and the bilabiality with /b/.

Moreover, the /n/ consonant adopts the labiality of the consonant 
                                          
                                        /f/ and is assimilated to /ɱ/ every time it is followed by /f/ either in word or in phrase boundary. For example, the word ‘yanfad’ 
                                          
                                        “to run out” is pronounced [yaɱfad]. Assimilating the /n/ consonant when followed by /f/ has been introduced in the Tajweed references which state that the /n/ should be hidden while keeping its nasalisation whenever followed by /f/ (Cserepinski, 2000; Siddiqui, 2003). However, by analysing the native speakers’ speech and by comparing this with other languages like English, we believe that the /n/ consonant is assimilated into /ɱ/ rather than being hidden. Take as an example the English word ‘infer’ [iɱfer].

The /n/ consonant also adopts the velarity of the sounds 
                                          
                                        /k/ and 
                                          
                                        /q/ when followed by one of them. This can be seen in words like: ‘bank’ 
                                          
                                        [baŋk] and ‘munqAd’ 
                                          
                                        [muŋqa:d] “submissive”.

Furthermore, the /n/ is assimilated to the palatal nasal consonant /ɲ/ when followed by one of the sounds articulated from the dental and post-alveolar points, both fricatives and stops, namely: 
                                          
                                        /θ/, 
                                          
                                        /ð/, 
                                          
                                       /ðʕ/, 
                                          
                                        /tʕ/, 
                                          
                                        /dʕ/, 
                                          
                                        /sʕ/, 
                                          
                                        /t/, 
                                          
                                        /d/, 
                                          
                                        /s/, 
                                          
                                        /z/, 
                                          
                                        /ʤ/, and 
                                          
                                       /ʃ/. Take these examples: ‘manvuwr’ 
                                          
                                        [maɲθu:r] “scattered”, ‘manZar’ 
                                          
                                        [maɲðʕar] “view”, and ‘yantabih’ 
                                          
                                        [yaɲtabih] “to pay attention”.

An interesting point can be observed here; these consonants are exactly what we have seen in the solar letter group (if we add the /ʤ/ consonant) excluding /l/ and /r/ which are totally assimilated with /n/. This might be due to the fact that the consonant /n/ is the closest sound to /l/ in terms of place of articulation. This proximity in the two mentioned consonants makes them share certain changes when they occur in close conditions. However, this process is optional and varies in use among Arabic speakers who speak with different accents.

The nasal assimilation rules take the following format
                                          4
                                       
                                       
                                          4
                                          In these rules we used the symbols /M/, /c/, and /e/ to stand for the IPA phones /ɱ/, /ŋ/, and /ɲ/, respectively.
                                       :


                                       
                                          
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    

The spread of pharyngealisation

The Arabic phonetic system possesses pharyngealised coronal consonants called emphatics, namely (
                                          
                                        /sʕ/, 
                                          
                                        /dʕ/, 
                                          
                                        /tʕ/, 
                                          
                                        /ðʕ/). “These consonants are produced with a primary articulation at the dental/alveolar region and with a secondary articulation that involves the constriction of the upper pharynx” (Davis, 1995). It has been found that where one of these emphatic consonants occurs in a word, emphasis (pharyngealisation) may spread to the neighbouring sounds in the same syllable or word (Davis, 1995). By this process, the influenced sounds (both consonants and vowels) tend to be pronounced in a way like the emphatics. Two questions arise here; what is the domain of the pharyngealisation? In other words, how far is the spread likely to reach? The second question is: in which direction does the process work? backwards or forwards?

Different studies have tried to address these questions (Davis, 1995; Watson, 1999). They all emphasised that the domain of pharyngealisation spread and the directions of this spread vary greatly from accent to accent. However, since this process is quite complex, we will draw the frame of this phenomenon by restricting it to the minimal domain, which is generally agreed to be the syllable. By doing so, we would argue that the emphatic consonants affect mainly the vowels that occur in the syllable that contains them. So, the vowel is pharyngealised when preceded by an emphatic consonant (the onset of the syllable) and when followed by an emphatic consonant within the same syllable. Take these examples: ‘SAdiq’ 
                                          
                                        [sʕa:
                                          
                                             
                                             ˆ
                                          
                                        diq] “honest” and ‘yaTbaE’ 
                                          
                                        [ya
                                          
                                             
                                             ˆ
                                          
                                        tʕbaʕ] “to print”.

Compare the vowel pronunciation in the words ‘sAriq’ 
                                          
                                        [sa:riq] “thief” and ‘SAdiq’ 
                                          
                                        [sʕa:
                                          
                                             
                                             ˆ
                                          
                                       diq] “honest”. It can be seen in the spectrograms given in Figs. 2
                                        and 3
                                        that the formants are clearer in 2 than in 3, marking the fact that the vocal tract is more open following the non-pharangyealised sound and therefore there is more resonance.

The vowel pharyngealisation rules take the form:


                                       
                                          
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    

According to these rules, the vowel is pharyngealised whenever it is followed by an emphatic consonant and that emphatic has the position coda in the syllable, or preceded by an emphatic consonant which is the onset of the syllable.

The emphatic consonants may also affect the neighbouring consonants. This can be seen in Arabic when the consonant ‘s’ 
                                          
                                        is replaced by its emphatic counterpart ‘S’ 
                                          
                                        when neighbouring the emphatic consonant ‘T’ 
                                          
                                       . This conversion takes place in two cases:
                                          
                                             1
                                             When the consonant directly following /s/ is /tʕ/, either separated by a vowel like ‘sATiE’ 
                                                   
                                                 or not like ‘yasTabir’ 
                                                   
                                                .

When the /s/ and /tʕ/ are separated by a consonant which must be any consonant except /t/, e.g. ‘musayTir’ 
                                                   
                                                 and ‘sawT’ 
                                                   
                                                .

This is a regressive assimilation that occurs only within the word. The rules covering this kind of assimilation are:


                                       
                                          
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    

The vowel in the second part of the rule is in brackets to indicate that it is optional.


                                       
                                          
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    

Beside the emphatic consonants, the pharyngealisation effect can be seen on the vowels neighbouring back consonants like uvular consonants which are: 
                                          
                                        /q/, 
                                          
                                        /x/, and 
                                          
                                        /g/. This effect can be noticed on the front vowels only /a/ or /a:/ which are pharyngealised by becoming more open and more back when followed or proceeded by an uvular consonant within the same syllable. Take the examples: 
                                          
                                        [qa:
                                          
                                             
                                             ˆ

                                             ˆ

                                        bap].


                                       
                                          
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    

In MSA, there is a contrast in sound length in some contexts. Sound neutralisation can be observed in various positions:
                              
                                 •
                                 Short vowel neutralisation: a dominant Arabic pronunciation rule says that you cannot start an utterance with successive consonants or end it with a vowel. This means that a terminal unstressed short vowel, e.g. a case or mood marker, must not be pronounced in the pausal form. The resulting vowel from this process is transcribed as schwa /ə/. For example, a word like ‘taktubu’ 
                                       
                                     “she writes” is transcribed as [taktubə] when it occurs utterance finally.


                                    
                                       
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 

Long vowel neutralisation (the so-called “resolution of a V-V sequence”): long vowels are shortened in certain situations in MSA, namely when they occur word finally and are followed by hamzatu Alwasl. For example the phrase ‘AiftaHuwA AlkitAb’ 
                                       
                                     “open the book” is pronounced [
                                       
                                    iftaℏu lkita:b].


                                    
                                       
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 

Double consonants neutralisation: it is noticed that the double consonants are shortened and pronounced as one consonant when they occur utterance finally as in ‘Haj∼’ 
                                       
                                     “pilgrimage” which is pronounced [ℏ aʤ]. In order to apply this conversion, the word should not be followed by a vowel like 
                                       
                                     where it pronounced [ℏaʤʤa]. The rule responsible for this kind of variation is:


                                    
                                       
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 

Tajweed rules state that there are two characteristics of 
                              
                            /l/ and 
                              
                            /r/ sounds; they both can be described as heavy ‘tafxym’ 
                              
                            or light ‘tarqyq’ 
                              
                           . The ‘lAm’ /l/ is always in tarqyq except in the pronunciation of the name of ‘All‘h’ 
                              
                            where it is emphasised when it comes at the beginning of the utterance or when its predecessor vowel is either ‘fatHa’ /a/ or ‘Damma’ /u/ e.g. ‘All‘humma’ 
                              
                            [

                                 ˆ

                                 ˆ
                              
                            a:humma] and ‘yA All‘h’

                                 ˆ

                            a:h]. On the other hand, the /l/ is not emphasised when preceded by a ‘kasra’ /i/ e.g. ‘lill‘h’ 
                              
                            [lilla:h]. The emphasis of the sound does not only affect the pronunciation of the word but may also change the meaning. Compare the following utterances:
                              
                                 -

                                     [walla:h] which means “he makes him responsible”

The only difference between the two utterances is the emphasis of the sound /l/.


                           
                              
                                 
                              
                           
                        

According to these rules, the /l/ is emphasised in the word when it comes at the beginning of the utterance and when it preceded by a vowel that is not (-open) and not (-rounded) which means it cannot be ‘kasra’.

Furthermore, the /r/ sound could be emphasised or not depending on the context. It is not emphasised whenever it is preceded or followed by ‘kasra’ /i/ within the same syllable, like ‘riHlap’ 
                              
                            [riℏla] “trip” and ‘sir’ 
                              
                            [sir] “a secret”. In contrast it is emphasised in all the other cases like ‘rajul’ 
                              
                            [r
                              
                                 
                                 ˆ
                              
                            ajul] “a man” and ‘wrwd’ 
                              
                            [wur
                              
                                 
                                 ˆ
                              
                            u:d] “flowers”. This can be described in the following rule:


                           
                              
                                 
                              
                           
                        

The emphasis of the consonant /r/ is applied when it is preceded or followed by a vowel that does not have the features (-open) and (-rounded) within the same syllable. The emphasis of /l/ and /r/ normally spreads to the neighbouring vowels within the same syllable just like what happens with the emphatic consonants so the vowel preceding or following the emphasised /l/ or /r/ within the same syllable will be pharyngealised.

In this section the stress rules are presented based on research in the literature and observation of how spoken MSA is actually pronounced (Al-Ani, 1970; McCarthy, 1979; De Jong and Zawaydeh, 1999). This process comes at the end because it depends mainly on the internal structure of the syllables that make up the word, which may change greatly after applying the phonological rules. Although word stress in MSA is non-phonemic, which means it cannot be used to distinguish the meaning (see Al-Ani, 1970; Odisho, 1976), researchers confirm that well-defined stress rules can help in enhancing Arabic speech processing applications (Halpern, 2009; Ramsay and Mansour, 2007). The stress rules presented here are based on the standard pronunciation of MSA. However, the accent may cause a shifting in the stress position, e.g. Egyptian speakers pronounce the word ‘maktabap’ 
                              
                            “library” as [mak-ta-ba] with stress on /ta/ rather than the standard way [mak-ta-ba].

Stress rules:
                              
                                 1
                                 If the word contains a word-final super heavy syllable (CVVC or CVCC), this syllable must be stressed. Consider the word ‘sijil∼’ 
                                       
                                     “register” [si-jill] and ‘rah
                                    ∼
                                    Al’ 
                                       
                                     “traveler” [rah-ha:l]. This kind of syllable can only occur once in a word.

In words with open heavy syllables (CVV), the stress is placed on the last such syllable. Consider for instance, ‘dAris’ 
                                       
                                     “student” [da:-ris] and 
                                       
                                     “students” [da:-ri-su:-na].

In case the word has no super heavy syllable or open heavy syllable, the position of the stressed syllable depends on the number of syllables in the word:
                                       
                                          •
                                          In disyllabic words, the stress falls in the first syllable. e.g. ‘huwa’ 
                                                
                                              “he” [hu-wa] and ‘maktab’ 
                                                
                                              “office” [mak-tab].

In polysyllabic words, stress is placed on the antepenultimate syllable. For example ‘rasamat’ 
                                                
                                              “she draws” [ra-sa-mat] and ‘maktabatK’ 
                                                
                                              “a library” [mak-ta-ba-tun]

Most languages have words that do not follow the general rules for pronunciation. In English, for instance, some particular words have silent letters that do not correspond to any sound in the word's pronunciation, such as ‘w’ in ‘answer’, ‘s’ in ‘island’, and ‘t’ in ‘ballet’. In the case of Arabic, there are silent letters and missed letters. The silent letters have just been described, the missed letters are the sounds that are not included in the word but are pronounced. For example, the sound /u:/ in words like ‘dAwd’ 
                           
                         /da:wu:d/ or ‘TAws’ 
                           
                         /tʕa:wu:s/. These types of words do not follow a specific pronunciation rule. For such cases, there needs to be a set of rules that associate the graphemic form of the exceptional words to their phonemic form.

This also includes conversions of numbers, symbols, acronyms, abbreviations, and non-alphanumeric characters into appropriate word or phrase descriptors. Researchers confirm that these kinds of words are a major source of errors in phonetic transcription (Ali et al., 2008). Irregular forms of this kind must be identified prior to executing the pronunciation rules.

A great deal of attention in the literature has been paid to the evaluation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications like speech recognition systems and speech synthesis systems. However, researchers confirm that there is still a lack of literature in the objective evaluation of the performance of the system's components like the grapheme-to-allophone conversion system individually (El-Imam, 2004). As a result, there is no standard methodology to follow in evaluating our system.

Testing and evaluating the proposed system involves two stages: in the first stage we verify that the developed set of rules produces the phonetic transcriptions that correspond to our expectations. The issue here is that these are complex rules which apply in combination and they may interact in an unexpected way especially across word boundaries. In the second stage we investigate how accurately the rules capture the actual phonetic realisation.

In the first testing stage, the PENN Arabic treebank text corpus is used (Maamouri and Bies, 2004). The corpus sentences were used as an input to the transcription system to test how words are pronounced in a freely occurrence text. Then, we extracted a reasonable amount of transcribed words making sure that they illustrate every possible boundary condition in order to cover all aspects of variability in speech. The rules were tested on 500 words that have a single phonetic transcription and another 500 words with multiple phonetic transcriptions. Words with multiple phonetic transcriptions are particularly important for this work, since the aim of the rules is to make sure that we obtain the correct pronunciation in the various contexts in which the word can occur. For each word that we have chosen in our sample, we have tested occurrences of that word in a variety of contexts in the PATB to ensure that we have a complete test of the rule set. Table 5
                      gives examples of words that have a single phonetic transcription and the ones that have multiple phonetic transcriptions. A word correct metric is used here as a scoring scheme to evaluate the system performance.

Generally speaking, the system produced few word errors (3.4%) when compared to a manually pre-annotated text. The overall score of the system is 98.8% for words with a single transcription and 96.5% for words with multiple transcriptions. The main source of errors was the existence of foreign names such as ‘lwt$yAnw’, ‘ryyd’, ‘dnfr’, and ‘lkHand’ and encountering symbols or abbreviations which were missed in the lexicon such as ‘< lx’, ‘mlm’, and ‘tg’. The reason for using the PATB was that it provides reasonably accurately diacriticised text, which is what we need for testing the system. In some cases the text is not diacriticised, e.g. ‘mSdq’. Such items cannot be used when looking at the system's performance. When they are removed, the system's output exactly matches our expectations. The aim of this testing phase was to ensure that the rules behaved as we intended them to, in particular to ensure that there were no unexpected interactions between rules. As such, comparing the output with a manually pre-annotated text is an appropriate test. The aim here is to test the integrity of the implementation, not to investigate the accuracy of the rules as a description of Arabic phonology.

The second, evaluation, stage was aimed at testing the effectiveness of the rules for predicting how native speakers pronounce words in context. The overall goal of the research reported here is to obtain an accurate description of how people actually say things, to be used, among other things, for providing accurate phonetic transcription for the training phase of a speech recogniser. In this second stage we therefore wanted to verify that these phonological effects have audible consequences in natural speech.

We manually created 20 sentences with a total of 560 phonemes (listed in Appendix B). The created sentences cover all Arabic phonemes and all the phonological contexts that we looked at in our study. The sentences were recorded by five native speakers from different dialectal regions (Gulf, Egypt, Iraq, Levantine). An independent human annotator with experience in Arabic phonetics was asked to transcribe the total of 100 sentences using a narrow phonetic transcription without knowing anything about the expected results. Given that the annotator had no information about what we expected to find, her transcription provides a fair picture of the sounds that the speakers produced. If she heard one sound being assimilated to another, or if her transcription had a phoneme missing, then that is evidence that these sounds are indeed assimilated or deleted. Thus if her independent description of the sounds that a native speaker produced when reading a text aloud corresponds to the transcription produced by our rules then this provides evidence in support of our rules.

The output of the system matched the annotator's transcription to 98.3%. Below is a sample of the transcription obtained from the annotator:


                     Sentence: ‘lam >atamak∼an min ru&yapi Aljaziyrap’


                     Transcription: [lam 
                        
                     a.ta.mak.kam minr
                        
                           
                           ˆ
                        
                      u
                        
                           
                           ˆ
                        
                      .
                        
                     jati l.ʤa.zi:.ra]

The mismatches fall into five classes which are listed in Table 6
                      and discussed below.


                     
                        
                           1
                           Accent

The largest set of mismatches arise from accent variations. For instance, the MSA phoneme 
                                 
                               /ʤ/ as in the word 
                                 
                               /tuʤra:/ is generally preserved in Gulf and Iraqi accents whilst it is realised as /g/ in Egyptian accent /tugra:/ and /ʒ/ in Levantine Arabic /tuʒra/.

We also found that Egyptian speakers may relax the pronunciation of the emphatic consonant 
                                 
                               /tʕ/ by making it sounds like /t/. For example, the word 
                                 
                               /
                                 
                              alxatʕi:b/ has been transcribed as /
                                 
                               alxati:b/. Another aspect of pronunciation variation resulting from the dialectal influence is the emphasis spread. Typically the emphasis spreads to the neighbouring vowels and in some cases the neighbouring consonant. However, looking at the transcribed sentences of the Egyptian and Levantine speakers we found that in some cases the effect of the emphatic consonant spreads to the whole word. For example, the word 
                                 
                               /
                                 
                              intasʕ a
                                 
                                    
                                    ˆ
                                 
                               rat/ is pronounced /
                                 
                              intʕa
                                 
                                    
                                    ˆ
                                 
                               sʕ a
                                 
                                    
                                    ˆ
                                 
                               rat/. In addition, we found that Iraqi accents include extra letters in the definite article assimilation. For example, the word 
                                 
                               /
                                 
                              alʤa:miʕa/ is pronounced /
                                 
                              aʤʤa:miʕa/ though the palatal stop consonant /ʤ/ is not considered as one of the solar consonants where the assimilation normally takes place. Phonetically, adding the 
                                 
                               /ʤ/ consonant to the solar letter group does make sense because they all have a common area of articulation (including dentals, alveo-dentals, and post-alveolars, which are all made with the front part of the tongue).

The final aspect of pronunciation variation we found resulted from the way of pronouncing names in the accent which affects the way they are pronounced in MSA. In Egyptian accent, for instance, people say /
                                 
                              il
                                 
                              arbaʕ/ in their daily communication “Wednesday”, as a result, they pronounce this word /
                                 
                              al
                                 
                              arbaʕa:
                                 
                              / instead of /
                                 
                              al
                                 
                              arbiʕa:
                                 
                              / when speaking MSA.

Mis-reading

Part of the mismatches between the generated phonetic transcription and the one obtained by the annotator was resulted from people mis-reading the words. This is a consequence of the fact that assigning the word's final vowel depends on the word's function in the sentence. Speakers vary in their grammar skills, so many less well educated people drop the vowel at the end of the word, pronouncing it as a schwa, or sometimes they give the wrong vowel. For example, one of the speakers said /
                                 
                              addawru/ instead of /
                                 
                              addawri/.

Ignoring assimilation

Some people make an effort when speaking to machines, which means that they do not speak naturally. As a result, they avoid some kinds of assimilation aiming at clarifying their speech, as saying /bank/ instead of /baŋk/. Another reason for ignoring the assimilation is pausing between words, which changes the syllabic structure of the word and consequently affects the pronunciation by changing the assimilation context.

Individual speaking styles

Speaking styles differ between individuals. For instance, some people tend not to pronounce the final sound in the sentence like saying /muʤtahidu:/ when pronouncing the word 
                                 
                               /muʤtahidu:n/ and some of them simplify the ‘hamza’, like the one in 
                                 
                               /lʕasʕila/ which was pronounced by one speaker as /lʕasyila/.

New phenomena

By analysing the annotator's transcription we found some kinds of new regular assimilations which are:

                                    Converting the phoneme /d/ to /tʕ/ when it is at the end of a syllable which starts with an emphatic consonant and is followed by /q/ like saying /ʕlsʕitʕqu/ instead of /ʕlsʕidqu/.

Simplifying the consonant /z/ to its voiceless counterpart /s/ when followed by the /q/ phoneme, like pronouncing the word 
                                          
                                        as /ʕlrisq/ instead of /ʕlrizq/.

Moving from back vowels to front vowels and vice versa is a difficult task for some speakers especially in fast speech. We found that words like 
                                          
                                        /ʕintabihu:/ are sometimes pronounced as /ʕintabuhu:/ to avoid the tongue movement.

Some speakers have difficulties in moving between phonemes which are close in articulation points. For instance, we found one speaker pronounced the phrase 
                                          
                                        /ʕlθa:ni: limaʤlis/ as /ʕlθa:ni: nimaʤlis/.

Given that the last two kinds of assimilation are not universal, even for speakers from a single accent, including them is not likely to be useful for our target applications. On the other hand, we have added the first two phenomena to our phonological rules to control such variations.

The rule set described above was developed in order to generate phonetic transcriptions for use in training an ASR system for MSA. Before using the rules for this purpose, it is necessary to verify that they do match what happens in native speech–there would be very little point in using transcriptions obtained using these rules in an ASR if they were not an accurate reflection of native speech. The key test for this was to use the rules to generate a transcription for a set of examples; and to get an independent annotator to mark up recordings of these examples by a group of native speakers. If the generated transcription matches the manual transcription of the recordings then the rules are a reasonable approximation to reality. The score on this task was 98.3%, and the 1.7% of cases where there were discrepancies were largely explained by the presence of loan words (which would not be expected to follow the standard Arabic rules), errors in vowel production by the native speakers, and minor accentual effects.

Given that our transcriptions do seem to provide an accurate picture of what a native speaker sounds like, we are now planning to use these rules to generate a context-sensitive phonetic transcription for a given MSA text to be used in the training phase of a speech recogniser. The effectiveness of using the generated phonetic transcription is going to be tested on developing a speech recognition system based on 25h of recordings. The database has been collected with the aid of 57 speakers who cover the main Arabic accents. We hope to report on this work in the near future.
