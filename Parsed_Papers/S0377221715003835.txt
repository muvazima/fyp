                  The purpose of this paper is to highlight a serious omission in the recent work of Li (2012) for solving the two person zero-sum matrix games with pay-offs of triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) and propose a new methodology for solving such games. Li (2012) proposed a method which always assures that the max player gain-floor and min player loss-ceiling have a common TFN value. The present paper exhibits a flaw in this claim of Li (2012). The flaw arises on account of Li (2012) not explaining the meaning of solution of game under consideration. The present paper attempts to provide certain appropriate modifications in Li’s model to take care of this serious omission. These modifications in conjunction with the results of Clemente, Fernandez, and Puerto (2011) lead to an algorithm to solve matrix games with pay-offs of general piecewise linear fuzzy numbers.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     Li (2012) in his recent paper proposed a new method to solve two person zero-sum matrix games with pay-offs of TFN’s. He emphasized, and in fact illustrated, that the method proposed by him always assures a common TFN-type fuzzy value for both Player I gain-floor and Player II loss-ceiling functions. Therefore, he concluded that any matrix game with pay-offs of TFNs has a TFN-type fuzzy value. He further emphasized that the conclusion (i.e., a common TFN value for both players) is rational because the underlying fuzzy matrix game is a zero-sum game. He also argued that his proposed method results in superior performance as compared to the existing methods in literature, more specifically, Campos (1989), Bector, Chandra, and Vidyottama (2004), Li (1999); Li and Yang (2004) and Li (2008). This is because the existing methods either do not provide a TFN value for the game or even if they do so the value is not common for the two players.

In this paper, we demonstrate that although Li’s first conclusion that the value of the game is a TFN is correct but his other conclusion that both players have a common TFN value is flawed. The mistake in Li’s work is observed due to omission of an essential concept of ‘solution of a game’. In this paper, we proceed with a thorough investigation of Li’s work and highlight a serious omission in an effort to alert future adoption of Li’s approach in fuzzy matrix games. We also suggest appropriate modifications to take care of this omission. These modifications in conjunction with the results of Clemente, Fernandez, and Puerto (2011) lead to an algorithm to solve matrix games with pay-offs of general piecewise linear fuzzy numbers.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews and points out a serious omission in the method of Li (2012). Section 3 provides our revision in order to resolve the mistakes in Li’s research. A simple numerical example is presented in Section 4. Section 5 describes an algorithm to solve matrix games with pay-offs of general piecewise linear fuzzy numbers. This algorithm is based on our revision of Li’s work as suggested in Section 3. Some concluding remarks are furnished in Section 6.

Rather than presenting the mathematical details of Li’s method to solve a two person zero-sum matrix game with pay-offs of TFNs we consider only the numerical example presented in his work. This has been done to keep the presentation short and also to clearly illustrate how and why we differ from his point of view. The example is cited from Campos (1989) and it has now become almost a bench mark example in the area of fuzzy matrix games (see, Bector & Chandra, 2005). Let the fuzzy matrix game be described by the fuzzy matrix

                     . Thereby it is concluded that the fuzzy value of the matrix game 
                        
                           A
                           ˜
                        
                      is given by the common TFN (155.2083, 161.0526, 166.3934).

Going through the work of Li (2012) what we observed that he mainly had used α-cuts, interval-valued fuzzy matrix game theory (Collins & Hu, 2008; Li, 2011a, 2011b; Li & Cheng, 2002), and the deterministic linear programming duality, to draw his conclusions.

What Li (2012) has talked about is the value of the game only but it is important to note that a solution of a game does not mean only its value but it also very much includes the optimal strategies for the two players. Though Li (2012) takes care of one component of solution of a fuzzy matrix game (i.e. value), he completely neglects the second aspect of a solution and that is optimal strategies of two players in a game. In fact a more serious omission is that Li (2012) never defined what he meant by a ‘solution of a fuzzy matrix game’ and therefore missed about the optimal mixed strategies altogether. Here lies our first point of concern in Li’s work. Even if one agrees, for the time being, that (Vl, Vm, Vr
                     ) is the common TFN value of the game, the major question remains about optimal strategies. Li is obviously silent about them, primarily because the three values Vl, Vm
                      and Vr
                      describing TFN as value of the game were obtained for three different optimal vectors

                      respectively. In fact there is absolutely no way to describe the optimal strategies for two players following the approach of Li (2012).

Besides missing on the solution concept, we also disagree with his other argument which he strongly emphasized that since the fuzzy matrix game is a zero-sum game we must have a common value for two players as the same holds in crisp zero-sum matrix games. But we have no reasons to expect this assertion since the problem set-up is fuzzy and ‘equality’ of two TFNs representing optimal values 
                        
                           V
                           ˜
                        
                      for Player I and 
                        
                           W
                           ˜
                        
                      for Player II cannot be taken in the usual crisp sense rather it has to be understood in an altogether different sense of fuzzy. We shall be discussing this and the other related aspects in the section to follow.

Our contention here is that though the value of the game for each player indeed will be TFN,

                      for Player II, but these will neither be equal nor optimal for the overall game as suggested in Li (2012). Consequently there is no question of a common TFN being the optimal value of the game.

With regard to fuzzy matrix games and related topics we shall follow the notations and terminologies of Bector and Chandra (2005). We hope there will be no confusion even if they are somewhat different from Li (2012).

                      holding as strict inequality. Here we must note that this ordering ‘⪯’ in TFN’s is a partial order. This is important in understanding the meaning of solution of game FG, because it tells that the maximality (or minimality) of fuzzy numbers on a set has to be understood in terms of partial order ‘⪯’ only. Therefore it makes sense to denote the matrix game FG as

Here, they have been obtained via the notion of reasonable solution whereas in Li (2012) obtained the same via the 0-cut and 1-cut of the associated interval-valued matrix game. In fact these problems have been originally obtained by Li (1999) himself.

                      Since f
                     1(x) and f
                     2(x) attain their maximum at different points (x

                      respectively), there is no concept of common value or common optimal solution in this scenario. Because of this we need to understand ‘optimality’ in the sense of ‘efficiency’ or ‘pareto optimality’ (see Steuer, 1986 for details). In this example such solutions are points in [0, 1] which do the trade-off between the two objectives f
                     1(x) and f
                     2(x).

To find a solution of the game FG, we have to treat

                      as multiobjectives programming problems and use standard machinery, Pareto (or efficient) solution concept, and softwares say GAMS (Mavrotas, 2007) to solve the game. Thus, Li (2012) had made a mistake by treating the two multiobjective linear programs equivalent to three scalar linear programs. Here, we must note that solution

The complete information on efficient frontiers of two optimization problems provide enough flexibility to the two players to choose their optimal strategies and hence know the corresponding TFNs optimal values.

The above results confirm that the value of the game FG for each player is a TFN. But these two TFN’s in general, are not same.

In this section we show that the modifications as suggested in Section 3 provide a methodology to solve matrix games with pay-offs of piecewise linear fuzzy numbers. Our presentation here is highly motivated by Clemente et al. (2011).

                      are piecewise linear fuzzy numbers. By a piecewise linear fuzzy number we mean a fuzzy number having continuous piecewise linear membership function (Inuguchi, Ichihashi, & Kume, 1990). Obviously triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are special case of a general piecewise linear fuzzy numbers. Let PLFG denote the two person zero-sum fuzzy matrix game with pay-offs of piecewise linear fuzzy numbers.

Now following the notations, terminology and results of Clemente et al. (2011), it can be shown that solving PLFG is equivalent to solving following two multiobjective programming problems

We next present a game where the pay-offs are piecewise linear fuzzy numbers. Again we note that such a game cannot be solved by the existing methods as they are limited to either triangular or trapzoidal fuzzy pay-offs.

                           Remark 5.1
                           In literature, only matrix games with pay-offs of triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers have been studied, e.g., Li and Yang (2004), Bector et al. (2004), Campos (1989) and Clemente et al. (2011). In Bector et al. (2004) and Campos (1989), exact membership functions of the fuzzy values of the game for the two players are not obtained. Here only average indices corresponding to membership functions of fuzzy values of the game for the two players are obtained. Though Li and Yang (2004) and Clemente et al. (2011) provide membership function of the fuzzy value of the game for each player, they provide only one efficient solution and not the entire efficient frontier. The present method attempts to provide an approximate efficient frontier for a very general problem whenever pay-offs are prescribed by general piece wise linear membership functions (Fig. 1
                              ).

                               to get an approximate description of these functions in terms of their corresponding α-cuts. Thus we can use the same methodology to get an approximate solution for fuzzy matrix game. This approximation can be improved by taking larger values for r.

In our method the number of objective functions in the multiobjective programs (VP)1 and (VP)2 depend on the number of αi
                              -cuts. Thus, the more these cut points are, the better is the representation of the value of the game for the two players. But then this also means several objective functions in (VP)1 and (VP)2, leading to more computational effort. This seems to be major drawback of the proposed methodology requiring further study.

In this study, we have described a critical omission in the recent work of Li (2012) for solving zero-sum fuzzy matrix games with pay-offs of TFNs. We described the flaw in Li’s conversion from fuzzy game problem to deterministic linear programming problems. We have provided a revision in Li’s approach suitably and drawn valid conclusions with regard to the solution of such games. Specifically we have concluded that each player have a TFN-type optimal value but it does not make sense to have the common value for both players. It is our contention that, in fuzzy scenario, Player I and Player II have their own fuzzy values

                     . To this end we would like to add that the observations of this study are also valid for other research articles like Li and Cheng (2002) and Li (2013). Based on our modifications of Li’s work and taking motivation from Clemente et al. (2011) we have also presented a method to solve two person zero sum matrix games with pay-offs of piecewise linear fuzzy numbers.
