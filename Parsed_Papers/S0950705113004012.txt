                  In most data envelopment analysis (DEA) models, the best performers have the full efficient status denoted by unity (or 100), and, from experience, we know that usually plural decision making units (DMUs) have this efficient status. Discriminating between these efficient DMUs is an interesting subject, and a large number of methods have been proposed for fully ranking both efficient and inefficient DMUs. This paper demonstrates the fact that the rank reversal phenomenon may occur in most DEA ranking methods; however, this study introduces some ranking methods which do not follow the procedure and lack this taint. Numerical examples are provided to clearly illustrate the above mentioned phenomenon in some DEA ranking methods. In fact, certain ranking methods are surveyed in DEA focusing on rank preservation and rank reversal phenomena.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was initiated in 1978 when Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes demonstrated how to change a fractional linear measure of efficiency into a linear programming (LP) format [12]. DEA as a linear programming method can simultaneously take into account multiple inputs and outputs to measure the relative efficiency for the homogenous DMUs in various contexts. In particular, the DEA model is a non-parametric model that does not require the assignment of predetermined weights to input and output factors. DEA has been applied for efficiency measurement in various public and private sectors, including the power industry [15,35,53], education [42], R and D performance [14], health care [4], banking [43,46], the military [12], and courts [30]. Extensive reviews and additional applications are available in Seiford [44] and Charnes et al. [10]. The DEA approach was introduced by Charnes et al. [11];this first model is thus called the Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR) model. A DEA model is developed to produce an efficiency frontier based on the concept of the Pareto optimum. The DMUs that lie on the efficiency frontier are non-dominated and are, thus, called Pareto-optimal units or efficient DMUs. DMUs that do not lie on the efficiency frontier are deemed to be relatively inefficient. The CCR model assumes constant returns to scale (CRS), implying that the producers are able to linearly scale the inputs and outputs without increasing or decreasing efficiency. Under this assumption, the overall efficiency scores calculated by input-oriented and output-oriented CCR models are equal. Subsequently, Banker et al. [3] proposed the BCC model, which assumes variable returns to scale (VRS). This approach forms a more restricted feasible region than that of the CCR model and, thus, provides Technical Efficiency (TE) scores greater than or equal to those obtained assuming CRS. DEA provides a relative efficiency measure for peer decision making units (DMUs) with multiple inputs and outputs. While DEA has been proven an effective approach in identifying the best practice frontiers, its flexibility in weighting multiple inputs and outputs and its nature of self-evaluation have been criticized. In most models of DEA, the best performers have an efficiency score of unity, and, from experience, we know that there are usually plural DMUs which have this efficient status. Discriminating between these efficient DMUs is an interesting research subject. Several authors have proposed methods for ranking the best performers. These ranking methods have been divided into seven, somewhat overlapping, areas. The first idea, generally known as the super-efficiency method (see, e.g., [1,58,52,38,24]), ranks through the exclusion of the unit being scored from the dual linear program and an analysis of the change in the Pareto frontier. The idea used in the second group is based on benchmarking (see, e.g., [59]), in which a unit is highly ranked if it is chosen as a useful target for many other units. The third group utilizes multivariate statistical techniques, which are generally applied after the DEA dichotomy classification (see, e.g., [20,50,49]). The fourth research area ranks inefficient units through proportional measures of inefficiency (see, e.g., [6]). The fifth approach requires the collection of additional, preferential information from relevant decision makers (DMs), and combines multiple criteria decision methodologies with the DEA approach (see, e.g., [22,31]). The sixth research area is based on the concept of common weights analysis (see, e.g., [34,28]). The last area involves the evaluation of a cross-efficiency matrix, in which the units are self- and peer-evaluated (see, e.g., [47,16]).

A question that arises when ranking a group of DMUs is whether there is a change in the ranks of other DMUs after the addition or removal of one or more DMUs. Suppose, for instance, that in the evaluation of the branches of a commercial bank, branch A has secured the first rank. Then, another branch with the same inputs and outputs as those of branch A is added to the group. Considering that the other branches have not changed, the management of branch A would naturally expect to preserve their first place, or at least stand second to the new branch. Contrary to this expectation, however, the new ranking reveals that neither branch A nor the new branch has secured the first place. This phenomenon, first observed in MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making) ranking models, is called rank reversal. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), as a very popular multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) approach, has been considerably criticized for its possible rank reversal phenomenon, which means that the relative rankings of two decision alternatives could be reversed when a decision alternative is added or deleted. Such a phenomenon was first noticed and pointed out by Belton and Gear [8], which aroused a long-lasting debate on the validity of AHP and the legitimacy of rank reversal [1–4,10–13,15,16,20–34,36–40].Wang and Luo [60] have shown that the rank reversal phenomenon occurs not only in AHP, but also in many other decision making approaches, such as the BK method for aggregating multiple ordinal preferences, the SAW and the TOPSIS methods for MADM, and the DEA cross-efficiency evaluation method, when a candidate or alternative is added or removed. In this paper, we will demonstrate, by numerical examples that rank reversal occurs in most DEA ranking models. Moreover, some models in which this phenomenon does not occur will also be discussed. In fact, we survey some ranking methods in data envelopment analysis with focus on rank reversal and rank preservation phenomenon. The remainder of the paper is organized into four Sections. In Section 2, we briefly introduce the background of DEA. In Section 3, we demonstrate the rank reversal phenomenon in the cross-efficiency method [47], the super-efficiency models [1,58,38,26,29], and the common weights method [34]. A discussion of some models in which rank reversal does not Section 4. And, finally, the paper is concluded in Section 5.

In this section, we show through numerical examples that the rank reversal phenomenon also occurs in many DEA ranking approaches, such as the cross-efficiency method [47], super-efficiency models [1,58,38,26,29], and the common weights method [34].

The cross-evaluation method was first developed by Sexton et al. [47]. It was developed as a DEA extension tool that can be utilized to identify best performing DMUs and to rank DMUs using cross-efficiency scores that are linked to all DMUs. The main idea of cross-evaluation is to use DEA in a peer-evaluation rather than a self-evaluation mode. Indeed, as Doyle and Green [17] argued, decision makers do not always have a reasonable mechanism by which to choose assurance regions; thus, they recommended the cross-evaluation matrix for ranking units.

                        Cross-efficiency evaluation has been used in various applications, e.g., efficiency evaluation of nursing homes [47], selection of a flexible manufacturing system [48], technology selection [2], determining the most efficient number of operators and the efficient measurement of labor assignment in a cellular manufacturing system (CMS) [19], measuring the performance of the nations in the Summer Olympic Games [65], evaluating computer numerical control (CNC) machines in terms of system specification and cost [54], system R and D project selection [41,68], extension of the analysis of an efficiency and productivity study on a cellular manufacturing system (CMS) [56], preference voting [23,69], rating decision alternatives [63], and so on. Some studies on other DEA issues are very relevant to the cross-efficiency concept (see, e.g., [39,7,37]). Chen [13] compared technical efficiency and cross-efficiency scores in the electricity distribution sector in Taiwan through a DEA framework. Wu et al. [66,67] used the cross-efficiency evaluation method to measure the performance of the nations participating in the last six Summer Olympic Games. They used the cross-efficiency evaluation method because the cross-efficiency score of a DMU is obtained by computing the DMU’s set of n scores (using the n sets of optimal weights), and then averaging those scores [47]. Therefore, cross-efficiency is a better choice for measuring the performance of nations in the Olympic Games. Also, in Wu et al. [64], Liang et al.’s [33] DEA game cross-efficiency model was modified and used to measure the performance of the nations participating in the last six Summer Olympic Games. They extended Liang et al.’s [33] approach to the case of the variable returns to scale (VRS) DEA model. The VRS DEA model can generate negative cross-efficiency scores. They introduced a modification to the VRS DEA model so that the cross-efficiency scores were non-negative. Bao et al. [5] focused on slack analysis for ranking based on peer-evaluation of DMUs. Sun and Lu[55] presented a Cross-Efficiency Profiling (CEP) model that can be used to improve the discrimination power of DEA and conduct a methodological comparison of CEP. Aiming at the flaws when the ultimate average cross-efficiency scores are used to evaluate DMUs, Wu et al. [67] eliminated the assumption of average and considered the DMUs as players in a cooperative game; the characteristic function value of coalitions were defined to compute the Shapley value of each DMU, and the common weights associated with the imputation of the Shapley value were used to determine the ultimate cross-efficiency scores. Wang and Luo [60] applied the cross-efficiency method to an example previously provided by Wong and Beasley [62] to show that rank reversal occurs in the cross-efficiency method. They demonstrated the occurrence of rank reversal once by removing the lowest ranking DMU and once by removing the third output. In this section, we intend to discuss the occurrence of rank reversal without any change in the production possibility set (PPS). To this end, we present an example that depicts the phenomenon when a copy of one of the DMUs is added to the problem.

Consider a problem with five DMUs, each of which uses two inputs to produce one output. Table 1
                         contains the input and output data of the problem, as well as the results obtained by applying the CCR model and the cross-efficiency method to the problem.

Now, we add a copy of DMU4 to the problem and apply the CCR model and the cross-efficiency method to the new problem again. Table 2
                         displays the results.

As can be observed, while such a change in the problem does not alter the PPS, it does change the ranks of DMU2 and DMU3.

Andersen and Petersen [1] developed a new procedure for ranking efficient units. The methodology enables an extreme efficient unit o to achieve an efficiency score greater than one by removing the

However, there are three problematic areas with this methodology. First, Andersen and Petersen refer to the DEA objective function value as a rank score for all units, despite the fact that each unit is evaluated according to different weights. This value in fact explains the proportion of the maximum efficiency score that each unit k attained with its chosen weights in relation to a virtual unit closest to it on the frontier. Furthermore, if we assume that the weights reflect prices, then each unit has different prices for the same set of inputs and outputs within the same organization. Second, the super-efficiency methodology can give specialized DMUs an excessively high ranking. To avoid this problem, Sueyoshi [52] introduced specific bounds on the weights in a super-efficiency ranking model as described in Eq. (2.5).

The third problem lies with an infeasibility issue, which if occurring, means that the super efficiency technique cannot provide a complete ranking of all DMUs. Thrall [57] used the model to identify extreme efficient DMUs and noted that the super-efficiency CCR model may be infeasible. Zhu [71], Dula and Hickman [18], and Seiford and Zhu [45,46] proved conditions under which various super-efficiency DEA models are infeasible. Mehrabian et al. [38] suggested a modification to the dual formulation in order to ensure feasibility, as specified in

                        Despite these drawbacks, possibly because of the simplicity of the concept, many published papers have used this approach. For example, Hashimoto [24] developed a DEA super-efficiency model with assurance regions in order to rank the DMUs completely. Using Model 2.8, Hashimoto avoided the need for accumulating additional preference information in providing a complete ranking of n candidates.

                         place vote (whereby each voter selects and ranks the top t candidates). The use of assurance regions avoids the specialization pitfall of the standard super-efficiency model (taken from [39]). Other super-efficiency ranking models can be found in Tone [58] and Jahanshahloo et al. [26,27,29].

Now, by an example we show that the addition of a copy of one of the DMUs to the PPS may result in rank reversal.

Consider a problem with eight DMUs, where each DMU produces one output by consuming two inputs. Table 3
                         contains the input and output data of the problem and the results obtained from the CCR model and different super-efficiency methods.

Furthermore, the ranks obtained by the DMUs after using different super-efficiency models are presented in Table 4
                        , below.

Now, we add a copy of DMU5 to the above problem and apply the CCR model and different super-efficiency models to the problem again. The results are given in Table 5
                        .

Moreover, the ranks obtained by the DMUs using the various super-efficiency models are provided in Table 6
                        , below.

It can be observed that such a change in the problem has resulted in a change in the ranks of DMU1 and DMU5 in all super-efficiency methods used, although the PPS has not been altered.

The idea of common weights in DEA was first introduced by Cook et al. [8] and Roll et al. [9] in the context of applying DEA to evaluate highway maintenance units. Cook et al. [10,11] gave a subjective ordinal preference ranking by developing common weights through a series of bounded DEA runs, by closing the gap between the upper and lower limits of the weights. Ganley et al. [12] considered the common weights for all the units, by maximizing the sum of efficiency ratios of all the units, in order to rank each unit. They suggested the potential use of the common weights for ranking DMUs. Sinuany-Stern et al. [13] used linear discriminant analysis in order to find a score function which ranks DMUs, given the DEA division into efficient and inefficient sets. Sinuany-Stern et al. [14] developed DR/DEA to provide the best common weights for given inputs and outputs in order to rank all the units on the same scale.

CWA (common weights analysis), proposed by Liu and Peng [34], aims to assist the manager in determining one set of weights assigned to the performance indices, in order to have the best efficiency score for the group of efficient DMUs. Then, the set of weights is regarded as one common set of weights across each efficient DMU, in order to compute its absolute efficiency score for the ranking of DMUs. To solve the ranking problem thoroughly, the assessed target is further expanded to all DMUs, including the inefficient ones. The CWA model to determine the common set of weights for n units with m input indices and s output indices is formulated as follows:

                        Indeed, we can use the above MOLP problem to search for one common set of weights to create the best efficiency score of a group composed of efficient DMUs. In the next subsection, we give some other methods for solving the above-mentioned MOLP, based on the idea of Liang et al. [32]. In this subsection, we apply the idea proposed by Liang et al. [33], to introduce three common weights approaches.

In an MOLP problem, finding a solution that optimizes all objectives simultaneously is generally impossible. Therefore, the task of an MOLP solution process is not to find an optimal solution, but rather to find non-dominated solutions and to help select a most preferred one. Loosely speaking, a solution, represented by a point in the decision variable space, is non-dominated if moving the point within the feasible region to improve an objective function value is impossible without worsening at least one of the other objectives. In multiple criteria terminology, a non-dominated solution is also called an efficient solution.

One fact we would like to point out here is that a non-dominated solution set for an MOLP problem will always contain, but is not limited to, the optimal solutions obtained by individually optimizing each of the objectives in the MOLP problem under the setting of single objective linear programming (LP). For more details about multi-objective optimization, readers are referred to Steuer [51] and Masud [36]. In order to reach a particular non-dominated extreme point, the MOLP formulation (5) can be written in the min-sum approach, the max-ordering approach, or by minimizing the mean absolute deviation. These approaches do not need any inter-objective or other subjective preference information from the decision maker (DM) once the problem constraints and objectives have been defined. Thus, these approaches require that the DM be able to accept the solution obtained from the method. The advantage of adopting these approaches is that in the process of obtaining the solution, the DM will not be disturbed by the analyst, which is desirable from the point of view of the DM. However, a major disadvantage then is that the analyst will have to make many assumptions about the DM’s preference. This is difficult to do with even the best and most knowledgeable analyst. Therefore, we can use an interactive MOLP method such as the step method (or STEM) [9], G-D-F algorithm [21], and Zionts and Wallenius’s method [70] to reflect the DM’s preferences in the process of searching for a common set of weights.

                           . The model used in this procedure, called CWA, was proposed by Liu and Peng [34]. The model aims to assist the manager in determining one set of weights assigned to the performance indices, in order to have the best efficiency score for the group of efficient DMUs. The set of weights is then regarded as one common set of weights across each efficient DMU, in order to compute its absolute efficiency score to rank DMUs. In order to solve the ranking problem completely, the assessed target is further expanded to all DMUs, including the inefficient ones. The CWA model to determine the common set of weights for n units with m input indices and s output indices is formulated as follows:

Now, we indicate rank reversal in the above models by providing an example.

Consider a problem with three DMUs in which each DMU uses two inputs to produce one output. The input and output data of the problem, together with results obtained from the CCR model and various common weights methods and the ranks obtained by each DMU are provided in Table 7
                           .

Now, a copy of DMU3 is added and different common weights models are applied to the problem. Table 8
                            displays the results.

As can be observed, while the PPS has not altered, rank reversal as occurred as a result of the above-mentioned change.

In this section, we first consider the model proposed by Wang and Luo [61] and show that rank reversal does not occur in this method after adding a copy of a DMU. Then, by extending Obata and Ishii’s [40] idea, we provide another model in which rank reversal does not occur either, after a copy of a DMU is added. In the end, we consider another rank preserving model introduced by Jahanshahloo and Afzalinejad [25]. Note that ranking models in which rank reversal does not occur are not limited to these three models. However, it is worth mentioning that in all these three models, ranking is based upon a factor that does not change after adding a copy of a DMU, and this is the key point in rank preservation in these models.

Wang and Luo [61] introduce two virtual DMUs called ideal DMU (IDMU) and anti-ideal DMU (ADMU) into the data envelopment analysis. According to their idea, assume that there are n DMUs to be evaluated, each DMU with m inputs and s outputs.

                           An IDMU is a virtual DMU that can use the least inputs to generate the most outputs, while an ADMU is a DMU that consumes the most inputs only to produce the least outputs.

The method proposed by Wang and Luo [61] is given below. In their method, DEA efficiency evaluation problems will be handled in a different way. The two virtual DMUs, IDMU and ADMU, are used to construct two DEA models for the calculation of the best possible and the worst possible relative efficiencies, respectively. The two distinctive efficiencies are integrated using the well-known TOPSIS approach in multiple attribute decision making (MADM) to generate a composite index called relative closeness (RC) to the IDMU. The RC index will be used as the evidence of overall assessment of each DMU, based on which an overall ranking for all the DMUs can be performed very easily. We summarize their method in the following steps.


                        Step 1: Calculate the highest (best) possible relative efficiency of IDMU using the following model:

Note that the addition of a copy of a DMU does not change IDMU and ADMU; the ranking of DMUs will thus not alter with such a change. The following examples demonstrate cases in which rank reversal does not occur.


                        Table 9
                         contains rankings of the DMUs present in the examples given in previous (sub) sections. That rank reversal does not occur is obvious in these examples.

It is worth noting that the CCR model (Model 2.2) sometimes encounters cases in which alternative weights exist; moreover, different weights can result in different rankings of efficient DMUs. It is necessary for the decision maker (DM) to select the applicable one from among these efficient DMUs. We propose an approach to assist DMs in dealing with the issue of alternative rankings. Observe that one set of output indices with two sets of different index values has the same weighted sum. For the case in which the same weighted sum exists for both sets of different index values by adopting different sets of weights, Obata and Ishii [40] proposed that it is preferable for output indices to adopt the smaller range of weights. In other words, a larger range of output index values is desirable to the DM. They explained that the benefit of the weighted sum comes from the index values themselves, rather than from the individual weights. Similarly, it is preferable to use the larger range of weights for input indices. That is, a smaller range of input index values is desirable to the DM. We extend the above discussion in order to introduce a ranking model as follows:

                         mean, the better the performance of DMU0. In this model, the addition of a copy of a DMU does not result in rank reversal. The same also occurs in the following examples.


                        Table 10
                         below provides the ranking results of the examples given in the previous subsections. Obviously, rank reversal does not occur in these examples.

By introducing the full-inefficient frontier, Jahanshahloo and Afzalinejad [25] proposed a model that considers the distance of DMUs from the frontier as a ranking criterion. They presented their model with the variable returns to scale assumption and in two orientations, the input orientation and mixed orientation, and compared it with other ranking models. It is worth mentioning that the models introduced by these authors are completely similar to the input-oriented BCC model and the additive model with the variable returns to scale assumption, with the exception that they considered an assumption entirely opposite to the feasibility assumption. The additive model proposed by these authors with the constant returns to scale assumption is of the following form.

As can be seen, in the above model, distance from the so-called full-inefficient frontier is used as the ranking criterion. Note that rank reversal does not occur in such models since the addition of a copy of a DMU does not change the full-inefficient frontier. We also show in Table 11
                        , that rank reversal does not occur in the three examples.
                           Remark 1
                           Which method is better? If we want to give a suitable answer to the problem at hand, we should first specify whether rank reversals are always undesirable. Data envelopment analysis is one of the important branches of Decision-making. Decision-making methods are used to make decisions in different aspects of human activities. Given the well-established fact that different methods may yield different answers when fed with exactly the same problem, the question is how to evaluate them. Rank reversals are at the very heart of assessing the merits of such methods. At the same time, they are at the center of many heated debates in this area. Many authors use them as means to criticize decision- making methods or to better explain rational behavior [70]. To explain these two opinions, we consider two simple examples as follows: Suppose that there are two cars available to the decision maker: car A and car B. car A is much cheaper than car B but its overall quality is much less compared with that of car B. On the other hand, car B is more expensive than car A, but it is also of better quality. A decision maker may choose car A. Next, suppose that the car dealer presents to the decision maker a third car, say car C, which is way more expensive than car B but now the overall quality of car C is marginally higher than that of car B. Under such a scenario, it is quite possible for a decision maker to change his opinion and buy car B instead of car A. Such events may take place with many rational decision makers. In other words, rank reversals may actually be possible in rational decision -making. These examples indicate that not only is rank reversal in decision -making not taint but it can also be an advantage. However, let us consider the simple example in the introduction section. We recall that in evaluating the branches of a commercial bank, branch A has secured the first rank. Then, another branch with the same inputs and outputs as those of branch A is added to the group. Considering the fact that the other branches have not changed, the management of branch A would naturally expect to maintain their first place, or at least stand second to the new branch. Contrary to this expectation, however, the new ranking reveals that neither branch A nor the new branch has secured the first place. Therefore, this type of rank reversal occurring in the ranking methods can be a taint for the ranking methods in data envelopment analysis. However, we think that popular methods of ranking in DEA in which the rank reversal occurs should be distinguished from the others. Also, there are some models introduced which rank reversal does not occur.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, by providing simple examples, we demonstrated the occurrence of rank reversal in different ranking models, including cross-efficiency, super-efficiency, and common weights models. Next, we discussed three other models in which the phenomenon does not occur when a copy of a DMU is added to the PPS. Our aim in this paper was to show the occurrence or non-occurrence of rank reversal and change or preservation of the PPS when a copy of a DMU is added to the problem. It is worth mentioning that models with rank reversal are not limited to those discussed in this paper. On the other hand, ranking models can be mentioned in which rank reversal does not occur. What is of great importance here is that in the models in which rank reversal does not occur after the addition of a copy of a DMU, the criterion used for ranking does not change after the addition. Clearly, the ranking models in DEA in which rank reversal does not occur are identified as useful; Finding and introducing such models can be of great help in initiating topics for future research. Moreover, another important point to focus on would be the method of modifying ranking models in which rank reversal does not occur.
