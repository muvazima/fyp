                  While our society began to recognize the importance to balance the risk performance under different risk measures, the existing literature has confined its research work only under a static mean-risk framework. This paper represents the first attempt to incorporate multiple risk measures into dynamic
portfolio selection. More specifically, we investigate the dynamic mean-variance-CVaR (Conditional value at Risk) formulation and the dynamic mean-variance-SFP (Safety-First Principle) formulation in a continuous-time setting, and derive the analytical solutions for both problems. Combining a downside risk measure with the variance (the second order central moment) in a dynamic mean-risk portfolio selection model helps investors control both a symmetric central risk measure and an asymmetric catastrophic downside risk. We find that the optimal portfolio policy derived from our mean-multiple risk portfolio optimization models exhibits a feature of curved V-shape. Our numerical experiments using real market data clearly demonstrate a dominance relationship of our dynamic mean-multiple risk portfolio policies over the static buy-and-hold portfolio policy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One fundamental principle behind the mean-variance (MV) portfolio selection formulation proposed by Markowitz (1952) is to strike a balance between maximizing the expected terminal wealth and minimizing the investment risk. Please refer to Kolm, Tütüncü, and Fabozzi (2014) for a review of the research progress in portfolio optimization during the past 60 years. As a natural generalization of the MV analysis, a general class of mean-risk portfolio optimization models has already become a fundamental instrument in real-world portfolio management. The last half century has witnessed numerous risk measures proposed in the literature. Please see Krokhmal, Zabarankin, and Uryasev (2011) for a comprehensive review. At the same year when Markowitz published his seminal work of the MV formulation, Roy (1952) proposed the fundamental safety-first principle (SFP) in portfolio selection, which concerns the probability that disastrous events happen, a risk measure concentrating on the tail of a distribution, instead of the central moments. Following the same concept of SFP to measure the downside risk, the Value-at-Risk(VaR) is defined as the quantile of the loss under certain confidence level. Although VaR is popular in financial industry (RiskMetricTM
                      
                     Morgen, 1996), the VaR has been widely criticized for some of its undesired properties (Tasche, 2002). More specifically, VaR fails to qualify as a coherent risk measure, as it violates some axioms of the coherent risk measures proposed by Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, and Heath (1999). As a modification of the VaR, the conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) proposed by Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000) and Rockafellar and Uryasey (2002) is defined as the average value of the loss greater than the VaR for a given confidence level. CVaR has attracted increasing attention in recent years as CVaR is a coherent risk measure proved by Acerbi and Tasche (2002). More importantly, the convexity of the CVaR measure leads to a tractable optimization model of the corresponding mean-CVaR portfolio formulation and its extensions, see, e.g., Alexander and Baptista (2002), Rockafellar and Uryasey (2002), Zhu and Fukushima (2009) and Huang, Zhu, Fabozzi, and Fukushima (2010). While almost all mean-risk frameworks in the literature adhere to a single risk measure, Roman, Darby-Dowman, and Mitra (2007) proposed recently a static portfolio selection model with a combined risk measure of both variance and CVaR, which offers a new way of thinking under the mean-risk framework.

Various dynamic mean-risk portfolio optimization models have been developed according to different risk measures. The past 15 years has witnessed rapid progresses of the dynamic MV formulation by leaps and bounds, see Li and Ng (2000), Zhou and Li (2000), Li, Zhou, and Lim (2001), Zhu, Li, and Wang (2004), Bielecki, Jin, Pliska, and Zhou (2005), Basak and Chabakauri (2010), Cui, Li, Wang, and Zhu (2012), Cui, Gao, Li, Li, (2014). The earliest work on dynamic mean-SFP portfolio selection model by Li, Chan, and Ng (1998) approximates the SFP measure by using the Bienaymé–Tchebycheff Inequality as did in the original work of Roy (1952), which in turn leads back to a dynamic MV formulation. However, when the underlying distribution of the random return is not normally distributed and is asymmetric, such an approximation method is certainly not accurate enough and basically loses the essential feature of the safety-first principle. As for the mean-CVaR portfolio models, the current state-of-the-art still remains mainly at the level of static formulations which generate optimal buy-and-hold portfolio policies, e.g., see Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000), Alexander and Baptista (2002), Rockafellar and Uryasey (2002), Zhu and Fukushima (2009), Künzi-Bay and János (2006) and Huang et al. (2010). Different from MV portfolio optimization where only the first two central moments of the distribution are needed, the distribution information of the returns is always required in computing the CVaR of the portfolio loss. Thus, either an explicit distribution function or a discrete distribution is assumed in mean-CVaR portfolio optimization. The past several years have witnessed efforts to extend static mean-CVaR optimization models to two-period or multi-period settings, see, e.g., Fábián (2006), Fábián and Szoke (2007), Hibiki (2006). However, due to the assumption of the discrete scenario of the returns, these models often lead to a computational intractability while the number of scenario and/or periods is only relatively large. By using the dynamic programming approach, Siegmann and Lucas (2005) studied the loss aversion based dynamic portfolio allocation model which is related to mean-downside risk portfolio optimization. As for continuous-time models, Jin, Yan, and Zhou (2005) showed that a general class of mean-downside risk portfolio optimization problem in continuous-time setting is ill-posed in the sense that the optimal value cannot be achieved. Despite of such a negative result, there do exist research works that integrate the downside risk measure into the utility maximization model in continuous-time, e.g., Basak and Shapiro (2001) considered the VaR constraint on the terminal wealth, and Yiu (2004) extended such a result to the case when the VaR constraint is imposed for the entire investment process. Chiu, Wong, and Li (2012) modified the original mean-SFP formulation reasonably by imposing an upper bound on the terminal wealth level and completely solved the continuous-time mean-SFP asset-liability problem.

Different risk measures emphasize different aspects of the random investment loss. While the variance measures the deviation of the random variable from the expected value, Roy’s safety-first principle (SFP) (Roy, 1952) focuses on the extreme events in the tail part of the random return distribution. While SFP is a probability measure, the CVaR is a conditional expectation conditioned on that losses are greater than the VaR for a given confidential level. If we examine the investment performance according to different spectra of the risk measures, any policy generated from a mean-risk portfolio model with a sole risk measure may not become a good choice. Roman et al. (2007) showed that the optimal policy generated from the mean-CVaR portfolio model could induce a very large variance, which leads to a small Sharpe ratio. The confidential level of the loss in CVaR is usually set at 95 or 99 percent. Intuitively speaking, the CVaR focuses on the 5 or 
                        
                           1
                           
                           percent
                        
                     tail part of the random return distribution, which neglects the risk exhibited in other parts of the distribution. On the other hand, the CVaR of the portfolio generating from the traditional MV model could be also unacceptably large. To overcome the inconsistence between the policies generated from the MV and mean-downside risk models, Roman et al. (2007) proposed to combine the CVaR and the variance together as two risk measures in a multi-objective portfolio optimization problem. After solving these static optimization problems, Roman et al. (2007) showed the advantage of these portfolio models with multiple risk measures by checking them against various market data sets.

Motivated by the work in Roman et al. (2007) under a static setting, we consider in this paper its extension to dynamic portfolio selection with multiple risk measures. More specifically, we consider in this work two kinds of dynamic mean-multiple risk portfolio optimization models, namely, the dynamic mean-variance-CVaR (MVC) and the dynamic mean-variance-SFP (MVS) portfolio optimization problems. To our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature studying dynamic mean-multiple risk portfolio optimization models. Compared to the existing literature, our contributions include several significant features. Under our market setting, we are able to derive the analytical forms of the portfolio policy for both MVC and MVS portfolio optimization models. Due to the combined risks in the objective function, our multiple-risks based portfolio model conquers the ill-posedness of the mean-downside risk portfolio optimization model with a sole downside risk (Jin et al., 2005). We also reveal a key difference of our portfolio model with the well known dynamic MV portfolio policy, e.g., see Li and Ng (2000), Zhou and Li (2000), Bielecki et al. (2005). The optimal portfolio policies derived from both MVC and MVS exhibit a curved V-shape property, i.e., with respect to a certain level of the current wealth, both of the MVC and MVS portfolio policies increase the allocation to the risky assets in both directions. Compared with the static MVC model proposed by Roman et al. (2007), our newly derived dynamic MVC portfolio policy can reduce both the variance and the CVaR measures significantly.

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. We present the market setting and problem formulations in Section 2. We investigate and solve completely the dynamic MVC and dynamic MVS formulations in Section 3 and Section 4, respectively. In Section 5, we compare the dynamic MVC and MVS portfolio policies with the dynamic MV portfolio policy via two illustrative examples. We also compare our dynamic MVC portfolio model with the static buy-and-hold portfolio policy. Throughout of the paper, we use notation 1

We adopt the CVaR definition of the loss given by Rockafellar and Uryasey (2002), which is a unified definition applied for all loss functions with a continuous or a discontinuous distribution.

                     where the integration in (2) degenerates to a summation if the β-tail distribution function of L(x(T)) is discrete. The CVaR definition in (2) is actually the mean value of the β-tail distribution of the loss L(x(T)). Such a definition of CVaR covers general distribution functions of the loss function L(x(T)).

                     where ω ≥ 0 is a weighting parameter, which balances the importance of the two risk measures. Note that, for a fixed value of d, varying the parameter ω generates the efficient frontier in the two-dimensional variance-CVaR space. Varying both d and ω generates the efficient surface in the three-dimensional mean-variance-CVaR space. Similarly, we can also consider the following mean-variance-SFP (MVS) portfolio selection model,

Due to the constraints in (4)–(6), it is difficult to solve problem

                     directly by using the classical stochastic control approach. We use, instead, the martingale approach to solve problem

                     see, e.g., Pliska (1986) and Karatzas and Shreve (1998). The main idea of the martingale approach is to decompose the solution process into two phases: i) solving first a static optimization problem to determine the optimal terminal wealth x
                     *(T); and ii) identifying next the portfolio policy which replicates such an optimal wealth x
                     *(T). Under our market setting, the market is complete. Thus, we can compute the market price of risk as

Under Assumption 3.1, the deflator process, z(t), defined in (10) implies that z(T)/z(t) follows a log-normal distribution, i.e.,

Note that the optimal α

                           are represented by the market state z(t). Although z(t) can be computed by observing the price S(t) when the market is complete, z(t), in general, cannot be observed directly. Thus, it is more favorable to have the feedback form of the portfolio policy, i.e., representing the portfolio policy π
                           *(t) in terms of the current wealth x
                           *(t). This can be done by eliminating z(t) from (22) and (23) numerically, i.e., we can compute the value of x
                           *(t) and π
                           *(t) for a set of discrete value of z(t). Then, we can build up a mapping between π
                           *(t) and x
                           *(t) by using a curve fitting method.

                           2 ≤ ω, the optimal solution of (34) is given as in (30), and, when γ
                           2 > ω, the optimal solution of (34) becomes (32). At this point, X
                           * is the solution in minimizing the Lagrange function g(X). To achieve the strong duality, substituting X
                           * into (13) and (14) forces the feasibility of X
                           *, thus yielding the results in (31) and (33), respectively, for the cases of γ
                           2 ≤ ω and γ
                           2 > ω.□

                           (corresponding to ω > 0) allocates more in the risky asset than the MV portfolio policy does when the market condition is good. These findings actually show that model

                           removes the drawback of a symmetrical penalization on both gain and loss parts of the terminal wealth from adopting the variance term as a risk measure in the MV portfolio model.

                           policy is more sensitive to the deviation of the current wealth from the threshold. As for the time effect, we can see that, when the remaining investment horizon becomes shorter, the

                           policy becomes more sensitive to the deviation of the current wealth from the threshold. This effect can be interpreted as the reverse time-diversification, i.e., allocating more wealth in the risky asset when facing shorter investment horizon.

We compare in this example our dynamic MVC portfolio optimization model with the static buy-and-hold policy in Roman et al. (2007). We adopt a similar market setting given by Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000), where the risky assets are the Standard & Poor index (S&P 500), the long-term US Government Bond (Bond) and the US Small capital index (SamllCap). Following Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000), the annual expected return rate R and the covariance matrix Q can be estimated as given in Table 2
                           . We also assume that there is a risky free asset with an annual return rate

More specifically, we first randomly generate 105 samples of the returns of the three assets from the log-normal distribution according to the mean and covariance listed in Table 2. We then compute the CVaR value of the Buy-and-Hold policy by solving the correspondent linear programming problem associated with these samples by using the CPLEX solver.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have advanced the current literature on dynamic mean-risk portfolio selection formulations by incorporating multiple risk measures, have achieved convincing advantages over the static counterpart of such a type, and have demonstrated an ability to balance and manage wide spectra of the risk. By using the martingale approach, we have derived the solutions of the mean-variance-CVaR (MVC) and mean-variance-SFP (MVS) portfolio optimization formulations analytically, when the market coefficients are deterministic. The portfolio policies of both MVC and MVS models exhibit a feature of curved V-shape, i.e., the larger the distance from the current wealth level to the tip of the curved V function (from both sides), the larger the allocation in the risky assets when the wealth level is either below or above certain level (with a highly nonlinear pattern).

We may, instead, consider an alternative formulation to include only one of three performance measures, the mean, the variance, or CVaR (or SFP) in the objective function, while placing the other two as constraints with given constraint levels. We can also derived the analytical solutions for these alternative formulations. The relationships between these two different formulations are studied in Li, Yang, and Biswal (1999).

                           . By using the similar argument in Lemma 5.2 in Bielecki et al. (2005), we can show that H(ρ) is a non-decreasing function with respect to ρ. Thus, we can find the infimum of H(ρ) by setting

                           we can use a similar method to show that the equations have no solution. Note that when

                           it is also easy to check that there is no solution for Eqs. (17) and (18). Thus, under the assumption given in the proposition, we only need to consider the positive solution η > 0 for Eqs. (17) and (18).□

                           Applying Lemma 7.1 to the expressions in (43) and (44) and further combining both cases of (i) and (ii) yield the uniformed expressions in (41) and (42), which completes the proof.□
