                  In this methodology, a potential energy is initially defined over each possible model for the relationship (1), what allows the application of the Lagrangian mechanics to the derived system. The solution of the Euler–Lagrange in this system allows obtaining the optimal solution according to the minimal action principle. The defined Lagrangian, corresponds to a continuous medium, where a n-dimensional finite elements model has been applied, so it is possible to get a solution for the problem solving a compatible and determined linear symmetric equation system.
                  The computational implementation of the methodology has resulted in an improvement in the process of get representation models obtained and published previously by the authors.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the study and modelling of complex systems, as the natural ones, in which the number of relationships and variables can be great, it is important to get modelling methodologies that help to the knowledge of the system and allow the use in hybrid form. One of the biggest problems in this kind of problems is the a priori knowledge of the relationships between the components from which are possible to obtain experimental data. The methodology developed in this work is a revision of that presented in [8,9], resulting in a new theoretical basis and a substantial improvement in the applicability and the algorithmic efficiency.

The available methodologies to study these problems is so enhanced and complemented by the previous studies, published in the scientific works [2–4,10,11].

Lagrange’s formulation of classic mechanics [5], allows the study of physical systems in a formal mode, introducing an abstraction level on the considered problems. To this, the definition of a Lagrangian function over the space of states of a system is needed, where that state is defined by a set of variables, named generalized variables (q

The interpolation is constructed with the union of local interpolations, having several possibilities to make this construction. The generation of a n-dimensional geometric model from the finite elements model is done from the definition of the type of the elements and the number of nodes defined on a generic element, as the different types of numbering and coordinates defined, and its relationships.

The elements defined in dimension n are n-dimensional hypercubes. Each segment of the generic hypercube is locally transformed in the interval [−1,1], so it can be identified with the domain [−1,1]
                           d
                        . In each one of these elements are defined 2
                           d
                         nodes.

Complexity of the geometric model is the number of intervals in which each segment [0,1] is divided. Therefore, the original domain [0,1]
                           n
                         is divided in a set of cn
                         hypercubics subdomains.

The elements have a global index between 0 and cn
                        
                        −1, and with a similar argument, a global index for the nodes between 0 and (c
                        +1)
                           n
                        
                        −1 is defined.

In the hypercubic elements defined and selected, the form functions are:

In 2-dimensional models, the representation model can be visualized as an elastic surface that deforms to approach itself to the experimental data, as can be shown in Fig. 1
                        .

Using of finite elements method, suppose to have a deformable mesh, where the finite elements are squares with aristae of length h. The problem is defined in this way by the distance to the experimental data, depending of the set of values {ui
                        }.

The mesh vertex can be considered as an elastic material that allows defining potential energies associated to the deformation.

In matrix form, the system can be written as:
                              
                                 (30)

                                    U
                                    +
                                    c
                                    ·
                                    Θ
                                    ·
                                    U
                                    =
                                    Y
                                 
                              
                           that is a symmetric and determined system (physical analogy assure us the existence of a solution).

When c is equal to 0, the equations corresponding to the methodology presented in [8,9] are obtained.

Although at the beginning the explications have been developed from the 2-dimensional case, none of the definitions or expressions depend of this bidimensional character, so the obtained equations, and particularly the form of the system, is valid for any dimension.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In the article [9] the developed method was applied to the study of two problems. Ahead, these results will be compared with the obtained with the new one.

The data, in Table 1
                        , were used in a work on the concrete properties published in “Industrial and Engineering Chemistry” in 1932:

In the next Table 2
                        , runs of the program for the old and the new methodologies are showed in order to compare the values of the parameters of the solutions:

The next Fig. 4
                         compares the values of the average rugosity parameter for the generated models in the two methodologies.

Data study one chemical reaction in which coal is involved, as can be shown in Table 3
                        .

Comparing again the runs of the program for the old and the new methodologies in Table 4
                        .

The next Fig. 5
                         compares the values of the average rugosity parameter for the generated models in the two methodologies.

In the presented examples, the solution of the corresponding systems have been studied, studying the possibility of extend the power of calculus in the new algorithm. To this, in an equivalent computation time, the solution for complexity 10 is obtained, that is a system with 14.641 variables, where the last algorithm just achieved to solve a 4.096 nodes problem.

In the second case the improvement is even greater, because the problem size has growth from 4.096×4.096 to 46.656×46.656 nodes.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

One of the previous method characteristics were that in most part of the cases the system was undetermined. By this reason two operations were used:
                           
                              
                                 Variable selection – In the set of equations, those with a better numerical behavior were selected using a RRQR algorithm [1,7]. This process increased the computational cost and converted the matrix in a quasi-dense matrix, what making more difficult the solving process.


                                 Rigidization – To complete the set of equations was necessary to create new relations between the variables. That was done by rigidization. This rigidization process was conceptually equivalent to give elastic properties to some nodes, adding the equations derived in this article to these nodes. The unreasoned assignation of these properties and the fact of the (in any way) arbitrary selection of some nodes and no selection of the rest made not entirely satisfactory the theoretical background of the methodology.

Moreover, the new method results in a linear equation system where the matrix is symmetric, making easier the solving process, using master algorithms as the preconditioned conjugate gradient [6].

In the most part of the cases, the system matrix is a sparse or quasi-sparse matrix, lowering the memory waste.

Calculations have been made on a laptop with 2GHz processor and 3GB of RAM.

As was commented in [8,9], the natural next step is to extend the methodology to environments of high performance computing (HPC), with software parallelization, enhancing the applicability of the methodology.

On the other side, the huge size of the linear system and the characteristics of the problem, open the possibility of the study of alternative methods of resolution, as the heuristic ones.

Another side to study is the influence of the value of the binding constant between the potentials energies, c, to search the existence of some optimal value for this parameter.
