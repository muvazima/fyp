                  Population growth creates a challenge to food availability and access. To balance supply with growing demand, more food has to move from production to consumption sites. Moreover, demand for locally-grown food is increasing and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) seeks to develop and strengthen regional and local food systems. This article examines wholesale facility (hub) locations in food supply chain systems on a national scale to facilitate the efficient transfer of food from production regions to consumption locations. It designs an optimal national wholesale or hub location network to serve food consumption markets through efficient connections with production sites. The mathematical formulation is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem that minimizes total network costs which include costs of transporting goods and locating facilities. A scenario study is used to examine the model's sensitivity to parameter changes, including travel distance, hub capacity, transportation cost, etc. An application is made to the U.S. fruit and vegetable industry. We demonstrate how parameter changes affect the optimal locations and number of wholesale facilities.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

As the population grows, food production must expand to meet growing demand and food has to move efficiently from producing to consuming regions. Concurrently, demand for locally-produced food in the United States has also increased sharply, and the USDA has implemented a Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food educational program designed to promote local and regional agriculture. Attention to locally-produced food is believed to address in part the twin problems of “food deserts” and high obesity rates. At the same time, wholesalers, shippers, and processors face perishability and freshness challenges because of the limited shelf life of their products. Serving each individual production–consumption node in an efficient and timely manner could reduce waste, transportation and inventory costs as well as final product prices while raising profits. To reduce costs and provide food to consumption sites efficiently, we employ the concept of hubs and model their optimal locations within a logistical network.

Working with farmers, wholesalers, shippers, processors and retailers, USDA seeks to develop and strengthen regional and local food systems (Martinez et al., 2010).  Small and mid-sized farmers often struggle with access to trucks, warehouse/storage and distribution infrastructures to deliver their products to retailers and consumers quickly and efficiently. To make it easier especially for small and midsize farmers to deliver their products to market more quickly, USDA has proposed the establishment of so-called regional “food hub” services. USDA's working definition of a food hub is “a centrally located facility with a business management structure facilitating the aggregation, storage, processing, distribution, and/or marketing of locally/ regionally produced food products.”

                           http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/12/14/getting-to-scale-with-regional-food-hubs/.
                      Food hubs need active coordination and business management to provide wide access to retail markets for small to mid-sized farmers. In this way, consumer access to fresh and healthy food may potentially increase. Moreover, by relying on intermediate regional food hubs rather than only direct retail markets, more places including underserved areas and food deserts could potentially be covered. Hubs serve as consolidation centers to aggregate flows from several origins, and then allow them to be shipped to several destinations. Hubs allow the direct links between each origin destination pair to be replaced with fewer indirect connections between them. A hub in a food supply chain system is defined as an intermediate node that connects with more than one production location and more than one consumption location to consolidate product flows.

To assess the implications of significantly increasing the role of locally produced foods in satisfying existing consumer demand, we design an optimal logistic location network that eases access through efficient connections between production and consumption sites while satisfying overall demand in the network. To consider the role of local/regional sourcing of products, we introduce shipping constraints, examine tradeoffs from a bimodal transportation system, and carry out numerous sensitivity analyses. The model is mathematically formulated as a mixed integer programming problem and it minimizes total network costs which include costs of transporting goods and constructing hub facilities. The mathematical program considers several constraints such as maximum travel distance to assure that local food products are used when available, hub capital cost and capacity, road condition, and other transportation cost factors.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a short background on the hub location problem. Section 3 provides a problem definition and formulation. Section 4 discusses the solution methodologies. Section 5 shows the experimental results and analysis and Section 6 presents our conclusion and future work.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

Hub location problems are of interest to interdisciplinary researchers from fields as diverse operations research (Rieck, Ehrenberg, & Zimmermann, 2014), transportation (Aros-Vera, Marianov, & Mitchell, 2013; Lüer-Villagra & Marianov, 2013), telecommunications (Klincewicz, 1998), economics (Etemadnia, Hassan, Goetz, & Abdelghany, 2013), supply chain management (Eskigun et al., 2005), logistics (Ishfaq & Sox, 2011), oil reservoir management (Tavallali, Karimi, Halim, Baxendale, & Teo, 2014), and geography and others. The hub location problem involves locating consolidating facilities when flow (travelers, airline passengers, telecom messages, cargo, farm products, mail, etc.) must be sent from origin to destination nodes (e.g., cities). Trips between origin–destination (OD) nodes may represent direct links between OD pairs or indirect paths passing through a hub. A potential hub emerges whenever establishing a direct link between OD pairs is either challenging or costly.


                     Campbell (1994) defined a fundamental set of hub location problems, while a comprehensive introduction, survey, and commentary review on hub location research is given by Campbell and O'Kelly (2012); Alumur and Kara (2008); Klose and Drexl (2005); Campbell, Ernst, and Krishnamoorthy (2002); and Klincewicz (1998). Hubs allow more OD nodes to be connected through fewer links. Hubs reduce the cost of consolidating flows by providing economies of scale (Horner & O'Kelly, 2001) in traffic flow which are critical for minimizing transportation costs. Hubs serve to concentrate the flow from origin nodes through in-bound links and de-concentrate the flow to destination nodes throughout-bound links. Hub-locating is well established in practice (Eiselt, 2007), and it has become common in large-scale transportation and telecommunication systems (Lium, Crainic, & Wallace, 2009). A network of hubs helps to reduce the total transportation cost within a distribution system while providing better and faster services to satisfy the needs of the existing demand in the network (Darwish & Odah, 2010). Fig. 1
                      shows different paths which connect production nodes pi
                      to consumption nodes cj
                      through consolidation hubs hh
                      via indirect links. Even though a direct link from production to consumption node would appear to be shorter, actually connecting each production node to each consumption node through direct links is either infeasible or would increase the total cost of the logistic network (Campbell, 1994; Campbell & O'Kelly, 2012; Klincewicz, 1998).

The hub location problem involves siting a facility to reduce shipping costs as a benefit to the entire system by routing the flow through hubs. In their generic description of hub location problems (Campbell and O'Kelly, 2012) define a hub network as consisting of:

                        
                           (1)
                           Origin and destination nodes

Hub nodes

Access links that connect non-hub origin and destination nodes to hub nodes

Hub links that connect two hub nodes, and

(Possibly) links that connect non-hub OD nodes directly

Most facility location problems including the hub location problem can be studied as a network design problem with location (Contreras & Fernandez, 2012). Various constraints and other properties related to the design and location of the logistics network need to be considered. In particular, the constraints on how the OD nodes are connected play a significant role in deciding where to locate hub nodes so as to minimize overall cost.

In applying a wholesale hub network to the food supply chain system we are concerned with the location of physical facilities with an emphasis on transportation as the main application. “Food Hub” establishments have received growing attention after USDA initiated the concept of “Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food (KYF2)”. The idea behind KYF2 is to build a stronger relationship between farmers and consumers and support the use of local and regional food products (USDA report April 2012). KYF2 recognizes that one of the main challenges especially for smaller farmers is lack of access to distribution facilities and high transportation costs. Greater access to distribution facilities could help producers meet the growing demand for locally and regionally produced food in more markets. Responding to these challenges, USDA established a regional food hub committee to examine how to expand access to more regionally- and locally-grown food. As described in the USDA report (United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Marketing Service, 2012) one of the main focus areas is on the wholesale market industry to determine the availability of infrastructure and services that can be used by regional and local food hubs. Specifically, the report states (page 2):

                        
                           “USDA and its partners in the National Food Hub Collaboration readily recognize that regional food hubs on their own will not be able to solve the myriad of distribution challenges—not to mention production and processing challenges—that hinder producers’ abilities to take full advantage of the growing consumer demand for locally grown food. This will require greater engagement with the existing food distribution and wholesale industry (such as grower-shippers, specialty and broadline distributors, wholesalers, brokers, produce wholesale markets, and terminal markets) to determine how food hubs can complement and add value to the already critical role that these operations are providing in moving food to markets.”
                        
                     
                  

Therefore it is worth studying the optimal location of wholesale markets to ensure greater availability and access to these locations for producers (especially regional and local producers) and consumers (markets).

In Fig. 2 County Business pattern data and farm-level data from the Census of Agriculture is used to show the continental U.S. fruit and vegetable (F&V) industries’ supply chain map. F&V farms, processing facilities, refrigerating and wholesale as well as retail markets are shown at the county level. One goal of our work is to investigate whether these wholesale hubs are located optimally considering transport impedance values. This infrastructure has built up over many years, but recent years have seen the rapid growth in retail market shares controlled by large national food retailers that are increasingly building and operating their own distribution networks (e.g., Konig, 2009; USDA/ERS undated; Volpe, Rogers, & Leibtag, 2013). This rapid change may have left a sub-optimal location of the existing wholesale hub infrastructure. Impedance (Yeager & Gatrell, 2014) is a measure of resistance to movement, such as travel along a highway. These impedance measures are used to operationalize the concept of accessibility in transport planning studies (Horner & O'Kelly, 2001). The analysis of impedance is based on cost descriptors and transportation network characteristics and hierarchies. It is related to the physical parameters on the road systems such as conditions and events within residential, traffic congestion in the network, highway road level of service. Each link in the network is assigned an impedance value, which represents likelihood of the mileage based on the flow on each link. The higher impedance is for a link than the actual mileage, the higher the impact of travel time/cost on that link. For our optimization model we obtain the impedance measures from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Center for Transportation Analysis website (http://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/SkimTree.htm). In the problem formulation, the impedance factor between counties is used to evaluate the optimality of the hub locations. However, it is also important to understand how optimal hub locations adjust over time when several associated constraints in locating the hubs change. For example the impedance factor can change over time based on changes in road services within the transportation network (e.g., changes in road congestion affect impedance values).

The generic mathematical program developed in Etemadnia et al. (2013) is applied here, and the objective function is modified to include the variable of shipping commodities more than a certain threshold distance to satisfy demand. A total transport system cost function is minimized subject to the location of hubs and routing of product flows to serve demand in the network. System costs include the cost of transporting food to and from the hubs and establishing the hub facilities. There are two possible transportation modes, namely land and air transfers, and food transportation cost is a function of travel distance (impedance). Throughout this paper, we calculate travel distance as a function of impedance mileage (instead of highway mileage); transportation occurs among wholesale markets (hubs), production facilities (production/supply) and retail markets (consumption), all of which are located in specific counties. We consider travel from production sites to hubs and from hubs to consumption sites. One county can be a production region, a hub location, and/or a consumption site. This means that a production region can also be the location of a hub to support not only other consumption locations but also the same county. Table 1
                      presents the indices and variables used in the model.

The objective function of the model along with the constraints is given in (1)–(8) and we refer to this as model (M):

                     f(dih
                     ) and f(dhj
                     ) are impedance values which are a function of highway miles between production node i and hub h, and hub h and consumption node j, respectively. FS and FD are the subsets of production node-to-hub and hub-to-consumption node allocations, respectively. FS and FD subsets are screened base on the distance thresholds. The potential node-to-hub and hub-to-node allocations in FS and FD – (i, h) ∈ FS and (h, j) ∈ FD – support land transportation. Associating lower transportation cost, CL, the first and the second terms in the objective function involve locating hub facilities within the threshold distances. However, because of the consolidated nature of production regions, we may not be able to satisfy all demand considering the maximum travel distance constraint. Therefore, connections with (i, h)∉FS and (h, j)∉FD can only be supported via air transportation at a higher cost. Although the preferred long distance mode need not be air, the important distinction here is that a higher cost mode is required to overcome long distance. The third and fourth terms in the objective function allow the hubs to be located farther from production and consumption regions but this involves higher transport cost, CA. In other words, subsets FS and FD encourage the location of hubs to be within the stated maximum distance from production and consumption nodes (where the maximum determines what can still be considered “local” food). The last term in the objective function captures the cost of establishing each hub; for present purposes we assume a value equal to $100,000 for the fixed cost. This allows us to capture the tradeoffs between fixed and marginal cost (limitations of this approach are discussed in Section 6).

Constraints 2 and 3 assure that the balance of total substances (∑
                        h
                     
                     msih
                     ) transferred from production region i to all hubs,H, are less than or equal to total supply, pi
                     , in region i, and the balance of total substances (∑
                        h
                     
                     mdhj
                     ) transferred from all hub locations, H, to consumption markets j are equal to total consumption demand, cj
                     , in location j, respectively. Constraint 4 is a hub balance constraint which indicates that the inbound flow at each hub location as a transition location equals the outbound flow. Constraints 5–8 ensure that no production and consumption node is assigned to a hub location unless a hub exists or is opened at that site. In other words Zh
                      must equal 1 before any other node can be allocated toh. Eqs. (5) and (7) determine the upper bound Uh
                      for both supply-to-hub and hub-to-demand node flow for each hub; similarly Eqs. (6) and (8) fix their lower bound Lh
                      respectively. Uh
                      and Lh
                      also define the hub capacity and lower flow limit in each hub h, due to the fact that the hub balance (Eq. (4)) does not allow any storage (accumulation) or production in a hub. Therefore, if Uh
                      and Lh
                      for hubs are defined, the model is complete, which implies using only one constraint from Eqs. (5) and (7) and another one from Eqs. (6) and (8) would suffice. However, since this model is a mixed integer programming model, providing constraints that directly limit the variables can be beneficial (Eiselt & Sandblom, 2000). Therefore in this study we used the entire Eqs. (5) to (7).

Model (M) is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model with numerous possible node-hub combinations. Since each county can simultaneously be a production node, a hub, or a consumption node, there are numerous possible combinations. The number of these combinations increases significantly with an increase in the number of counties; as an example, for 10, 30 and 50 counties, there are more than 105, 3 × 1010 and 5 × 1016 possible combinations, respectively. Clearly, solving such a large combinatorial problem needs special attention to reduce the huge computational expenses. Considering the relatively high cost of establishing a hub, we expect that only a portion of potential hub candidates are selected and many potential hub candidates would be rejected. The following heuristic is developed to use this idea to considerably reduce the computational time.

Similar to any branch and bound/cut algorithms, we initially relax the integer variables (0 ≤ Zh
                      ≤ 1) of model (M) and solve a relaxed MILP (RMILP) as a linear programming problem. Let us refer to that as model (RM). The solution to this model would potentially contain some excluded nodes with Zh
                      = 0 and some potential hubs with Zh
                      ≠ 0. The binary value of the former hubs (Zh
                      = 0) suggests that they were not effective even in a relaxed model; hence, we omit these hub candidates from the model (M) and build a smaller sized model called Intermediate Model (IM). Naturally, this new model (IM) eliminates Zh, msih, mdhj
                      variables and all associated constraints related to Zh
                      = 0, and can be solved much faster. This approach was already successfully tested in industrial size problems (Susarla & Karimi, 2012). Therefore there are clear incentives for applying that to our problem.

From the above description, TCRM
                      ≤ TC ≤ TCIM
                     , and the optimality gap ratio for model (M) is defined as |TCRM
                      − TCIM
                     |/TCRM
                     . This can be used to measure the drift divergence from the optimal solution. Fig. 3
                      shows the algorithm described above.

The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports state level annual production statistics for 21 different fresh market vegetable crops across 37 States (USDA/NASS, 2009a). The 2007 statistics are allocated down to counties in these 37 States based on harvested county acreage for these same 21 fresh market vegetable commodities, using table 30 in the 2007 Census of Agriculture (USDA/NASS, 2009b). To overcome data suppressions in the Census data, a constrained maximum likelihood mathematical programming model was used. The model minimized adjustments to the variance weighted initial estimates of suppressed data to align these initial estimates with the adding up requirements of the hierarchical table 30 data. This hierarchy includes requirements that the sum of harvested crop acreage across all commodities equal the published county-wide total harvested vegetable acreage, and that the sum of harvested acreage for specific crops across all counties in a state equal the published statewide total for each crop. By simultaneously solving a state/county model and a national/state model for the same commodities, the model produces maximum likelihood estimates of all suppressed county harvested acreage statistics (Canning, 2013). The same approach was used for estimates of fresh market fruit production in U.S. counties, based on annual production statistics of 34 different fresh market fruit and berry crops across 43 States (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2009c, 2009d), and tables 31 and 32 of the Census data (USDA/NASS, 2009b). Combined production for the subset of these 55 crops produced in each county are converted to a common unit (tons) and summed to a single production statistic per county.

Fruit and vegetable imports by county reflect the ports of unlading for all 2007 imports of fresh fruits and vegetable commodities, obtained from the “Port Data” product published by the Foreign Trade Division of the U.S. Bureau of the Census (www.census.gov/foreign-trade/). All U.S. ports of unlading data were converted to tons, mapped to a host county, and (where applicable) summed to a single county-wide import statistic. Export data is compiled the same way using statistics from the same “Port Data” product. For exports, the counties host one or more international ports of departure.

Consumption in each county can be estimated by multiplying U.S. per capital consumption of fruits and vegetables by county population; however, since the model normalizes total consumption to total availability and assumes that food loss occurs at the same rate between all production and consumption nodes, only the county population statistics are required. July 1, 2007 estimates published by the U.S. Census Bureau are used for this purpose (http://www.census.gov/popest/).

Based on 2007 USDA/NASS data, a total of 2522 counties in the United States contain fruit- or vegetable-producing farms. Some of the counties with larger farms also have higher production levels. In this study, production in 2007 is estimated to be 6,648,867 tons in Fresno County in California (1,682,763 tons of fruits and 4,966,104 tons of vegetables). Hence, total fruit and vegetables production from all farms in the United States is calculated as 75,454,796 tons.


                        Fig. 4
                        
                         shows the continental U.S. fruit and vegetable production map. California, Florida, and Washington states have the highest production level. Fruit and vegetable production data are missing in Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming states and some counties in Kansas and Montana because USDA annual production surveys do not cover these states. Consumption locations are spread across the United States based on county population. We locate wholesale hub facilities by connecting production nodes to all counties with consumption locations to satisfy existing demand.


                        Fig. 5 shows total consumption based on the population in each county.

The U.S. fruit and vegetable demand network is assumed to consist of a number of fruit and vegetable wholesale markets (hubs) such that each hub manages the transmission of the products to satisfy existing demand subject to production capacity and travel distance constraints. The total number of hubs as well as their locations in the network varies based on hub capacity, travel distance, road conditions, and economic factors such as average gas prices and land prices for establishing a facility in an area. Several simulations are conducted using the model developed here to determine the optimal location of the wholesale markets (hubs) in the region. The results can be compared to simulate the effect of changing parameters on hub locations. Fig. 6
                      shows the locations of the existing fruit and vegetable wholesale facilities (North American Industry Classification System (NIACS) code = 424480) in the continental United States.

All optimization studies were carried out on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, each case running on four processor cores with a memory allocation of 60 gigabytes. Several simulations were conducted using the model to determine the
                      optimal number of U.S. F&V hubs and their locations.


                     Table 2 shows total production and consumption, and the maximum distance in the network. As seen in Fig. 4, there are regions in the middle of the country (Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, and Arkansas) where county-level production data are not available, largely because production of F&V is very limited in these areas.

The first set of experiments examines the effect of unlimited average travel distance, and variable minimum/maximum capacity of hub establishments, on the total number of hubs in the network. This experiment is directed
                      by bounding the lower/upper bound of the capacity of hubs when there are no limits on the average distance travelled by the food from production sites to the hubs and from hubs to the consumption sites. Therefore, all vegetables are transported via land transfer. Table 3 shows the number of optimal hubs with variable minimum/maximum hub capacities for this experiment. When we restrict the maximum capacity of the hubs, the general expectation is to have more hubs to satisfy the entire demand of the network. This might be true once ∑
                        i
                     
                     msih
                      = Uh
                      for at least one hub h. In cases A and B, confining the upper bound capacity of hubs from unlimited (a threshold greater than total F&V consumption in the United States) to 50,000 units results in a reduction of the number of hubs by 1, but the total cost in the objective function increases. This can be explained by the form of the objective function, where there is a trade-off between transportation costs and fixed costs of building hub capacity. In these two cases, there is no limit on average travel distance, and by reducing the upper bound capacity the hub facilities are located in the places that minimize total average travel distance, which also minimizes the cost. In case A, hubs with very high capacities are located close to high capacity production sites or close to high demand consumption markets to minimize the distance of total quantity traveled to and from hubs. In cases B and C, decreasing the lower bound of the hub capacity from 500 to 1 unit decreases the total number of hubs by 5; however it increases the total cost in objective function. The lower cost of model B despite the higher number of hubs is again attributed to a trade-off between installation and transportation costs.


                     Fig. 7 illustrates maps with transportation accessibility to supply and demand regions. As can be seen from the maps, due to the unlimited average distance in all cases, all demand is satisfied only through land transportation facilities. Fig. 7 also shows the hub locations in cases B and C. In case B the maximum hub capacity is 50,000 and the lower bound is 1.

The second set of experiments shows the impact of restricted average travel distance (i.e., food qualifies as “local” if it travels less than a certain distance) and constant minimum capacity of the hubs (1000) on the number of hubs when the maximum capacity of the hub is variable. Table 4 shows the number of optimal hubs, the number of supply sites using only land transport, the number of supply sites using only air transport, and the number of supply sites using both land and air transport in order to satisfy total demand in the network. Table 4 also shows the number of demand sites supplied only by land transport, only by air transport or both, and objective function cost considering a maximum capacity of 10,000, 5000, and 2000 units (D, E and F cases). In this simulation the distances allowed for substances to travel from production nodes to hubs and from hubs to consumption sites are 500 and 200 miles, respectively. In general, considering all three cases of D, E, and F, when the lower bound of the hub capacity is constant (1000), decreasing the upper limit of the hub capacity increases the number of hubs. By increasing the total number of hubs, more production and consumption sites can access the hubs in the bounded travel distance scenario. For example in cases D and E, when the upper capacity decreases from 10,000 to 5000, the total number hubs increases by 5 and more production sites (2429 > 2418) have access to the hubs through land transport with less total travel cost (14.4 × 109 < 14.6 × 109).


                     Fig. 8
                      illustrates hub locations along with supply and demand sites connected to the hubs locations through land transportation, air transportation, or both. In Fig. 8, maps with a green shaded color represent the supply sites which send commodities to hubs through land (light green), air (darker green), or both (darkest green) transportation facilities in cases D, E, and F. Fig. 8 also shows the purple shaded maps for consumption sites in all these three cases which receive supply from land (light purple), air (darker purple), or both (darkest purple) transportation facilities.

The last set of experiments is conducted to study the effect of a variable lower limit of the hub capacity and bounded average travel distance on hub locations in the network. In this experiment, the distance that food travels by land from production sites to the hubs is constrained; however the travel distance from hubs to consumption sites remain constant as 200 miles. Table 5
                      shows the number of optimal hubs required to be placed with maximum capacity of 10,000, when the distance allowed for food to travel from production nodes to hubs and from hubs to consumption markets is subject to change. The number of hubs increases from 193 in case H to 280 hubs in case K when the average travel distance from production sites to hubs (by land) is reduced from 500 miles to 200 miles. The hub capacity properties remain the same for these two cases. Even though the number of hubs increases, due to the travel distance restriction from production sites to hubs, fewer production sites have access to hubs through land transport. To satisfy demand the number of supply nodes that uses air transport increases from 10 sites to 111 sites in case H to case K, respectively. However; as the travel distance from hubs to consumption nodes remains constant in both cases H and K, the increase in the number of hubs expands the number of consumption markets that can be supplied from hubs by land. As a result the number of consumption markets supported by air transport falls from 1302 to 843 in these two cases.

                      site maps along with the location of the hubs for cases I and L of this experiment. As shown in the figure, there is a development in dark green areas when the average distance traveled from supply locations to hubs decreases from 500 to 200 miles in case K. In this case more locations will use alternative transportation facilities to satisfy the demand in the network.

Hub locations along with the supply/demand region connections to the hubs for case F are visualized in Figs. 10–12. The high density of connections prevented us from using arrows to show the direction of connections. However, the direction of flow can be easily depicted in most cases. The hub capacity histogram for a total of 258 hubs is shown in Fig. 10. Since the maximum capacity of the hub is considered to be 2000, more than 65 percent of the hubs (167 out of 258 hubs) reach the maximum capacity in order to meet the demand. Fig. 11 shows the connection density from supply regions to the hubs and from hubs to demand regions. In case F distances allowed for the substances to travel from production nodes to hubs and from hubs to consumption sites by land are 500 and 200 miles, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 11(a), the 300 miles difference in the land transport threshold of supply-to-hub and hub-to-demand nodes can clearly explain the considerably fewer air connections from supply regions to hubs. This is the result of the cost minimization problem which minimizes the overall transportation cost by optimally distributing the hub facilities in the entire region to satisfy demand, and transport by air is more costly than transport by land. On the other hand, restricting the land transport threshold of hub-to-demand node transfer to 200 miles resulted in the use of more air connections to satisfy demand in the region (Fig. 11(b)). In brief, both aspects of the optimization model, i.e. (a) the cost minimization and (b) effective supply of the demand are efficiently addressed.


                     Fig. 12 shows the two hubs which have the most supply-to-hub connection (Hub 39109) and the most hub-to-demand connections (Hub 30093), and the supply-to-hub and hub-to-demand connections are shown in orange and blue respectively. From the solution, Hub 30093 utilizes the 2000 units which is the maximum given capacity and as can be seen from Fig. 12, only one production site is connected to this hub. This production site (53025 – Grant county in the state of Washington) has production quantity of 18,280 (Table 6) almost 11 percent of which supplies Hub 30093, which in turn distributes the food to many smaller demand hubs. In contrast, Hub 39109 utilizes 1000 units (i.e., half of the maximum given capacity) and receives distributed and small quantities from 168 supply regions. It forms the hub with the highest supply-to-hub connection and then transfers the collected vegetables to six demand regions as represented in (Table 7).

Here we compare the solution from CPLEX MIP algorithm (as a commercial solver) with our LP-MIP based algorithm. The Table 8 summarizes the solutions from using both approaches. In both cases the average travel distance from production sites-to-hubs and from hubs-to-consumption sites and the maximum capacity of the hubs are fixed to 500 and 200 miles, and 10,000 respectively. In case I, the minimum capacity of the hubs is 1 while it is increased to 1000 in case G. As reported in Table 6, in both cases the amount of time required to find a solution falls using the LP-MIP. However, the solution results remain practically the same. As shown in Table 6 in case G′ using the MIP approach, CPLEX could not find a solution within 72 hours, whereas only two and one-half hours were required using the MIP-LP solution. This clearly demonstrates the efficiency of our solution strategy.

This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for finding optimal hub locations within a national logistics system. A model is developed to minimize the total transportation costs across two possible transportation modes, a standard low cost mode (land based in the mnemonic) and a high cost mode that is used to overcome long distance shipping constraints associated with highly perishable cargo (air in the mnemonic). Considering the relatively high cost of establishing a hub, only a subset of potential hub candidate locations are selected and many potential hub candidates would be rejected. Because there are many possible node-hub combinations within a national scale logistics system, we develop a heuristic solution algorithm to reduce computational costs.

Our findings allow us to draw several implications for the study and development of regional food systems. First, the results of the study indicate that the model is sensitive to the distance over which commodities are allowed to travel using land transportation. If we equate shorter distance constraints for land based shipments with increasingly smaller geographic areas for which regional growers can cost effectively market their produce, and vice
                     
                      versa, then several implications can be gleaned from our findings. For example, going from case G to case J (Table 5) we find that when hubs are constrained to having at least a capacity of 100,000 tons and the maximum land mode shipping distances decreases from 500 miles to 200 miles, the number of supply nodes that exclusively ship by the higher cost air mode increases from 17 to 276. The reason is that, for many growers the geography that is cost effectively reachable by land shipments does not contain a sufficient market to merit the establishment of a hub. Air shipments greatly increase the marketable geography of a regions production, so use of this mode would facilitate growers producing for distant markets. Put another way, any innovations or investments that increase the geographic area over which growers can market their produce via the low cost land shipments will lower the use of air transportation and thus lessen the incentive to produce for long distance markets.

Our findings on hub capacity constraints tell a similar story. For example, going from case L to case J (Table 5), maximum land shipping distances are held constant at 200 miles while minimum hub capacities increase from 100 tons to 100,000 tons. Not surprisingly, the optimal number of hubs decreases by over 60 percent. With far fewer hubs, many more growers and consumer markets are further away from a hub than is cost effectively reachable by the less expensive land mode so the number of supply and demand nodes supported only by air transportation more than doubles, from 652 to 1476. Put another way, any innovation or investment that decreases the minimum size of economically viable hub capacities will lower the demand for air transportation and thus lesson the incentive to produce for long distance markets.

These findings are potentially useful for policymakers and private decision-makers who may be interested in assessing whether the current network of supply chains connecting producers and consumers is optimal and, if not, where the greatest opportunities lie for redirecting investments in transportation hub infrastructure. Policymakers can use these results to assess the implications of alternative definitions of “locally-produced foods” in terms of anticipating market size and potential, as well as the implications of new infrastructure investments and logistic systems innovations. Researchers who examine logistical systems on a national or global scale can adapt our modeling framework and heuristic solution algorithm approach to related research problems.

For the specific research questions discussed in this study, there are clear areas of opportunity to extend the modeling approach. First, the simplistic treatment of hub construction costs that served a useful purpose in this study can be replaced with an empirical approach that treats hub construction and maintenance as an optimal investment problem, whereby the conventional capitalization formula (e.g., Devereux & Griffith, 2003) replaces the fixed cost specification. Using this approach, empirical analysis of shipping costs, wholesale margins, and product volumes handled can be combined with financial statistics such as prevailing discount rates and capital depreciation rates in order to translate this data into the annualized costs of building and maintaining a hub operation. With container shipping cost per mile statistics typically published by region and commodity (e.g., USDA/AMS, 2014), this approach allows for the empirical calibration of both hub operation costs and ton/mile shipping costs, which will facilitate empirically based estimates of the cost tradeoffs that determine spatial market outcomes in the model.

Another closely related extension of this study is to account for economies of scale in handling costs of different sized hub operations. One example of an empirical model of this type is the holistic model employed by Haque and Epplin (2012) that encompasses feedstock production and harvest, logistic services (shipping and storage), and biorefinery investment (size and location). For our study, the investment problem can be addressed empirically using the same data sources discussed above. Translating wholesale margin costs to costs per unit handled and estimating linear cost functions for hub operations of varying scales, two or more annualized hub cost function specifications can be compiled. In this approach, the decision to build or not build a hub in a production or consumption node is expanded to one of not building a hub or building a hub in one of several possible capacities and cost structures.

Finally, the simplistic approach in this study of treating fruit and vegetable production as a non-differentiated commodity is problematic. There are many varieties of both fruit and vegetable product as evidenced by the fact that production data used for this study included 21 vegetable varieties and 34 fruit and berry varieties. Consumers do not view these varieties as perfect substitutes and this has important implications for optimal commodity flow outcomes. Problems of this type are common in studies of international and interregional trade (e.g., Helpman, 1998), and the prevailing empirical approach is to specify a model of intra-industry trade, with (i) price sensitive regional consumers demanding product variety, (ii) regional growers each producing a differentiated product variety, (iii) regional suppliers (handling-distribution-logistics) providing increasing returns to scale services, and (iv) transportation costs that increase with impedance weighted shipping distance. The model in this study and the extensions described above for measuring economies of scale encompass features (ii) to (iv); however, hub-to-hub trade flows in this study are determined by using a least cost objective function where products from any two regions are viewed as perfect substitutes. Approaches to incorporate features of the model of intra-industry trade to capture the hub-to-hub trade flow outcomes to problems of the type examined in this study represents another promising future direction for this research.

The model in this study captures and sorts out the salient competing forces affecting the endogenous spatial outcomes (hub locations, hub size, trade flows, and technology constraints) of a representative national logistical system for fresh produce distribution with over 2000 producing regions and over 3000 consumption regions. Some simplifying assumptions, such as product homogeneity across regions and exogenous fixed unit cost transportation services, helped facilitate the scenario analysis, and it is important to keep these assumptions in mind as real-world policy implications and applications are developed. Approaches for relaxing these simplifying assumptions were considered, and a survey of related research provides a promising direction for future research on this topic.
