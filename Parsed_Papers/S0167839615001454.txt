                  In this note we study the regularity of generalized Hermite interpolation and compare it to that of classical Hermite interpolation.
                  While every Hermite interpolation scheme is regular in one variable, the “classical Hermite interpolation schemes” in several variables are regular if and only if they are supported at one point. In this note we exhibit some regular generalized Hermite interpolation schemes supported at two points and study some limitation of existence of such schemes. The existence of such schemes provides a class of counterexamples to a conjecture of Jia and Sharma.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this note we will compare the regularity properties of generalized Hermite interpolation (as introduced in de Boor and Ron, 1991) to those of classical Hermite interpolation (cf. Lorentz and Lorentz, 1990; Lorentz, 2000). The classical Hermite interpolation schemes in several variables are regular if and only if they are supported at one point (cf. Lorentz, 2000). We show that this is still the case for generalized Hermite interpolation over the complex field and no longer the case over the real field. In particular, we study regular generalized Hermite interpolation schemes supported at two points. We also present some necessary conditions for the existence of such schemes. The constructed schemes provide a class of counterexamples to a conjecture made in Jia and Sharma (1991).

In one variable this notion of Hermite interpolation coincides with the classical Hermite interpolation since the only finite-dimensional D-invariant subspaces of 
                        k
                        [
                        x
                        ]
                      are polynomials of fixed maximal degree and are always regular. The classical Hermite interpolation problem in several variables (when all subspaces in question are polynomials of fixed degree) had been a subject of intensive study in recent years in Approximation theory (cf. Lorentz and Lorentz, 1990; Lorentz, 1992, 2000) as well as in algebraic geometry (cf. Alexander and Hirschowitz, 1995; Harris, 2011). In this article we will compare and contrast some of the results on regularity of classical multivariate Hermite interpolation problems to those of generalized ones.

It is a well-known fact that in one dimension the Hermite interpolation scheme is always regular while for 
                        d
                        >
                        1
                      the classical Hermite interpolation scheme is regular if and only if it is a Taylor scheme, i.e., 
                        Z
                      consists of one point. In this section we will show that this fact still holds for generalized Hermite interpolation in the complex setting (
                        k
                        =
                        C
                     ) and fails in the real setting (
                        k
                        =
                        R
                     ). The latter gives a counterexample to a conjecture of Jia and Sharma (cf. Jia and Sharma, 1991).

                      is called an affine variety if there exists a finite set of polynomials

The types of schemes constructed in the proof of the theorem are not the only ones. For instance, it is easy to check by direct computations (cf. Shekhtman, 2005) that the schemes

                        Problem 2.7
                        
                           Is there a regular generalized Hermite interpolation scheme supported at three points?
                        

So far we failed to construct any such schemes.

Lorentz, 2000; Gevorgian et al., 1996) as well as in algebraic geometry (cf. Alexander and Hirschowitz, 1995; Harris, 2011). In terms of algebraic geometry, this work accumulated in the famous Harbourne–Hirschowitz conjecture (cf. Alexander and Hirschowitz, 1995). In contrast singular generalized schemes exist for all spaces

It is easy to check that for 
                        N
                        =
                        1
                        ,
                        d
                        =
                        2
                      no scheme is singular. It also matches with the fact that the dimension of polynomials of degree at most 1 in two variables is 3 and there is no integer s satisfying (3.2). By (3.2) singular schemes exist in spaces of linear polynomials in three or more variables.
