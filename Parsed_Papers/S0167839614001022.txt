                  In this work we present a parameter-dependent Refine-and-Smooth (RS) subdivision algorithm where the refine stage R consists in the application of a perturbation of Chaikin's/Doo–Sabin's vertex split, while each smoothing stage S performs averages of adjacent vertices like in the Lane–Riesenfeld algorithm (Lane and Riesenfeld, 1980). This constructive approach provides a unifying framework for univariate/bivariate primal and dual subdivision schemes with tension parameter and allows us to show that several existing subdivision algorithms, proposed in the literature via isolated constructions, can be obtained as specific instances of the proposed strategy. Moreover, this novel approach provides an intuitive theoretical tool for the derivation of new non-tensor product subdivision schemes that in the regular regions satisfy the property of reproducing bivariate cubic polynomials, thus resulting the natural extension of the univariate family presented in Hormann and Sabin (2008).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The beginning of subdivision for surface modeling goes back to 1978 when the generalizations for bi-quadratic and bi-cubic B-spline surfaces to quadrilateral meshes of arbitrary topology were published simultaneously by Catmull and Clark (1978) and by Doo and Sabin (1978). Then, in 1980 Lane and Riesenfeld (1980) provided a unified framework to represent for all

                     , degree-(
                        n

                     ) uniform B-spline curves and their tensor product extensions via a subdivision process where each subdivision step consists in applying one refine stage (aimed at doubling the number of given vertices) followed by n smoothing stages which modify the vertices position but not their number. In formulas, each subdivision step consists in the application of the subdivision operator

                     , where R and S denote the refine and smoothing operators, respectively. All processes of this kind are named Refine-and-Smooth (RS) algorithms, and the one proposed by Lane and Riesenfeld is certainly the simplest example that can be found in the literature since the refine operator R is given by the subdivision scheme for linear splines, while each smoothing operator S averages adjacent vertices in the current data set. Twenty years later, Stam (2001) on the one side and Zorin and Schröder (2001) on the other side, proposed independently a generalization of the Lane–Riesenfeld algorithm to arbitrary meshes, and showed that Doo–Sabin and Catmull–Clark schemes are nothing but the first two members of a family of surface subdivision schemes (also known in the literature as the family of midpoint subdivision schemes), which generalizes uniform tensor product B-spline surfaces of any bi-degree to quadrilateral meshes of arbitrary topology.

Since the family of midpoint subdivision schemes relies on a smoothing operator S performing midpoint averages (exactly as the standard Lane–Riesenfeld algorithm), it is made of an alternation of dual/primal members, corresponding to the application of an odd/even number n of smoothing stages, respectively. Indeed, when an odd number of smoothing stages is applied, the resulting subdivision scheme is featured by rules performing a vertex split; in contrast, the univariate/bivariate scheme obtained by the operator

                      with n even, recursively subdivides a given mesh via an edge/face split operation.

The goal of this work is to present a new constructive approach to design univariate and bivariate families of alternating primal/dual subdivision schemes with tension parameter in a unified framework. The approach is based on an RS subdivision algorithm where the refine stage consists in the application of a perturbation of the standard subdivision scheme for quadratic splines, while each smoothing stage usually performs averages of adjacent vertices. Therefore, in the univariate context, the refine stage is based on a parameter-dependent variant of Chaikin's corner cutting algorithm (Chaikin, 1974), whereas in the bivariate context on an analogous modification of Doo–Sabin's algorithm for polyhedral meshes with arbitrary faces (Doo and Sabin, 1978). Considering n smoothing stages as in Lane–Riesenfeld algorithm, this novel RS algorithm allows us to derive families of curve and surface subdivision schemes whose structure and properties are very similar to those of the B-spline schemes. In fact, the members of each family are also enumerated by n, and higher values of n give schemes with wider masks and support, higher continuity and higher degree of polynomial generation. The main difference is that, when suitably setting the tension parameter, all schemes from the new family are able to reproduce cubic polynomials, whereas the B-spline schemes have only linear precision. Moreover, exactly as B-spline schemes, the new schemes can be conveniently implemented using repeated local operations that only involve direct neighbors of the newly inserted or updated vertices. In the univariate context, this new construction provides a whole family of tension-controlled curve subdivision schemes, whose first two members coincide with the well-known interpolatory 4-point and dual 4-point schemes with tension parameter, presented via isolated constructions in Dyn et al. (1987, 2005), respectively. In addition, the new family contains the family of subdivision schemes with cubic precision proposed in Hormann and Sabin (2008), as a special subfamily. The generalization of the tension-controlled univariate family to quadrilateral meshes of arbitrary topology yields a family of non-tensor product schemes with tension parameter. If considering a specific setting of the free parameter, we show that the new family results in a subfamily of non-tensor product subdivision schemes reproducing bivariate cubic polynomials. The first member of the resulting subfamily (corresponding to 
                        n
                        =
                        1
                      smoothing stages) coincides with the interpolatory subdivision scheme for quadrilateral meshes with arbitrary topology already presented in Deng and Ma (2011), but not yet analyzed. Differently, the second family member obtained by means of 
                        n
                        =
                        2
                      smoothing stages, is a completely new dual approximating subdivision scheme for quadrilateral meshes of arbitrary topology, whose properties are deeply investigated.

The content of this paper is organized in six sections. Section 2 provides the background on d-variate subdivision schemes and reminds some existing results related to the Refine-and-Smooth mechanism. In Section 3 a new family of Refine-and-Smooth (RS) univariate subdivision schemes with tension parameter is introduced and its main properties are analyzed. Section 4 extends the idea presented in Section 3 to design a new family of tension-controlled RS subdivision schemes for quadrilateral meshes of arbitrary topology. In Sections 5 and 6 special attention is addressed to the description and the analysis of the first two family members resulting from the proposed construction. Conclusions are drawn in Section 7.

We remind that the generation degree of a subdivision scheme is the maximum degree of polynomials that can potentially be generated by the scheme, provided that the initial data is chosen correctly. Obviously, it is not less than the reproduction degree. For the precise definition of polynomial generation and reproduction the reader can consult (Charina and Conti, 2013; Conti and Hormann, 2011; Dyn et al., 2008).

                        Cashman et al. (2013) called the family of Lane–Riesenfeld's schemes L-schemes, to stress the connection of the refine and smoothing stage definition with linear interpolation. In that paper they also generalized Lane–Riesenfeld's idea by using a higher-order local interpolation operator, both for the refine and the successive smoothing stages. In particular, they studied the case where the local cubic operator that stems from Dubuc–Deslauriers interpolating 4-point scheme (Deslauriers and Dubuc, 1989) is used, and called the new family of schemes C-schemes. The n-th member of this family has symbol

In the next section we investigate another variant of Lane–Riesenfeld algorithm that, compared with the one proposed in Cashman et al. (2013), modifies only the refine stage. In fact, we consider the family of RS algorithms where, like in the well-known Lane–Riesenfeld algorithm, the smoothing stage S consists in performing averages of adjacent vertices, but, differently from the Lane–Riesenfeld algorithm, we apply a refine stage R based on a perturbation of Chaikin's corner cutting algorithm (Chaikin, 1974). This modification produces a new family of alternating primal/dual univariate subdivision algorithms and their bivariate analogs for quadrilateral meshes of arbitrary topology, both characterized by the presence of a tension parameter w that allows for considerable variations of shape.

We start by studying the smoothness properties of the family of subdivision schemes

                                 N
                              
                           
                        . The next proposition exploits the reasoning in Cashman et al. (2013, Section 3.3) to derive a lower bound on the Hölder regularity. Its proof is thus omitted since it trivially consists in the application of a known general result to the symbol we deal with.

It is obvious to emphasize that the Refine-and-Smooth algorithms which turn out to be more interesting in applications are the ones obtained with a not too high number of smoothing stages since the greater is n the larger becomes the support width of the basic limit function (BLF) and consequently the computational cost for generating curves. With this observation in mind it is worthwhile to notice that, when 
                           n
                           ≤

                        , by slightly increasing the support width of L-schemes, the new family of schemes allows us to introduce a tension parameter that can be used to control the shape of the limit curve without affecting the integer smoothness and the degree of polynomial reproduction.

                         (also denoted by HS-schemes) allows us to increase the degree of polynomial reproduction of the parameter-dependent family up to 3, without influencing the class of integer smoothness. In fact, in view of (3.10), for 
                           n
                           ≤
                           8
                         HS-schemes have the same integer smoothness as L-schemes and at least the same integer smoothness as C-schemes whenever 
                           n
                           >
                           2
                         (see Fig. 4
                        ). Moreover, if applying the same number of smoothing stages, HS-schemes allow, on the one hand, to increase the degree of polynomial generation and reproduction of L-schemes in exchange of a slight increase of the support width and, on the other hand, to achieve the same degree of polynomial reproduction of C-schemes by means of a basic limit function with a remarkably smaller support width (see Table 1
                        ). Thus, in summary, we can conclude that HS-schemes are a good compromise between L-schemes and C-schemes and may be conveniently taken as building blocks for the derivation of bivariate subdivision schemes generating surfaces of arbitrary topology.

The generalization of Chaikin's scheme to polyhedral meshes is given by the so-called Doo–Sabin's subdivision scheme (Catmull and Clark, 1978). If the face to be subdivided is quadrilateral and its vertices are labeled as

Applying the Refine-and-Smooth strategy illustrated in Section 4 with one smoothing stage only, we obtain an interpolatory subdivision scheme for quadrilateral meshes that, following the univariate notation, we denote by

In Fig. 9
                         we illustrate the effect of the tension parameter w for values in the above determined range 
                           (
                           0

                           )
                        : the smaller is the value of w, the closer the limit surface stays to the initial mesh. This is clearly due to the fact that when 
                           w
                           →
                           0
                         the limit surface tends to the bi-linear B-spline surface (see Remark 7 as well as Fig. 8).

In case the initial mesh contains some extraordinary vertices (i.e., vertices of valence 
                           N
                           ≠
                           4
                        ), after a sufficiently high number of subdivision steps they become isolated in an otherwise regular tiling of the surface. Therefore, following the approach in Reif (1995), convergence and smoothness of the subdivision scheme can be obtained by analyzing the properties of the local subdivision matrix 
                           A
                         defined in the neighborhood of the extraordinary vertex. Since in the regular case the parameter setting

                           =

                         provides the scheme with the best behavior, we conclude by analyzing the smoothness properties of the subdivision scheme

                            we point out the behavior of the first 4 leading eigenvalues in dependence of the valence N. As easily expected, the greater is the valence, the smaller is the distance between the subdominant and the sub-subdominant eigenvalue (see also Fig. 14
                            where valences up to 
                              N

                         for the plot of the corresponding basic limit function).

In the remaining part of this section we analyze the main properties fulfilled by this new dual approximating bivariate subdivision scheme when applied to a regular initial mesh.

In the following proposition we start by determining the parameter set

                         turns out to be convergent, and we derive the subset of parameters corresponding to the generation of smooth limit surfaces. As done in the previous section, for this purpose we exploit the formalism of Laurent polynomials.

                           From the result in Proposition 6.1 we already know that the smoothness of the limit functions produced by the scheme is

                              . In order to show that when

                              , exploiting the result in Dyn and Levin (2002, Theorem 4.30) the proof consists in showing the contractivity of the symbols

We conclude by observing that, in view of Proposition 6.2, the subdivision scheme

                         has the same smoothness properties of the bi-cubic B-spline surface, but, instead of being a tensor product primal scheme, it is a non-tensor product dual scheme. Moreover, in view of Proposition 6.4 it is featured by the capability of reproducing

                        , instead of simply having linear precision, and thus the approximation order of the new scheme is higher than the one of the bi-cubic B-spline surface. Although the approximation order derived from the reproduction degree is usually not optimal since, after suitably preprocessing the initial data, an approximation order of one larger than the generation degree can be achieved (Levin, 2003), considering that the new scheme is able to generate

                        , even when applying the preprocessing, the approximation order of the new scheme turns out to be higher. This means that the limit surface of the new scheme approximates the initial data better than the bi-cubic B-spline scheme (see, e.g., Fig. 17
                        ).

                           Proof
                           We start by observing that, in case the initial mesh contains some extraordinary vertices, then after the first subdivision step an extraordinary face with N edges is created in correspondence to an extraordinary vertex of valence N. The number of extraordinary faces generated by the scheme after the first iteration remains the same during all the subdivision process and each extraordinary face becomes isolated in an otherwise regular tiling of the surface. Thus, we can analyze the smoothness properties of the scheme

                           ). Although for valencies

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we presented a new constructive approach to design tension-controlled univariate and bivariate families of alternating primal/dual subdivision schemes in a unified framework. The approach is based on a Refine-and-Smooth subdivision algorithm that originates from a parameter-dependent variant of the Lane–Riesenfeld algorithm. The first two family members obtained in the univariate case are two well-known schemes with tension parameter, proposed in the literature via isolated constructions. Differently, the first two family members obtained in the bivariate case are an interpolatory and a dual approximating scheme for quadrilateral meshes with arbitrary topology never investigated before. In particular, the member corresponding to the choice 
                        n
                        =
                        1
                      has been shown to be a non-tensor product extension of the interpolatory 4-point scheme with tension parameter (Dyn et al., 1987), whereas the one corresponding to the choice 
                        n
                        =

                      an analogous extension of the dual approximating 4-point scheme (Dyn et al., 2005). The tuning of the tension parameter to maximize the degree of polynomial reproduction, provided in the univariate case a revisitation of the family of Hormann–Sabin's schemes with cubic precision (Hormann and Sabin, 2008), whereas in the bivariate case the proposal of a novel family of non-tensor product subdivision schemes that in the regular regions fulfill the property of bivariate cubic precision.
