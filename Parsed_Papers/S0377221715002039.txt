Conditions of order preservation

                  The pairwise comparisons method is a convenient tool used when the relative order among different concepts (alternatives) needs to be determined. One popular implementation of the method is based on solving an eigenvalue problem for the pairwise comparisons matrix. In such cases the ranking result for the principal eigenvector of the pairwise comparisons matrix is adopted, while the eigenvalue is used to determine the index of inconsistency. A lot of research has been devoted to the critical analysis of the eigenvalue based approach. One of them is the work of Bana e Costa and Vansnick (2008). In their work, the authors define the conditions of order preservation (COP) and show that even for sufficiently consistent pairwise comparisons matrices, this condition cannot be met. The presented work defines more precise criteria for determining when the COP is met. To formulate the criteria, an error factor is used describing how far the input to the ranking procedure is from the ranking result. The relationship between the Saaty consistency index and COP is also discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The origins of pairwise comparisons (herein abbreviated as PC) date back to the thirteenth century (Colomer, 2011). The contemporary form of the method owes much to Fechner (1966), Thurstone (1994) and Saaty (1977). The latter proposed the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) –a hierarchical, eigenvalue based extension to the PC theory, which provides useful methods for dealing with a large number of criteria. AHP is used in decision theory, economics, and other fields. Despite its long existence, pairwise comparisons still prompts researchers to enquire further into this area. Examples of such exploration are the Rough Set approach (Greco, Matarazzo, & Słowiński, 2011), incomplete PC relation (Bozóki, Fülöp, & Rónyai, 2010), non-numerical rankings (Janicki & Zhai, 2012), rankings with the reference set of alternatives (Kułakowski, 2014; Kułakowski, Grobler-Dębska, & Wąs, 2014), fuzzy PC relation handling (Fedrizzi & Brunelli, 2010; Mikhailov, 2003) and others. More can be found in Ishizaka and Labib, 2009; Smith and Von Winterfeldt, 2004.

Some aspects of PC still raise vigorous discussions (Barzilai & Golany, 1994; Dyer, 1990). In particular, Bana e Costa and Vansnick (Bana e Costa & Vansnick, 2008) pointed out that sometimes the expert judgments are not always appropriately reflected in the final assessment. They formulate two conditions of order preservation (COP) which they believe the paired rankings should satisfy (see Section 2.3). Their work arouses different reactions. On the one hand, there is criticism (Saaty, Vargas, & Whitaker, 2009; Wang, Chin, & Luo, 2009), on the other hand, recognition and praise (Andronikidis, Georgiou, Gotzamani, & Kamvysi, 2009; Çakır, 2008). Without doubt, however, their work seems to reveal important properties of the pairwise comparisons method.

In the presented article, the conditions formulated in Bana e Costa and Vansnick, 2008 are discussed in the context of the ranking errors (Sections 2.2 and 3). Considerations of errors (Section 3) lead to the formulation of three short theorems showing the relationship between inconsistency, the ranking error and COP (Section 4). The obtained results suggest that the AHP limitations as described in Bana e Costa and Vansnick, 2008 are not an inherent problem of the eigenvalue based prioritization procedure, but are a matter of error and inconsistency. Two of the provided theorems (Theorems 2 and 3), provide two sufficient conditions that easily allow one to check if the conditions for the preservation of order preference, from both an ordinal (4) and cardinal (5) point of view, are met. The situation in which COP is not met is considered in Section 5. A brief summary is provided in Section 6.


                        Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been proposed by Saaty in 1970s (Saaty, 1977). It is a multi-criteria decision making method based on comparing concepts (alternatives) in pairs. Central to the AHP is the pairwise comparisons (PC) matrix A = [aij
                        ], where 
                           
                              
                                 a
                                 
                                    i
                                    j
                                 
                              
                              ∈
                              
                                 R
                                 +
                              
                           
                         and i, j ∈ {1, …, n}, that expresses a quantitative relationship over the set of concepts C. The values aij
                         and aji
                         are interpreted as the relative importance, value or quality indicators of the concepts ci, cj
                         ∈ C, so that according to the best knowledge of experts ci
                         = aijcj
                         should hold.

                           Definition 1
                           The matrix A is said to be reciprocal if ∀i, j ∈ {1, …, n}: aij
                               = 1/aji
                               and A is said to be consistent if ∀i, j, k ∈ {1, …, n}: aij
                               · ajk
                               · aki
                               = 1.

There are several methods to determine how far the PC matrix A is inconsistent (Brunelli, Canal, & Fedrizzi, 2013). The most popular method is to calculate Saaty’s consistency index 
                           CI
                         (Saaty, 1977).

The result of the pairwise comparisons method is a priority function 
                           
                              w
                              :
                              C
                              →
                              
                                 R
                                 +
                              
                              ,
                           
                         so that w(c) represents the priority value for c ∈ C, where C is the set of concepts. The values of w for the sequence of concepts c
                        1, …, cn
                         is a priority vector [w(c
                        1), …, w(cn
                        )]. In AHP, vector w is obtained by calculating the principal eigenvector w
                        max of A and rescaling it so that the sum of its elements is 1. Due to the Perron–Frobenius theorem (Saaty, 1977) w
                        max exists.

If the priority vector w was ideal, i.e. if each expert judgment perfectly corresponded to the priority vector, then every aij
                         would equal the ratio w(ci
                        )/w(cj
                        ). In such a case every ε(i, j) would be equal to 1. Otherwise, when the priority vector is imperfect the values aij
                         and w(ci
                        )/w(cj
                        ) may vary. In other words ε(i, j) describes the local error (sometimes referred to as local inconsistency

In other words, the given value of the consistency index guarantees that the arithmetic mean of the difference between local error (2) and one equals CI.

In (Bana e Costa & Vansnick, 2008) there are two postulates (conditions of order preservation) as regards the meaning of an eigenvalue based priority vector. The first one, ordinal, the preservation of order preference condition (POP) claims that the priority vector in relation to the given pair of concepts (ci, cj
                        ) should not break with the expert judgment. In other words, for the pair of concepts c

                        2 ∈ C such that c

The second one, cardinal, the preservation of order of intensity of preference condition (POIP), stipulates that if c

Despite the fact that both conditions of order preservation have been formulated in the context of an eigenvalue based approach, it is important to note that, in principle, they remain valid in the context of any priority deriving method. Neither of the two conditions require w be a rescaled eigenvector of A. Moreover, meeting the POP and POIP conditions seems to be natural for any w.

It is easy to see (2) that ε(i, j) = 1/ε(j, i). For example, if some ε(i, j) = 2 then ε(j, i) = 0.5. In fact, both of these values carry the same information, which is: the priority vector for the pair (ci, cj
                     ) differs twice from the expert judgment. In other words, one concept got a 100 percent better score than it should. The usefulness of the ε(i, j) parameter has been recognized by researchers. For instance, in Saaty (2013, p. 203) the matrix [ε(i, j)] is used to determine which expert judgments need to be improved in order to reduce the inconsistency of A (see Section 5).

The same meaning of ε(i, j) and ε(j, i) and the further convenience led the author to define the reciprocal error

                         may also help to discover where the highest discrepancy is, hence, where the expert judgment (or the priority vector) could be improved.

It turns out that ε(i, j) can also be used to formulate sufficient conditions for which both POP and POIP postulates (Section 2.3) hold. For this purpose, let us define the concept of the maximal reciprocal error.

Similarly to POP and POIP (Section 2.3), the maximal reciprocal error is derived from the eigenvalue based approach, but it does not depend on it. Thus, Definition 2 remains valid for any priority deriving method and any w. Moreover, the value

The above assertions easily translate into an algorithm that allows us to decide whether the pairwise comparisons matrix A and the priority ranking w are POP-safe, i.e. whether the POP condition will never be violated for this pair. Let us note that if we adopt a weak inequality as the upper bound of the ranking error i.e.

                      then to meet the POP the strong inequality aij
                      > δ + 1 is needed. Thus, assuming that

                           =

                      is known, all the ratios greater than one i.e. aij
                      > 1 need to be examined to determine whether they are also greater than δ + 1. If so, A is POP-safe, which means that POP is not violated.

The relationship between POIP and the reciprocal error can also be expressed in the form of assertion.

Similarly as before, to hold the assertion (3) it is enough for the weak inequality 
                        
                           
                              E

                              ,
                              w
                              )
                           
                           ≤
                           δ
                        
                      and the strong inequality aij
                     /akl
                      > (δ + 1)2 to hold. Thus, for the practical verification of whether the POIP is violated, the condition aij
                     /akl
                      > (δ + 1)2 needs to be examined for every pair aij, akl
                      that meets the requirements of the theorem.

The situation in which the priority vector does not meet the POP and POIP is uncomfortable for the decision makers. Different parties may object to the results of the ranking, arguing that some (important and influential) experts think differently. To cope with this, the person responsible for the ranking procedure can either modify the priority vector w or modify the matrix A.

The first option means a change of the ranking procedure. In addition to the eigenvalue based method as proposed in Saaty (1977) there are several other methods (Fedrizzi & Brunelli, 2010). The solution proposed by Bana e Costa and Vansnick in their work (Bana e Costa & Vansnick, 2008) suggests the first option is the best. In three of the four examples provided they show that when the eigenvalue based weight vectors fail to meet POP or POIP (in all the cases the consistency index is below the acceptance threshold) there are other weight vectors which do not pose such problems.

Selecting the second option involves modification of the initial expert judgments. Usually the reason for modifying the matrix A is its high inconsistency. Generally, in AHP it is accepted that A is consistent enough when the ratio (called the consistency ratio) of its consistency index CI to the consistency index of a random matrix of the same size is smaller than 0.1. There are several methods to reduce the inconsistency of A (Ergu, Kou, Peng, & Shi, 2011; Koczkodaj & Szarek, 2010). The work (Saaty, 2013) proposes the procedure consisting of (1) finding the most inconsistent judgment in the matrix (the one with the greatest local error), (2) determining the range of values to which that judgment can be changed, then (3) asking experts to consider, if they can, changing their judgment to a plausible value in that range. Steps (1)–(3) should be repeated until the desired consistency is reached. Theorem 1 confirms the validity of this approach. Decreasing

                      ≥ 1 + δ (POP) and if aij
                      > akl
                      > 1 then also aij
                     /akl
                      ≥ (1 + δ)2 (POIP). Thus, the same inconsistency reduction procedure as proposed in Saaty (2013) can be used for such modification of A that both POP and POIP are satisfied.


                     Theorems 2 and 3 also indicate another important feature of the COP postulate. Even if the matrix A is highly consistent i.e. 
                        
                           
                              E
                              max
                           
                           
                              (
                              A
                              ,
                              
                                 w
                                 ev
                              
                              )
                           
                        
                      and CI is small (Theorem 1), then if two different concepts are preferentially close to each other, there is still no guarantee that POP and POIP are met. Indeed, this observation allows for easy generation of almost consistent matrices that fail either the POP or POIP postulate. For example:

The consistency index for A is CI = 0.0002. In particular w(c
                     1)/w(c
                     2) = 0.99 while a
                     12 = 1.01, and similarly w(c
                     3)/w(c
                     4) = 0.991. The matrix (21) is a clear example that if the elements of the PC matrix are close to one then even the high consistency of the matrix may not translate into the compliance with POP and POIP.

                            both POP and POIP are always met.
                     
                  

Both changing the vector w and modifying the matrix A have their proponents and opponents. For example, advocates of the first approach indicate that the inconsistency reduction (especially proposed in Saaty, 2013) for various reasons may not be optimal (Kyriacos & Ishizaka, 2014; Lamata & Peláez, 2002). On the other hand, the opposite option provides arguments that “only the eigenvalue gives the correct ordering and priority values” (Saaty et al., 2009), and therefore, adopting another priority deriving method is beyond dispute. Regardless of the debate on the pros and cons of both approaches, the popularity of AHP means that very often the second approach is considered as a viable alternative.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

In their work Bana e Costa and Vansnick (2008) formulated two conditions whose fulfillment makes the priority vector indisputable. Therefore, in practice, meeting these two conditions may translate into a significant reduction in the number of appeals against the results of the ranking procedure. Hence, in addition to intangible benefits such as providing the ranking participants a sense of justice, meeting the POP and POIP conditions may contribute to the reduction of costs associated with carrying out the evaluation procedure.

This study addresses the important problem of difference between expert judgments and the priority vectors that may appear in the pairwise comparisons method. The provided theorems try to show the mutual relationships between the COP postulates, ranking errors, and the relative importance of concepts. They allow the user to decide whether the given PC matrix and the priority vector w meet COP. They also provide arguments for using consistency improvement procedures based on the local errors minimization (Saaty, 2013) as a method which leads to the matrix in line with both POP and POIP conditions. The theorems provide arguments indicating that the AHP limitations suggested in Bana e Costa and Vansnick (2008) are not the inherent problem of the prioritization procedure followed in AHP, but have their original source in the inconsistencies between elements of the PC matrix, which are not detected by the inconsistency measurement used for the matrix as a whole.

Although the maximal reciprocal error (Section 3), similar to COP postulates, has been defined in the context of the eigenvalue priority deriving method, it is not tied to it. In fact, it could be useful for any pair of the PC matrix A and the priority vector w. The only, but crucial, assumption is that w attempts to reflect the experts’ judgments given as A. The conditions provided by Theorems 2 and 3 are sufficient, but they are not necessary. Thus, there may be better estimates that allow users to determine whether the COP are satisfied. The existence of such estimates remains an open question and will be the subject of further research.
