                  One major issue in CAGD is to model complex objects using free-form surfaces of general topology. A natural approach is curvenet-based design, where designers directly create and modify feature curves. These are interpolated by smoothly connected, multi-sided patches, which can be represented by transfinite surfaces, defined as a combination of side interpolants or ribbons. A ribbon embeds Hermite data, i.e., prescribed positional and cross-derivative functions along boundary curves.
                  The paper focuses on two transfinite schemes: the first is an enhanced and extended variant of a multi-sided generalization of the classical Coons patch (Várady et al., 2011); the second one is based on a new concept of combining doubly curved composite ribbons, each one interpolating three adjacent sides. Main contributions include various ribbon parameterizations that surpass former methods in quality and computational efficiency. It is proven that these surfaces smoothly interpolate the prescribed ribbon data. Both formulations are based on non-regular convex polygonal domains and distance-based, rational blending functions. A few examples illustrate the results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     Curvenet-based design is a natural approach to create complex free-form models in three dimensions. The process begins with creating a curve network representing the boundaries and feature lines of the object. These curves may come from several sources, such as traditional blueprints, 2D sketches, or directly through some sophisticated 3D graphical user interface, such as in the works of Bae et al. (2009), Grimm and Joshi (2012), then the interpolating surfaces are expected to be automatically generated over the curve network. Transfinite surfaces are particularly suitable for this approach, since they are determined solely by boundary curves and cross-derivatives.

It is hard to compare transfinite schemes with other types of general topology surfaces, such as (i) trimmed parametric surfaces, (ii) subdivision surfaces, or (iii) split n-sided surfaces. Trimmed surfaces are typically defined by a grid of control points, in contrast to transfinite patches that require only the boundary information. Certain symmetric n-sided configurations cannot be achieved by trimmed surfaces, for example a regular 3- or 5-sided patch cannot be exactly represented over a 4-sided domain. While the boundary edges over the four sides of the parametric domain can be directly edited in 3D, the internal trimming curves cannot. As for continuity, stitching parametric surfaces along general trimming curves can be achieved only in a numerical sense, controlled by tolerances; however, for transfinite patches accurate “watertight” stitching is possible.

Subdivision surfaces offer a highly intuitive technique to produce smoothly connected, general topology surfaces derived from a control polyhedra, but interpolating a network of prescribed boundaries and cross-derivatives is a difficult task. To match a given network, first a good initial control polyhedron must be found, then the subdivision rules need to be modified to obtain an interpolating limit surface. Related work on interpolating curve networks by subdivision can be found in e.g. Levin (1999), Nasri and Abbas (2002), Ma and Wang (2009).

There are CAD systems that use only stitched quadrilaterals, and when an n-sided patch needs to be represented, it is subdivided — in most cases — using the central split scheme. This may seem to be a good solution, but it is not easy to determine optimal splitting curves and a good center point, or to resolve compatibility constraints (Peters, 1993). T-splines also represent surfaces in this category (Sederberg et al., 2003), where the connection of adjacent patches with different knot vectors is efficiently solved. Recent work on n-sided patches composed of quadrilaterals include Karčiauskas and Peters (2007), Loop and Schaefer (2008), Bommes et al. (2011).

Our work is motivated by designers and stylists, who want to focus on controllable boundary curves and ribbons. They expect nice, predictable and smoothly connected surfaces, and would like to avoid dealing with intricacies not related to design intent. Transfinite patches are attractive for real-time curve editing with immediate surfacing response. It is a disadvantage, however, that these surfaces are defined by high-degree rational polynomials in a non-standard format. Strictly local control can be an advantage, though some applications may demand for a global optimization over large curve networks; this may be the subject of future research.

This paper expands former work by the same authors and also introduces a new transfinite formulation using composite ribbons. The concept of multi-sided generalization of Coons patches appeared in Várady et al. (2011), while composite ribbons were recently outlined in a short paper (Várady et al., 2013). Here we present the necessary boundary conditions and proofs of continuity for both formulations in details, which was formerly impossible due to space limitations. We also introduce new ribbon parameterizations that surpass former methods in terms of quality and computational efficiency. After reviewing related work in Section 2, we revisit classical topics, such as Hermite curves and Coons patches, that will help to reformulate the equations leading to the new schemes (Section 3). We summarize the basic elements of multi-sided surface constructions in Section 4, and discuss various ribbon parameterizations with and without constraints. The actual surface formulations are described in Sections 5 and 6. We analyze our results in Section 7, then suggestions for future work conclude the paper.

There is an extensive and diverse literature on transfinite methods. These differ in several aspects, including (i) the number of boundaries, (ii) the cross-derivative constraints (

In the classical work of Coons (1967) four boundaries were interpolated. This was followed by Gordon's extension to interpolate a grid of curves by quadrilaterals (Gordon, 1969). Then transfinite patches with three sides were investigated (Barnhill et al., 1973; Nielson, 1979) followed by 5-sided (Charrot and Gregory, 1984) and later general n-sided schemes (Gregory, 1986). Inserting two-sided or even one-sided patches has also become important, in order to complete general topology curve networks, see e.g. Sabin (1998), Várady et al. (2012). Initially, domains were regular polygons, but later non-convex polygons and domains with internal hole loops were also proposed (Kato, 1991; Sabin, 1998). The use of non-regular 2D domains was suggested in Várady et al. (2011).

At the beginning side-based interpolations dominated the field (see Coons-like patches and surfaces in Kato, 1991, 2000; Sabin, 1996). Later corner interpolants were suggested as well, e.g. Charrot and Gregory (1984), Plowman and Charrot (1996), Várady (1991). Many schemes, including Coons patches, need correction terms in the formulae to satisfy the interpolating constraints.

An interesting concept of permanence was suggested in Farin and Hansford (1999), which requires a shrinking domain polygon with edges parallel to the original sides to be mapped onto an n-sided subpatch of the same kind. This is a challenging idea — currently no solution is known for 
                        n

There is a fairly wide variety of blending functions and parameterization methods (Várady et al., 2011). For general n-sided patches, mostly “tricky” rational functions based on special distances are computed within the domain, for example in Gregory (1986), Kato (1991), Várady et al. (2011). In Sabin's early paper (Sabin, 1986) it is shown that rational polynomial parameterization by two domain variables is not possible for

Generalized barycentric coordinates (Floater, 2003; Hormann and Floater, 2006) provide a good basis for parameterizing polygonal domains (see also Section 4.5). Recent publications extend this theory to interpolate Hermite data — continuous functions and derivatives — over polygons and curved boundaries (see moving least squares coordinates, Manson and Schaefer, 2010, and transfinite mean value interpolation, Dyken and Floater, 2009; Bruvoll and Floater, 2010).

Recent developments of transfinite surfaces include Coons patches having geodesic boundaries (Farouki et al., 2009), and methods to adjust the shape interior of transfinite patches while retaining their boundaries (Várady et al., 2012).

First we revisit and reformulate basic curve and surface equations to introduce our new n-sided surface schemes. Instead of separate positional and tangential data, we combine ribbons, i.e., continuous quadrilaterals having their own local parameterization. Generally ribbons are parameterized linearly by a distance parameter; in this paper we propose a rational ribbon reparameterization that reproduces Hermite cubics and Coons patches.

(3.1)), that also requires a correction surface (see Section 5), while the second is a combination of doubly curved ribbons (see Section 6), each interpolating three consecutive sides.

We briefly describe how ribbons can be created. We assume that for each vertex of the network the crossing curves define a local tangent plane. For each boundary

For example, by means of the so-called ribbon-handles, which are prescribed cross-derivatives at the middle point of the boundary (

                        ), users can interactively edit ribbons, if needed. Alternatively, these can be optimized by different fairing algorithms, which is the subject of ongoing research. (Typically, we apply cubic B-spline boundaries with quadratic or cubic scalar functions.) From now on we will assume that the ribbons have already been defined, and focus only on the patch formulation.

Our experience shows that we can apply a regular polygon, if the above measures remain below prescribed thresholds. However, if the length or angle distortion is high, we strongly recommend using non-regular convex polygons to avoid unexpected shape artifacts. Instead of solving a non-linear optimization, simple heuristic methods for creating non-regular domains have been suggested in Várady et al. (2011).

Avoiding singular blending functions while retaining the side-based concept was one of the key motivations in our research to generalize Coons patches. In the four-sided case, the cubic Hermite blending functions ensure interpolation on

Both the side and corner blending functions will be used in the multi-sided Coons patch (Section 5), while only the side blends are needed for the composite ribbon patch (Section 6). These blending functions ensure that the ribbons naturally vanish on the “opposite” sides; the number of terms to be evaluated increases with the number of sides.

The most crucial issue in transfinite surface generation is ribbon parameterization, i.e., how to compute the local side and distance parameters

                        ). This is what determines the associated points of the ribbons and thus has a critical effect on the shape. There are infinitely many possible solutions to map a four-sided parametric quadrilateral onto an n-sided domain, and our experiments produced a wide variety of visually similar surfaces with different interior curvatures. We will describe a few interesting solutions.

Two groups of ribbon parameterizations are considered. In simple parameterizations (Section 4.5) it is natural to require that each side parameter

Roughly speaking, this means that in the simple case the parameterizations of the adjacent ribbons match only in a positional sense. For the constrained case these are identical in a differential sense, as well (see Fig. 4.3
                        ). These properties are trivially satisfied for the four-sided Coons patch, but for n-sided domains special constructions are needed. In the evaluation of parameterization methods, there are two main issues: (i) the constant

The former constrains all sweep lines to go through a given point outside the domain, the latter forces the

                            shows constant s and d lines for this parameterization using the central line sweep parameterization as a basis (Várady et al., 2012). The first image is based on the right side of the polygon; the second on the small side at the top-right; and the third on the top side. Observe that all lines of the second image start the in same way (in a differential sense) as their counterparts in the first and third images.

While the interconnected parameterization scheme satisfies all the requirements, its d-constant parameter lines have inflections. In this section we will show a different parameterization where the d-constant parameter lines are cubic curves. This computation is not direct, as it requires the solution of fourth- or sixth-degree equations. (Cubic parameter lines are the simplest, but quartics can also be used by extending the method below to spread the d constant parameter lines more evenly for large n-s, e.g. 
                              n
                              ≥
                              8
                           .)

Similarly to the previous method, this parameterization also builds on a sweep line parameterization. For simplicity's sake, we will use the bilinear sweep, but the same can be done for radial or other parameterizations, that lead to higher degree equations. For ease of computation, we will assume that the base side lies on the u axis, with its endpoints at the origin and

Let us define the d isocurves in such a way, that they “inherit” the same positions and tangents from the left and right side as the corresponding bilinear sweeping lines of those sides. We place a point B as shown in the figure at a λ proportion of the AC side, Y is defined symmetrically on the ZX side. λ is a fullness parameter, that controls the shape of the d isocurves to be more flat or curved. The ABYZ polygon defines a cubic Bézier curve. Note that the quadrilateral

                            for the fullness parameter λ, the parameterization of the base side becomes linear, and the equation simplifies to fourth degree; however, the isoparameter lines become somewhat flat. A larger λ gives more fullness, but requires solving the above sixth-degree equation. This construction also satisfies the requirements of constrained parameterization (see Fig. 4.8
                           ).

This section deals with the direct generalization of the Coons patch to n sides following the original idea of summing up linear side interpolants and subtracting corner correction patches (see also Section 3). Having a general polygonal domain, we define side and corner blending functions, and apply constrained parameterization for the individual ribbons. Either the interconnected or the cubic method can be used, or anything else that satisfies the requirements (4.2)–(4.4). Running the indices from 1 to n, the following surface equation is obtained:

Along a given side, similarly to the reformulated Coons patch, five surface interpolants — three linear ribbons and two corner correction patches — are combined to evaluate a point on the boundary. As these satisfy the rules of constrained parameterization, the patch will interpolate the related boundary and cross-derivative functions. A short proof can be found in Appendix A; for more details see Salvi (2012). A few examples are shown in Section 7.

Note, that for 
                        n
                        =
                        4
                      this equation reproduces the Coons patch when the cubic Hermite blending functions are used, but only a close approximation of the original patch can be obtained when rational distance-based blending functions are applied.

The patch defined in the previous section is based on linear ribbons. These are very simple and can be computed efficiently. On the other hand, linear ribbons may strongly deviate from highly curved n-sided surfaces, and their combination may cause unexpected curvature changes, when the points in the interior are computed by the affine combination of relatively “distant” positions. This motivated us to introduce a special curved ribbon that actually interpolates three consecutive linear ribbons. The curved ribbons align much closer to the final n-sided patch, and their combination, even in extreme cases, yields more predictable interior shapes (see Fig. 6.1
                     ). Using curved ribbons leads to a new multi-sided patch formulation, called composite ribbon patches.

A curved ribbon is defined as the combination of three consecutive linear ribbons, and it is actually a Coons patch with three of its four sides given, defined over a local rectangular domain. Let

Due to the above construction, d is constrained to lie in 
                           [
                           0
                           ,

                           ]
                        . This holds for the Wachspress and interconnected parameterizations, but not for the bilinear and cubic parameterizations.

Note that the fourth side of the curved ribbons is “floating”; it comes as a by-product of the three interpolating linear ribbons. Constraining the fourth side can be an advantage, as it offers further degrees of freedom to adjust the shape. At the same time, this fourth side, as in the case of simple linear ribbons, has a relatively small influence due to the blending functions.

Also, using our notation, the classical Gregory patch (Charrot and Gregory, 1984) can be interpreted as a combination of two-sided curved corner interpolants, that are made up of two linear ribbons minus a single correction term, as follows:

In the next sections we will present new schemes that combine curved ribbons.

Curved ribbons can be used as side interpolants for simple transfinite interpolation patches using the singular blending function (Eq. (4.1)). Unfortunately, the direct generalization of Coons patches, introduced in Section 5, does not work with curved ribbons. Therefore, we propose an alternative representation that combines curved ribbons in a different way, and eliminates correction patches; thus yielding a simple formula:

                         hence the division by two in the surface equation. This patch also satisfies the boundary constraints. A short proof can be found in Appendix B; for more details see Salvi (2012).

It can be proven that the ribbon interpolation property remains valid, if we ignore the last parameterization requirement (4.4). Then we have the same tangent plane for every boundary point as the respective curved ribbon, but not the same tangent vector. This enables the use of simple parameterizations, such as the Wachspress method, which is computationally more efficient. The resulting patch reproduces the boundary constraints in a

                         patches can be noticed only at extreme boundary configurations.

To sum it up, in this section we have created new transfinite surface schemes that (i) use curved side interpolants, (ii) have roughly the same computational complexity as other transfinite methods, and (iii) avoid using singular blending functions.

In this section we show a few examples to evaluate our results. Where needed, we will refer to two prior schemes. The Side-based (SB) patch suggested by Kato (1991) applies singular blending functions. The Corner-based (CB) patch proposed by Gregory (1986) combines corner interpolants. We will use the abbreviations GC and CR for the Generalized Coons and the Composite Ribbon patches, respectively.


                     
                        Example 1
                        Even curvature distribution and predictable patch interior is of great importance. In other words, curvature artifacts must be avoided. Our experience shows that in this respect CR patches seem to be the best, in particular for difficult boundary configurations. For simple cases, the curvature distributions are similar. This similarity is strong between the GC and CB patches, which are “close relatives” in generalizing the Coons patch, in spite of the fact that the GC patch is a combination of side interpolants, while the CB patch uses corner interpolants.

The images in Fig. 7.1
                            show mean curvature maps for SB, CB, GC and CR patches. Observe the undesirable narrow curvature variations that occur along some edges of the SB patch; this problem disappears when using GC or CR patches, yielding more natural transitions between the ribbons. Table 1
                           (a) shows numerical values of mean curvature values including its minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation for all four schemes.

These values were computed using a dense triangular mesh; if exact values are needed the derivatives are computed using the formulae in Appendices A, B, though this is computationally much more demanding.


                     
                        Example 2
                        Computational efficiency is determined by three components: (i) evaluating the interpolants, (ii) computing the blending functions, and (iii) computing the ribbons' parameterization. Assuming cubic B-spline boundary curves, the basic interpolants are cubic-by-linear for SB and GC, bicubic for CB, and biquartic for CR. The blend functions are rational functions of the distances with degree 
                              2
                              (
                              n
                              −
                              1
                              )
                            for SB, and 
                              2
                              (
                              n
                              −
                              2
                              )
                            for the other patches. Finally, the mapping between the domain and the ribbons can be characterized by a bilinear polynomial for SB and CB, a quintic for GC, and a trigonometric parameterization for CR.

Our experience shows that 97% of the evaluation time is used for ribbons, and only 3% is devoted to parameterization and blending functions. Table 2
                            shows the computation times for a single point on a 2.5 GHz processor. As expected, the SB patch is the fastest, and the CR patch is the slowest. The ratios of computing different parameterizations are the following: interconnected → 1, cubic → 1.78, Wachspress → 1.28. (Computations can be made more efficient with extensive caching.)


                     
                        Example 3
                        Another interesting question is how these rational transfinite patches can approximate regular shapes, such as an octant of a sphere. We have used approximate B-spline boundaries for the circular arcs with a constraint that the middle point of the patch lies exactly on the ideal sphere. In this test CR patches proved to be the best; in Fig. 7.2
                            planar contours, a sensitively scaled Gaussian curvature map and isophotes illustrate the quality of the approximation. See Table 1(b) for numerical comparison of the radius values for all four schemes.


                     
                        Example 4
                        Stability is a qualitative characteristic, that is hard to define for multi-sided schemes. Assuming that we are editing one of the boundaries, we would expect that the shape surrounded by the other sides is generally unaffected. Similarly, if we insert a new edge, i.e., we create an 
                              (
                              n
                              +
                              1
                              )
                           -sided patch from an n-sided, we expect that the parts of the patch that are not directly adjacent will remain unchanged. Our experiment shows that in this respect CR patches are good, CB and GC patches are reasonable, and SB patches are somewhat weaker.


                           Fig. 7.3
                            shows a somewhat artificial model that interpolates a general topology curve network. It contains one 2-sided, two 3-sided, two 4-sided, one 5-sided and one 6-sided patch, all smoothly connected. For the 4-sided loops ordinary Coons patches were used, for the 2-sided a special formula shown in Várady et al. (2012) was used, and the rest was represented by CR patches. The cross-derivative functions were extracted from the curve network, and the ribbons satisfy tangent plane constraints at the vertices. See the shaded visualization (a) and the contours (b). This is an almost symmetric surface configuration, except that a corner was cut off at the right side, which converted the five-sided patch at the left into a six-sided patch. The isophote lines (c) and mean curvature map (d) figures show that the patch has changed only to a minimal extent in the middle. It can also be observed that these patches provide visual 
                              
                                 
                                    G

                            continuity in non-extreme configurations, see the smooth variation of the isophote lines across the boundaries.

It is a particular advantage of transfinite schemes that they ensure a very concise representation for complex shapes. For example, the above model can be fully defined by 5 KB, while using quadrilateral B-splines would require more than 100 KB.

Finally, a more complex example is shown in Fig. 7.4
                           . The three close-up views show the face (a) without boundaries, (b) with the default ribbons and also with a (c) slicing map to show 
                              
                                 
                                    G

                            continuity. This collection of faces consists of six 5-sided, and two 4-sided patches.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Two new surface representations for transfinite surface interpolation have been investigated. Both schemes are based on ribbon surfaces, composed of boundary curves and cross-derivative functions, ensuring normal plane continuity between adjacent patches. The first scheme can be considered a true generalization of the Coons patch, following the classical Boolean sum logic. The second is a transfinite surface combining doubly curved side interpolants. Ribbons have been reparameterized to reproduce the Coons patch for 
                        n
                        =
                        4
                     . Various mappings of the ribbons onto the n-sided polygonal domain were suggested, defining simple and constrained parameterizations that are necessary for ensuring the interpolation property. These schemes inherit the continuity of the boundaries, e.g. having cubic B-splines will produce a 
                        
                           
                              C

                      continuous patch in the interior. Future research work is going to be directed towards fairing, data approximation by ribbon-based patches, and using ribbons over non-convex parametric domains.
