                  A recently reported Lyapunov based criterion (Singh (2014) [7]) for the asymptotic stability of two-dimensional (2-D) linear discrete systems described by the Fornasini–Marchesini second local state-space (FMSLSS) model is reviewed. It is established in this paper that, despite utilizing a more general Lyapunov matrix, Singh's criterion will never lead to an enhanced stability region in the parameter-space as compared to that obtainable via Hinamoto–Lu's criterion.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

During the past few decades, the stability properties of 2-D discrete systems have been studied extensively [1–12]. The two most common state-space models for 2-D systems were introduced by Roesser [13] and Fornasini–Marchesini [1]. Several Lyapunov equations with constant coefficients have been proposed for the stability analysis of 2-D linear discrete systems described by the FMSLSS model [3–7]. The approaches in [3–6] are based on utilizing a positive definite symmetric Lyapunov matrix. The existence of the positive definite solutions to the Lyapunov equations proposed in [3–7] is, in general, only sufficient but not necessary for 2-D stability. In fact, to the best of authors' knowledge, no numerically tractable constant 2-D Lyapunov matrix inequality which provides both necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of 2-D systems is reported in the literature so far.

This paper is directly inspired by a recent paper [7]. Unlike [3–6], Singh's approach [7] makes it possible to utilize even an asymmetric Lyapunov matrix. It is claimed in [7] (see [7, Remark 1]) that Singh's criterion [7] is distinct from that in [3–5]. The purpose of this paper is to establish a link between the approach in [7] and previous approaches [3–5]. In particular, it is shown presently that the obtained stability condition in [7] is equivalent to that in [4,5]. In other words, the criterion in [7] fails to provide an enhanced stability region in the parameter-space as compared to that obtainable via [4,5]. Further, the implication of [7] is discussed in the context of 2-D discrete systems described by the Roesser model [13].

                            Observe that Theorems 1–3 are based on exploiting the condition (3). Therefore, these results can provide sufficient conditions for the bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability of system (1) possibly under the assumption that (2) does not possess any non-essential singularity of second kind (see [8] and the references cited therein for a sample of literature on the subject).

It may be observed that the positive definite Lyapunov matrix

                            in Theorems 1 and 2 is symmetric. On the other hand, the matrix 
                              P
                            in Theorem 3 is not restricted to be symmetric. The matrix 
                              P
                            is referred as asymmetric Lyapunov matrix in the event of 
                              P
                            being asymmetric such that

Based on the arguments of Schur complements and congruence transformation, Proposition 1 establishes the equivalence between Theorem 2 and Theorem 3. Such arguments have also been used in the proof of [14, Theorem 1] to introduce additional degrees of freedom in the 1-D Lyapunov equation.

With a view to establish a link between [7] and [4,5], let us now examine the approach in [7] carefully. Pertaining to a 2-D free system given by (8), in accordance with [7, Eq. (8)], choose a quadratic 2-D Lyapunov function as

                        P
                      is a positive definite symmetric matrix. The equivalence of (15) and (6) follows trivially from Schur complements. Moreover, it may be noted that the stability analysis in [7] is based on determining a set of Lyapunov functions given by (12), which involves a general (symmetric or asymmetric) 
                        P
                     , such that (7) holds. On the other hand, the analysis in [4,5] is based on determining a set of 2-D Lyapunov functions of the form [5, Eq. (24)]

                      is a positive definite symmetric matrix. Nevertheless, it is easy to observe that the Lyapunov function (12) is essentially equivalent to (16). This qualitatively explains why the utilization of asymmetric Lyapunov matrix 
                        P
                      in Singh's approach [7] provides no advantage over [4,5].

                            and following the proof of Proposition 1, one can easily establish Proposition 2.

In view of Propositions 1 and 2, it is clear that Theorem 3 (Corollary 1), despite offering the flexibility of utilizing even an asymmetric Lyapunov matrix, yields no better result than Theorem 2 (Theorem 1). Moreover, it is easy to observe that Theorem 3 (Corollary 1) is numerically more complex than Theorem 2 (Theorem 1). Thus, the approach in [7] fails to provide any specific advantage over Hinamoto–Lu's approach [4,5] for testing asymptotic stability of system (1).  □

Using the arguments given in the proof of Proposition 1, one can easily arrive at the following proposition. 
                        Proposition 3
                        
                           
                              Theorem 5
                            
                           is equivalent to 
                           
                              Theorem 4
                           
                           .
                        

Thus, application of the approach in [7] to the 2-D discrete Roesser model [13] fails to provide enhanced stability region as compared to that obtainable via (18).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper provides a clear link between Singh's criterion [7] and Hinamoto–Lu's criterion [4,5] for the global asymptotic stability of linear 2-D FMSLSS model. The criterion in [7], despite offering the flexibility of utilizing a more general (symmetric or asymmetric) Lyapunov matrix, turns out to be an equivalent representation of Hinamoto–Lu's criterion [4,5]. The implication of [7] has been discussed in the context of 2-D Roesser model. Further work is required to generalize the existing 2-D Lyapunov equations [3–5,11] in order to narrow the gap between ‘sufficiency’ and ‘necessity’ for a 2-D system to be asymptotically stable. Such a generalized Lyapunov equation can be potentially applied to many promising areas of 2-D systems [15–17], which deserve further investigation.
