                  Jiang et al. proposed an algorithm to solve the inverse minimum cost flow problems under the bottleneck-type weighted Hamming distance [Y. Jiang, L. Liu, B. Wuc, E. Yao, Inverse minimum cost flow problems under the weighted Hamming distance, European Journal of Operational Research 207 (2010) 50–54]. In this note, it is shown that their proposed algorithm does not solve correctly the inverse problem in the general case due to some incorrect results in that article. Then, a new algorithm is proposed to solve the inverse problem in strongly polynomial time. The algorithm uses the linear search technique and solves a shortest path problem in each iteration.

                      becomes optimal to the problem (1). The modifications can be measured by various distances. Jiang, Liu, Wuc, and Yao (2010) considered the inverse minimum cost flow (IMCF) problem under the sum-type and the bottleneck-type weighted Hamming distance. In the sum-type case, they show that a special case of the inverse problem reduces to the weighted feedback arc set problem to be APX-hard. In the bottleneck-type case, they presented an algorithm to solve the inverse problem. In this note, we give a counter example to show that their algorithm fails for solving the IMCF problem in more cases. We show that this problem arises due to some incorrect results presented in that article. It is also mentioned that a restricted version of the IMCF problem can be solved correctly by this algorithm. Finally, we propose an algorithm based on the reduced cost optimality conditions to solve the problem in the general case. Our proposed algorithm solves a shortest path problem on an auxiliary network in each iteration and runs in strongly polynomial time.

In this section, the formulation of the IMCF problem is given and the algorithm proposed by Jiang et al. (2010) is reviewed.

In this section, we use the reduced cost optimality conditions to propose an algorithm for solving the IMCF problem under the bottleneck weighted Hamming distance. Based on Lemma 2.2, the problem can be formulated as

                     . On the other hand, the number of iterations is at most m. Therefore, the following result is established.

Finally, let us give some suggestions to improve the complexity of Algorithm 3:
                        
                           •
                           In Algorithm 3, we use the linear search technique to find the least index l so that 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          d
                                       
                                       
                                          (
                                          l
                                          )
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               is feasible. One can use the binary search technique to improve the complexity.

Due to the little difference between the auxiliary networks in two consecutive iterations, one can use the sensitivity analysis for solving the shortest path problems in these networks.


                     
                        
                           •
                           In this note, the inverse minimum cost flow problem under the bottleneck-type weighted Hamming distance is considered.

This paper focuses on the proposed algorithm presented by Jiang et al. (2010). A counter example is used to show that the algorithm is not correct.

It is mentioned that Algorithm 2 solves the problem correctly if the given feasible solution
