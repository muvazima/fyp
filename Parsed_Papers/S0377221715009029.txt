                  Production plans often span a whole week or month, even when independent production lots are completed every day and service performance is tallied daily. Such policies are said to use staggered deliveries, meaning that the production rate for multiple days are determined at a single point in time. Assuming autocorrelated demand, and linear inventory holding and backlog costs, we identify the optimal replenishment policy for order cycles of length P. With the addition of a once-per-cycle audit cost, we optimize the order cycle length P
                     * via an inverse-function approach. In addition, we characterize periodic inventory costs, availability, and fill rate. As a consequence of staggering deliveries, the inventory level becomes cyclically heteroskedastic. This manifests itself as ripples in the expected cost and service levels. Nevertheless, the cost-optimal replenishment policy achieves a constant availability by using time-varying safety stocks; this is not the case with suboptimal constant safety stock policies, where the availability fluctuates over the cycle.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Our paper is motivated by a recent experience with two manufacturers who planned on a weekly basis. One of the manufacturers had a local customer, just a few hours away by truck. The other manufacturer had a customer on another continent, six weeks away by container ship. Production and distribution planning in each case was conducted once per week in SAP, which automated the order-up-to (OUT) replenishment policy calculations. For the manufacturer with the remote customer, products were loaded into 40-feet containers that were dispatched at the end of the week. This matches well the literature on periodic review inventory systems, such as the base stock policy and the OUT policy.

For the manufacturer with the local customer, whilst production and distribution plans where still generated at the start of the week, daily production lots were loaded onto trucks that were dispatched to the local customer at the end of each day. Here we have a planning cycle of one week, and an inventory inspection period of one day. This scenario, with mismatched order cycles and inspection periods, is quite popular in the just-in-time / lean environment. Nevertheless, this phenomenon has received little attention and is not well understood. The case when goods can be received every day, but when orders may be placed only once every P days is called staggered deliveries.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The pioneering work on staggered deliveries was done by Flynn and Garstka (1990), who developed an inventory-optimal control policy under staggered deliveries and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) demand. Flynn and Garstka (1990) call the problem of finding the optimal replenishment policy the ordering problem, while they call the problem of identifying the optimal planning cycle length the auditing problem. They find for the infinite horizon case, with a fixed audit cost (a cost incurred when production plans are generated), that the optimal policy is a base-stock policy (a variant of the OUT policy). This model was expanded to include a fixed cost for each cycle with a non-zero order quantity; then an (s,S)-type policy is optimal (Flynn, 2000). Prak, Teunter, and Riezebos (2015) investigated the same problem with an arbitrary order cycle length (which they termed periodic review) and continuously staggered deliveries (termed continuous ordering). They found that the optimal ordering policy for the continuous-time problem is OUT.


                        Chiang (2001) investigated an OUT (termed [R,S]) inventory system with service constraints, inventory holding costs, an audit cost, and a fixed cost per receipt. The study demonstrated that lot splitting, i.e. staggering, may lead to reduced costs, particularly when the audit cost is high. A particular type of staggered delivery system was studied by Chiang (2009), who considered two variations of a staggered policy. In one of these, which we shall refer to as Chiang’s simplified policy, the order quantity was arbitrary in the first period of the order cycle, and constant in the remaining periods. The other policy included a non-negative ordering constraint; it also permitted a variable order quantity (bounded from above by some constant) for several periods following the first, potentially extending to every period in the cycle.

In staggered systems, and in some periodic review systems, it is common to ignore cycle stock and to apply inventory costs to the inventory level at the end of each replenishment cycle, just before new receipts arrive. This can be compared with the non-staggered models in Silver and Robb (2008) and Chiang (2007), which permit inventory inspections (with associated costs) between two subsequent receipts.

The lean literature often suggests planning as frequently as set-up costs allow (Bicheno and Holweg, 2009, p. 155; Burbidge, 1983), but this is not always reflected in practice. A recent survey of 292 Swedish companies revealed that when using the OUT policy, 21 percent planned on a daily basis or more frequently, 37 percent planned on a weekly basis, and 42 percent planned fortnightly or less frequently (Jonsson & Mattsson, 2013). The same survey reported that, over the period 1993–2013, planning cycles have been shrinking. However (Flynn & Garstka, 1990) showed that an optimum order cycle length, P
                        * > 1, may exist if there is an audit cost — a fixed cost per planning cycle. Approximate solutions for finding P
                        * were given in Flynn and Garstka (1997), Flynn (2000), and Flynn (2008). For i.i.d. demands the problem of identifying P
                        * for coordinating multiple items was investigated in Flynn (2001). Lian, Deshmukh, and Wang (2006) used simulation to find the optimal length of the planning cycle.

With autocorrelated demand, the demand in one period may be affected by random demand fluctuations that have occurred in previous periods. Autocorrelated demand has been observed in industry (Erkip, Hausman, & Nahmias, 1990), and it is known that autocorrelation may affect inventory cost and service levels significantly (Lee, So, & Tang, 2000). Zhang (2007) considers the consequences of heteroskedastic demand on the OUT policy, whereas we notice, as did Lian et al. (2006) and Flynn (2008), that heteroskedasticity of inventory levels can be induced by the staggered delivery mechanism.

This paper extends the inventory-optimal model of Flynn and Garstka (1990) to autocorrelated demand, and demonstrates how availability and fill rates fluctuate between the days in a delivery cycle. This is linked to the heteroskedastic inventory variance, which depends on demand autocorrelation.


                        Lian et al. (2006) and Flynn (2008) find that time-varying safety stocks are optimal for i.i.d. demand. We build on these results and identify the optimal time-varying safety stocks for autocorrelated demand.

We identify the inventory performance in terms of cost, availability, and fill rate when optimal safety stocks are used, and compare this with the performance of two practical (but suboptimal) constant safety stock settings. The problem of the optimal order cycle length P
                        * has already been considered by Flynn (2000), Flynn (2001) and Lian et al. (2006) for i.i.d. demand. We generalize this to autocorrelated demand and characterize the exact solution to P
                        * by an inverse function approach.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we describe the model in a natural seven-day setting to introduce the concept of staggering. Then, in Section 3, we derive the optimal ordering rule for arbitrary planning cycle lengths and autocorrelated demand. Here we also define how performance is measured via inventory costs, availability and the fill rate. We also provide an exact solution to the problem of finding the length of the optimal planning cycle for autocorrelated demand. Section 4 considers the staggered OUT policy under first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) demand and provides some numerical insights. First we operationalize the staggered delivery policy to demonstrate how one actually generates production plans. Then we investigate the inventory cost and service level consequences of the staggered policy. Finally we provide an example of how to find the optimal planning cycle length. Section 5 concludes. Proofs are presented in appendices.

To ease understanding, let us initially define the model in a weekly setting of seven days, where we plan once per week, but produce every day. Later, we generalize this to arbitrary planning periods of length P, but for now we consider the planning cycle to be seven days long.

Every morning the inventory level is tallied. If it is Monday, a production plan is made immediately after the inventory inspection. This production plan contains seven orders, to cover an entire week of production. This reflects the planning cycle length 
                        
                           P
                           =
                           7
                        
                     . In more general terms, staggering deliveries means that we must determine the production rate for P days once every P periods. Between two such occasions, no new production plans are calculated, as we are committed to the established plan; Fig. 1
                      illustrates this.

Let t number the individual days (periods), and let Mondays occur when t/P is an integer. Suppose it is the start of Monday morning, and that we must plan the orders for the next cycle {O

                        t, 7}, numbered in the same sequence as they will be produced. Every order O corresponds to a future inventory receipt R, according to

The policy operates on the master production scheduling (MPS) level, and is therefore concerned with due-date setting. Order releases are typically handled by material requirements planning, using the MPS (generated by the policy) as input (Pinedo, 2009, p. 10). Immediately when a cycle’s order quantities have been determined, the required receipt rates

                     . We need not know the exact timing of job releases, as long as the planned quantity arrives in the right period. The lead time L is the delay until the first order is received, reflecting the time to effect a new production plan, including the time to schedule jobs, to allocate resources, and to produce. Note that if

                      the first order would be released to production immediately, and be completed in less than one day. It would therefore contribute to the inventory level measured at time

The receipts resulting from the staggered deliveries are placed in inventory. We assume that there is no shrinkage, and that the inventory level increases with receipts (Rt
                     ) and decreases with demand (Dt
                     ),

                     If there are no goods on-hand, the excess demand is backlogged and subtracted from the inventory level; then the inventory level falls below zero. Backlogged demand is satisfied immediately when new goods are received. We assume that the system is linear, therefore negative orders are permitted, reflecting costless returns (in distribution scenarios), or that goods are sold off at a price equaling the variable cost of production (in manufacturing scenarios). Negative demand is also permitted, reflecting returns from customers to our inventory. Both the storage and the production facilities have unlimited capacity.

The periodic inventory costs consist of a holding cost H per unit of inventory, and a backorder cost B per unit of unsatisfied demand, which we model as negative inventory,

                     . Consequently, the optimal order policy is myopic, meaning that the optimal solution for an n-period problem can be found by solving n independent single-period problems (Heyman and Sobel, 1984, p. 63–71). In practice, we need only to consider the immediate consequences of each decision, as it has no bearing on the cost incurred in other (future) periods. The myopic nature of the optimal policy can be verified by setting up a dynamic program. See Bertsekas (2005, p. 162–164) for a problem with the same cost structure, compatible with autocorrelated demand, but without staggering, and Flynn and Garstka (1990) for a dynamic program with staggering, but without demand autocorrelation. We exclude a dynamic programming formulation, as it adds complexity without providing commensurate insights.

The expected inventory cost (4) is convex, and a minimum exists because both B and H are positive. Therefore, there exists an optimal expected inventory level that minimizes

The policy can be interpreted as an OUT policy with increasing lead times over the cycle and a simplified ordering rule for all periods but the first. Note that our simplified rule, (7), is different from the simplified rule in Chiang (2009), who assumes that

To gain further insights about the optimal policy and its dynamic performance, we shall assume that demand is autocorrelated,

                         we exploit the linear system assumption, and the assumption of normally distributed, i.i.d. random error terms. Consequently the inventory level follows a normal distribution, hence the mean and variance are sufficient to specify the inventory distribution. The mean inventory can be set to

Not only does the optimal safety stock minimize the total cost of the system, it also sets the system’s availability (Silver, Pyke, & Peterson, 1998) to the critical ratio

The fill rate (β), or type 2 service level, is sometimes considered a more appropriate measure in customer-facing settings, as it measures the fraction of demand fulfilled immediately from stock (Johnson, Lee, Davis, & Hall, 1995). The exact formula for the fill rate when demand is autocorrelated and possibly negative (Disney, Gaalman, Hedenstierna, & Hosoda, 2015) is of the following form:

                        This exact fill rate takes the expectation of immediately satisfied demand, and divides it by the expected positive demand. This works well when demand is weakly stationary, but does not work for nonstationary demand. If the variables in this expression are normally distributed, we can obtain the fill rate via the following lemma.

                              It is often necessary to evaluate (11) numerically. This is usually done with software like Mathematica or Matlab, but it can also be achieved with Microsoft Excel using the macro provided in Disney et al. (2015).

To calculate the exact fill rate we must know the variances

The inventory variance (15) increases in τ, regardless of θt
                        , and is finite for all demands, stationary or nonstationary. The variance of the state variable

                         is also increasing in τ, but is only finite for stationary demand. The covariance (17) between demand and initial inventory exists only for stationary demand.

The main insight from (15) is that the inventory variance increases over the cycle. As inventory costs are minimized when

                         we find a time-varying safety stock to be optimal. This safety stock is increasing in τ. It is also clear from (15) that autocorrelation can amplify or attenuate inventory heteroskedasticity.

Under normally distributed demand and linear transformations, the inventory level is also normally distributed. The expected inventory cost is

This procedure lets us specify a P and provides the range of cost configurations

                         for which this P is optimal. Through this indirect approach, several properties of P
                        * are revealed: it is increasing in the audit cost V, and it is decreasing in the factors that drive inventory cost, namely B, H, L, and σ
                        ε. This follows from the influence of (15) and (19) on λ. Furthermore, given a cost balance λ and an arbitrary P, it is immediately clear if P < P
                        *, 
                           
                              P
                              =
                              
                                 P
                                 *
                              
                              ,
                           
                         or P > P
                        *, as λP
                         is increasing in P. These observations hold for generally autocorrelated demand as (15) is increasing in τ.

To find P
                        *, it is sufficient to identify two values P
                        1 and P
                        2, such that 
                           
                              
                                 λ
                                 
                                    P
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              ≤
                              λ
                              ≤
                              
                                 λ
                                 
                                    P
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                        ; a binary search between these values then provides the optimum. As an alternative, we may plot the first few λP
                        , and then seek P
                        * graphically. This simpler approach does not guarantee that P
                        * will be in the range plotted, but it is nonetheless reasonable when the audit cost is moderate in relation to the inventory cost.

To better understand the model, it is helpful to consider a simple case. Here we choose the AR(1) demand process. It is stationary and invertible for |ϕ| < 1 (Box & Jenkins, 1976). The corollary below provides necessary expressions for calculating inventory costs, availability, the fill rate, and λP

                        Fig. 3
                         illustrates the inventory standard deviation for a range of AR(1) demands. The configurations where |ϕ| < 1 reflect stationary demand, while other configurations reflect nonstationary demand. In either case, the inventory level is stationary. As we can see from (15) the inventory standard deviation is increasing in τ. The consequences of this are clear: staggering increases the total inventory cost, particularly when there is significant autocorrelation. Staggering is least harmful when demand is negatively autocorrelated and stationary

                        Eq. (27) reveals that when demand lacks autocorrelation, the variance increases linearly, meaning that the inventory standard deviation is proportional to the square root of τ. This is a fundamental result, demonstrating that the staggered policy behaves like an iterated OUT policy with increasing lead times for each order in the cycle. The inventory variance increases step-wise in (29). This is noticeable in the inventory standard deviation of Fig. 3, where for

                        . They imply that the inventory costs are minimized when the availability, for every τ, is 90 percent. As we know, the inventory variance changes with τ, and hence time-varying safety stocks are optimal. If we insist on using constant safety stocks, the availability will change over the cycle. For example, a constant safety stock can be based on the worst-case inventory variance, obtained at the end of the cycle, providing

                        For any constant safety stock setting, availability degrades as τ increases. This is due to σ
                        
                           i, k
                         being increasing in k. For the safety stock setting under discussion, σ
                        
                           i, P

                           i, k
                        , making the availability lower-bounded at 90 percent.

A more sophisticated constant safety stock setting could be based on the average inventory variance,

                        This safety stock setting is obtained if one ignores the cyclical heteroskedasticity and takes the variance of the inventory process as a whole. The resulting availability is shown in Fig. 5
                        
                        
                        , illustrating that the target availability of 90 percent is no longer a lower bound. On average, however, the availability is above the target of 90 percent. This always results when H < B and when

Observe that Φ(x) is concave for x ≥ 0. Then (32) is an immediate result of Jensen’s inequality. On the domain x ≤ 0, Φ(x) is convex, and the inequality in (32) is reversed. This completes the proof.□

The cost differential between these three strategies is worth considering. Fig. 6 verifies that the optimal time-varying safety stock outperforms all constant settings. The worst economic performance results from the constant safety stock setting based on the end-of-cycle inventory variance. This is clear for nonstationary demand, but when there is little autocorrelation, the two fixed safety stock strategies are nearly cost-equal.

To see if these observations hold under different cost settings, we may consult Fig. 7, where H and B assume different values, but in all cases 
                           
                              H
                              +
                              B
                              =
                              10
                           
                        . These settings imply an optimal availability of 80 percent, 90 percent, 95 percent, or 99 percent. Regardless of the cost configuration, we notice that autocorrelation drives the cost differential between the constant and the time-varying safety safety stock settings. This effect appears for all of the cost settings, particularly when demand is nonstationary. For stationary demand, the cost varies less between the three settings when H and B are close, as with the 
                           
                              H

                              2
                              ,
                              B
                              =
                              8
                           
                         case, and it varies more when the difference between H and B is large. In the 
                           
                              H
                              =
                              0.1
                              ,
                              B
                              =
                              9.9
                           
                         setting, corresponding to an optimal availability of 99 percent, the superior performance of the time-varying safety stock becomes clear, leading to a fundamental insight: time-varying safety stocks are most important when demand exhibits strong autocorrelation, and when high service levels are required.
                        
                     

As the variable safety stock is the strategy of choice – providing the required availability at the lowest cost – we may wish to understand how the fill rate develops over a cycle, when time-varying safety stocks are in place. Though the availability remains constant, we see in Fig. 8 (restricted to |ϕ| < 1 as the fill rate can only be defined for stationary demand) that the fill rate fluctuates over τ, and that it depends on ϕ. Furthermore, Fig. 8 indicates that the fill rate degrades as τ increases, particularly when demand is positively autocorrelated. Although the fill rate is undefined for |ϕ| ≥ 1, the numerical experiments consistently show that the fill rate approaches 100 percent as |ϕ| → 1.

From the definition of the fill rate (10) and the knowledge that the inventory variance is increasing in τ, we can make some observations about the fill rate under constant safety stock settings. For the end-of-cycle constant safety stock setting, the fill rate at the end of the cycle, with 
                           
                              τ
                              =
                              7
                              ,
                           
                         is identical to the fill rate of the optimal time-varying safety stock. For τ < 7, the fill rate is higher. The other constant safety stock setting, based on the average inventory variance, does not have the fill rate of the optimal time-varying safety stock at 
                           
                              τ
                              =

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have identified the inventory-optimal policy under staggered deliveries and autocorrelated demand. The strategy is to correct all inventory errors for the first order of the cycle, and then to order only the forecasted demand for the period in question and the required change in the safety stock, according to (6) and (7). This makes real the optimal policy identified by the Flynn and Chiang papers by applying the OUT policy to autocorrelated demand.


                        Flynn and Garstka (1990) and Chiang (2009) present staggered models with fixed audit costs, assuming i.i.d. demand. Our policy differs from Flynn and Garstka (1990), as O
                        
                           t, k
                         may be negative. Conservative settings of μ, and σ
                        ε render the effect of negative orders negligible, making our policy computationally consistent with Flynn and Garstka (1990). Our policy also differs from the two policies in Chiang (2009), as we have a time-varying production quantity in each period. Our policy ensures that the target availability is maintained consistently. However, Chiang’s policies may be practical for small P. Indeed, when P ≤ 2, Chiang’s simplified policy is optimal. The regular policy in Chiang (2009) has an added non-negativity constraint, which in Chiang’s numerical examples caused an increased cost over the simplified policy.

Our model allows for constant safety stocks if desired, but we find that not only are time-varying safety stocks more economical, they also ensure that the target availability is achieved consistently. The overall safety stock is affected by the autocorrelation of demand and increases with the order cycle length. In the special case of an AR(1) demand process with 
                           
                              ϕ

                         the safety stock only needs to be changed for periods when τ is odd. Our model and analysis also captures the nonstaggered case when 
                           
                              P
                              =

                         which results in a regular OUT policy.

The inventory variance is increasing over the order cycle for any demand autocorrelation function, and the heteroskedasticity affects fill rates, even when the availability is kept constant. This causes the fill rate to fluctuate cyclically. We have also provided an exact approach for determining P
                        *, the optimal length of the planning cycle, when auditing, holding, and backlog costs are present. The optimization procedure reveals that P
                        * is an increasing function of the audit cost V, and a decreasing function of B, H, L, and σ
                        ε.

If a production system requires consistent availability, it is necessary to take into account the time-varying inventory variance. Ignoring the heteroskedasticity of inventory will result in either excessive service levels and unnecessary costs, or poor service on predictable days of the planning cycle. However, if time-varying safety stocks are deemed impractical or too complicated, we recommend a safety stock setting based on the average inventory variance over the cycle. Then the availability will fluctuate over the cycle, but on average it will exceed the critical fractile 
                           
                              B
                              /
                              (
                              B
                              +
                              H
                              )
                           
                         when B ≥ H.

Even with optimal time-varying safety stocks, fill rates may degrade over the cycle, particularly when demand is positively autocorrelated. Reducing the length of the planning cycle provides an opportunity to reduce inventory costs, and is especially attractive when the initial planning cycle is long, and demand exhibits strong autocorrelation. However, short planning cycles require frequent audits, incurring a cost. The balance between inventory and audit costs must be regulated carefully via the order cycle length.

This investigation focused only on inventory performance and the optimal order cycle length under autocorrelated demand. Our numerical investigation of the fill rate reveals a rich behavior that calls for further study. One might also consider the impact of staggered deliveries on bullwhip or capacity costs.

Furthermore, we have assumed perfect knowledge of the autocorrelation function (ACF) of demand, that the ACF does not change over time, and that we can observe past demand from the beginning of time. In a real setting we must estimate the ACF from a limited set of past observations. This may introduce specification errors, and robustness tests could be considered, perhaps along the lines set out in Hosoda and Disney (2009). Further consideration could also be given to the mis-specification of the demand distribution as in Akcay, Biller, and Tayur (2011) and Lee (2014).
