                  We have grown the crystals of two thiophene/phenylene co-oligomers (TPCOs) composed of in-line five and seven alternating thiophene and benzene rings. These TPCOs are characterized by thiophenes located at both molecular terminals. The grown crystals had several pairs of parallel crystal faces that function as optical resonators. These produced interference fringes in their emission and reflectance spectra. We measured the emission spectra in both weak broadband excitation and intense laser excitation regimes. From these spectra we determined the phase refractive index dispersion and the anisotropic group refractive indices. We made field-effect transistor devices using the above TPCO crystals and carried out their electrical measurements. These optical and charge transport properties are compared with those of crystals of other alternating TPCOs with phenylenes located at both molecular terminals.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Crystals of organic semiconductor materials are increasingly attracting attention as promising materials for high performance optoelectronic devices. These crystals combine high fluorescence quantum yield [1–3] and high carrier mobilities [4]. These properties are due to the regular molecular alignments in the crystals. Making the most of these characteristics, researchers recently started applying the organic semiconductor crystals to e.g. light-emitting field-effect transistors (LEFETs) [5]. The organic semiconductor crystals also exhibit optically-excited spectrally-narrowed emissions (SNEs) [1,6,7]. Amongst the organic semiconductor crystals, furthermore, those of thiophene/phenylene co-oligomers (TPCOs) [8–10] show longitudinal multimode laser oscillations under optical excitations [11–14].

The refractive index and its dispersion are important parameters for applying the materials to the optoelectronic devices. In this connection we have developed useful methods to determine the dispersions and anisotropic group refractive indices of the organic crystals [12,15]. To do this we used pairs of parallel crystal facets acting as Fabry–Pérot resonators, and observed the interference fringes in the emission and reflectance spectra. In the emission spectra the fringes can clearly be seen with both a weak broadband excitation and intense laser excitation regimes. On the basis of the above methods, we have determined the dispersions and anisotropic group refractive indices of several TPCO crystals [12,15,16].

The aforementioned situation motivated us to further explore optoelectronic properties of a wider variety of organic semiconductors, particularly TPCOs. In the present studies we chose two alternating TPCOs having thiophene moieties at both molecular terminals; i.e. 2,5-bis[4-(2-thienyl)phenyl]thiophene (AC′5) [9] and 1,4-bis{5-[4-(2′-thienyl)phenyl]thiophen-2-yl}benzene (AC7) [10]; see Fig. 1
                      for their structural formulae. We have determined the dispersions and anisotropic refractive indices of these crystals. We also made field-effect transistor (FET) devices using them and carried out their electrical measurements. We compare these results with those reported for other alternating TPCO analogs having phenylenes at both molecular terminals, i.e. 1,4-bis(5-phenylthiophen-2-yl)benzene (AC5) [8] and 2,5-bis[4-(5′-phenylthiophen-2′-yl)phenyl]thiophene (AC′7) [10]. Fig. 1 includes their structural formulae.

AC′5 and AC7 crystals were grown in a vapor phase [17]. As an option we choked the growth apparatus with silica wool to reduce carrier gas flow. For the AC′5 (AC7) crystal growth, we set the temperatures of the source heater at 270–280°C (350–380°C) and the growth heater at 230–240°C (300–340°C). The growth time was 9–20h. For measurements we manually laminated the crystals on silicon wafer substrates covered with a silicon oxide layer of 300nm in thickness. Additionally, AC′5 crystals were grown directly on the substrates in a liquid phase [18]. We used ortho-dichlorobenzene as a solvent and an aluminum plate as a radiator. We kept a mixture of AC′5 powder and its solution at 80°C for 430h for crystal growth.


                        Fig. 2
                         shows AC′5 and AC7 crystals. Their images disappeared at the extinction positions of the crossed Nicols of the polarizing microscope observations [17,18]. A pair of parallel edge facets constitutes a Fabry-Pérot resonator (i.e. reflecting mirrors). This produced interference fringes in the emission or reflectance spectrum. The crystals in Fig. 2a and c were used for the emission measurements. In these figures, L indicates horizontal resonator lengths (62.1μm for AC′5 and 229.0μm for AC7). The top and bottom wide planes parallel to the substrate surface constituted another vertical resonator. Their separations (i.e., thicknesses d) were 1.05μm for AC′5 in Fig. 2b and 1.40μm for AC7 in Fig. 2d. These were used for the reflectance measurements. We determined the crystal sizes (ranging from 205 to 1663μm) and thicknesses (from 370nm to 1.40μm) using the microscope and a surface profiler, respectively [12,16]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed in the manner same as before [18].

We measured the emission and reflectance spectra using the reported setups and procedures [12,15,16]. We irradiated the incident lights perpendicularly to the wide crystal planes. For the emission measurements, we used as the excitation unpolarized violet light (380–420nm) arising from a mercury lamp (white light: 294.5–812.5nm) in combination with an excitation filter. Using a monochromator spectrograph (SOLAR TII, MS7504) we observed the spectra parallel to the crystal plane and perpendicular to the pair of the facets (see Fig. 2a and c) [12,16]. In contrast, we detected the reflected light (450–800nm or 500–800nm) from the crystals using a photonic multi-channel analyzer (Hamamatsu Photonics, PMA-11 C7473-36) in the opposite direction of the incident white light [15,16]. We measured the spectra polarized along either the A- or P-direction shown in Fig. 2b and d.

We also carried out the laser light excitation measurements using the same setup reported previously [11,12,16]. The horizontal resonators of the crystals were used for the measurements. We used the monochromator spectrograph and the photonic multi-channel analyzer for high- and low-resolution measurements, respectively. The wavelength of the excitation laser was set at 422nm.

Bottom-contact type FETs were fabricated by laminating the vapor-phase-grown crystals onto pairs of comb-shaped interdigitated source and drain electrodes that were preliminarily-prepared on the substrates. These electrodes were composed of the layered chromium (5nm in thickness) and gold (100nm). We also fabricated a top-contact type AC7 crystal device. We spin-coated 5wt% toluene solution of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (3000rpm, 30s) on the substrate. The resulting PMMA layer was 275nm in thickness. We laminated the crystal on it and deposited gold to form the source and drain contacts [19]. The channel lengths and widths of all devices ranged 10–50μm and 0.63–13.00mm, respectively.

We measured the output characteristics in vacuum of ∼10–3
                        Pa in the hole-enhancement mode by applying direct-current (DC) voltages ranging from 0 to −60 (or −100) V and from 0 to −60 (or −70) V to the drain and gate contacts, respectively [20]. We grounded one of the metal electrodes as the source contact following the standard method [21]. The Si was used for the gate contact.

We carried out molecular orbital (MO) calculations using the Gaussian 09 program [22]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to optimize the geometry and estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies using the B3LYP method with 6-31G(d) basis set. These energies for AC5 and AC′7 were found in the literature [20,23]. We calculated the polarizability tensor with the optimized molecular geometries from 500 to 750nm using the Coulomb-attenuating method (CAM-B3LYP) [24].

                        Fig. 3
                        a shows an unpolarized broadband emission spectrum of the AC′5 crystal. Two peaks were observed around 560nm and 595nm. The presence of the jagged fringes disabled us from determining the exact peak locations. Fig. 3b displays the detailed profile of the spectrum at 559–565nm. Periodic modulation due to the interference was clearly visible. These modulations ranged from 555 to 715nm. Fig. 3c and d exhibits corresponding spectra for the AC7 crystal. Major peaks were observed at around 540, 565 and 610nm. The periodic modulations (see Fig. 3d) ranged from 540 to 740nm. For the AC′5 and AC7 crystals the emissions polarized parallel to the normal to the substrate plane were ∼4.5 and ∼6.6 times stronger than those polarized perpendicular to that normal, respectively. The result indicates that the modulated emissions are polarized perpendicular to the substrate plane.

We calculated the wavelength dependence of group refractive index n
                        g for every ∼5nm from the variation of mode order of fringes, its wavenumber variation, and the resonator length following the reported procedures [12,16]. Open circles and diamonds in Fig. 4
                        a show the results. The n
                        g values for the AC′5 (AC7) crystal ranged between 4.3 and 2.9 (6.4 and 3.2) in the wavelength from 555 to 715nm (540 to 740nm).

We estimated the dispersion of the phase refractive index n from the wavelength dependence of n
                        g following the reported methods [12,16]. To this end we assume that the dispersion is described by the simple Sellmeier dispersion formula

                        [12,16]. Here, fitting parameters A and B are nondimensional and C has the dimension of length (wavelength) [12,16]. From the experimental data (the open circles and diamonds in Fig. 4a), we fitted n
                        g curves (solid curves in Fig. 4a) after iterative calculations using the appropriate initial parameter values [12]. Table 1
                         lists the final values A, B, and C of AC′5 and AC7 together with those reported for AC5 and AC′7 [12]. Fig. 4b indicates the phase refractive index dispersions using these calculated and reported parameters [12]. The refractive indices of AC′5 (AC7) ranged from 2.69 to 2.47 (from 3.14 to 2.73).

AC7 indicated a multimode laser oscillation. Among the emission peaks of the AC7 crystal around 540, 565 and 610nm (Fig. 3c), the 565-nm peak became dominant with increasing incident laser light energies. Fig. 5
                        a shows the low-resolution emission spectra of the AC7 crystal. Under excitation pulse energy of 4.7mJ/cm2, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak located at 565.2nm was 7.70nm. In Fig. 5b the peak intensity is plotted as a function of the excitation pulse energy. The peak intensities were taken at the maximum intensity of each spectrum (between 557. 8 and 566.0nm). Nonlinear increment of the intensity was clearly noted around 2.5mJ/cm2: This indicated the threshold energy of the laser oscillation. Fig. 5c shows corresponding high-resolution spectra between 563 and 568nm. At the energy over the threshold, the fringes became clear (see the spectra for 3.7 and 4.7mJ/cm2 in Fig. 5c). Under laser light excitation, the AC′5 crystal obviously indicated the laser oscillation as well. Fig. 6
                        a and b shows the low-resolution emission spectra of the AC′5 crystal and their peak intensity plotted as a function of the excitation pulse energy, respectively. The spectra peaked at ∼544nm with the FWHM of 5.66nm at 3.5mJ/cm2. The threshold energy was around 1.5mJ/cm2. Fig. 6c indicates high-resolution spectra between 539 and 549nm under several excitation energies. The spectra definitively indicated sharp fringes having deep valleys due to the multimode oscillation (see the spectra for 2.2 and 3.5mJ/cm2 in Fig. 6c). These results demonstrate the coherence of the laser lights from the AC′5 and AC7 crystals.

From the fringes at 3.5mJ/cm2 for AC′5 and at 4.7mJ/cm2 for AC7, we estimated the group refractive indices to be 4.39 at 544.2nm and 5.30 at 564.6nm, respectively [11]. These agree well with those estimated from the fringes of the broad band emissions (see the closed circle and square in Fig. 4a).


                        Fig. 7
                         shows polarized reflectance spectra of the AC′5 (Fig. 2b) and AC7 (Fig. 2d) crystals. We measured these spectra along the P- and A-directions displayed in Fig. 2b and d. For both A- and P-directions, interference fringes were observed in the spectra from 450 (500) to 800nm for AC′5 (AC7). Using these fringes, we estimated the averaged group refractive indices along each direction following the reported method [15]. To do this we used the fitting function f(λ)·cos(4πn
                        g
                        d/λ)+
                        g(λ) (see gray dotted curves in Fig. 7), where f(λ) and g(λ) are trial cubic polynomials [15,16]. Here, we assume that the principal axes of the refractive indices are parallel to the P- and A-directions [27]; see Fig. 2b and d. For AC′5 we obtained the group refractive indices at 1.74 along the P-direction and 1.58 along the A-direction. These indices were averaged ones from 450 to 800nm. For AC7, the corresponding number averaged from 500 to 800nm was 1.75 (1.56) for the P-direction (A-direction). These results are summarized in Table 2
                        . AC′5 indicated the smaller indices than AC5 (1.87 along the a-axis and 1.62 along the b-axis) [15] and AC7 showed the larger indices than AC′7 (1.68 along the b-axis and 1.48 along the a-axis) [12]. Table 2 includes the phase refractive indices averaged over 555–715nm for AC′5 and 540–740nm for AC7 (Fig. 4b). These indices are relevant to the direction parallel to the normal to the substrate plane. This direction is represented as ⊥PA-direction in the table.

The FET devices showed p-type conductions. Despite of the nonlinear increases in the drain currents around the origin, those currents were clearly saturated at the larger magnitude of the drain–source voltages. Fig. 8
                         exemplifies output characteristics of the top-contact AC7 crystal FET. The hole mobilities were estimated to be 0.091cm2/Vs in the saturation region and 0.035cm2/Vs in the linear region. The hole mobilities of the bottom-contact type FETs ranged 2.1×10−4−2.4×10−4
                        cm2/Vs for AC′5 and 1.4×10−3–1.9×10−3
                        cm2/Vs for AC7 at the saturation regions.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The AC7 and AC′7 crystals indicated the 1.14–1.17 times larger phase refractive indices than the AC′5 and AC5 crystals (Fig. 4b). Correspondingly Fig. 4b indicates that the dispersion curves are separated as a whole into two sets of upper and lower curves. This is due to the difference in π-conjugation extension (i.e. the molecular length) of TPCOs [16]. Closely inspecting the individual curves, however, those of the thiophene-terminated TPCOs (AC′5 and AC7) exhibited a shift toward a longer wavelength region relative to those of the phenylene-terminated TPCOs (AC5 and AC′7) of the same total ring number (see Fig. 4b). This is because that AC′5 (AC7) has one more thiophene ring than AC5 (AC′7) [6,7]. When compared at fixed same wavelengths around 600nm or longer, furthermore, AC7 indicated somewhat smaller indices than AC′7. This reflects the following: The parameter (A
                     +
                     B)1/2 in Table 1 is thought to represent the phase refractive index at an infinite wavelength [16]. AC7 indicate the smaller (A
                     +
                     B)1/2 than AC′7. As for AC5 and AC′5, these indicate the same value.

AC5 and AC′7 molecules stand nearly upright against the substrate plane in the crystals [15,19]. The molecular long axes defined as a line connecting the terminal carbon atoms of the molecule are at angles 1.5° for AC5 and 1.75° for AC′7 to the normal of the ab-plane (substrate plane) [15,19]. In XRD patterns (θ−2θ scan) of the AC′5 crystal a well-resolved line arose at 4.18° as the first-order diffraction and higher-order lines up to the 4th order were resolved as well. From these lines we evaluated the plane separation to be 21.28Å. The corresponding separation was similarly estimated at 29.25Å for the AC7 crystal. These numbers are related to 21.62Å and 29.64Å observed for the AC5 and AC′7 crystal, respectively [15,19]. The separation 21.28Å (29.25Å) therefore reflects the molecular length of AC′5 (AC7) as in the case of the AC5 and AC′7 crystals. In other words, the XRD results indicate that the AC′5 and AC7 crystals comprise a highly aligned layered structure of the molecules. In the AC5 and AC′7 crystals the A- and P-directions coincide with the a- or b-axis [15,19]. Consequently, the A- and P-directions of the AC′5 and AC7 crystals in Table 2 are associated with the crystallographic short axes, even though the crystallographic data are unavailable for AC′5 and AC7.

                      depicts calculated polarizabilities of TPCO molecules as a function of wavelength. We selected the maximum values among the components of the diagonalized polarizability tensor. Note that these are pertinent to the direction of the molecular long axis [11]. Assuming the upright configurations of the AC′5 and AC7 molecules in those crystals as in the case of the AC5 and AC′7 crystals, the polarizabilities of Fig. 9 are likely to be associated with the dispersions in Fig. 4b. We estimated the polarizabilities of the thiophene-terminated TPCOs to be smaller by ∼2% than those for the phenylene-terminated ones. This is consistent with the smaller indices of AC7 at the longer wavelength regions than AC′7. The calculated polarizabilities relevant to two directions perpendicular to the molecular long axis indicated smaller values (∼20–70) and weak wavelength dependences [16].

The optically-excited laser oscillation spectrum of the AC7 was peaked around 565nm (Fig. 5c). The AC′7 crystal indicated the laser oscillation spectrum around 562nm along with 525nm [12]. The laser oscillation of the AC′5 was observed around 544nm (Fig. 6c) closely related to that of the AC5 crystal (544nm) as well [11].

Meanwhile, the maximum mobility of AC7 (0.091cm2/Vs) was comparable with that of AC′7 (0.098cm2/Vs) [19]. The spectroscopic and charge transport results thus indicate that the related optoelectronic properties are expected in the TPCOs composed of alternating thiophenes and phenylenes of the same aromatic ring numbers. Table 3
                      summarizes the HOMO and LUMO energies of TPCOs. The thiophene-terminated AC7 (AC′5) indicated the slightly lower energies than the phenylene-terminated AC′7 (AC5) except the HOMOs of AC7 and AC′7. The difference in LUMO energy between AC′5 and AC5 (AC7 and AC′7) was 0.03eV (0.02eV). These related numbers reasonably explain the related optoelectronic properties of the thiophene- and phenylene-terminated TPCOs.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have grown the crystals of two alternating TPCOs, AC′5 and AC7. These molecules were characterized by thiophenes located at both molecular terminals. Using these crystals we have determined their dispersions and anisotropic refractive indices. We also made field-effect transistor (FET) devices using these crystals and carried out their electrical measurements. We compared the results with those for other alternating TPCO analogs AC5 and AC′7. Analyzing the interference fringes in the emission and reflectance spectra, we determined the refractive index dispersion along the direction perpendicular to the flat crystal plane and estimated the other two anisotropic group indices in the directions parallel to the wide crystal plane. The dispersion curves are separated as a whole into two sets of upper and lower curves; i.e. those of AC7 and AC′7 along with those of AC′5 and AC5.

The maximum mobility of AC7 (0.091cm2/Vs) was comparable with that of AC′7 (0.098cm2/Vs). The experimental results of the refractive indices and charge transport on the FET devices mean that both the thiophene-terminated TPCOs and the phenylene-terminated TPCOs exhibit related properties when they have the same total ring number. This can be explained by the similar HOMO and LUMO energies of both the types of TPCOs. Thus the present studies add a different class of TPCOs; i.e. the thiophene-terminated compounds as useful optoelectronic materials.
