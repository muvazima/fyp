                  Cranial nerve palsy caused by aneurysmal compression has not been fully evaluated. The main causes of symptoms are considered to be direct mechanical compression and aneurysm pulsations. Recent studies indicate that nerve dysfunction is mainly induced by pulsation rather than by direct compression, and successful cases of endovascular surgery have been reported.

The patient presented with peripheral facial nerve palsy but not hemifacial spasm and was successfully treated by coil embolization. To investigate the mechanisms underlying peripheral facial nerve palsy, fluid structure interaction (FSI) analysis can approximate displacement and the magnitude of aneurysmal wall motion due to hemodynamic forces. In our case, maximum mesh displacement was observed at the aneurysmal wall attached to the facial nerve inside the pons rather than the REZ, which explains the clinical manifestation of facial nerve palsy in the absence of hemifacial spasm.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cranial nerve palsy caused by aneurysmal compression is considered to result from direct compression and aneurysm pulsations against the nerve. Recent studies indicate that nerve dysfunction is mainly induced by pulsation rather than direct compression, and successful endovascular surgeries have been reported [1–3]. Improvement of neuropathy is considered to result from reduced intra-aneurysmal flow, which in turn attenuates pulsation. Even though aneurysm size is not reduced after coil embolization, symptom resolution is observed [1]. Flow diverters have recently been used to treat symptomatic unruptured aneurysms [4]; therefore, it has been proposed that symptomatic improvement may be related to hemodynamic changes inside the offending aneurysm. However, the correlation between cranial nerve palsy and aneurysmal pulsations has not been fully elucidated.

While there are relatively few reports of hemifacial spasm due to neurovascular conflicts caused by cerebral aneurysm [5–7], facial nerve palsy in these cases is even more rare. We treated a patient with an unruptured vertebral artery-posterior inferior cerebellar artery (VA-PICA) aneurysm that contacted the facial nerve at its root exit zone (REZ). The patient presented with peripheral facial nerve palsy without hemifacial spasm and was successfully treated with coil embolization. To further investigate the cause of nerve palsy, we carried out fluid structure interaction (FSI) analysis, which allowed us to assess aneurysm wall motion magnitude by calculating the total mesh displacement [8–10]. We hypothesize that the location most affected by aneurysm pulsation was at the point of maximum total mesh displacement, and this may have caused the observed nerve dysfunction. Using FSI, we attempted to determine if stimulation of the elastic aneurysmal wall coupled with its pulsation was a cause of cranial nerve palsy in this patient. Our findings highlight the clinical usefulness of FSI analysis in investigating cerebral aneurysm pulsation as a potential cause of cranial nerve palsy.

A 59-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with sudden onset left-side peripheral facial nerve palsy (House-Brackmann grade III) without other neurological deficits. She had no medical history and was taking no medications. We initially suspected Bell׳s palsy; however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an unruptured VA-PICA aneurysm 8-mm in diameter wedged in the left side of the pons at the facial nerve REZ (
                        Fig. 1a and b). A small bleb was also found on three-dimensional rotational angiography (3-DRA; (Fig. 1c and d). Considering the aneurysm׳s location, it was clear that it caused the patient’s palsy. Furthermore, the sudden symptom onset indicated impending rupture, and immediate surgical treatment was considered. Given the aneurysm׳s shape and location, both clipping and coiling were viable treatment options. After explaining the situation to the patient, she selected coil embolization. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia 3 days after symptom onset. A series of bare coils were placed in the aneurysm, and total occlusion was achieved without any perioperative complications (
                        Fig. 2). Her facial weakness had gradually resolved 1 week after the procedure, and she was fully recovered after 1 month. A follow-up MRI showed no evidence of aneurysm recanalization.

To investigate the mechanism underlying the patient’s palsy, we generated fusion image reconstructions from 3-DRA and constructive image in steady state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI CISS) and visualized the anatomical position of the VA-PICA aneurysm and facial nerve using Amira software (FEI/VSG-division, Bordeaux, France). For analysis, the digital imaging for communication in medicine (DICOM) format for 3DRA was used, and blood vessels were extracted using Real Intage software (Cybernet System, Tokyo, Japan), allowing us to export data for meshing using ICEM CFD 15.0 software (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA) in the stereolithography (STL) file format. Using the triangulated surface from STL file as a base, a computational volumetric mesh was constructed. The mesh mainly comprised tetrahedrons with seven layers of prism elements near the wall surface to increase the analytic precision of the boundary layer. The maximum Reynolds number of aneurysm model was based on the inlet diameter and ranged between 300 and 600; thus, the flow was treated as laminar. Overall, the blood properties were assumed to comprise incompressible, laminar, and Newtonian flow with a constant density of 1100kg/m3 and a constant dynamic viscosity of 0.0036Pas. A pulsatile mass flow and pressure waveform from a flow-rate waveforms study by Ford et al. [11] were imposed for 1.80s at the inlet and outlet, respectively, and the pressure outlet range was approximately 80–130mmHg (
                        Fig. 3). No-slip boundary conditions were applied at the arterial and aneurysmal walls. The Navier–Stokes equations were used to simulate blood flow on the computational mesh.

Using ANSYS Mechanical software, we performed the Newton–Raphson algorithm for structural analysis of the aneurysm. The governing equation for the structural domain was the momentum conservation equation. The mesh type used was structural shell, and the aneurysmal walls were modeled as an isotropic, incompressible, and linearly elastic solid with a density of 1100kg/m3, Poisson׳s ratio of 0.49, and a thickness of 0.38mm [10,12–14]. The experimental results of aneurysm elasticity studies have shown that the elastic modulus is as high as 300MPa compared to 1MPa for a normal artery [14]. The elastic modulus of 5.0MPa was chosen based on these experimental results and values used in similar FSI studies [12–14].

The numerical simulations for fluid and structural analysis were performed using ANSYS CFX and ANSYS Mechanical software, respectively. The coupling of FSI simulation was performed using ANSYS Workbench 15.0 as a fully coupled two-way FSI and solved iteratively within each time step until the specified residual of 10−5 (RMS) and 10−3 were reached for ANSYS CFX and ANSYS Mechanical, respectively. The initial values were obtained from a steady-state solution based on the initial flow condition of cardiac cycle.

In terms of the boundary conditions on the FSI interfaces, the displacements of the fluid and solid domain must be compatible and tractions at these boundaries must be at equilibrium. No external boundary condition of pressure was applied in this study. A two-way fully coupled FSI was used where the pressure exerted by blood flow to the walls in the fluid domain and wall deformation owing to hemodynamic pressure in the solid domain were exchanged iteratively. A uniform coupled time step of 0.005s was used. The fluid meshes were composed by 732,531 tetrahedral elements and 402,222 nodes, and the structural meshes were 2399 shell elements and 2423 nodes. These meshes were sufficient for computational convergence. Within one-time step during the FSI simulation, the forces acting on the body are interpolated from the converged solution provided by the fluid solver. After interpolating the forces from the fluid mesh to the surface mesh of the structure, a converged solution of the structural dynamics will be attained under the effect of the acting forces. The response of the structure to the emerging load represents a displacement of the structural grid nodes, namely the wall displacement. The displacements at the boundary between structure and fluid are interpolated to the fluid mesh which leads to its deformation. This step closes one inner loop of the simulation and, these steps are repeated until the changes in the flow forces and the structural displacements fall below the convergence criterion. The loop of simulation and the convergence criterion of ANSYS Multi-field Solver Process are referred to in Appendix.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The 3DRA-MRI CISS fusion image showed that the aneurysmal dome was attached at the REZ, and a small bleb was observed on the opposite side (
                     Fig. 4a). FSI analysis obtained the maximum mesh displacement at the attachment with the facial nerve, mostly proximal to the REZ, which resides within the pons (Fig. 4b). The maximum mesh displacement at the peak systole was 0.213mm.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Cranial nerve palsy caused by cerebral aneurysm is rare. Oculomotor nerve palsy is mainly caused by compression from a posterior communicating artery aneurysm that can be seen in the anterior circulation [15]. For facial nerve dysfunction caused by vascular pathology, hemifacial spasm rather than facial nerve palsy is typically seen, and this is generally caused by vascular compression from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery or PICA [16–18]. However, facial nerve palsy caused by aneurysmal compression is extremely rare, and there are few published case reports [19–22]. In our case, a VA-PICA aneurysm was wedged in the left side of pons and the patient did not experience hemifacial spasm, even though the aneurysm was located at the facial nerve REZ. The reason for this interesting finding could not be explained anatomically or morphologically; however, FSI analysis proved useful in identifying a potential explanatory mechanism.

FSI can evaluate the interaction of a movable or deformable structure with an internal fluid flow and approximate aneurysm wall motion by calculating the total mesh displacement. The 3DRA and MRI CISS fusion image indicated that the attachment of the facial nerve with the aneurysmal wall occurred towards facial nerve fibers inside the pons rather than the REZ, and FSI analysis resolved the total mesh displacement in this area. The facial nerve is most affected by aneurysmal pulsations at the wall with the maximum mesh displacement, which would cause facial nerve palsy rather than hemifacial spasm. Importantly, stronger pulsations added to the mass effect at that point and affected facial nerve fibers inside the pons, which eventually caused her symptom. Pulsation transmitted from the aneurysmal wall to adjacent neural structures is considered to cause not only mechanical irritation but also transduction of mechanical energy that causes eventual damage through the interface. This may explain the appearance of neurological symptoms and the natural recovery that took place after coil embolization, even though aneurysm size did not change significantly [1,23]. Several papers have reported that the important compression points for hemifacial spasm are in the proximal segment of the REZ, on the pontine surface, or even at the pontomedullary sulcus area where the facial nerve originates [24,25]. In our case, the aneurysmal wall area of maximum mesh displacement was observed at a more proximal segment. If the maximum mesh displacement was instead in the REZ or along the nerve more distally, we speculate that the patient would have developed hemifacial spasm [26].

The improvement of facial nerve palsy after coil embolization was related to reduced inflow into the aneurysm, and reduced aneurysmal wall pulsations in the area where maximum mesh displacement was observed. Our preliminary analysis indicates that high wall motion and pulsations were related to a symptomatic aneurysm that caused cranial nerve palsy in the present case.

A limitation of this study was that we did not directly view the aneurysm and facial nerve during surgery, and no electroneurography testing was performed. In addition, the thickness of the aneurysmal wall was defined as the same throughout the entire lesion, and we did not take the initial stress effect into consideration [27]. The site of maximum mesh displacement was in line with the symptom and suggested aneurysm expansion in this area. Thus, FSI analysis may provide important clues in understanding how aneurysms grow and eventually rupture, particularly when considering the previous report by Lee et al. that total mesh displacement of ruptured aneurysms was higher than in unruptured cases [28]. We only reported results from a single case. A comprehensive study of a series of similar cases is needed and will be the focus of future work.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

FSI analysis can be used to assess hemodynamic phenomena in pulsating aneurysms causing cranial nerve palsy and analyze the effectiveness of endovascular treatment in such patients. Therefore, FSI analysis is potentially an approach to understand the significance of neurovascular conflicts intracranially. Further development and application of this method is required to expand the theoretical basis of aneurysm growth and rupture mechanisms, as well as factors that may lead to or prevent them.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

Cranial nerve palsy caused by aneurysmal compression has not been fully evaluated. Symptoms are mainly caused by arterial pulsation of the aneurysm, rather than by direct compression. We found an unruptured vertebral artery-posterior inferior cerebellar artery (VA-PICA) aneurysm compressing the facial nerve at the root exit zone (REZ). The patient presented peripheral facial nerve palsy, but not hemifacial spasm. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this symptom, we utilized fluid structure interaction (FSI) analysis, an approach that can approximate displacement and the magnitude of aneurysmal wall motion due to hemodynamic forces. A 59-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for sudden onset of left side peripheral facial nerve palsy (House-Brackmann grade III) without other neurological deficits. MRI revealed an unruptured VA-PICA aneurysm 8mm in diameter wedged in the left side of the pons at the facial nerve REZ. Coil embolization was chosen as the treatment, and her facial weakness gradually resolved, then fully recovered. Using FSI analysis, which allowed us to assess the magnitude of aneurysm wall motion by calculating the total mesh displacement, we simulated the magnitude of aneurysmal wall motion. Maximum mesh displacement was observed at the aneurysmal wall attached to the facial nerve inside the pons rather than the REZ, which explains the clinical manifestation of facial nerve palsy in the absence of hemifacial spasm. This preliminary report demonstrates the utility of FSI analysis for investigating cranial nerve neuropathy.

The solution process for multi code coupling (MFX) is shown in the figure below.

The solution loop consists of two loops: the multi-field time loop and the multi-field stagger loop. Within each time step is the stagger loop. The stagger loop allows for implicit coupling of the fields in the MFX solution. The number of stagger iterations applies to each time step in the MFX analysis. Within each step in the time step loop, the field solutions are repeated in the stagger loop until convergence. The number of iterations executed within the stagger loop is determined by the convergence of the loads transfer between fields or the maximum number of stagger iterations. For a transient analysis performed in CFX, the stagger iteration contains many CFX coefficient iterations, which loop until convergence or until the maximum number of coefficient iterations is reached. Load transfers between fields occur at each stagger loop. Global convergence is checked after the load transfer. If global convergence of the load transfer is not achieved, another stagger loop is performed.

At the end of each stagger iteration, the ANSYS master checks the convergence of the quantities transferred across the interface and the fields within each field solver. The analysis proceeds to the next time step if the interface quantities have converged. The stagger solution continues until the maximum number of stagger iterations has been reached or convergence occurs. The default is 10 stagger iterations.

The convergence tolerance (TOLER) for the quantities transfer across the surface field interface. The default is 0.01(1%).

By definition, convergence occurs when the changes of the interface loads are smaller than the input tolerance TOLER.
