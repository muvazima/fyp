                  Deformable models are mathematical tools, used in image processing to analyze the shape and movement of real objects due to their ability to emulate physical features such as elasticity, stiffness, mass and damping. In the original approach, parametric models are obtained from the minimization of an energy functional by means of the Euler–Lagrange equation. Finite element method is used for spatial discretization. The shape and position of the model is governed by a second-order partial differential equation system, which is obtained by applying the calculus of variations. Subsequent work propose a model formulation defined completely in the frequency domain, by translating the PDE system into the Fourier domain. This new approach offers important computational efficiency and an easier generalization to multidimensional models, since each spectral component of the model is ruled by an independent PDE. This paper reviews the frequency based formulation and analyzes the convergence and stability of these multidimensional parametric deformable models. Results show that the accuracy and speed of convergence depend on the dynamic parameters of the system and the spectrum of the data to be characterized, providing a procedure to speed-up the convergence by an appropriate choice of these parameters.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Deformable models are mathematical structures inspired by non-rigid physical objects. They are able to describe the boundaries and inner parts of real objects by means of curves, surfaces or volumes that deform under the influence of internal and external forces. The physical characteristics of the objects, such as elasticity, stiffness or mass, are emulated by the use of the internal forces. By contrast the external forces lead the model to follow the shape of the data to be characterized. This data is obtained regularly by means of multidimensional images, although deformable models can also be applied to other types of signals.

The shape of the model is usually determined from the minimization of an energy functional through an iterative process. In this functional both internal and external energies influence the outline and position of the model. Thus, the final state is achieved when equilibrium is reached between these internal and external forces. Euler–Lagrange is applied to this functional providing a partial differential equation (PDE) system which characterizes the shape of the model. Since models are dynamic, if data changes over the time, external forces are recalculated, and then the model can rapidly adapt to the changing data by means of this PDE. Consequently, the deformable model is able to emulate the shape and physical properties of changing objects, especially those with non-rigid motion or deformation.

These models have been used and further developed extensively in the last three decades due to their wide range of applications in the field of image processing and computer vision. The main motivation is to provide reliable tools to analyze, model and reconstruct datasets where the challenge lies in retrieving high-level information from low-level signals while minimizing the impact of noise and other unwanted effects. Among their vast range of applications are pattern recognition [1–3], object and motion tracking [4,5] as well as image segmentation [6–10]. In addition, their usage in the simulation of soft tissue [11,12], computer animation [13–15] and non-destructive testing of products [16,17] makes these models particularly valuable. Furthermore, in the field of medical imaging [9,10,18,19], the widely recognized value of deformable models arises from their ability to segment, match and track images of anatomic structures exploiting features derived from datasets.

Deformable models were introduced by Kass et al. [20] under the name of active contours or snakes. Since these models held a single parameter, they were able to characterize linear objects which should be defined in the two-dimensional plane. Terzopoulos et al. generalized them to three dimensions in [21,22]. Nowadays, deformable models are well-known tools in the literature. Montagnat et al. [23] provides a comprehensive classification of different approaches according to the surface representations and mathematical background. Besides, books [18,24] describe the formulation of most used models focused on medical image processing.

When designing deformable models a distinction between discrete and continuous representations must be made. First, with discrete representations the geometry of the model is only known at a finite set of points. Particle systems [14], spring-mass models [25,26] and simplex meshes [27–31] are discrete approaches. In contrast, continuous representations offer the ability to compute differential quantities such as surface normals or curvature everywhere in the model because they provide at most a 
                        
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      continuity. They must be discretized for the iterative process, but the continuous function can be easily collected after each iteration.

Continuous deformable models can be broadly classified into explicit and implicit models. In the explicit models [2,6,20,21,32], also known as parametric ones, the object is represented by means of meshes (curves, surfaces or volumes) whose shape evolves under the control of internal and external forces. Polynomial finite support representation [32], deformable templates and modal decomposition are examples of continuous explicit schemes. The shape deformation is the main advantage of this kind of models since it allows a fast adjustment to different objects. In contrast, their main drawback is the difficulty to change the topology of the model, so the basic topology must be created before the deformation. These topological constraints could provide however some benefits in experiments with a priori knowledge about the rough shape of the data of interest. Specifically, these models ensure that no topological change between initial an final stage is produced.

Nevertheless, in order to overcome these constraints of the explicit models, several works have been developed over recent years. In [33] 
                     T-snakes are proposed, an extension of the classic snakes to provide flexibility in topology by means of an iterative reparameterization of the contours. Several works [34–36] develop techniques based on detecting the self-intersections in the evolving mesh and merging the colliding regions using a set of remeshing rules. In [37] undesirable loops of an active contour are detected by inspecting the total net change of a given contour angle. Similarly, [38] shows an approach where the mesh is iteratively updated by computing the Delaunay triangulation of the model.

The second class of deformable models, namely the geometric or implicit ones, use a distance transformation to define the shape of the n-dimensional object as a level set of an 
                        
                           (
                           n
                           +
                           1
                           )
                        
                     -dimensional object [39–41]. The progression of these implicit-scheme models is based on the theory of curve evolution, being able to provide topological flexibility in the iterative process. Therefore, topological changes can be automatically handled within the iterative process. As a drawback, the user interaction is more difficult and the computational cost is higher than the parametric models. Nevertheless, some optimizations have been proposed to increase the computational efficiency, as in the case of the narrow band principle, which was applied to the numerical evolution scheme of level sets [42,43] or to the energy itself [44,45], and nowadays are very popular in the literature [18].

In recent years, new approaches to deformables models have been published in order to characterize the inner part of objects. The formulation of MetaMorphs [46] integrates both shape and interior texture as a generalization of previous parametric and implicit geometric deformable models. The shape is represented implicity and the interior texture is captured using a nonparametric kernel-based approximation of the intensity probability density function. Furthermore, Topological Active Volumes (TAV) [47] are parametric 3D deformable models based on the active nets model. This model has two different kinds of nodes: external nodes for surface adjustment and internal modes for modeling the inner topology. Both MetaMorphs and TAV allow topological changes in their structure in order to adjust the concavities, detect holes and find separate objects in the scene [48].

Most approaches for the above mentioned deformable models are raised in the spatial domain [20,21,32]. This space-based formulation leads to a complicated extension to multidimensional systems, due to the resulting high computational load for models with a large number of nodes when defined in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                        
                      or higher [49]. Alternatively, a new approach for active contours were completely formulated in the frequency domain in [50]. Both spatial and frequency defined models accomplish a similar adjustment to the data, but the computational efficiency of the frequency approach is remarkable.

In [51] we presented a framework for multidimensional parametric models, which are completely defined in the frequency domain similarly to [50] from a generalization of the classical framework of active contours [32]. Although, B-splines are used as polynomial finite support, these models can be easily built with other shape functions. Besides, since it is set in the Fourier domain, this formulation can be applied to models of any number of dimensions with a low computational complexity, allowing the modeling of complex data with a high speed of adaptation. Therefore, open or closed active meshes can be used to model edges of three-dimensional objects as well as three-dimensional structures to characterize the inner part of multidimensional data. Furthermore, the efficient implementation of the model in the frequency domain allows fast tracking of changing data over time.

These models include a set of parameters that define their behavior, i.e., mainly elasticity, stiffness, mass and damping. Additionally they make use of other parameters that characterize how the model fits the data. The choice of these parameters is not a trivial task and it can restrict the final adjustment of the model and its speed of convergence. For this reason, it is highly advisable to study how these parameters determine the temporal evolution of the model and its convergence to the data. In [52] the convergence of active contours, i.e., unidimensional models, is analyzed using a modal decomposition based on an eigen analysis in the spatial domain. The work presented in [52] is limited to active contours and provides conditions that speed up the convergence and make it optimum. Namely, these are based mainly on the appropriate choice of the dynamic parameters of the model.

In this work we propose a similar study applied to the general framework of multidimensional parametric deformable models. Thus, their formulation is analyzed resulting in a procedure to maximize the speed of convergence maintaining the stability of the model. This analysis is performed completely in the frequency domain, which leads to a decoupling of the frequency components of the model. Hence, the convergence conditions are obtained individually for each frequency component, which allow us to apply the results to models of any number of dimensions and shape functions, avoiding the restrictions found in [52].

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the continuous formulation of the generalized multidimensional model. Section 3 describes the discretization applied to the model, resulting in an iterative process in the frequency domain. Later, Section 4 portrays the problem statement, i.e., the convergence analysis of the models. The study of the convergence conditions is also conducted in this section, which leads to the mentioned optimization procedure. Section 5 addresses the practical implementation of the models, detailing both the algorithm and the computational analysis of the proposed method. Results with single spectral component signals and real data are detailed in Section 6. Then, discussion about the convergence conditions and efficiency are detailed in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 presents the conclusions and intended future work.

                         depend on the parameters of the model. As shown in Section 4, the use of the IIR filter claims for less demanding stability conditions and it generally provides a faster convergence. The FIR scheme, on the other hand, allows a simpler addition of the extensions [50] and therefore an easier application to non-closed models. However, its evolution is slower than the previous case and stability conditions must be considered. Fig. 2

Finally, it is noteworthy that (20) and (21) can be obtained because (9) is a system of d decoupled PDEs and, under the mentioned considerations, this system can be written in matrix form using nested circulant matrices. In this case, the matrix multiplication is equivalent to a circular convolution of two discrete signals, whose transformation in the Fourier domain results in a product of their respective spectra. It should be noted that this approach is not straightforward in scenarios with non-linear PDEs, as for instance, the geodesic active contour [54,55] whose parametric implementation has a non-linear Euler–Lagrange equation which depends on the curvature of the contour.

This section addresses the convergence and stability characteristics of deformable models, whose dynamic nature is described by the iterative Eqs. (20, 21). The aim of this analysis is to determine the conditions to ensure system stability and speed up in the adjustment of the model to the data along the iterative process. In particular, the influence of the parameters 
                        
                           α
                           ,
                           
                           β
                           ,
                           
                           γ
                        
                      and η will be a key point, since the behavior of the deformable model, and hence the whole iterative process, are governed by them.

As described later in this section, although all parameters are involved in the adjustment process, their effect on the process is distinctly different. On one hand, α and β are the static parameters that characterize the elasticity and rigidity of the model. Their influence is noticeable in the level of adjustment of the model to the data depending on the level of artifacts or noise, characterized by high frequency components. On the other hand, the parameters η and γ are defined in terms of the dynamic parameters m and c, which have a greater impact during the process of adjustment. Specifically, γ has a big influence in the iterative system, since the first and second order coefficients of the system, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 a
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 a
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                     , depend on γ. The parameter η influences the spectrum of the filter of the iterative system, and hence, the stability of the process.

In the analysis of convergence it is important to distinguish the two stages that arise in the process of adaptation of the model to the dataset. During the first one, called transient state of the iterative process, the model moves quickly from the initial position to the rough shape of the object to be traced. In this stage some nodes of the model are trapped from the dominant borders while other nodes are affected only by the smoothness constraints of the model. The attraction of the nodes to the target is due to the external forces generated by the gradient of the data, whereas the filter 
                        
                           H
                           (
                           
                              
                                 ω
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      or 
                        
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                           (
                           
                              
                                 ω

                      is applied to all nodes as smoothing internal forces.

The second phase of the adaptation process, namely the steady-state, begins when the deformable model reaches the vicinity of the data of interest. In the course of this phase, the model moves slowly and tends to reach an equilibrium between external and internal forces.

The convergence and stability of the iterative systems underlying the implicit and explicit implementations of deformable models can be studied from two different approaches. One of them is by using the z-transform and analyzing the poles of the transfer function of the iterative system. The other approach is based on the analysis of the spectral radius of the matrix of a first-order iterative system, that is, the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue of the iteration matrix. Next, the two approaches will be used to ensure that both provide the same information about the dynamic behavior of deformable models described by (20) or (21).

Before proceeding, two assumptions are assumed. Firstly, we suppose slow variations of external forces, i.e.,

                           (

                           )
                           =
                           Q
                           (

                     . Secondly, the array of nodes 
                        
                           
                              
                                 U

                           (
                           
                              
                                 ω

                      is expected to converge to array 
                        
                           
                              
                                 U
                              
                              
                                 ∞
                              
                           
                           (
                           
                              
                                 ω
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     . Although the external forces are really time-dependent (or ξ-dependent) in a practical scenario, the static behavior of the external forces is necessary due to the difficulty of the general case. This assumption, similarly to that made in [52], allows us to analyse the dynamical properties of the deformable model in a certain moment. Moreover, experimental results in Section 6 will show that these assumptions are perfectly admissible.

In addition, it should be noted that since Eqs. (20) and (21) are expressed in the Fourier domain, each frequency component of 
                        
                           U
                           (
                           
                              
                                 ω
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      is decoupled from the rest of components in the iterative process. Then, the results of the analysis can be applied to models of any number of dimensions and any shape function, by simply calculating the functions 
                        
                           F

As mentioned in the beginning, the adaptation of the model involves two stages. During the first stage, some nodes of the model move quickly from the initialization to the rough shape of the object to be traced. The error along this transient stage shows an oscillating behavior in all modes of convergence and its envelope can be approximated by,

In Section 6.1, the evolution of the error during the transient state in one and two-dimensional models is simulated and compared to the theoretical approach of Eq. (35) for the three modes of convergence.

Once the model has reached the coarse adjustment to the boundaries of the data, begins the steady stage of the adaptive process, where a fine modeling of the object takes place. In this second phase, the model tends to evolve to an equilibrium between external and internal forces. This stage has a longer duration than the previous one since it involves a fine adjustment to the data. Moreover, depending on the mode of convergence, the way and speed of fitting changes substantially. For this reason the evolution of the model in steady state is examined below in each of the three modes of convergence.

                           This equation provides two values for the parameter γ that set the critically damped mode. Nevertheless, according to their physical meaning, γ must be always positive and nonzero. Therefore, only the positive value of γ can be chosen for the model, being expressed by,

Given that the iterative system is linear, if the data has mainly low frequency components,

                           This means that the dataset is composed mostly by structures with smooth shape. This assumption is perfectly admissible since in a practical scenario the majority of dataset can be approximated by smooth shapes.

                        . This is appealing, because large values of η increase the speed of convergence in transient state, but on the contrary the smoothing of the model is lower, specially with data with abrupt oscillations. As a result, reducing the value of η in this way leads to smoother and also stable models.

                           Note that due to implementation reasons, the application of external forces from the data involves a quantification of the values of these external forces, which can generate non-linearities. In case that they emerge in the unstable region of the spectrum, they must be filtered to avoid instability in the iterative system.

It is worth highlighting that by using the 
                           
                              e
                              DFT
                           
                        , the convolutions of the iterative system in the spatial domain become Hadamard products, i.e., point-wise products, of the e-dimensional frequency arrays. This new approach involves a reduction of the computational load of the algorithm, as discussed in Section 5.2.


                        Algorithm 1 summarizes the procedure for the fitting of the model to the data. The first step involves the parameters setting. Parameters 
                           
                              α

                         and η are fixed based on the dynamics and assumed elasticity and rigidity of the deformable model to characterize the dataset. On the contrary, parameter γ is calculated in order to optimize the speed of convergence. By assuming that the model is adjusted to the data in the final state, the spectrum of the data is proportional to the spectrum of the error in the initialization. Then, a frequency component

                         of the model can be selected in this spectrum of the error to converge in a critically damped behavior by computing the corresponding parameter

                         by means of Eqs. (39) or (49). In Section 6, it is illustrated how this method is applied to single and multiple spectral component signals.

After that, the model is initialized in the second step. As detailed in Section 1, it is important that the topology of the model be consistent with the topology of the data which is intended to be characterized.

For the calculation of the filters, two steps will be run. First, the frequency-domain shape and stiffness functions,

Before calculating the external forces used in the method, a preprocessing is usually applied to the target data under analysis. This step depends on this data and it usually implies an e-dimensional filtering as well as the use of basic operations of mathematical morphology [58]. For instance, in the medical dataset analyzed in Section 6, a B-spline based filtering followed by an extended-maxima transform, an opening and an erosion are applied in the preprocessing step. This procedure is useful for reducing the impulsive noise of the data and other unwanted effects. Additionally, this processing extends the influence of the external forces at a greater distance from the surface of the object. Next, the gradient of these processed data 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    I
                                 
                                 
                                    ′
                                 
                              
                           
                         is calculated.

At each iteration ξ, the array of external forces 
                           
                              q
                           
                         is obtained by mapping the position of the nodes 
                           
                              u
                           
                         to the arrays of the gradient data 
                           
                              ∇
                              
                                 
                                    I
                                 
                                 
                                    ′
                                 
                              
                           
                        . Note that this step is performed in the spatial domain whereas the iterative process is executed in the frequency domain. For this reason, two Fourier transforms must be applied here. Next, the position of the nodes is obtained by using the equation of motion defined in Eqs. (20) or (21). Given that this process is executed until the model is close enough to the outline of data, the average error between model and data is finally computed and used as loop exit condition.

In order to study the computational savings of the proposed method, the memory requirements and processor load will be compared for the spatial and frequency formulation. The iterative systems (20) and (21) can be used in models defined by e parametric variables using e-dimensional filters. These systems are able to process arrays of nodal variables and forces, all of them e-dimensional. It is worth noting that the models will evolve in a d-dimensional space. Therefore, the model is defined using d coordinate functions, each of them determined by its corresponding e-dimensional array of nodes and forces.

From Eqs. (20) and (21), it can be proven that for the iterative process, we need to store up to 7 arrays with size

                              u
                           
                         must be reshaped as column vector to be used in this iterative system. Thus, for the iterative process it is necessary to store three matrices of size

                         shows the memory requirements and number of operations for different model sizes. It can be seen that the computational savings of the frequency approximation with respect to the spatial one grows with increasing size and number of dimensions of the model.

It is noteworthy that the benefits of the frequency approximation over spatial one are fundamentally a reduction of the computational requirements as well as the simple convergence analysis and optimization procedure described in Section 4. This allows the use of the proposed formulation in large models in an efficient way. Nevertheless it should be noted that both spatial and frequency formulation run essentially the same iterative system with equivalent operations. Therefore, except for rounding errors, the accuracy in the model placement throughout the iterative process is approximately the same.

With the aim of validating the theoretical results of Section 4, a set of deformable models with different dimensions, shape functions and iterative schemes have been implemented and applied to multidimensional data. This section details the results of these simulations.

As stated in Section 2, the coordinate functions of the models are mutually independent. Thus, the experiment can be conducted on each coordinate function individually. Likewise, given that the whole process is implemented in the frequency domain, the models are represented by an orthogonal base, i.e., the e-dimensional spectral components. Therefore, the iterative system can be understood as a set of independent systems, each processing a spectral component of the model. Consequently, we can analyze a generic component of the model and subsequently ensure convergence for the whole system by fulfilling the conditions for all components.

In order to gain quantitative understanding of the analysis, as a first approach, e-dimensional sinusoidal signals with frequency

                                       ¯

                      are chosen as the data to be modeled. Since these signals contain a single spectral component, we can clearly study the evolution of that frequency component in the process of adjustment to the data. This experiment is performed with one- and two-dimensional models.

Later in Section 6.3, signals with multiple spectral components are considered and analyzed. Given that these datasets contain energy in several spectral components, an algorithm is proposed in order to calculate the optimal

                     . To be better understood, we introduce the proposed models in increasing order of complexity. In this way, the nodes of these models are defined in

                      being limited their motion to 1, 2 or 3 Cartesian spatial coordinates. That is, the nodes hold 1, 2 or 3 degrees of freedom depending on the complexity of the experiment.

First of all, the evolution of the error along the transient state is studied. Thus, a one-dimensional model with 128 nodes and a two-dimensional one with

                         illustrate that fact with some examples for one- and two-dimensional models. The solid line corresponds to the root square error, calculated as the difference between the nodes of the model and the data. The theoretical speed of the adjustment is shown in dashed line. The accurate adjustment between the theoretical and numerical results validates the analysis in this stage. This analysis has been also applied with different frequency values

As stated in Section 5.1, the gradient of the data is used as external forces 
                           
                              q
                           
                         for these experiments. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that if the external forces exceed the threshold necessary to attract the model to the data, their exact value or calculation procedure does not substantially influence on the speed of convergence. These forces affect only the oscillations in the evolution of the error shown in Figs. 9 and 10. So that, the frequency of these oscillations is proportional to the level of the forces.

The evolution of the model in the steady state is analyzed in this section. At this time the models are already close to the data, according to the assumptions of Section 4. Once again, sinusoidal signals with frequency

                         are used in order to perform the characterization of individual frequency components. Given that the model can be considered as a linear system, only its component

As detailed in Section 4, all implicit-scheme models hold eigenvalues with modulus lower than unity in all frequencies except the continuous one. Hence the iterative system is inherently convergent. In contrast, the parameter η must fulfill the conditions of Table 1 to guarantee the convergence of all frequency components of explicit-scheme models.

Each frequency component is associated with two eigenvalues. The speed of convergence of this component will be determined by the modulus of the largest eigenvalue. Since the fastest convergence is achieved when working on the critically damped case, one can optimize the speed of convergence for a given frequency component

In this section, we verify the results on the convergence detailed in the Section 4 by applying the iterative system (20) and (21) to data with multiple spectral components. These signals are three-dimensional synthetic or real data. Two-dimensional models are used in order to recovery the surface of the objects or structures of interest. Depending on the characteristics of the data to be delineated, these models are set to 1, 2 or 3 degrees of freedom, that is the number of Cartesian spatial coordinates in which variation of the nodes is allowed. Section 5.1 details the most important steps of the adaptation algorithm.

Even though these data have different spectral characteristics, the same method can be applied to all of them. The spectrum of data is analyzed, and the frequency band with maximum energy is allocated.

                         are computed for implicit and explicit scheme with Eqs. (39) and (49), respectively. Thus, the fastest speed of convergence can be achieved for the frequency components of the data with the most energy, and therefore on average for the whole signal.

Note that this procedure really optimizes the speed of convergence in the steady state. As described in Section 6.1, a faster convergence can be achieved in the transient state by using modes slightly overdamped. Nevertheless, since the transient state is usually significant only for a few iterations, especially in multi-component signals, in practice the steady state represents a large part of the overall convergence of the model.

First, deformable models are used to characterize the surface of three topographic datasets

                                    1
                                 
                              
                              -
                              
                                 
                                    DS

                        . They are delineated using two-dimensional models with motion in one coordinate function, i.e., z-coordinate of the nodes remains free whereas x and y coordinates are constant throughout the iterative process. Fig. 13
                         shows the results. The top three rows depict the models adapting to the three datasets.

                        b it can be drawn that the critically damped case provides again the fastest speed of convergence.

These results validate the analysis performed in Section 4, both for single-component signals and for real data with multiple spectral components. This allows an easy optimization of the parameters of the model to achieve the maximum speed of adjustment to the data with deformable models for any number of dimensions and shape functions.

The experiments carried out in this section aim to study the adaptation of the proposed models to different datasets, remaining the analysis of the robustness against noise and other artifacts beyond the scope of them. In [61] a thorough study about the effectiveness of the models in noisy environments is addressed. Specifically, a comparison between B-spline and finite differences deformable models is performed.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The abstract of this work claims to analyze the convergence and stability of the multidimensional parametric models defined in the Fourier domain in [51], with the aim of ensure the convergence of the iterative system as well as provide the optimum parameters to speed up the evolution of the model towards the data to be fitted.

The approach addressed in this paper is the evolution and generalization of the analysis described in [52], where the convergence and stability were studied only for active contours or snakes. Note that active contours are one-dimensional deformable models, i.e., models with only one parametric variable. The analysis performed in [52] split the convergence of the contour into its natural modes in the spatial domain, considering all spectral components simultaneously. This work provided the optimum parameters to improve the convergence of the contour in a two-dimensional scenario.

In contrast, the analysis of convergence and stability in the proposed multidimensional framework can be used with any deformable model with any number of parametric variables. The equation of motion (9) is discretized and translated into the frequency domain by means of the Fourier transform, providing a second-order iterative system where each frequency component is decoupled from the others. Since the e-dimensional Fourier transform can be applied to any e-dimensional deformable model, the framework proposed in this work can be generalized and used with models of any number of dimensions, shape function and iterative schemes, allowing the analysis and optimization for each spectral component

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, the convergence of multidimensional parametric deformable models based on the frequency domain [51] has been studied and the conditions that assure the stability and speed up the model evolution have been provided. The analysis has been applied to the multidimensional models in complete generality, that is, with any number of dimensions, shape function and iterative scheme.

The shape of the model in the steady situation depends on the parameter η, and the filter of the system,

                     , but its final situation is independent on the parameter γ. However, the behavior towards the final situation does depend on γ. Since the whole process is performed in the frequency domain, the iterative system is decoupled into its spectral components, allowing the calculation of the optimum γ that speed up the convergence of each frequency component, and therefore of the whole model. Regarding to stability, the parameter η shows a key role in models with explicit scheme. Thus, depending on the useful bandwidth of the data, a 
                        
                           
                              
                                 η
                              
                              
                                 min
                              
                           
                        
                      must be set to guarantee the stability of the system. Instead, all implicit-scheme models are inherently stable.

Therefore, the frequency framework of deformable models described in [51] reveals an interesting perspective for designing and analyzing parametric deformable models. Then, models with any number of dimensions and shape function can be easily constructed in the frequency domain by choosing the appropriate iterative matrices. Likewise, both implicit and explicit schemes can be selected by using the proper matrices, resulting in an iterative system with a high computational efficiency. Besides, the frequency domain analysis conducted in this paper enables the optimization of the dynamic parameters based on the bandwidth of the data to be modeled, providing a fast and accurate adjustment. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the models and the optimization algorithm in the recovery of boundaries of two- and three-dimensional objects.

Although the frequency-based formulation can be applied to models of any number of dimensions, the filter expressions are calculated in this paper only for models with 
                        
                           e
                           =

                      parametric variables. Therefore, the next future line of work involves the calculation of the frequency arrays for models of higher dimensions, i.e., 
                        
                           e
                           ⩾
                           3
                        
                     . Within this line of research, models with 
                        
                           e
                           =

                      or active volumes are particularly interesting. These three-dimensional structures represent a deformable volume, which can conform not only to the outline of an object, but also to its internal characteristics. In addition, given that active volumes should accommodate to the internal features of the object, the algorithm for calculating the external forces needs to be modified to provide these forces from the inner part of the dataset.

In summary, this general formulation of the parametric deformable models along with its convergence analysis, provide a valuable framework for the effective use of deformable models for segmentation, tracking, simulation and characterization of multidimensional data, with high flexibility, velocity and effectiveness.
