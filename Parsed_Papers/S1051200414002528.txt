                  Real-world signals are often not band-limited, and in many cases of practical interest sampling points are not always measured regularly. The purpose of this paper is to propose an irregular sampling theorem for the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), which places no restrictions on the input signal. First, we construct frames for function spaces associated with the FRFT. Then, we introduce a unified framework for sampling and reconstruction in the function spaces. Based upon the proposed framework, an FRFT-based irregular sampling theorem without band-limiting constraints is established. The theoretical derivations are validated via numerical results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) [1,2] is a generalization of the Fourier transform (FT) with additional free angle parameters. It can be interpreted as a rotation by an angle α in the time-frequency plane [3]. The FRFT can extend the utilities of the FT and has received much attention in recent years due to its numerous applications [1–9], including quantum physics, optics, radar, communications, signal processing, etc.

Sampling theory plays a crucial role in signal processing and communications, which allows real-life signals in the continuous domain to be acquired, represented, and processed in the discrete domain. In the sense of the FRFT [10–21], the most classical sampling result is the theorem of Xia [10], which states that for a finite energy

                     . It is clear that (5) applies only to the case of regular sampling. In many real applications, sampling points are not always measured regularly. Sometimes sampling steps need to be fluctuated according to input signals so as to reduce the number of samples as well as computational complexity. There are also many cases where undesirable jitter exists in sampling instants. Some communication systems may suffer from random delay due to channel traffic congestion and encoding delay. In such cases, the sampling system will become more efficient when a perturbation factor is considered. Towards this end, Zhao et al. [23] introduced an extension of Paley–Wiener's

                     -Theorem based upon the linear canonical transform, which is a generalization of the FRFT. However, the extension is appropriate to the case of band-limited signals only. Therefore, it is desirable to derive an irregular sampling theorem for the FRFT without band-limiting constraints. The purpose of the present paper is to fill this gap by exploiting the theory of frames. We first construct frames for function spaces associated with the FRFT, and then propose a unified framework for sampling and reconstruction in the function spaces. Further, without band-limited assumption, we establish an irregular sampling theorem for the FRFT. Numerical results are also presented.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, notation is introduced, and some facts of the frame theory and the discrete-time FRFT are briefly reviewed. In Section 3, a unified framework for FRFT-based sampling and reconstruction in function spaces is proposed. Then, an irregular sampling theorem of the FRFT without band-limiting constraints is established in Section 4. In Section 5, numerical results are given. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn in Section 6.

                     . Moreover, there are numerous real-world applications in which analogy signals cannot be sampled regularly and the data are known only on an irregularly spaced sampling set. In communication systems, when data from a regularly sampled signal are lost, it generally results in a sequence of irregular samples [26–28]. There are also applications which can benefit from introducing irregular sampling, e.g., quantization methods [29]. In all of these examples, standard reconstruction techniques developed mainly for regularly spaced samples are not applicable.

In order to derive an irregular sampling theorem for the FRFT, we need to introduce a function class

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we first presented a construction of frames for function spaces associated with the FRFT, and then proposed a unified framework for sampling and reconstruction in the function spaces. By using the derived results, an FRFT-based irregular sampling theorem without band-limiting constraints is established. The validity of theoretical derivations is demonstrated via numerical results.
