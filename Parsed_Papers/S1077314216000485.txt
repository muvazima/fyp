                  Large appearance changes in visual tracking affect the tracking performance severely. To address this challenge, in this paper we develop an effective appearance model with the highly discriminative features. We propose an online Fisher discrimination boosting feature selection mechanism, which selects features that reduce the with-in scatter while enlarging the between-class scatter, thereby enhancing the discriminative capability between the target and background. Moreover, we utilize a particle filtering framework for visual tracking, in which the weights of candidate particles take into account the context information around the particles, thereby enhancing the robustness of tracking. In order to increase efficiency, a coarse-to-fine search strategy is exploited to efficiently and accurately locate the target. Extensive experiments on the CVPR2013 tracking benchmark demonstrate the competitive performance of our algorithm over other representative algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Object tracking is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision with a wide range of applications, such as surveillance, human computer interaction, and medical assistance [1]. Although much progress has been made in recent years, it remains a challenging task due to large variations in object appearance caused by illumination changes, partial occlusion, deformation and so on. To well cope with these factors, it is of great importance to design an effective and efficient appearance model.

In general, the traditional tracking algorithms can be categorized into two categories based on their appearance models: generative trackers and discriminative ones. Generative trackers learn an appearance model with the target appearance information, and search for the most similar candidate in each frame with the minimum reconstruction error. In [2], Ross et al. present a tracking method that incrementally learns a low-dimensional subspace representation, which efficiently updates online to adapt the target appearance changes. In [3], tracking is modeled as a sparse approximation problem [4–7], in which a set of trivial templates are introduced to address the challenging issues like particle occlusion, pose variation, etc. Kwon and Lee [8] combine several observation and motion models in a particle filtering framework to handle large scale appearance and motion variations. Zhang et al. [9] model the tracking as a multi-task learning problem. Wang et al. [10] propose a generative tracking method based on a novel robust linear regression algorithm, which models the error term with the Gaussian–Laplacian distribution. Discriminative trackers localize the object by learning a decision boundary between the target and the background. Grabner et al [11]. propose an online boosting feature selection approach to select features for visual tracking. In [12], Grabner et al. further introduce an online semi-supervised boosting method into visual tracking, which alleviates the drifting problem in visual tracking. Hare et al. [13] employ an online kernelized structured output support vector machine (SVM) for visual tracking, which achieves favorable performance on the CVPR2013 tracking benchmark [14]. In [15], Babenko et al. formulate object tracking as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem and proposes an online MIL boosting algorithm, which selects features to design an appearance model. Zhang and Song [16] further propose a weighted MIL tracker by considering instance importance. In [17,18] the random Haar-like features that satisfy the compressive sensing theory is exploited as the object representation, which can achieve real-time tracking performance. In [19], Henriques et al. propose a fast tracking algorithm which exploits the well-established theory of circulant matrices, and hence provides a link to Fast Fourier Transform, which achieves competitive performance with fast speed. In [20] Henriques et al. formulate kernelized correlation filters (KCF) with circulant matrices, and efficiently incorporated multi-channel features in a Fourier domain.

The Haar-like features [21] are widely explored in the discriminative trackers [11–13,15,17] due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, most of these trackers cannot achieve competitive performance in the recently proposed CVPR2013 tracking benchmark [14] except for the Struck algorithm [13]. We argue that the potential power of the Haar-like features has not been fully exploited. In this paper, to enhance the discriminative capability of Haar-like features for visual tracking, we propose an online Fisher discrimination boosting feature selection method, which selects features that have small within-class scatter but big between-class scatter. Then we utilize a coarse-to-fine search strategy in a particle filtering framework to locate the target. Extensive evaluations on the CVPR2013 tracking benchmark [14] demonstrate its favorable performance compared with the representative trackers. In summary, the main contributions are summarized as follows:

                        
                           •
                           We propose an online Fisher discrimination boosting feature selection method, which selects the Haar-like features that can well discriminate target from background.

Our tracker achieves competitive results in the CVPR2013 tracking benchmark [14] with 50.2% in success plots and 72.0% in precision plots, showing the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection mechanism.

                                    i

                              ,
                           
                         in which each bag

                         contains n rectangle feature templates, of which each template 
                           
                              z

                                 j
                              
                           
                         represents a vectorized image patch inside the blue rectangle, and then we select k templates via an online Fisher discrimination boosting feature selection strategy, which constructs the feature template bags 
                           
                              
                                 T
                                 i
                              
                              ⊂
                              
                                 B
                                 i
                              
                           
                        . Secondly, a coarse-to-fine search mechanism is adopted to find the maximum classifier response location via the particle filtering method, in which the background context information is taken into account to reweight particles. Finally, the feature templates and classifier are updated according to object appearance variances. When the confidence of the classifier is lower than a threshold Θ, which means that the estimation is not credible, both the feature templates and classifier stop updating to avoid drift problem.

We employ the simple and effective Haar-like features to describe the appearance model in our tracking system. Although the Haar-like features have been widely applied to visual tracking [11,13,15,17,22], most of them cannot achieve favorable performance in the CVPR2013 tracking benchmark [14] because the fixed Haar-like feature templates are used, thereby limiting their discriminative capabilities. To address this problem, we propose an effective appearance model that is constructed by the adaptive Haar-like feature templates that are selected by the Fisher discrimination boosting criterion.

As illustrated by Fig. 2
                        , to take into account the proper granularities of features, we first constrain the width and height of the feature templates by

Then, we take into account the mutliscale appearance information by setting the templates in the same bag to the same size while the templates in different bags own varying sizes. Furthermore, to make the features more diverse, we constrain the locations of the every line rectangles by a Flock rule [23]:

The vector boosting algorithm in [25] relies on the special case of the exponential loss function of AdaBoost, and thus cannot be readily adapted to solve the above problem. Now, we present the proposed novel online vector boosting algorithm that can readily address the above problem. Our method is motivated by the algorithm in [26] that takes the statistical view of boosting, which tries to optimize a specific objective function

The proposed algorithm is an extension of the optimization problem in (9) in which both the outputs of its weak classifiers and final output are vectors rather than scalars. At all time we maintain n candidate weak classifiers in which the jth weak classifier is defined as

To efficiently search for the optimal state l, a coarse-to-fine search strategy based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) [27] is exploited which gradually approaches the maximum location response. The main steps of the search mechanism are summarized in Algorithm 3, where 
                           l
                         represents object location (x, y), which also represents object state. The first step roughly approximates the object location, and therefore a large radius γ and search step Δ is used to generate several candidate windows. The number of windows is much smaller than the exhaustive search method, but the search result is close to the groundtruth object location. The weight of each candidate window is proportional to the classifier response (15), and the top N high score windows are delivered to further fine search. Then, based on the coarse location, we iterate R times to refine the location based on a random walk motion model. Each parameter in

Therefore, we only utilize the last two frame negative samples to update the background information as

                        Evaluation metric: Precision plots and success plots defined in [14] are employed to evaluate the robustness of the tracking algorithms. The precision plot illustrates the percentage of frames whose predicted object location (center of the predicted box) is within a distance of 20 pixels from the center of the ground truth box. The score at the threshold 20 pixels is defined as the precision score. The success plot shows the percentage of frames whose intersection over union overlap with the ground truth annotation is over a threshold varying between 0 and 1. The successful frame is defined as the overlap score more than a fixed overlap ratio, which is defined as

                        Overall performance: Fig. 3
                         illustrates overall performance of the top 10 evaluated tracking algorithms (i.e., SCM [28], Struck [13], TLD [29], ASLA [30], CXT [31], VTS [32], VTD [8], CSK [19], LSK [33], and LOT [34]) in terms of precision plots and success plots. The proposed OFBT achieves competitive results in terms of both precision plot and success plot: the precision score of OFBT is 0.720, which outperforms Struct [13] (0.656) that employs the fixed Haar-like feature templates by a large margin; meanwhile, in the success plots, the proposed OFBT achieves the score of AUC 0.502, which outperforms SCM [30] by 0.3% and Struck [13] by 2.8%. The proposed OFBT exploits only simple adaptive Haar-like features to represent the object, and a coarse-to-fine particle filtering strategy to locate the object with small computation complexity, nevertheless it outperforms Struct and SCM that resort to complex learning techniques in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.


                        Attribute-based performance: We further evaluate OFBT on videos with 11 attributes to facilitate analyzing strength and weakness of the proposed algorithm (Figs. 4
                        –7
                        
                        
                        ). Since the AUC score of the success plot is more accurate than that at the representative threshold (e.g., 20 pixels) of the precision plot, in the following we mainly analyze our proposed algorithm based on the success plot according to the 11 attributes.


                        Fig. 4 illustrates the success plots of videos with attributes that our method achieves favorable results, in which OFBT ranks within top 2 on 9 out of 11 attributes. For the videos with attributes such as FM, BC, MB, DEF, BC, IPR, and OPR, OFBT ranks 1st among all evaluated algorithms. In sequences with FM and MB, Struct ranks 2rd, showing that the tracker with wide range search window and dense sampling can perform well on these attributes, and so does OFBT. In sequences with IV and OCC, both SCM and OFBT perform favorably well because they employ local features, in which OFBT exploits the Haar-like features from the target and background via templates with varying sizes while SCM learns the local patch features from the target and background with sparse representation. Similarly, on the OPR and IPR subsets, besides our tracker, the SCM and ASLSA trackers are also able to obtain satisfactory results, which can be attributed to the effective spare representations of local patches.


                        Fig. 5 shows that OFBT cannot perform well with two attributes, such as LR, SV. The low resolution makes OFBT less effective to extract useful information from the target object and this can be improved by considering the context information surrounding the target as [35]. OFBT only considers single scale tracking for simplicity, which can be readily extended to the multi-scale tracking by constructing scale pyramids, thereby improving performance on the sequences with SV attribute.


                           Deformation: 
                           Fig. 8
                            shows the tracking results of three challenging sequences with deformation attributes. In the Basketball sequence, the object suffers from great changes as the player runs in the basketball court. Fig. 8 shows that Struct, CXT, and TLD drift after suffering from the occlusion and appearance variance. Our tracker can deal with deformation well due to its online appearance update.

The Fleetface sequence suffers from scale changes, appearance varies, and background distraction when the object moves around the room. Many methods lose the object when the object turns his head due to the dramatically appearance changes from face to hair. The similarity from the bookshelf also makes the sequence more challenge. ASLA, Struct and our OFBT methods achieve well performance on this sequence.

In the Shaking sequence, the object undergoes both illumination change and pose variation. The sudden spotlight makes some trackers drift from the object. OFBT deals with it well and tracks the target in all the sequence accurately.


                           Heavy occlusion: 
                           Fig. 9
                            shows the challenge of heavy occlusions from background. In the David3 sequence, object appearance varies drastically when the man turn around. Except that, severe occlusion introduced by tree also makes the tracking task more difficult. In the Jogging sequence, object appearance varies when the woman runs along the road. Besides, occlusion from traffic light and distraction from another running women also add difficulty to successful tracking. In the Subway sequence, tracking object a man wearing black cloths, similar to the background. Other people with similar appearance walking along the road add distraction to the tracking task. Overall, OFBT shows favorable performance to cope with these challenges, which owes to the adaptive appearance model and particle filter framework.


                           Illumination change: 
                           Fig. 10
                            shows the tracking results of three challenging sequences where the targets suffer from drastic illumination changes. In the CarDark sequence, a car runs along the street at night that suffers from large changes in environmental illumination and background clutters, and TLD, CXT, and VTD drift gradually . In contrast, SCM, Struct, ASLA, VTS, CSK, LSK and our OFBT achieve much better performance. For the David sequence, the man walks around the room with appearance variance and illumination challenge. Some trackers drift to background when these challenges occurs. For the Fish sequence, illumination and Camera movement makes it challenging. Notwithstanding, our tracker achieve favorable performance due to its adaptive local appearance model.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have presented a novel visual tracking based on particle filtering framework. Our appearance model is constructed based on the highly discriminative feature templates selected via an online Fisher discrimination boosting feature selection mechanism, and an online update mechanism is employed to consider the appearance variance. A coarse-to-fine search has been employed to locate the final object location with low computation. Extensive experimental results on the CVPR2013 tracking benchmark [14] have demonstrated the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance to some state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.
