@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the last few decades, as a new generation of phosphors, rare earth doped alkaline earth silicates and aluminates have been proposed and developed for various display and signing applications because of their application in traffic signs, emergency exit routes, decoration, and textile printing, among others. Compared with the conventional sulfide materials used earlier, silicates and aluminates long afterglow phosphors yield much better characteristics, such as a longer duration time of the phosphorescence, brighter luminosity, improved chemical stability along with relatively easier preparation and lower cost [1–3]. Colors of the newly developed long lasting phosphors cover from blue to red. However, no phosphors with white light long afterglow has been developed into a commercial application so far, while white light is the most suitable for illuminating light sources. In traditional phosphors industry, the white color phosphors can be obtained through the combination of the available phosphors with the three primary colors, red, green and blue [4–6]. Recently, a novel method of achieving white light long afterglow phosphors was conceived and reported by two groups from China. Lei et al. firstly reported the white light emitting long afterglow phosphors CdSiO3:Dy3+ 
                     [7,8] and SrSiO3:Dy3+ 
                     [9]. Then Liu et al. studied the white persistent luminescence of CaAl2O4:Dy3+ 
                     [10] and Y2O2S:Tb3+ 
                     [11]. In all these materials, the white light long afterglow emission is achieved via the combination of different color emissions from an identical luminescence centre, Dy3+ or Tb3+. For instance, the two main groups of emission lines of Dy3+ are in the wavelength range 470–500nm (blue) and 570–600nm (yellow), corresponding to the 4F9/2
                     →
                     6H15/2 and the 4F9/2
                     →
                     6H13/2 transitions respectively. The two color light emissions can produce white light through an appropriate combination in Dy3+ doped materials. Because the afterglow decay process is largely controlled by the properties of traps in the host, the different color emissions from the identical centre will have the same decay process, thus keeping the afterglow color unchanged.

In the present paper, we report the synthesis of dysprosium doped di-strontium magnesium di-silicate (Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+) phosphor by high temperature solid state reaction method. This paper reports the structural characterization on the basis of XRD, TEM, EDX and FTIR analysis and studies of optical properties are also done on the basis of thermoluminescence (TL), photoluminescence (PL), long afterglow (decay) and mechanoluminescence (ML) properties.

The dysprosium doped di-strontium magnesium di-silicate (Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+) phosphor was prepared by the high temperature solid state reaction method. The starting materials are strontium carbonate [SrCO3 (99.90%)], magnesium oxide [MgO (99.90%)], silicon di-oxide [SiO2 (99.99%)] and dysprosium oxide [Dy2O3 (99.99%)] all of analytical grade, were employed in this experiment. Boric acid [H3BO3 (99.90%)] was added as flux. Initially, the raw materials were weighed according to the nominal compositions of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. Then the powders were mixed and milled thoroughly for 2h using the mortar and pestle. The grinded sample were placed in an alumina crucible and subsequently fired at 1050°C for 3h in air and at last the nominal compounds were obtained after the cooling down of the programmable furnace.

The powder X-ray diffraction pattern has been obtained by Bruker D8 advanced X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation and the data were collected over the 2θ range 10–80°. The phase structure of the sample was verified with the help of Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standard Data (JCPDS) file (JCPDS: 75-1736) and average crystallite size was calculated using the Debye Scherrer formula (D
                        =
                        kλ/βcosθ). The grain size of prepared phosphor was determined by TEM using TECHNAI G2. The samples required for TEM analysis were prepared by dispersing the sintered phosphor in methanol using an ultrasound bath technique. A drop of this dispersed suspension was put onto 200-mesh carbon coated copper grid and then dried into the air. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) was used for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the prepared phosphor. FTIR spectra were recorded with the help of IR Prestige-21 by SHIMADZU for investigating the finger print region (400–1400cm−1) as well as the functional group region (1400–4000cm−1) of sintered phosphor in middle infrared region (400–4000cm−1) by mixing the sample with potassium bromide (KBr). TL glow curves were recorded with the help of TLD reader 1009I by Nucleonix (Hyderabad, India Pvt. Ltd.). In the TL study, the mass of the sample was fixed (8mg), and every time takes the fresh sample for observation. The PL excitation and emission spectra were measured by a spectrofluorophotometer (SHIMADZU, RF-5301 PC) using the xenon lamp as excitation source. The decay curves were obtained using a Perkin Elmer fluorescent spectrometer with the proper excitation under a UV lamp (365nm). The ML measurement was observed by the home made lab system comprising of an RCA-931A photomultiplier tube (PMT). The ML glow curve can be plotted with the help of SM-340 application software installed in a computer attached with the storage oscilloscope. All measurements were carried out at the room temperature.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS@&#

The phase structure of the prepared phosphor was analyzed by the XRD. The position and intensity of diffraction peaks of the Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor is consistent with that of the powder diffraction file of International Center for Diffraction Database (ICDD: 75-1736) [12].

                         displays the XRD pattern of the prepared Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor, it can be concluded that the prepared sample is chemically and structurally Sr2MgSi2O7. The phase structure of the Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor is akermanite type structure which belongs to the tetragonal crystallography with space group P

                        21m, this structure is a member of the melilite group and forms a layered compound. The average crystallite size was calculated from the XRD pattern using Debye Scherrer relation D
                        =
                        kλ/βcosθ, where D is the crystallite size for the (hkl) plane, λ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray radiation [Cu Kα (0.154nm)], β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) in radiations, and θ is the corresponding angle of Bragg diffraction. In the case of (211) plane, average crystallite size of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was 60.38nm.

The grain size of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ is shown in Fig. 2
                        . The TEM images confirm the grain size of the prepared phosphor. From the TEM image, it can be observed that the prepared sample consists of grain with different size distribution. Moreover, the agglomeration of powder particles was also observed due to high temperature. The transmission electron microscopy results are in good correlation with the XRD result.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the EDX spectra of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The composition of the powder sample has been measured using EDX. Table 1
                         shows the compositional elements of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor, which is compare with the standard element. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is a standard procedure for identifying and quantifying elemental composition of sample area as small as a few nanometers. Their appeared no other emissions apart from Sr, Mg, Si, O and Dy in EDX spectra of the sample. In the spectrum intense peaks are present which confirm the formation of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor.

The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra have been widely used for the identification of organic and inorganic compounds. Fig. 4
                         shows the FTIR spectra of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The FTIR spectrum of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor contains clearly exhibited bands in the region (3437.15cm−1) of hydroxyl group show the stretching vibration of O–H groups. The hydroxyl group in sintered phosphor is might be due to presence of moisture through environment. The asymmetric stretching of (CO3
                        2−) carbonates can be observed in the range of 1900–1700cm−1. Two weak shoulders, which corresponds to the out of plane bending of appears at approximately 1969.70, 1868.94cm−1. These bands are due to a slight carbonation of the samples preparation [SrCO3 (raw material)]. The free CO3
                        2− ions has a D3h symmetry (trigonal planar) and its spectrum is dominated by the band at 1900–1700cm−1. The vibration band of 1633.05cm−1 are assigned due to the Mg2+ and bending of the sharp peaks in the region of 1469.12cm−1 are assigned due to Sr2+. According to the crystal structure of Sr2MgSi2O7, the coordination number of strontium can be 8 and 6. Therefore, Sr2+ can occupy two alternative lattice sites, the eight coordinated Sr2+ site [SrO8 (Sr1 site)] and the six coordinated Sr2+ site [SrO6 (Sr2 site)], and other two independent cations sites, namely Mg2+ [MgO4], and Si4+ [SiO4] also exist in the crystal lattice. Mg2+ and Si4+ cations occupy in the tetrahedral sites. Dy3+ ions can occupy four alternative lattice sites and the coordination number of dysprosium can be 6, 7, 8 and 9 (Dy1, Dy2, Dy3 and Dy4 respectively). It is hard for Dy3+ ions to incorporate the tetrahedral [MgO4] or [SiO4] symmetry but it can easily incorporate octahedral [SrO8] or hexahedral [SrO6]. Another fact that supports that the radius of Dy3+ (0.99Å) are very close to that of Sr2+ (about 1.12Å) rather than Mg2+ (0.65Å) and Si4+ (0.41Å). Therefore, the Dy3+ ions are expected to occupy the Sr2+ sites in the Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor.

In the presented spectrum the absorption bands of silicate groups were clearly evident. The Si–O–Si stretching modes for the silicate tetrahedral show infrared absorption bands, located at about 1082.89, 792.62, 718.25, 667.88, 631.89cm−1. The characteristic band centred at approximately 975.74, 925.36cm−1 is assigned to the Si–O stretching vibrations of the Si(Q2) tetrahedral and the group of bands at approximately 510.35, 475.16cm−1 correspond to the deformation of the TO4 tetrahedral form as well as the Mg–O modes. (T=Si, Mg). The FTIR spectra confirm the present elements in Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor [13–16].

As is well known, the existence of suitable charge traps in host lattice is responsible for long lasting phosphorescence. The duration of long lasting phosphor depends on the number of captured electrons/holes, and successively, the number of captured electrons/holes relies on the concentration and the depth of traps. Therefore, the appropriate depth of traps is crucial for long afterglow. If the depth of the trapping levels is too low, the phosphor would show a fast decay, which does not last for a long time. On the contrary, if it is too deep the phosphor will no longer show phosphorescence. Generally, it is considered that the shallower the trap is, the lower the temperature of TL peak [17]. TL technique is a useful tool for revealing the nature of trapping centers produced in an insulator or semiconductor excitation by X-rays, laser or ultraviolet.


                        Fig. 5
                         shows the TL glow curve of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor with different UV irradiation time (5, 8, 10, 15 and 20min) at 365nm UV source with a heating rate of 5°C/s. The TL glow curve peak occurred at 120.77°C and these peak positions remains constant with UV irradiation time. From the TL glow curve, it is seen that, initially TL intensity increase with increasing UV irradiation time. TL intensity are maximum for 10min of UV exposure, after that they start to decrease. It is predicted that with the increasing UV irradiation time, greater number of charge carriers are released which increases the trap density results in increase of TL intensity (density of charge carrier may have been increasing), but after a specific exposure (10min) traps starts to destroy results in decrease in TL intensity. The decreasing of charge carriers density is may be a reason for the low TL intensity at higher irradiation time (15 and 20min irradiation time).

On the mechanism of long afterglow, it is a common viewpoint that during the excitation period the energy of incident light is partly stored in the form of captured charges; those captured charges can be thermally released from the traps at room temperature to result in the characteristic emission of the luminescence ion. Because the release of the captured electrons is durative, the luminescence of the materials shows the property of long life [18,19].

The TL parameters i.e. activation energy (E), frequency factor (s) and shape factor (μg
                        ), for the prominent glow peaks of prepared phosphor were calculated using the peak shape method are shown in Table 2
                         
                        [20–22]. The relationship between the frequency factor‘s’ and the activation energy ‘E’ is given by the Eq. (1)

                        )=0.49–0.52 for the second order kinetics. [23,24].

The effect of different UV exposures on the Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor and different TL parameters like trap depth, shape factor, frequency factor is calculated (Table 2). In our case, shape factor (μg
                        ) is lies between 0.45 and 0.46, which indicates that it is a case of non-first order kinetics, approaching towards second order, responsible for deeper trap depth resulting in the long afterglow.

In order to study the luminescent properties of phosphor, the excitation and emission spectra of prepared Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was recorded. The excitation spectra were observed in the range of 200–400nm, consists of the f→f transition of Dy3+ are observed, and emission spectra were recorded in the range of 400–750nm. From Fig. 6
                        , the excitation and emission spectra is broad bands centered at 358 and 575nm. The excitation spectra for the emission at 575nm consist of a series of line spectra in 230–400nm with the strongest one at 358nm and some lines at 270, 345, and 371nm, which are ascribed to the transitions from the ground state to excitation states in the 4f9 configuration of Dy3+. One can also find that the emission lines of Dy3+ are broadened somewhat because there are several Stark levels for the 4F9/2
                        →
                        6HJ levels.

The emission spectra mainly consist of three groups of sharp lines peaked at about 470 (blue), 575 (yellow) and 678nm (red), which are associated with the transitions of Dy3+ from the excited state 4F9/2
                        →
                        6H15/2, 4F9/2
                        →
                        6H13/2 and 4F9/2
                        →
                        6H11/2 respectively [25]. It is well known that the former weak blue emission at 470nm (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H15/2) is corresponded to the magnetic dipole transition, which hardly varies with the crystal field strength around Dy3+. While the later stronger yellow emission at 575nm (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H13/2) belongs to the hypersensitive forced electric dipole transition, which is strongly influenced by the outside surrounding environment [26]. According to the Judd–Ofelt theory [27], when Dy3+ locates at a low symmetry local site without inversion symmetry, a yellow emission according to the electric dipole transition (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H13/2) will be dominant. Conversely, a magnetic dipole transition (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H15/2) will predominate in the emission spectra, resulting in a strong blue emission. In our case, the yellow emission (4F9/2
                        →
                        6H13/2) will dominate. The strong yellow emission is also beneficial to decrease the color temperature of the phosphor and generate warm white light emission. The optical properties of the material are often influenced by the structure of the matrix and synthesis technique.

When trivalent metallic ions, such as Dy3+ are incorporated into a host lattice and substitute divalent metallic ions, the charge balancing is necessarily required. For Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+, the incorporation of alkali metal ions can neutralize the charge generated by Dy3+substitution for Sr2+, and thus stabilize the structure and enhance the luminescence. Dy3+ ions have been often used as co-dopants in the previously developed aluminate and silicate based materials. When divalent alkaline earth ions, such as Ca2+ or Sr2+, is substituted by trivalent Dy3+ in the alkaline earth silicates and aluminates, various defects can be induced due to the charge compensation mechanism [28].

In the Eu2+ and the Dy3+ co-doped materials, most of the excitation energy will be transferred from the host or the Dy3+ to the Eu2+; thus only 5d-4f emissions of Eu2+ can be observed. However, in Dy3+ singly doped samples, which are in our current interest, Dy3+ is not only the supplier of traps but also an activator itself. A process of emitting the white light in Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor is illustrated schematically in Fig. 7
                        . After irradiation with the ultraviolet light (process numbered [1]), most of the excitation energy associated with the excited carriers (electrons or holes) will be transferred via the host directly to the luminescence centers, Dy3+, followed by the Dy3+ 4f emissions as the immediate luminescence (process [2]). However, part of the excitation energy will be stored when some of the excited carriers drop into the traps (process [3]), instead of returning to the ground states. Later, with thermal excitation at proper temperature, these carriers will be released from the traps and transferred via the host to the Dy3+ ions, followed by the characteristic Dy3+ emissions as long afterglow (process [4]). In the practical system, the electron traps and the hole traps may not be both equally abundant or important in terms of their contribution to the white light emission, as suggested in Fig. 7 
                        [29].

In general, color of any phosphor material is represented by means of color coordinates. The emission spectrum of the Dy3+ doped Sr2MgSi2O7 phosphor sample was converted to the CIE 1931 chromaticity using the photoluminescent data and the interactive CIE software (CIE coordinate calculator) diagram as shown in Fig. 8
                        . The calculated chromaticity coordinates for the white light emitted from Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor is given by (x
                        =0.3541, y
                        =0.3589), which is in agreement with the chromaticity coordinates of standard white light (x
                        =0.333, y
                        =0.333) [30] (see Fig. 8).


                        Fig. 9
                         shows the typical decay curves of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The initial afterglow intensity of the sample was high. The decay times of phosphor can be calculated by a curve fitting technique, and the decay curves fitted by the sum of two exponential components have different decay times.

Dy3+ is an important rare earth ion in the development of phosphors with long lasting afterglow, playing a crucial role. The dopant Dy3+ is a famous trap creating ion, which can greatly prolong the afterglow [1]. It is reasonable to consider that the role of doping Dy3+ ions is to introduce new types of traps or significantly increase the concentration of traps responsible for the afterglow. The afterglow intensity of the persistent phosphor depends on the densities of the traps electrons, while the duration of afterglow depends on the depth of the trapped electrons. The number of trapped charge carrier, in term, depends on the concentration of oxygen vacancies/Dy3+ and the trap depth of it. For a suitable trap depth, the trap concentration is directly depends on the dysprosium ions [31].

Mechanoluminescence (ML) is an interesting luminescence phenomenon whereby light emission in solids is caused by grinding, rubbing, cutting, cleaving, shaking, scratching, compressing or by crushing of solids. ML also appears during the deformation caused by the phase transition or growth of certain crystals. In these ML studies, an impulsive deformation technique has been used for measurements.

                         shows that the characteristics curve between ML intensity versus time for Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor at different heights. The experiment was carried out for a fixed moving piston (400gm) dropped with different heights 20, 30, 40, 50cm. When the dysprosium doped Sr2MgSi2O7 phosphor is excited impulsively by the impact of moving piston, initially the ML intensity increases with time, attains a peak value and later on it decreases with time. It is seen that when moving piston is released at particular height, then the ML emission also takes place. During the deformation of a solid, a great number of physical processes may occur within very short time intervals, which may excite or stimulate the process of photon emission. It is evident that the ML intensity increases with the increase of falling height of moving piston, showing the ML peak intensity maximum at 50cm height. The ML intensity increases linearly with the increases the falling height of the free moving piston. The prepared Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor is not irradiated by any excitation source such as Ultra-Violet, Laser, X-ray, β-rays or γ-rays. From Fig. 10a it can be seen that the linearly increase of compressive load can induce the increase of ML intensity. That is, the ML intensity of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ is linearly proportional to the magnitude of the applied load [32–34].

                         shows that the characteristics curve between ML intensity versus impact velocity of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The ML intensity increases linearly with the increases the falling height of the moving piston; that is, the ML intensity depends upon the impact velocity of the moving piton [

                         (where=h, is the different heights of moving piston)]. The ML intensity of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor increases with increasing the mechanical stress. When the moving piston hits the Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor, it produces piezoelectric field in the sintered phosphor as they are non-centrosymmetric. The piezoelectric field near certain defects centers may be high due to the change in the local structure. The piezoelectric field reduces the trap depth of the carriers. The decrease in trap depth causes transfer of electrons from electron traps to the conduction band. Subsequently, the moving electrons in the conduction band are captured in the excited state, located at the bottom of the conduction band, whereby excited ions are produced. The subsequent recombination of electrons with the hole centers gives rise to the light emission [35,36]. ML properties of this phosphor can provide high sensitivity for smart skin and self diagnosis applications. When the surface of an object was coated with the ML materials, the stress distribution in the object beneath the layer could be reflected by the ML brightness and could be observed. Based on the above analysis this phosphor can also be used as sensors to detect the stress of an object. Thus the present investigation indicates that the piezo-electrification is responsible to produce ML in prepared phosphor [37,38].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In summary, a new potential white light emitting strontium magnesium silicate based phosphor Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ are successfully synthesized by the solid state reaction method. The phase structure of the Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor is consistent with standard tetragonal crystallography. From the XRD and TEM analysis, average crystallite size of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was ∼ 60nm. The radius of Dy3+ (0.99Å) are very close to that of Sr2+ (about 1.12Å) rather than Mg2+ (0.65Å) and Si4+ (0.41Å). Therefore, the Dy3+ ions are expected to occupy the Sr2+ sites in the Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. Under the ultra-violet excitation, the prepared Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor would emit blue, yellow and red light with peak at 470nm, 575nm and 678nm corresponds to the transitions of 4F9/2

                     6H11/2 respectively. The red light emission peaking at 678nm from the transitions of 4F9/2

                     6H11/2 is weak compared to the blue emission (465nm) and yellow emission (575nm). The strong yellow emission (4F9/2
                     →
                     6H13/2) will dominate in the PL spectra. The PL emission exhibited a white light which was confirmed from the calculated CIE coordinates which were found to be very close to standard white light for human eyes. It is worthy to note that the dependence between ML intensity of Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu2+ and the load is close to linearity. Based on the above analysis this phosphor can also be used as sensors to detect the stress of an object. Thus, the solid state reaction method furnishes a simple method for preparing a silicate based phosphor.
