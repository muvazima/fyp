                  The goal of this paper is to develop a numerical model for physiological mechanisms that help to compensate reduced blood flow caused by a peripheral arterial stenosis. Thereby we restrict ourselves to the following compensation mechanisms: Metabolic regulation and arteriogenesis, i.e., growth of pre-existing collateral arteries. Our model is based on dimensionally reduced differential equations to simulate large time periods with low computational cost. As a test scenario, we consider a stenosis located in the right posterior tibial artery of a human. We study its impact on blood supply for different narrowing degrees by the help of numerical simulations. Moreover, the efficiency of the above compensation mechanisms is examined. Our results reveal that even a complete occlusion of this artery exhibiting a cross-section area of 0.442cm2 can be compensated at rest, if metabolic regulation is combined with collateral arteries whose total cross-section area accounts for 8.14% of the occluded artery.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Mathematical models have become more and more important in many applications from medicine and biology [1,6,9,10,12,25,40]. Since these techniques are non-invasive, known physiological processes in the human body can be applied to clinical problems and used to predict the outcome with no risk for a patient. In this work, we are concerned with the simulation of blood flow from the heart through the arterial vessel system to the peripheral arteries, e.g., arteries in arms or legs. In particular, the impact of a stenosis in a peripheral artery on blood supply of distal organs is investigated.

A stenosis is an abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel caused by plaque made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances or, acutely, by a thrombus [23,36,43]. Due to pressure drops and reduced oxygen supply, caused by a peripheral stenosis, ischemia in distal tissue can result. In severe cases, it may be necessary to perform amputations, e.g., of legs or arms.

As a response to arterial occlusion, the human vascular system exhibits some compensation mechanisms helping to restore the reduced blood flow. Here, we focus on two different compensation mechanisms: metabolic regulation and arteriogenesis.

Metabolic regulation adjusts the resistance of the arterioles supplying the surrounding tissue domain in cases of elevated oxygen demands or hypoxia [33]. Depending on the metabolic demand of the tissue, the resistances of the corresponding arterioles are decreased or increased. This is achieved by muscles wrapped around the walls of the arterioles, which can reduce or enlarge the diameter of the corresponding vessels. This is a short term regulatory process which occurs within seconds.

Arteriogenesis indicates the growth and remodeling of pre-existent small vessels into physiologically relevant arteries. Usually, these vessels are interarterial connections which are present in almost all organs (see Figs. 1 and 2
                     
                     ). In medical literature they are often referred to as collateral vessels. If an artery is partially or completely occluded their diameters can be enlarged significantly (up to 2.5 times). Thus, they can function as additional blood transport routes often preventing or limiting necrosis. Measurements in mice reveal that this process endures about 3 weeks [34,35].

Comparing both compensation mechanisms, it becomes obvious that they exhibit different time scales. For metabolic regulation and arterial blood flow it is important to resolve every heart beat, while in case of arteriogenesis, almost no change of the collateral vessels can be observed within the same time period. In order to couple the different processes, we design a time stepping scheme using macro time steps for the arteriogenesis and micro time steps for the fast processes. The simulation of metabolic regulation and arterial blood flow is based on dimensionally reduced, i.e., one-dimensional (1D) and zero-dimensional (0D) models, which can be derived by means of 1D mass and momentum balance equations [3,5,14,15,21,27]. The choice of these models is motivated by the intention to keep the computational costs low and to obtain simulation results faster. Besides the fact that the computational effort related to 1D models is low, some recent publications [17,30] reveal that quantities of interest, e.g., pressure and flow waveforms, can be computed with small deviations to numerical data obtained from 3D models.

We investigate numerically whether the previously described mechanisms can compensate a certain degree of stenosis. To do so, we consider an arterial network consisting of the 55 main arteries (see Fig. 2). The effect of a peripheral arterial stenosis is studied by placing a stenosis of different degrees in the right posterior tibial artery (Vessel 54).

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we present the mathematical models for arterial blood flow, stenoses and the compensation mechanisms. Section 3 contains our simulation results and a short comment on the efficiency of the considered compensation mechanisms.

In this section, numerical models for arterial blood flow, the stenosis and the compensation mechanisms are presented. Moreover, we discuss the used numerical methods and the time stepping scheme.

The basis of our model is formed by a domain decomposition technique [13,15,29], i.e., in a first step we split the network (see Fig. 2) into its single vessels and assign a decoupled submodel to each vessel. Next, we interconnect the independent subsystems by suitable interface conditions. It is assumed that the arteries can be considered as simple compliant tubes.

                         the thickness and ν the Poisson ratio of the vessel wall. Due to the fact that biological tissue is practically incompressible, ν is chosen as follows:

                        . Eq. (2) assumes that the vessel wall is instantaneously in equilibrium with the forces acting on it. Effects like wall inertia and viscoelasticity could be incorporated using a differential pressure law, see, e.g., [15,19].

                        54 and V
                        55 is simulated by a suitable source or sink term (see Section 2.4).

                        The remaining equations are obtained by the characteristics entering the bifurcation. Due to (4) there are three characteristics leaving the vessels into the bifurcation. This results in a non-linear algebraic system of equations for six unknowns. For more detailed information concerning the coupling conditions at a bifurcation, we refer to [15, Chapter 11][22,38].

At the outlets of the terminal vessels, we require again two equations in order to be able to compute the interface data. The first one is obtained by interpolating the outgoing characteristic (3b) at

                         according to [20]. This ODE (0D-model) can be derived using averaging techniques and the principles of electricity, where the pressure corresponds to voltage, the flow rate to current, the resistances to Ohm׳s resistances and the compliance to the capacity of a capacitor [4]. A detailed description how to couple this 0D-model and the corresponding 1D-model in the terminal vessel can be found in the following articles: [5,26]. Since we have a 1D–0D coupling at the outflow boundaries, this model for arterial blood flow is often referred to as a multi-dimensional or multi-scale model 
                        [5].

A more complex model simulating a stenosis can be found in [21,25,36,39,43]. It is given by an ODE and links the 1D-models adjacent to a stenosis by a 1D-0D-coupling. However, our numerical tests revealed that this model is less stable with respect to the time step size used in a numerical discretization scheme. Furthermore it is not possible to simulate a complete occlusion. If the area of a stenosis is equal to zero, we would have to exert a division by zero in this model. For these reasons, we have decided to use the simplified stenosis model described in this subsection.

Let us denote the total number of collateral vessels between the tibial arteries 54 and 55 by N

                        , we first reconsider Fig. 1 and discuss some properties of these vessels.

According to [35] they have the size of arterioles. Though this may also be partly the cause in humans, measurements in the human heart yield collateral vessels in a diameter range of 0.031cm to 0.136cm [32]. Assuming growth rates up to a factor 2–3, we choose here starting radii of 0.03cm to 0.04cm. The average radii of the posterior and anterior tibial arteries have the size of 0.375cm and 0.197cm, respectively [41].

Considering Fig. 1, which has been taken from [35, Fig. 1], we observe that the collateral vessels have larger radii at their inlets and outlets than in the middle. For convenience, we assume that the radius

We choose the Hagen–Poiseuille model to compute blood flow through the collateral vessels because of the fact that in smaller arteries less pulsatile blood flow is observed [24]. Since we have pulsative blood flow of higher amplitudes in the main arteries, a different flow model for the collateral vessels has to be considered. In order to account for the variable vessel profile, we subdivide the interval

As already mentioned in Section 2.1, the 1D models in the tibial arteries are coupled by means of their source terms with the collateral vessels. In order to simulate a loss or gain of blood volume across the vessel walls, we have to specify the terms ϕ
                        54 and ϕ
                        55 in (1a). ϕ
                        54 and ϕ
                        55 are defined as piecewise constant functions in space, where these functions are constant on the intervals

                         and ξ in (10), we fit the generalized logistic function with data describing the growth of collateral arteries in mice. Considering Table 1
                         in [35], one can find measurements with respect to the diameters of the growing collateral arteries.

These data are recorded for the initial state (0 days) and after 3, 7 and 21 days using 4 different groups of mice. For a certain group (C57Bl/6), we observe that the diameters of the collateral vessels are magnified by a factor of 1.59 after 3 days, 1.75 after 7 days and 2.3754 after 21 days. We compute by the help of the curve fitting application from MATLAB the following parameters:

The haemodynamic effect of vessels located beyond the 1D main arteries is accounted for using lumped parameter or 0D models (see (6)). These models exhibit three parameters

                         of the i-th terminal vessel to avoid non-physical reflections. Due to the stenosis in Vessel 54 (right posterior tibial artery) blood flow will be decreased in its distal part and increased in the neighboring Vessel 55 (right anterior tibial artery).

In order to prevent an oversupply at the outlet of Vessel 55, the arterioles located beyond that outlet have to increase their resistances, while the arterioles beyond the neighboring outlet have to decrease their resistances to compensate the reduced blood supply, at least partially.

Within our model, we adjust the resistances

ODE (12) has been taken from [10, Chapter 2, Section 2.5], its right hand side consists of three terms. The first term quantifies the amount of oxygen supplying the corresponding tissue, the second term accounts for the amount of oxygen extraction from the blood under normal conditions. Finally, the third term simulates the metabolic demand of the corresponding tissue.

A possible choice for the consumption rate is the Michaelis–Menten law given by [18, Chapter 10]:

                         is decreasing or increasing in certain cases. Solving (12) and (14) and inserting the results of (14) into (13) yield a complete model for metabolic regulation.

For the numerical treatment of the 1D model (1a), (1b) and (2), we use the numerical method of characteristics (NMC). This discretization method has been analyzed in [2] where it has been shown that the NMC is convergent of first order in space and time, even for CFL-numbers that are greater than one. Due to this attractive property, we are able to choose quite large time steps which is desirable in the context of the presented model, since it requires the simulation of many heart beats.

According to Fig. 7, one can see that a long simulation period of about 3 weeks has to be treated. Simulating the growth of the collateral arteries by (10) and (11), it becomes obvious that during a single heart beat almost no change in the profiles of the collateral arteries can be identified. Consequently, there is no need in resolving every heart beat within 3 weeks and we choose for the growth of the collateral vessels a macro time step size

Thus we do not have a time step size restriction with respect to the discretization of the transport equations. The interface conditions between vessel segments, however, require the solution of non-linear equations by the help of Newton׳s method. Numerical tests reveal that the micro time step size

Of considerable interest is the question which conductivity of the collateral vessels is required to achieve an almost complete compensation of the reduced blood supply depending on the reflection parameter

                      of the stenosis. This depends of course on the original size, growth ability and number of collateral vessels. These data are difficult to obtain in humans and assumptions have to be made which may influence any considerations about the necessary number of vessels. The advantage of this modeling approach is that different parameters can be considered which allows a better adaption of animal data to the human situation.

The pressure and flow rate values in the healthy state (R
                        
                           t
                        =0.0) are within a reasonable range (see Fig. 9
                        ). Blood pressure ranges from 83mmHg to 121mmHg which is in accordance with [11]. Moreover, the curves exhibit the typical shape of pressure and flow rate curves in a peripheral artery. This justifies the usage of 1D models for arterial blood flow in order to analyze the effects of compensation mechanisms.

At first we demonstrate the impact of the stenosis by comparing the maximal systolic pressure values at the inlet and the outlet of the stenosis within the time interval [120s,121s]. We denote these values by

                        The corresponding simulation results are listed in Table 2
                        . We observe a non-linear relation between the reflection parameter R
                        
                           t
                         and the conservation rates. In Fig. 10
                        , it can be seen that the conservation rates decrease severely for higher values of R
                        
                           t
                        . If R
                        
                           t
                         is smaller than 0.7, we have a slow and almost linear decline of the conservation rates and pressure drops. Thus, we define a stenosis with 
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 t
                              
                           
                           ≥
                           0.7
                         as critical.

The influence of a stenosis on the adjacent vessels is illustrated in Fig. 9. Not surprisingly, pressure and flow rate drop severely in the distal part of Vessel 54, whereas in Vessel 55 both the flow rate and the systolic pressure are slightly increased as R
                        
                           t
                         grows. Due to reflections at the stenosis, the flow rate in Vessel 52 is reduced and the pressure is significantly increased. This increases peak wall tension which in an already weakened artery could add to the risk of aneurism formation.

Next, we want to examine the efficiency of the compensation mechanisms. Therefore, we define the recovery rate

                           t
                         for two cases. In the first case, no compensation mechanism is considered whereas in the second case only metabolic regulation is used at the outlets of V
                        54 and V
                        55. It can be observed that the reduced flow can be completely compensated for

                           0.7
                         in contrast to the case where no compensation mechanism is used. For 
                           
                              
                                 R

                           ≥
                           0.7
                        , metabolic regulation cannot recover the complete blood flow anymore. However, we observe that the recovery rates are still higher compared to the case without compensation mechanism.

In Fig. 12
                        , one can see the recovery rates depending on R
                        
                           t
                         if only arteriogenesis is applied as a compensation mechanism. A complete recovery is not possible regardless of the number of collateral vessels. For a complete occlusion, i.e., R
                        
                           t
                        =1, blood supply can be partially restored. As expected, the recovery rates increase with a growing number of collateral vessels.

Finally, we combine both compensation mechanisms and present the resulting recovery rates in Fig. 13
                        . The effects of both mechanisms in the vicinity of the stenosis are illustrated in Fig. 14
                        . In this scenario, a single collateral vessel allows a complete recovery up to a stenosis degree of R
                        
                           t
                        =0.75. A complete compensation for all reflection parameters is achieved if five collateral vessels exist. Summing the cross-sectional areas of the collateral vessels at their centers results in a total cross-sectional area of 0.036cm2 which accounts for 8.14% of the occluded vessel׳s area.

In addition to that, we record the oxygen concentration

                         are depicted. The results are in agreement with the recovery rates of the flow rate. The curve for five collateral vessels is similar to the measurements in [35, Fig. 6B]. This figure shows a comparison of haemoglobin oxygen saturations in healthy and artificially occluded feet of mice. Even though the topic of compensation mechanisms for stenoses is actively studied [8,16], experimental data of humans concerning the issue of this work are still missing mainly because in humans we usually observe endpoints rather than the development of compensatory structural adaption mechanisms. Therefore, only measurements obtained from mice are considered.

In this paper, we have simulated the influence of a peripheral arterial stenosis on blood supply of distal tissue. Furthermore, we have modeled two mechanisms that help to restore the reduced blood flow, i.e., metabolic regulation and arteriogenesis. The presented model is based on dimensionally reduced differential equations and algebraic coupling equations. It has been revealed that reduced blood supply caused by a critical stenosis can only be recovered if both compensation mechanisms are combined and a sufficient growth and number of collateral vessels is present. It should be mentioned however, that in large animal experiments incomplete compensation was reported and that the muscle oxygen consumption rates refer only to the resting state of the muscles, allowing structural maintenance and basic function. However, the collateral growth calculated here would not allow us to compensate for the consumption during muscle exercise. In order to balance the missing blood supply caused by a stenosis of lower degree it is sufficient to take only metabolic regulation into consideration. The existing model can be enhanced by incorporating further compensation mechanisms, e.g., angiogenesis or a more complex model for arteriogenesis.
