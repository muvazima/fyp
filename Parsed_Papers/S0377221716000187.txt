                  We propose an axiomatic definition of a dispersion measure that could be applied for any finite sample of k-dimensional real observations. Next we introduce a taxonomy of the dispersion measures based on the possible behavior of these measures with respect to new upcoming observations. This way we get two classes of unstable and absorptive dispersion measures. We examine their properties and illustrate them by examples. We also consider a relationship between multidimensional dispersion measures and multidistances. Moreover, we examine new interesting properties of some well-known dispersion measures for one-dimensional data like the interquartile range and a sample variance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Various summary statistics are always applied wherever decisions are based on sample data. The main goal of those characteristics is to deliver a synthetic information on basic features of a data set under study. It seems that the most commonly used summary statistics are central tendency measures (like the mean, median, mode, etc.) indicating a typical behavior of the examined variable. However, no measure of central tendency can reveal the whole picture of a variable. Indeed, two or more samples may have the same mean (or other central tendency) although they differ significantly. Therefore, besides central tendency a dispersion of observations in a sample is also of interest. Moreover, in many cases we have to monitor variability as carefully as the location parameters. As a typical example let us consider the Statistical Process Control where no alarm signal found on the 
                        
                           X
                           ¯
                        
                     -chart cannot be automatically interpreted as the process is under control until the S-chart (or R-chart) confirms no alarm caused by the increase of variability.

Many tools have been proposed to characterize dispersion, like the range, interquartile range, sample variance, standard deviation an so on. They differ in construction, properties and situations they are intended for use. It is also worth mentioning that several terms are used in the literature as regards dispersion measures like measures of variability, scatter, spread or scale. Some authors reserve the notion of the dispersion measure only to those cases when variability is considered relative to a given fixed point (like a sample variance which averages squared deviation of the data points from their mean) and then use the term spread as a more general one (see Bickel & Lehmann (1976, 1979); Wilcox (2005)). However, such distinction in terminology is neither consistent nor commonly accepted. Thus in our paper we do not attach importance to such distinctions.

Some of the considered tools measure the absolute spread (like those mentioned before), while the other indicate the relative scatter (e.g. the coefficient of variation or Gini coefficient). Most of them are dedicated to quantitative data (ratio scale) but one can found also a few that might be used to characterize qualitative observations (nominal scale).

What is interesting is that almost all well-known measures of dispersion could be used only for one-dimensional data. It is rather inconvenient especially that most of the contemporary data sets available and processed in practice is multidimensional. Of course, having such multidimensional data set one may apply univariate dispersion measures to each variable separately, but this way we loose information on possible relations between variables. Then, as a possible remedium, one may consider e.g. a covariance matrix which delivers both variances of all single variables and covariances for all pairs of variables. Hence, having a data set of k-dimensional observations we get a matrix of k
                     2 numbers instead of a single real value of a desired measure of dispersion characterizing somehow the whole multidimensional sample.

Keeping in mind all the remarks mentioned above we propose a general definition of a dispersion measure that could be applied for any finite sample of k-dimensional real observations, i.e. 
                        
                           
                              x
                              1
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              x
                              n
                           
                           ∈
                           
                              R
                              k
                           
                        
                     . Next we examine basic properties of so defined measures and illustrate them by examples. We also consider the relationship between multidimensional dispersion measures and multidistances introduced by Martín and Mayor (2009, 2011).

Recently, Gagolewski (2015) considered the dispersion measures from the aggregation theory point of view. He showed that although aggregation theory mainly focuses on central tendency measures (see Beliakov, Pradera, & Calvo (2007); Calvo, Mayor, and Mesiar (2002); Grabisch, Marichal, Mesiar, and Pap (2009)), it may deliver an interesting insight to measures of spread of one-dimensional quantitative data. In our case we show that some considerations on general multidimensional dispersion measures may also lead to some interesting conclusions for one-dimensional data sets.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present the desired requirements each measure of dispersion should satisfy. Next, we distinguish two basic types of dispersion measures: unstable and absorptive dispersion measures (Section 3 and Section 4, respectively). Section 5 is devoted to some interesting properties of the interquartile range that appear in practice when we try to estimate it from data. In Section 6 we prove a theorem showing a relation between unstable and absorptive dispersion measures. Finally, in Section 7 we examine the relationship between dispersion measures and multidistances.

Consider a sample of n observations from the k-dimensional real space, i.e. 
                        
                           
                              x
                              1
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              x
                              n
                           
                           ∈
                           
                              R
                              k
                           
                        
                     . Descriptive statistics, also called summary statistics, provide various measured describing different aspects of the underlying data. Besides central tendency measures, the next group of the most useful summary statistics is formed by measures of dispersion. Although each person has some intuition about measures of dispersion, it seems that a formal definition would be desirable.

Usually adding another observation to a data set under study we expect changes in the dispersion measure value, no matter where the new point is located. However, there also exists a class of measures for which by adding new observations we do not change the scatter of the data set (provided those observations belong to some area). To clarify the situation in further sections we indicate two important subfamilies of dispersion measures.

In other words, for any unstable dispersion measure and any data set there exist a set which has the k-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero and such that joining any its point to the data set do not change a value of the dispersion obtained for the initial data set. Let us now discuss some examples and basic properties of the unstable dispersion measures.

                            denote a sample covariance matrix. By Lemma 3.4 one may easily conclude that such popular tools applied for characterizing a dispersion of multidimensional data like the determinant |Σ| or the trace tr(Σ) of the covariance matrix are unstable dispersion measures. Indeed, if we assume f to be the sum of measures and Δi
                            to be the product of sample covariances then we get the result.

Intuitively, it seems that adding a new observation the dispersion of a sample can increase or remain unchanged. But there are also such dispersion measures that can decrease as the data set enlarges. For example, consider a one-dimensional sample

The most natural and immediate example is a sample range for one-dimensional data. Suppose

                           Rousseeuw, Ruts, and Tukey (1999) proposed a bivariate generalization of the well-known boxplot, called bagplot. The construction of the bagplot is based on the halfspace location depth. An important part of their plot, called bag form a figure which area is a strongly absorptive dispersion measure.


                     Hyndman and Fan (1996) investigated nine different methods implemented in the statistical software to calculate sample quantiles. Sample quantiles providing nonparametric estimators of their population counterparts are based on one or two order statistics from the sample

In the previous sections we have introduced two classes of dispersion measures – the unstable and absorptive ones. One may ask about possible relation between these two classes. Let us start from the following two examples.

Obviously, the construction shown in the above proof is not unique, i.e. usually one can consider various convergent sequences. However, which one would appear more useful in a given situation depends on particular circumstances and an objective to be achieved.

It is worth mentioning that the considerations and results shown in this section are not only theoretical but may be also utilized in practice. In the example given below we sketch the idea of the possible application of Theorem 6.3 for designing a new discrimination algorithm.

                        Example 6.4
                        Let us consider a classification problem of data coming from two different classes. Given a set of training data it seems natural to conclude that the most distant observations belong to separate classes. Therefore, these very observations may be treated as representative points of those two classes. The next step is to divide the remaining training data between those two classes with respect to their location from the representative points. This way we find a separating point (in one-dimensional case), separating line (in two-dimensional case) or separating hyperplane (in general).

Keeping in mind this general idea one may conclude that the desired discriminant characteristic for discovering the representative points is a suitable absorptive measure, like the range or one of its multidimensional counterparts discussed in Section 4. However, in order to design a border discriminating classes we have to “attract” each remaining training data point to the aforementioned representative point which can be done using an appropriate sequence of unstable measures tending to the absorptive one, as it is shown in Theorem 6.3.

To explain it better let us consider the one-dimensional case and measures discussed in Example 6.1. Suppose we have a training set of size n. Then, having the representative points of the two classes given by the range

We illustrate the proposed method using the Sepal.Length variate from the well-known data-set iris available in R software environment. For the sake of this example we use only the entries corresponding to the species setosa and versicolor. Then 50 randomly chosen observations were used as a training set while the remaining 50 served as a testing set. For

This is, of course, only a simple concept that can be transferred to more complicated data sets in higher dimensions. However, it will be the topic of our further research in a subsequent contribution.

A distance is, roughly speaking, a two-argument function measuring how much any two points of a given space are separated. Martín and Mayor (2009) starting from the question How separated Palma, Inca and Manacor are? extended the conventional definition of distance between two points so that it might be applied to collections of more than two elements. The properties of their multi-argument “distance” function, called a multidistance, were investigated in some further papers Martín and Mayor (2010, 2011); Martín, Mayor, and Valero (2011). Formally, a multidistance is defined as follows.

The last condition (md3) could be perceived as a generalized triangle inequality.

At first glance it appears that a multidistance not only aggregates distances between several observations but it also characterizes somehow the scatter of these points. Hence, a natural question arises about possible relation between the classes of multidistances and dispersion measures. Clearly, there are many dispersion measures which satisfy requirements (md1)–(md3). However, in spite of nonempty intersection there is no inclusion between these two classes of functions. Let us consider the following examples.

                           satisfies both the properties of dispersion measures and multidistances.

Consider a data set 
                              
                                 X

                           . By Example 4.5 we know that the diameter (6) of a set 
                              X
                            is a dispersion measure. The diameter is also a multidistance, called the maximal multidistance (see Martín and Mayor (2009, Remark 1)). Hence, consequently, in the case of one-dimensional observations on the real line the sample range R is both the dispersion measure and a multidistance.

By Example 3.2 we know that a sample variance

                      is the unstable dispersion measure. We also prove that s
                     2 is a multidistance.

                        Theorem 7.4
                        
                           Let

                                 ∈
                                 R
                              
                            
                           denote a sample. If a sample size n ≥ 3 then the sample variance s
                           2 
                           is a multidistance.
                        

Thus we have to verify if the requirements of Definition 7.1 hold. To do this it is worth remembering that we may express the sample variance in the equivalent way as follows

                           provided n ≥ 3. Hence (14) is fulfilled. This shows that (dm3) holds so the sample variance is a multidistance and the theorem is proved.□

However, if we consider an aggregation of distances between arguments instead of distances with respect to a fixed point, we can obtain a measure of dispersion. For instance

                           we obtain a translation invariant function which is not only a multidistance (called the maximal multidistance, see Martín and Mayor (2011)) but a dispersion measure as well.

More generally, the following proposition holds.

                        Proposition 7.6
                        
                           If a multidistance D satisfies the properties (A3)–(A5), then it is also a dispersion measure.
                        

The proof of this proposition is straightforward as axioms (md1) and (md2) satisfied by each multidistance are the same as requirements (A1) and (A2) for a measure of dispersion.

                           ∞.

Unfortunately, not all multidistances Dd
                            are also dispersion measures – it depends on the distance d. By Example 4.4 we know that a multidistance (19) based on the Euclidean metric is a dispersion measure. However, neither Dd
                            based on the Manhattan distance, nor based on the Chebyshev distance is a dispersion measure, because in both cases Dd
                            is not rotation invariant, i.e. they do not fulfill condition (A4).

Now, let DM
                            denote the radius of the smallest ball that contains all the points from 
                              X
                            obtained with respect to the Mahalanobis distance (20). It is clear that DM
                            as a radius of a ball in some metric is a multidistance. It is also a dispersion measure. Actually, given a rotation matrix R let

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we have introduced a general definition of a dispersion measure that might be applied not only for one-dimensional real data but also for multidimensional data. Moreover, we have distinguished two basic families of dispersion measures with respect to their behavior when adding a new observation to the data set, i.e. unstable and absorptive dispersion measures. We have considered many examples of these measures and examined the relationship between the above mentioned two families of dispersion measures. Moreover, we have discussed a relationship between dispersion measures and multidistances. We have also examined some new interesting properties of such well-known dispersion measures for one-dimensional data like the interquartile range and a sample variance.

Although we have tried to discuss and to answer many questions on the dispersion measures, many problems are still open and are worth further consideration. Firstly, we have examined in this paper the measures of the absolute spread only. Thus the measures of the relative spread, which are also important in applications, need a thorough interest. Secondly, we have restricted our attention to variability of the quantitative real data. However, the problem how to measure the spread of the qualitative data (nominal scale) seems to be interesting and important too. Thirdly, in our opinion a family of multidistances, which is still not examined completely, might be quite helpful in data analysis. And finally, we agree with Gagolewski (2015) that the methods of aggregation operators used so far for describing central tendency of the data, seem to be very promising in studies on the data spread.
