                  A modified quantized kernel least mean square (M-QKLMS) algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is an improvement of quantized kernel least mean square (QKLMS) and the gradient descent method is used to update the coefficient of filter. Unlike the QKLMS method which only considers the prediction error, the M-QKLMS method uses both the new training data and the prediction error for coefficient adjustment of the closest center in the dictionary. Therefore, the proposed method completely utilizes the knowledge hidden in the new training data, and achieves a better accuracy. In addition, the energy conservation relation and a sufficient condition for mean-square convergence of the proposed method are obtained. Simulations on prediction of chaotic time series show that the M-QKLMS method outperforms the QKLMS method in terms of steady-state mean square errors.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Chaotic time series prediction has been widely used in economic data processing, signal processing, automatic control and many other fields. A proper prediction method can improve the prediction accuracy. Commonly used methods include neural network based methods [1], least-mean-square (LMS) methods [2], support-vector machines (SVM) [3], etc. However, in many cases, these methods cannot meet the requirements of accuracy, or are too complicated to be implemented in practice. Therefore, an efficient prediction method is of practical importance.

Over the past decades, kernel adaptive filter (KAF) has become an emerging topic of research. KAF maps the input data into a high dimensional feature space that is also called reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). In RKHS, inner products can be easily computed by the kernel trick [2]. The representative examples of KAF include kernel least-mean-square (KLMS) algorithms [4], kernel affine projection algorithms (KAPA) [5], kernel recursive least squares (KRLS) methods [6], extended kernel recursive least squares (EX-KRLS) methods [7], and kernel maximum correntropy (KMC) methods [8].

Since KAFs build a linear growing radial basis function (RBF) network [9] by allocating a new kernel unit for every new data sample as a RBF center, a linear growing network structure becomes the main bottleneck of KAFs, leading to increasing computational costs and memory requirements. If the sample size is very large, the practicability is highly restricted [10]. In order to solve this problem, a lot of online sparsification criteria have been proposed, e.g., approximate linear dependency (ALD) criterion [6], novelty criterion (NC) [11], surprise criterion (SC) [12], prediction variance criterion (PVC) [13], and coherence criterion (CC) [14]. The ALD can be viewed as a special case of the surprise criterion [12,15]. According to these sparsification criteria, only part of the input data are preserved in the dictionary, thereby resulting in dramatic reduction of the network size.

Recently, a very simple vector quantization (VQ) method [15] has been proposed for online sparsification. The VQ method is imposed on KLMS and KRLS to generate the quantized kernel least-mean-square (QKLMS) algorithm [15] and the quantized kernel recursive least squares (QKRLS) algorithm [10], respectively. A quantization size is required in the VQ method. The distance between the current input and the dictionary is calculated for comparison. If the distance is greater than the quantization size, the current input data is added to the dictionary as a new center. Otherwise, the current input is discarded, but the coefficient of the closest center is updated. The main drawback of the VQ method is that during the update of coefficients, only the prediction error is used, and the input data are omitted. Although the distance between the discarded input data and the dictionary is less than the quantization size, the information of the input data should be utilized to update the corresponding coefficient for accuracy improvement.

To further improve the prediction accuracy of chaotic series, a modified quantized kernel least-mean-square (M-QKLMS) is proposed in this paper. In M-QKLMS, a gradient descent algorithm is used to update the coefficient, and in the process, both the prediction error and the input data are considered. Thus, the M-QKLMS method offers a better prediction accuracy than initial QKLMS.

                           Remark 1
                           The gradient descent method is a powerful tool to solve the problem of optimization. Since the cost function J of Eq. (8) is a convex function regarding

                           Remark 2
                           The M-QKLMS algorithm updates the coefficient of the dictionary by using the gradient descent method, which is an improvement of QKLMS. From Eq. (6), QKLMS updates the coefficient only by the prediction error, which can be regarded as an approximation of the gradient descent method. Moreover, from Eq. (9), M-QKLMS incorporates both the prediction error and the new training data to update the coefficient. Hence, compared with QKLMS, M-QKLMS can achieve more accurate updated coefficients. In addition, the modified vector quantization can be easily extended to other KAFs, e.g., KRLS [6].

In this section, the proposed M-QKLMS method is used to perform prediction of chaotic time series. The presented examples include Chua's chaotic time series and Mackey–Glass chaotic time series. For all experiments, the kernel width of the Gaussian kernel is set as 
                        h
                        =
                        1
                     , and the noise is Gaussian white noise with variance

                        0.01
                     . In fact, the Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) are 21 dB and 19 dB for Chua's chaotic time series and Mackey–Glass chaotic time series, respectively.

To make the system (42) be chaotic, we set

                        , and the initial conditions are 
                           x
                           (
                           0
                           )
                           =
                           0.6
                        , 
                           y
                           (
                           0

                           −
                           0.2
                        , 
                           z
                           (

                           =
                           0.3
                        . The time series is discretized at a sampling period of 0.07 second. In the following, the second coordinate y is chosen for prediction. A segment of initial Chua's chaotic time series and its noise contained series are shown in Fig. 1
                        .

First, the choice of filter order in the prediction of Chua's time series is discussed. Fig. 2
                         shows the steady-state mean-square error (MSE) of the M-QKLMS methods versus the filter order in the Chua's chaotic time series prediction, where the step size 
                           η
                           =
                           0.2
                        . Herein, for each filter order, 30 independent Monte Carlo simulations are run with different segments of time series. In each segment, the training data size is 1000 and the test data size is 100. Also, the last 100 train iterations are used to compute the final steady-state MSE. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that, when the filter order is about 5, the steady-state MSE can reach the minimum value. Hence, five previous points are used as the input vector to predict the present one 
                           y
                           (
                           n
                           )
                         in Eq. (42), i.e., 
                           d
                           (
                           n
                           )
                           =
                           y
                           (
                           n
                           )
                        . In the following, the step size 
                           η
                           =
                           0.2
                         is used both in QKLMS and M-QKLMS methods.

Then, we compare the steady-state MSE of the QKLMS and M-QKLMS methods versus the quantization size in Chua's chaotic time series prediction in Fig. 3
                        . It can be seen from Fig. 3 that when the quantization size is greater than some fixed value, the steady-state MSE of the M-QKLMS method is smaller than that of the QKLMS method. In Fig. 4
                        , we plot the MSE curves of the QKLMS and M-QKLMS methods when quantization size is set as 2.0, which is averaged over 100 simulations to minimize turbulence. From Fig. 4, we see that the steady-state MSE of the M-QKLMS method is smaller than that of QKLMS, which is consistent with the result in Fig. 3. Finally, the final network size versus the quantization size is plotted in Fig. 5
                        . It can be seen from Fig. 5 that, with the increase of quantization size, the network size decreases as expected. The M-QKLMS method can also implement online sparsification of the network structure.

                        , where the parameters are same as in the prediction of Chua's chaotic time series except that the step size 
                           η
                           =
                           0.1
                        . Also, the MSE curves of QKLMS and M-QKLMS methods when quantization size is set as 1.5 is shown in Fig. 7
                        . Herein, 200 Monte Carlo simulations are run to reduce the turbulence. We can see from Figs. 6 and 7 that the simulation results of the Mackey–Glass chaotic time series are coincident with those of Chua's chaotic time series. Thus, from the prediction of the two kinds of chaotic time series, the M-QKLMS method offers a better prediction accuracy than the QKLMS method.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Unlike the quantized kernel least-mean-square method that only uses the prediction error to adjust the coefficient of the closest center, the proposed modified algorithm utilizes gradient descent algorithm to update the coefficient. Both the prediction error and the new training data are incorporated in the proposed method. Hence, a more accurate updated coefficient is acquired, resulting in better prediction accuracy of chaotic time series. Furthermore, the modified method can reduce the network size, which is a significant improvement in practice. Simulations on prediction of chaotic times series show that, when the quantization size is greater than a fixed value, the proposed algorithm has a smaller steady-state mean-square error compared to the original quantized kernel least-mean-square method.
