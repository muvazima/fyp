                  This paper proposes a new encryption scheme for color images based on Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence operations and multiple improved one-dimensional (1D) chaotic systems with excellent performance. Firstly, the key streams are generated from three improved 1D chaotic systems by using the secret keys and the plain-image. Transform randomly the key streams and the plain-image into the DNA matrices by the DNA encoding rules, respectively. Secondly, perform the DNA complementary and XOR operations on the DNA matrices to get the scrambled DNA matrices. Thirdly, decompose equally the scrambled DNA matrices into blocks and shuffle these blocks randomly. Finally, implement the DNA XOR and addition operations on the DNA matrices obtained from the previous step and the key streams, and then convert the encrypted DNA matrices into the cipher-image by the DNA decoding rules. Experimental results and security analysis show that the proposed encryption scheme has a good encryption effect and high security. Moreover, it has a strong robustness for the common image processing operations and geometric attack.
