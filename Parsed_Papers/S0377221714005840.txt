                  In this paper we compare the residual lifetime of a used coherent system of age 
                        
                           t

                      with the lifetime of the similar coherent system made up of used components of age t. Here ‘similar’ means that the system has the same structure and the component lifetimes have the same dependence (joint reliability copula). Some comparison results are obtained for the likelihood ratio order, failure rate order, reversed failure rate order and the usual stochastic order. Similar results are reported for comparing inactivity time of a coherent system with lifetime of similar coherent system having component lifetimes same as inactivity times of failed components.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Study of coherent systems plays a relevant role in the field of reliability and survival analysis. A particular case of coherent system is an r-out-of-n system, i.e., a system which functions if, and only if, at least r out of the n components of the system function. Further the series and parallel systems are n-out-of-n and 1-out-of-n systems, respectively. The reader may refer to Barlow and Proschan (1981) for a detailed study of coherent systems. In many practical situations it may be of interest to compare the residual lifetime

                     . The aging properties and the stochastic comparison results of the residual life time and the inactivity time are extensively studied in the literature, see for example Block, Savits, and Singh (1998), Chandra and Roy (2001), Ross (1996), Li and Lu (2003), Li and Zuo (2004), Misra, Gupta, and Dhariyal (2008), Pellerey and Petakos (2002), Zhang and Li (2003), Eryilmaz (2012) and Si, Wang, Hu, and Zhou (2011). Also for the study of the eta functions one may refer to Glaser (2001). Throughout this paper the terms increasing/decreasing will be used for non-decreasing/non-increasing. Some definitions which may be found in Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007) are presented below for the sake of completeness in presentation.

For independently and identically distributed (IID) components, Zhang and Li (2003) proved that the lifetime of a parallel/series system having used/inactive components stochastically dominates the lifetime of a used/inactive parallel/series system, in the usual stochastic ordering. The results of Zhang and Li (2003) are strengthened by Li and Lu (2003) to the likelihood ratio ordering. Further Gupta (2013) strengthened the results of Li and Lu (2003) by proving that the lifetime of an r-out-of-n system having used components stochastically dominates the lifetime of a used r-out-of-n system, in the likelihood ratio ordering. In fact Gupta (2013) finds out the conditions on the structure function under which a coherent system having used/inactive components stochastically dominates the lifetime of a used/inactive coherent system, in the likelihood ratio ordering.

Recently some studies have been carried out for coherent systems having dependent components. Navarro, Pellerey, and Di Crescenzo (2015) studied stochastic comparisons between coherent systems having randomized dependent components. Also Gupta and Kumar (2014) have investigated stochastic comparisons of component and system redundancies with dependent components.

Considering that components are identically distributed (ID) and that may be dependent, in Section 2, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the system reliability functions so that the lifetime of coherent system having used components perform better/worse than the lifetime of used coherent system, under various stochastic orderings. The result derived in this paper can also be applied to coherent systems with IID components (see for example Navarro & Rychlik, 2010; Navarro & Spizzichino, 2010). The approach used in this paper unifies the results of Zhang and Li (2003), Li and Lu (2003) and Gupta (2013). Applications of derived results are illustrated through various examples.

                           which is the same as condition (2.14) in Navarro, del Águila, Sordo, and Suárez-liorens (2013) needed for preservation of the ‘New Better than Used’ (‘New Worse than Used’) property by a coherent system.

Now we provide some illustrative examples to study the comparative analysis between a used coherent system having ID components and coherent system of used but functioning ID components. The following example shows that if we consider a series system of n components having dependence structure described by Clayton-Oakes (CO) copula, then a used series system is better than a series system of used but functioning components, under the likelihood ratio ordering.

The following example shows that if we consider IID components, then r-out-of-n system of used components is better than a used r-out-of-n system under likelihood ratio ordering.

The notion of inactivity time is associated with past lifetime and time since failure. Studying the inactivity time is useful in Forensic science, estimation of left-censored data etc (refer to Nanda, Singh, Misra, & Paul, 2003). Here we provide a brief discussion on stochastic comparison of inactivity time of a coherent with a system comprising of components whose lifetimes are the same as inactivity times of failed components. Denote the inactivity time of a coherent system having ID components
