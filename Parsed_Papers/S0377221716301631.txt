@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many real world-problems involve multiple objectives. Due to conflict between objectives, finding a feasible solution that simultaneously optimizes all objectives is usually impossible. Consequently, in practice, decision makers want to explore and understand the trade off between objectives before choosing a suitable solution. Thus, generating many or all efficient solutions, i.e., solutions in which it is impossible to improve the value of one objective without a deterioration in the value of at least one other objective, is a primary goal in multiobjective optimization.

Exact algorithms for multiobjective integer programs (MOIPs) can be divided into decision space search algorithms, i.e., methods that search in the space of feasible solutions, and criterion space search algorithms, i.e., methods that search in the space of objective function values. Criterion space search algorithms tend to be easier to implement and as effective, if not more effective, than decision space search algorithms. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on criterion space search algorithms. Readers interested in recent advances in the area of decision space search algorithms are referred to Belotti, Soylu, and Wiecek (2013), Stidsen, Andersen, and Dammann (2014), Vincent, Seipp, Ruzika, Przybylski, and Gandibleux (2013).

The simplest form of a multiobjective integer program (MOIP) has only two objectives and is known as a biobjective integer program (BOIP). The earliest algorithms only generated a subset of all nondominated points, the so-called extreme supported nondominated points, e.g., Aneja and Nair (1979). But not long after, algorithms were developed that generated the complete nondominated frontier. Presently, a number of effective and efficient criterion space search algorithms for solving BOIPs exist. Interested readers are referred to Ehrgott (2006) and Boland, Charkhgard, and Savelsbergh (2015a) for an overview of recent advances in solving BOIPs using criterion search space algorithms.

The situation is quite different when the number of objectives is greater than two; far fewer methods have been proposed for generating the complete nondominated frontier in these settings. The main reasons that generating the complete nondominated frontier of a MOIP with more than two objectives is significantly more challenging are that:

                        
                           1.
                           The number of nondominated points tends to grow with the number of objective functions (see Brunsch, Goyal, Rademacher, and Röglin, 2014 for recent theoretical results that support this empirical observation). Since at least one search operation has to be performed to find a nondominated point, and searching for a nondominated point in (current) criterion space search methods involves solving a single-objective IP, the number of single-objective IPs that needs to be solved in order to solve even relatively small MOIP instances becomes quite large as the number of objectives grows.

Developing effective strategies for decomposing the criterion search space is much more difficult, because such strategies need to balance the number and shape of the elements in the decomposition with the difficulty of the single-objective IP used to explore an element of the decomposition. Consequently, many single-objective IP solves or very expensive single-objective IP solves are unavoidable.

In this paper, we restrict ourselves to generating the complete nondominated frontier of a tri-objective integer program (TOIP).

Searching for an as-yet unknown nondominated point is a core operation in any method for generating the nondominated frontier of a TOIP and accounts for most of the solution time. It is done by solving one or more single-objective IPs depending on the scalarization technique used. As a consequence, the total number of IPs solved when generating the nondominated frontier of a TOIP depends on the scalarization technique used. The relevant scalarization techniques are (1) weighted-sum, in which one IP is solved which optimizes a weighted sum of the three objectives, and (2) lexicographic, in which a sequence of IPs is solved; in the case of a three-stage lexicographic scalarization, three IPs, each optimizing one of the objectives, or, in the case of a two-stage lexicographic scalarization, one IP optimizing one of the objectives and one IP optimizing a weighted sum of the other two objectives (or, possibly, of the three objectives). It is important to mention and emphasize that solving a single IP which optimizes a weighted-sum objective in the search for an as-yet unknown nondominated point (as in weighted-sum) is not necessarily more efficient than solving a sequence of IPs in the search for an as-yet unknown nondominated point (as in lexicographic). In fact, computational experiments reveals that it usually is not. The reason is that the IPs solved during a lexicographic search tend to be easier, and, other than the first, can be initialized with a high-quality known feasible solution. In the following, when reporting the number of IPs solved by a specific method, we assume, unless specifically stated otherwise, that the weighted-sum scalarization technique is used.


                     Sylva and Crema (2004) proposed a simple, straightforward algorithm for solving a TOIP, which solves exactly 
                        
                           
                              |
                           
                           
                              Y
                              N
                           
                           
                              |
                              +
                              1
                           
                        
                      single-objective IPs, where 
                        
                           Y
                           N
                        
                      is the set of nondominated points (the algorithm solves one infeasible IP to determine that no other nondominated point exists). However, the single-objective IPs that need to be solved get harder and harder (as more and more disjunctive constraints are added), and, as a consequence, in practice, after only a few iterations, solving the single-objective IPs becomes computationally prohibitive.

More sophisticated algorithms solve more, but easier IPs (compared to the algorithm of Sylva and Crema) and end up being more efficient in practice, including the enhanced recursive method (Özlen, Burton, & MacRae, 2013), the full 3-split method (Dächert & Klamroth, 2014; Dhaenens, Lemesre, & Talbi, 2010), the full 2-split method (Dächert & Klamroth, 2014; Kirlik & Sayın, 2014; Lokman & Köksalan, 2013), and the L-shape search method (Boland, Charkhgard, & Savelsbergh, 2015b). (We note that besides Dächert and Klamroth (2014) and Boland et al. (2015b), all cited methods are designed for any number of criteria, not only for TOIPs.)

A full 3-split method works with 3-dimensional boxes in criterion space that may still contain as-yet unknown nondominated points. It searches a box to find a new nondominated point. When a new nondominated point is found, the box is decomposed into smaller boxes and the process is repeated in each of the new, smaller boxes. It can be shown that an implementation of the method exists that solves at most

                      IPs (Dächert & Klamroth, 2014).

The full 2-split method is similar to the full 3-split method. The difference is that the full 2-split method works in a projected (2-dimensional) space rather than the original (3-dimensional) criterion space. The main advantage of doing so, in practice, is that the number of infeasible IPs that has to be solved is much smaller, and single-objective IP solvers tend to struggle more when solving infeasible IPs. Because the full 2-split method operates in a 2-dimensional space, it works with rectangles instead of boxes. Depending on the variant of the method, the number of IPs solved is bounded by

The L-shape search method (LSM) combines ideas of the algorithm of Sylva and Crema and the full 2-split method. It also operates in a projected space. However, instead of working only with rectangles, it also works with L-shapes. As far as we know, LSM is the most efficient algorithm to compute the (complete) nondominated frontier of a TOIP. Another important feature of LSM is that it can quickly produce a high-quality approximate nondominated frontier. It can be shown that the number of IPs solved by LSM is bounded by

In this paper, we present a simple, easy to implement, but very efficient variant of the full 2-split method, the Quadrant Shrinking Method (QSM). In addition, we show that QSM solves at most

                      of the single-objective IPs solved by QSM convert a weakly nondominated point into a nondominated point, which typically can be done extremely fast, because a near-optimal feasible solution can be provided to jump-start the search.

To demonstrate the efficacy of QSM, a computational study has been conducted using publicly available instances of the tri-objective one-dimensional knapsack problem (1DKP), the tri-objective three-dimensional knapsack problem (3DKP), the tri-objective assignment problem (AP), and the tri-objective traveling salesman problem(TSP), in which we compare the performance of QSM to the performance of LSM, KSA (the variant of the full 2-split method developed by Kirlik & Sayın, 2014), ERM (the enhanced recursive method developed by Özlen et al., 2013), and DKA (a reimplementation of the full 2-split method developed by Dächert & Klamroth, 2014). The results show that QSM is significantly faster than any of the existing methods.

The superior performance of QSM, compared to existing methods, can be attributed to its novel decomposition technique (which immediately detects redundancy of many of the constructed rectangles), its simple data structures, its seeding of single-objective IPs with high-quality feasible solutions, and its use of enhancements aimed at eliminating redundant calculations.

The rest of paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce critical concepts of tri-objective integer programming, detail the logic of QSM, and prove the bound on the number of single-objective IPs solved by QSM. In Section 3, we discuss the results of our computational study. Finally, in Section 4, we give some concluding remarks.

QSM works in a projected 2-dimensional criterion space. Without loss of generality, we assume that the 2-dimensional space on which points in the criterion space are projected is defined by the first two objectives, i.e., by z
                     1(x) and z
                     2(x). We thus define the projection of a point 
                        
                           y
                           ∈
                           
                              R
                              3
                           
                        
                      to be (y
                     1, y
                     2), which we denote by 
                        
                           y
                           ¯
                        
                     . QSM makes use of quadrants in the projected space (i.e. in 
                        
                           R

                              y

                     . We refer to u as the upper bound of the quadrant Q(u).

Searching for an as-yet-unknown nondominated point is a core operation in any method for generating the nondominated frontier of a TOIP. A nondominated point

As far as we know, Özlen et al. (2013) were the first to observe and apply Propositions 8 and 9 in their enhanced recursive method.

Before introducing QSM, we make a simple, but important observation that is exploited extensively in QSM. Consider searching for a nondominated point with the property that its projection is in Q(u
                     1) using 2D-NDP-Search(u
                     1). If 2D-NDP-Search(u
                     1) returns Null, then such a nondominated point does not exist. On the other hand, if 2D-NDP-Search(u
                     1) returns an efficient solution with associated nondominated point z, then any other nondominated point with the property that its projection is in Q(u
                     1) can now be found by searching for nondominated points with the property that their projection is in either quadrant Q(u
                     2) or Q(u
                     3) with

                      where ϵ > 0 is a small positive constant (see Fig. 1
                      for an illustration; for presentational convenience, ϵ is not depicted). This follows from Proposition 6, which implies that no other nondominated point 
                        
                           y
                           ∈
                           
                              Y
                              N
                           
                        
                      exists with z
                     1 ≤ y
                     1 ≤ u
                     1 and z
                     2 ≤ y
                     2 ≤ u
                     2. In the remainder, for presentational convenience, we will often use “a nondominated point in Q(u)”, when it would be better and more precise to say “a nondominated point with the property that its projection is in Q(u)”.
                  

The basic idea of QSM is to explore a quadrant that contains all as-yet-unknown nondominated points by searching for those nondominated points, using 2D-NDP-Search(u) with upper bounds u on the top and the right boundary of the quadrant. When it is established that as-yet-unknown nondominated points can no longer be found using 2D-NDP-Search(u) with upper bounds u on the top and the right boundary of the quadrant, the quadrant is shrunk and the process repeats until it is shown that the quadrant does not contain any nondominated points.

Next, we describe QSM in more detail and discuss how it can be implemented efficiently.

QSM maintains a double-ended linked list D of points in the projected criterion space with the property that if u ∈ D, then Q(u) may still contain as-yet-unknown nondominated points and 
                        
                           
                              ⋃
                              
                                 u
                                 ∈
                                 D
                              
                           
                           Q
                           
                              (
                              u
                              )
                           
                        
                      contains all as-yet-unknown nondominated points. The double-ended linked list D is initialized with 
                        
                           u
                           :
                           =
                           (
                           +
                           ∞
                           ,
                           +
                           ∞
                           )
                        
                     . QSM also maintains an ordered list L of known nondominated points (and their corresponding solutions), which is updated each time a new nondominated point is found. The nondominated points in L are maintained in nondecreasing order of their third objective value. If two different nondominated points have the same third objective value, the one that QSM finds first appears first in L. The algorithm terminates when D is empty.

To explore the right boundary of the active quadrant, we pop the element at the front of D. Let u be the extracted element. Next, we search for a nondominated point using 2D-NDP-Search(u). If 2D-NDP-Search(u) returns Null, the search along the right boundary terminates. If the operation 2D-NDP-Search(u) returns an efficient solution xn
                     , it is added to L. Let

                     5, the other potential upper bound can be ignored (Fig. 2c). 2D-NDP-Search(u
                     6) returns Null, which implies that the search along the right boundary of the active quadrant terminates and the search along the top boundary commences (Fig. 2d).

Exploring the top boundary of the active quadrant proceeds similarly, but now elements are popped from the back of the list rather than the front of the list. If 2D-NDP-Search(u), for an extracted element u, returns Null, the search along the top boundary terminates. If 2D-NDP-Search(u) returns an efficient solution xn
                     , the point is added to L and two new points

After the exploration of the right and top boundary of the active quadrant have been completed, the element at the front and at the back of D define the next shrunken active quadrant, and the search for as-yet-unknown nondominated points continues.
                  

When exploring a shrunken quadrant, it is possible to avoid redundant calls 2D-NDP-Search(u) by exploiting Propositions 8 and 9. To do so, we maintain and employ lists of upper bounds that record whether a call 2D-NDP-Search(u) with upper bound u returned an efficient solution or not. The upper bounds u for which 2D-NDP-Search(u) returned an efficient solution are kept with that efficient solution, where we note that an efficient solution may be found more than once and thus more than one upper bound may be kept with an efficient solution (which themselves are kept in list L). The upper bounds u for which 2D-NDP-Search(u) returned Null are kept in a separate list. Before solving the first IP in any call to 2D-NDP-Search, we go through the list of known efficient solutions and find the first one that is feasible for the IP, if it exists. If a feasible solution is found, we check whether one of the upper bounds that lead to its discovery allows Proposition 8 to be applied. If not, then we continue searching for feasible solutions in L with the same third objective function value, since the existence of a feasible point with this value is assurance that the optimal value of the first IP cannot be higher than this and the efficient solutions in L are kept in nondecreasing order of the third objective value. If no feasible solution has been found, we check the list of upper bounds that returned Null to see whether Proposition 9 can be applied.

A precise description of the basic form of QSM is shown in Algorithm 1. To make the implementation of the algorithm as efficient as possible, we incorporate a few additional enhancements. Single-objective IP solvers can solve an IP faster when a high-quality feasible solution is provided at the start. Obviously, if the first IP in 2D-NDP-Search(u) is feasible, the optimal solution can be provided as a feasible solution to the second IP. More importantly, before solving the first IP in 2D-NDP-Search(u), we search L for a feasible solution. Because L is sorted in nondecreasing order of the third objective value, the first feasible solution encountered is also the feasible solution with the highest quality. Furthermore, if we provide a feasible solution x from L to the first IP in 2D-NDP-Search(u) and we find that x is optimal, i.e., the optimal objective value of the first IP is equal to z
                     3(x), then, because x is efficient, x will be optimal for the second IP as well and there is no need to solve the second IP. That implies that the second IP is solved exactly

                      times. In the remainder of this paper, QSM refers to the method with these enhancements, including the application of Propositions 8 and 9. Whenever Proposition 8 shows that z is optimal for 2D-NDP-Search(u), we assume that QSM does not invoke 2D-NDP-Search(u), and say that QSM finds z when exploring u. We also make the following assumption.

                        Assumption 10
                        If we provide a feasible solution, x, to 2D-NDP-Search(u), and x is optimal for the first IP, then 2D-NDP-Search(u) will return x.


                     An illustrative example. We illustrated the workings of QSM on an instance with five nondominated points 
                        
                           {

                     . The instance is solved in three iterations, where an iteration corresponds to exploring the right and top boundaries of a quadrant. In the figures, bold lines show the active quadrant, red crosses indicate upper bounds, small solid circle indicates NDPs, a large solid circle indicates the NDP identified in the specific iteration, and a dashed pattern indicates that no NDP is found in the specific iteration and the search along the right or top boundary terminates. Furthermore, in the caption,

If one of the propositions has been applied in a step, the upper bound used is given in parentheses. Recall that when QSM explores an upper bound and finds an NDP that has already been found in an earlier iteration or it cannot find an NDP, it never solves more than one IP (because it can apply Propositions 8 and 9 or does not need to solve the second IP in 2D-NDP-Search). At the start of Iteration 1, the double-ended list D only contains 
                        
                           
                              u

                              ∞
                              )
                           
                        
                     . QSM pops u
                     1 from D and calls 2D-NDP-Search(u
                     1) to find as-yet-unknown nondominated point z
                     1, and two new upper bounds are added to D (Fig. 3b). This process repeats until QSM terminates. Observe that when QSM pops u
                     3 from D to find as-yet-unknown nondominated point z
                     4, due to existence of u
                     5 in D, only u
                     8 is added to D (Fig. 3f). Observe too that from Iteration 2 - Step 4 onwards, all the upper bounds created, i.e., {u
                     12, u
                     13, u
                     14, u
                     15} are redundant, in the sense that Proposition 8 can be applied to {u
                     12, u
                     13} and Proposition 9 can be applied to {u
                     14, u
                     15}.

We prove the assertion by induction. Obviously, at the first iteration the claim is true since 
                              
                                 U
                                 =
                                 {
                                 (
                                 +
                                 ∞
                                 ,
                                 +
                                 ∞
                                 )
                                 }
                              
                           . Next, we suppose that the claim is true at (an arbitrary) iteration t, and we show that it must be true at iteration 
                              
                                 t
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                            too.

In iteration t, QSM first searches along the right boundary of 
                              
                                 Q
                                 (
                                 
                                    (
                                    
                                       u
                                       1
                                       f
                                    
                                    ,
                                    
                                       u
                                       2
                                       b
                                    
                                    )
                                 
                                 )
                              
                           . In each step of the search along the right boundary, QSM pops the front element, i.e, uf
                           , from D, and QSM replaces it with at most two other elements. Therefore, if we show that after adding new elements, the claim still holds then the assertion holds at any time during the search along the right boundary.

                            hold for the elements of D. Therefore, u
                           1 and u
                           2 cannot exist in D at the same time.

Now suppose that u
                           2 is explored before u
                           1. Because u
                           1 and u
                           2 cannot exist in D at the same time, we have that u
                           1 does not exist in D at the time u
                           2 is explored. Therefore, u
                           1 must be added to D after the exploration of u
                           2. However, that implies that there must exist a u ∈ D with u
                           1 ≤ u and u
                           1 ≠ u at the time u
                           2 is explored, because any upper bound u′ added to D has

                                 ≤

                            popped from D. However, again by Lemma 11, we have

First, suppose that calling 2D-NDP-Search(u
                           2) can be avoided by applying Proposition 8. Let

                            be the nondominated point that is found by 2D-NDP-Search(u
                           1) and 2D-NDP-Search(u
                           2). The logic of QSM implies that any element in D, except

                           1 then z must have existed in L too but it appeared first. This is because QSM provides the first feasible solution found in L to initialize the first IP in 2D-NDP-Search(u
                           1). Therefore, if z′′ was first in L, by Assumption 10, 2D-NDP-Search(u
                           1) must have returned z′′ rather than z.)

By Lemma 12, u
                           1 and u
                           2 cannot have been in D at the same time . Therefore, u
                           2 must have been created after exploring u
                           1. Let u
                           3 be the upper bound whose exploration resulted in the creation of u
                           2 (i.e., 2D-NDP-Search(u
                           3) returns z′′). It is clear that

                            and QSM exploits known feasible solutions, it is impossible that 2D-NDP-Search(u
                           3) returns z′′. (Note that according to our defined rules for keeping the nondominated points in L if

                            and z′′ is created at some points after exploring u
                           1, then z must appear first in L since it is found first.) A contradiction.

Next, suppose that calling 2D-NDP-Search(u
                           2) can be avoided by applying Proposition 9. The logic of QSM and the fact that u
                           2 < u
                           1 implies that there must exist a nondominated point in Q(u
                           1) (because u
                           2 must have been created based on the discovery of a nondominated point). A contradiction.□

An illustration of Proposition 13 can be found in Figs. 3j and 4a. We see that 
                        
                           
                              u

                           ,
                        
                      and that Proposition 8 can be applied to u
                     12 because QSM has already explored u
                     10 and returned nondominated point z
                     5, which is optimal for 2D-NDP-Search(u
                     12) too. The reason that 
                        
                           
                              u

                      is that u
                     12 is created after finding z
                     4 during exploration of u
                     5 (see Fig. 3m).

                        Definition 14
                        An element u ∈ D is useful if calling 2D-NDP-Search(u) cannot be avoided by applying Propositions 8 or 9.

Note that for each useful element u ∈ D at least one IP has to be solved (and possibly two). Note too that the first time 
                        
                           z

                      is found by QSM, two IPs are solved.

In the remainder, we will denote by nIP

Clearly, z is found by calling 2D-NDP-Search(u) for some u popped from D at some point during the execution of QSM. (Note that by definition u is a useful element.) After finding z, at most two useful elements are added to D. However, since u is popped from D, in total, the number of useful elements in D increases by at most one.□

An illustration of Lemma 16 can be found in Fig. 3f, j, and m, where the nondominated point z
                     4 is found three times by QSM when exploring u
                     3, u
                     7, and u
                     5. During the exploration of u
                     3 and u
                     7, QSM only adds elements u
                     8 and u
                     10 to D.

                           3 ≥ u
                           4, QSM will explore u

                                    Case 1: QSM returns infeasible, which implies that there is no nondominated point in Q(u
                                    3). Because Q(u
                                    4)⊆Q(u
                                    3), Proposition 9 implies that u
                                    4 is not useful.

First, suppose that QSM adds u

In this case, we have reached a situation that is similar to our starting point with u

                                             4
                                          
                                       
                                     and, because u
                                    5 ≥ u
                                    4, and by Lemma 12, QSM will explore u
                                    5 before u

Next, suppose that QSM does not add u

                                    3. This implies that u
                                    3 is explored on the top boundary, and at the time u
                                    3 is processed,

                                     is not created, and we can conclude that u
                                    1 must have been explored on the top boundary of a quadrant.

More precisely, since u
                                    3 is generated after exploring u
                                    1, it must be the case that QSM popped u
                                    1 from D before popping u
                                    3. Note that when QSM popped u
                                    1 from D, u
                                    7 was at the back of D. So by Lemma 12, it must be the case that

                                     and, because u
                                    8 ≥ u
                                    4, QSM will explore u
                                    8 before u
                                    4.

Since we assume that the set of nondominated points is finite, these situations cannot repeat indefinitely and at some point we must end up in Case 1 or Case 2.□

An illustration of Lemma 17 can be found in Fig. 3f, j, and m, where QSM finds nondominated point z
                     4 three times when exploring u
                     3, u
                     7, and u
                     5, but where u
                     13 (created after exploring u
                     5) is not useful, because u
                     8 has already been explored.

The following notation is helpful in deriving subsequent results.

                        Definition 18
                        For a given 
                              
                                 z
                                 ∈
                                 
                                    Y
                                    N
                                 
                                 ,
                              
                            we write S(z) to denote the set of upper bounds explored by QSM that result in finding z.

We first show that QSM solves

                                       I
                                       P
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    z
                                    )
                                 
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                            IPs.

Because the first time that QSM finds z, two IPs are solved, it suffices to show that 
                              
                                 
                                    n
                                    
                                       I
                                       P
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    z
                                    )
                                 
                                 −
                                 1
                              
                            IPs are solved, in total, all other times that z is found. This is the case, because QSM exploits known feasible solutions, and only one IP is solved in 2D-NDP-Searchcalls after z is found the first time.

We now show that the number of useful elements in D decreases by at least

This is because, the first time that QSM found z, it must have been exploring either u or u′ on the top boundary or right boundary, respectively. (This follows from the fact that as long as u and u′ exist in D, no other elements v ∈ S(z)\{u, u′} can define the active quadrant.) Next we show that

                            are the only useful elements that may be added to D after exploring all elements of S(z), which will prove the lemma.

Without loss of generality, we assume that the first time that QSM finds z is when it explores u′ while searching the right boundary. As a consequence, the element

                            is added to D the first time that z is found. Lemma 17 implies that any other element

                            created when exploring an upper bound s ∈ S(z)\{u′} is not useful: take u
                           1 in Lemma 17 to be u′ and take u
                           2 to be s. For instance, in Fig. 7, {u
                           7, u
                           8, u

                                    . In this case, the logic of QSM implies that QSM must have been exploring u on the right boundary of a quadrant. However, this would imply that all other elements s ∈ S, s ≠ u have already been explored (since s
                                    1 > u

                     4 three times when exploring u

                     7, and u
                     5 (all useful elements), but adds only two useful elements, i.e., u
                     8 and u

                                 Because in this case the upper bound in S(z) with minimum first component and the upper bound in S(z) with minimum second component are not necessarily unique, we define u and u′ more carefully.

We bound the number of IPs solved by QSM by examining the nondominated points. Note that when a nondominated point 
                              
                                 z

                            is found nIP
                           (z) times by calling 2D-NDP-Search(u), the first such call requires the solution of two IPs and all subsequent calls require the solution of one IP. Furthermore, note that each time 2D-NDP-Search(u) is called, it is called with a useful element u. Thus, bounding the number of useful elements that is created implicitly bounds the number of IPs that has to be solved. We distinguish three types of nondominated points:

QSM is implemented in C++ and uses CPLEX 12.6 as the integer programming solver. The computational experiments are conducted on a computer with 2.30 gigahertz Intel Xeon E5-2650 processors and 264 gigabyte RAM, with the RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.1 operating system, and using a single thread.

In our computational study, we use two publicly available sets of instances, Set I and Set II, used in previous studies of methods for solving TOIPs. The first set has been used by Özlen et al. (2013) and contains 19 instances (with different sizes), including 10 instances of the tri-objective assignment problem (AP), 6 instances of the tri-objective 3-dimensional knapsack problem (3DKP), and 3 instances of the tri-objective traveling salesman problem (TSP). The second set has been used by Kirlik and Sayın (2014) and has a class of AP instances and a class of 1DKP instances. Each class contains 10 subclasses, each with 10 instances. Thus, the total number of instances in Set II is 200. A subclass is characterized by the size of the instances it contains (in terms of the number of agents and tasks in AP and in terms of the number of items in 1DKP). The subclasses of AP have instances of size 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50. The subclasses of 1DKP have instances of size 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100. (Note that the size of an instance of 1DKP and 3DKP gives the number of binary variables in the formulation; the size of instance of AP to the power two gives the number of binary variables in the formulation, the size of an instance of TSP is in terms of the number of cities and thus the size to the power of two gives the number of binary variables in the formulation.) In our computational study, each instance was solved five times and averages over the results of the five runs are reported in the result tables and figures.

Detailed performance statistics of QSM, the L-shape search method (LSM), the method of Kirlik and Sayın (KSA), the enhanced recursive method (ERM), and the method of Dächert and Klamroth (DKA) on the instances in Set I can be found in Tables 1
                      and 2
                     . The table shows instance information, namely the class, the size, and the number of points in the nondominated frontier, as well as result information, namely for each method the number of single-objective IPs solved and the time taken to generate the nondominated frontier, and the percent improvement in number of IPs solved and time taken to generate the nondominated frontier of QSM over LSM, KSA, ERM, and DKA. The number of IPs that were infeasible is shown in parentheses.

We note that C/C++ implementations of ERM and KSA are publicly available, and we used these implementations in our computational experiments. We implemented the full 2-split method of Dächert and Klamroth (2014) (DKA) in C++ ourselves using their MATLAB code as a guide, which the authors kindly provided to us.

                      IPs to compute all nondominated points. Moreover, observe that the number of infeasible IPs solved by QSM is only about

                      on average over all instances. This is one of the advantages of solving TOIPs in the projected space, and is an important contributor to the efficiency of QSM. We note that all algorithms spend more than 95 percent of their computing time on solving single-objective IPs, so solving as few single-objective IPs as possible, and solving these as efficiently as possible, is critical to the success of any algorithms.

Comparing QSM’s results with those of LSM, KSA, ERM and DKA shows that QSM, on average, is about 17 percent faster than LSM, 28 percent faster than KSA, 39 percent faster than ERM, and 16 percent faster than DKA. The primary reason is that QSM solves fewer IPs in comparison to LSM, KSA, ERM, and DKA. We note that QSM is designed to efficiently generate the (complete) nondominated frontier, whereas LSM is designed specifically to quickly produce high-quality approximate frontiers, which comes at a small computational cost, and therefore it is not surprising that QSM outperforms LSM when generating nondominated frontiers.

The importance of the enhancements embedded in QSM is illustrated in Fig. 8
                     , which shows the ratio of time required to solve instances of set I when all enhancements are disabled (NO-E), when applying Propositions 8 and 9 is disabled (No-P), and when providing feasible solutions to IPs is disabled (No-F) to the time required to solve the instances when all enhancements are enabled. (The instances are presented along the horizontal axis in nondecreasing order of their number of NDPs.) It is clear that the enhancements are important and improve the performance of QSM significantly. It is also interesting to observe that the impact of providing feasible solutions compared to applying Propositions 8 and 9 becomes more important, relatively speaking, as the number of NDPs increases.

Because the number of instances in Set II is much larger than the number of instances in Set I, we present performance profiles rather result tables. A performance profile is a graph with along the horizontal axis the ratio of the runtime of an instance to the minimum runtime for that instance among all methods and along the vertical axis the fraction of instances that achieved a ratio that is less than or equal to the ratio on the horizontal axis (Dolan & Moré, 2002). (This implies that values in the upper left-hand corner of the graph indicate the best performance.) The performance profile of the runtime of QSM, LSM, KSA, ERM, and DKA for the AP and 1DKP instances in Set II can be found in Figs. 9
                      and 10
                     , respectively. (Since there are also some very small instances in Set II that can be solved extremely fast, to draw the performance profiles, we add 0.1 second to the actual runtime of the algorithms.)

We observe that QSM significantly outperforms LSM, KSA, ERM, and DKA on the AP instances. On the 1DKP instances, QSM clearly outperforms LSM, KSA, and ERM, but QSM and DKA have comparable performance on these instances. On the smaller instances DKA is better, but on the larger instances QSM is better. It is relevant to note that the largest 1DKP instances are far smaller than the largest AP instances. A closer examination of the results for the largest instances in both classes reveals that QSM solves fewer IPs (significantly fewer for AP instances) and solves these IPs faster (see Table 3
                     , which presents averages over the instances in the class).
