                  This paper studies vertical integration in serial supply chains with a wholesale price contract. We consider a business environment where the contracting leader may be endogenously changed before and after forming the integration. A cooperative game is formulated to normatively analyze the stable and fair profit allocations under the grand coalition in such an environment. Our main result demonstrates that vertical integration is stable when all members are pessimistic in the sense that they are sure that they will not become the contracting leader if they deviate from the grand coalition. We find that in this case, the grand coalition’s profit must be allocated more to the retailer and the members with higher costs. Nevertheless, we also show the conditions under which the upstream manufacturer can have strong power as in traditional supply chains.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Modern supply chains in many industries—such as the well-known examples in the automobile, electronics, and apparel industries—involve world-wide networks with many tiers, which are filled by many companies playing various roles (bib32, 2009). In addition, in many cases, the power balance among the members in a chain has drastically changed in the last two decades. Specifically, we can increasingly find examples of retailers or other downstream companies who have now become contract leaders in supply chains, although formerly, manufacturers had the most power and held contract leadership. In particular, the power of retailers, including Wal-Mart, Tesco Plc, and UNIQLO, has been increasing drastically. As a result, in consumer goods markets, private labels by some major retailers have recently emerged wherein the retailers design their labels and offer their manufacturers contracts to produce them. This is in contrast with traditional national brands where manufacturers design and produce products, and then sell them widely through retailers. In fact, the share of private labels has become about twenty percent in Wal-Mart, while in Tesco Plc, which is the third biggest retailer in the world, it actually exceeds forty percent.

As another example, UNIQLO has established a “Specialty store retailer of Private label Apparel” (SPA) model encompassing all stages of a label’s business from design to production to sales, although the manufacturing is outsourced. Further, at each stage, UNIQLO plays a leading role, for example, by conducting stringent quality control checks in outsourcing at the production stage. Furthermore, Reebok, in the apparel industry, and Google, in the smartphone industry, are examples of contract leaders in supply chains who are neither retailers nor manufacturers. Reebok outsources its entire manufacturing to manufacturers it contracts to, which are located in Southeast Asia and so on, and sells the product through many retailers (van Dusen, 1998). Google, too, outsources the manufacturing of its Nexus series of phones to leading manufacturers (preferring one manufacturer for each generation of product: HTC for the first, Samsung for the next two, and LG for the fourth and current), and sells them through cell phone carriers or retail stores (Arrington, 2010). As seen from such examples, with increasing tendency, many companies in mid-tier positions in supply chains are taking contract leaderships by utilizing their brand power. Therefore, they focus on their brand development and management, rather than engaging in each stage of the chain, that is, producing, retailing, and so on. All these examples show that recently in supply chains, an entity in any position can attain contract leadership and the sequential orders of contracts can vary accordingly.

However, we should note that for any decentralized supply chain, the problem of double marginalization exists, where each firm sets a higher price in order to gain a higher profit margin. This then leads to a higher retail price, lower demand, and (thus) lower profit (Spengler, 1950, Tirol 1988, and so on). Further, it is well known that one of the solutions to this problem is vertical integration among firms. In fact, in the real world, one well known example of vertical integration is that of Toyota, the Japanese automobile manufacturer, that formed the so-called “keiretsu,” a business group linked in a supply relationship. In contrast, the SPA model and the development of private labels mentioned above can be seen as examples where having a strong retailer leads to vertical integration of each process in a supply chain (design, production, wholesale, retail, and so on) into a centralized system. In addition, as is well known, DELL established the “direct model” in the 1990s, where one leader firm coordinates all stages of the supply chain and ensures virtual integration into a centralized system (Magretta, 1998).

The theoretical analysis on vertical integration in the framework of game theory has been well documented. In addition, there exist many researches on coordination schemes for attaining the centralized solution under decentralization. However, most of these papers analyze supply chains with only two tiers of suppliers and retailers, and thus multi-tier supply chains, including those with a middle man have received very little attention. In contrast, with regard to the sequential orders of contracts under pre-cooperation, most papers assume that a manufacturer is the contract leader and contracts are sequentially taken from upstream to downstream members. Thus, there are remarkably few studies that assume a downstream firm’s potential to play a leadership role in multi-tier supply chains. As an exception, Majumder and Srinivasan (2006) consider the possibility of varying sequential orders of contracts. However, with regard to vertical integration, they focus on the formation process of the integration and do not pay attention to the stability of the vertical integration formed or the rational allocation of profit among the members. However, we should note that the feasibility of forming the integration (grand coalition) and the stability of the formed coalition are quite different issues. It is very important to make the distinction between these two issues, as we can find this to be one of the main areas of consideration in game theory, especially cooperative game theory. In fact, the following recent example of the e-book market in the US shows the importance of considering the allocation of the centralized system’s profit to each of its members in order to sustain the system. Specifically speaking, Amazon, which monopolizes the downstream platform in the e-book market, has set the price of its e-books at 9.99dollars, but one of the major publishers, Macmillan, is not satisfied with this price. Consequently, in January 2009, in negotiations with Amazon, Macmillan introduced a requirement that they could set their own e-book prices from 12.99dollars to 14.99dollars. In addition, in the revenue-sharing contract between them, Macmillan asked Amazon to increase the rate of revenue sharing Macmillan receives from 35% to 70%. However, these negotiations broke down, and as a result, Amazon stopped selling Macmillan’s products. Two days later, Amazon finally decided to accept Macmillan’s requirements. According to some press reports, this is because Amazon recognized that Macmillan actually enjoys monopoly in major e-book markets, including school textbooks and so on (Rao, 2010; The New York Times, 2010).

We can interpret this fact as the break-down of the coalition because careful consideration was not paid to the possibility of an ex-post change of position in the contracting leader, although the parties previously succeeded in forming the grand coalition. As recently in the e-book market, the power balance between players in supply chains can drastically change in the early days of an industry. This implies that the leader position in supply chains may endogenously change before and after vertical integration. Therefore, under such environments, managers might be concerned about how they can maintain their vertical integration. Based on this motivation, by using a cooperative game theory, we explore stable and fair profit allocation under vertical integration in light of an ex-post change in the leadership position. We specifically address the following research questions.
                        
                           •
                           In serial supply chains with n tiers, provided that the leader can change (or all members believe that the leadership can change), after forming the grand coalition (centralized system),

When is the grand coalition stable?

How should the grand coalition’s profit be allocated to each firm?

With such circumstances as described above, under which conditions can the upstream manufacturer have the most power as in traditional supply chains?

In order to answer these questions, we use cooperative game theory that normatively discusses fair profit allocations under the grand coalition. We formulate our problem as a coalitional form game, the most standard model of a cooperative game. However, we should note that formulation is a troublesome issue. In order to formulate a coalitional form game, we must set the value (characteristic function) of a coalition as the maximum value it can individually earn (Myerson, 1996, and so on). This value is well-defined for standard cases in the absence of any externality, where any formation of a coalition does not affect the payoffs of players outside the coalition. Unfortunately, however, an externality exists under our setting, which implies that we must assume how the outsiders respond to the formation of a deviating coalition. Hence, here, we apply the theory of coalition formation, noting that there have been remarkable recent developments relating to game theory in this area. Specifically, we assume that even if some members deviate from the grand coalition, the remaining members continue with cooperation, such that the value of a coalition is defined as the equilibrium profit of the two-person game between deviating members and the remaining coalition. The formulation in this manner is one of the key points of this study and plays an important role in the discussions on our results mentioned later.

We now present an overview of the results obtained in this paper. First, we show that in terms of the existence of core allocation, the grand coalition is stable only if all members are pessimistic in the sense that they are sure they will not become the contract leader after any of their coalitional deviations from the grand coalition. This result suggests that although the whole of the supply chain benefits from vertical integration (which effectively eliminates double marginalization), integration is not stable if all or some members expect contract leadership. We next analyze the Shapley value and the nucleolus of our model, which indicates fair allocations under vertical integrations. As a result, we show that the grand coalition’s profit must be allocated more to the retailer and the members who have higher costs. In other words, these specific members have relatively strong powers for vertical integration to be stably sustained. Therefore, this result suggests that under situations facing a variable leadership and rapid cost improvements due to technological advances, the retailer is likely to be in a much more beneficial situation under vertical integration, while the upstream manufacturer is not. However, we show that even under such conditions, the upstream manufacturer can have a relatively strong power if it can vertically integrate with multiple monopolistic retailers.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature in vertical integration including that focusing on coordination and cooperation in supply chains, and clarifies the position of this paper. In Section 3, we formulate our problem of vertical integration and profit allocation as a cooperative game. In Section 4, we analyze the core, the Shapley value, and the nucleolus of our game; and examine stable and fair profit allocations under vertical integration. We extend our analysis to a supply chain with one manufacturer and multiple monopolistic retailers in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper. The proofs of all lemmas and theorems are provided in Appendix.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The literature related to this study comes from three research streams. The first is the literature on strategic interaction between players in a supply chain where some downstream player such as a retailer is the contract leader. The second is that on the formation of vertical integration in a supply chain. The last is that on stability and fair profit allocation in a coalition formation. All these works span the subjects of economics, marketing, and operations management.

In the first stream, Choi (1991) considers the strategic interaction between two competing manufacturers and one monopolistic retailer by using a game theoretic approach. He compares three cases with each other: the case where one of the manufacturers first offers its wholesale price as the contract leader (manufacturer Stackelberg), the reverse case where the retailer is the contract leader (retailer Stackelberg), and the case, where all players simultaneously determine their prices (vertical Nash). In his follow-on work—Choi (1996)—he extends the setting to the case of two manufacturers and two competing retailers and analyzes the equilibrium under various leaders’ positions. The recent work of Edirisinghe, Bichescu, and Shi (2011) investigates the stable structure of contracting under possible scenarios in the model of Choi (1991). These papers analyze only two-tier supply chains and assume that no player incurs costs other than wholesale prices, while each retailer determines its margin when it is the contract leader. In contrast, Majumder and Srinivasan (2006) consider multi-tier serial supply chains where each member has marginally increasing costs and investigate the impact of the leader’s position on the profit of each member and retailing price. In their following paper, Majumder and Srinivasan (2008) explore the extension of their model to network supply chains. Our model is based on that of Majumder and Srinivasan (2006). However, as mentioned later, they do not pay much attention to the topic of vertical integration, which is our primary concern.

Next, regarding the second stream, we first should note that Spengler (1950) is the pioneering paper that introduces the double marginalization problem and vertical integration under wholesale price contracts from a microeconomics viewpoint. Since then, in the subjects of both marketing and operations management, many papers study this topic by considering efficient distribution structures. For example, McGuire and Staelin (1983) analyze the equilibrium distribution structure under a situation, where two competing manufacturers sell their products exclusively through two retailers. By a comparative static approach, they compare the profitability between the centralized (vertical integration) and decentralized cases, under varying substitutability between the two products. Moorthy (1988) discusses the possibility of vertical integration by investigating a model with the endogenous choices of such dealership structures. Corbett and Karmarker (2001) focus on entry and exit under competition among firms at each stage in an n-tier supply chain, and on vertical integration. In contrast, Jeuland and Shugan (1983) is the first study on channel coordination between a manufacturer and a retailer in the decentralized situation. Coughlan and Wernerfelt (1989) also discuss a coordination scheme in multi-tier supply chains as in our study. The basic topics of such coordination contracts for resolving the double marginalization problem, including two-part tariff and quantity discounts, are comprehensively explained in Tirol (1988). Nevertheless, various contract schemes considering more realistic situations have been recently developed. Among these, the revenue sharing contract is studied in many papers, and is closely related with our study in terms of profit allocation. Under the revenue sharing contract, a supplier has ownership of the product and sets a retailing price, while a retailer deducts a percentage, which is set by the contract, from the retailing price and remits the balance to the supplier; for such contracts, see Cachon and Lariviere (2004). Gerchak and Yunzeng (2004) attempt an application of this scheme to assembly systems and compare its profitability with wholesale pricing. Pan, Lai, Leung, and Xiao (2010) also compare the profitability of revenue sharing and wholesale pricing under different channel power structures. Moreover, Li, Zhu, and Huang (2009) analyze the Nash bargaining solution between a manufacturer and a retailer based on the equilibrium attained under a revenue sharing contract between them. They suggest the possibility of attaining the centralized solution as in vertical integration through a long-term negotiation. However, these papers are quite different from ours in the following two aspects. One is that they deal with only two-tier supply chains, while we consider supply chains consisting of n tiers. Second, the other difference is that they focus on coordination mechanisms—feasibilities of the centralized outcome under a decentralized situation. In contrast, provided that the centralized outcome is already attained, we explore how the centralized system profit should be allocated to each player in order to stably maintain the outcome.

In this sense, the literature regarding the third stream—the stability of the coalition and fair payoff allocation among n players—is much more important for our study. These topics are closely related to the theory of coalition formation in the area of game theory. The literature in this area is mainly classified into two approaches. One concerns the non-cooperative game theoretic approach, where stable coalition structures are explored, under which each player individually decides whether or not to join a coalition provided that players can form a coalition and communicate with each other regarding payoff divisions. As in our study, the second approach is a cooperative game theoretic approach, where a stable and fair payoff allocation among players is normatively analyzed, provided that a grand coalition is formed. Regarding the former approach, Granot and Sosic (2003) and Sosic (2006) examine the models of horizontal alliances between retailers for efficient inventory management and mainly focus on the feasibility of the stable formation of a grand coalition. While Granot and Sosic (2003) assume myopic retailers and thus analyze a Nash equilibrium, Sosic (2006) employs the concept of farsighted stability presented by Chwe (1994). However, both studies assume that cooperation among members is sustained in the final stage of the game, and thus, their non-cooperative game models partly involve cooperative games. Granot and Sosic (2005), too, explore the possibility of a stable alliance among three suppliers under an Internet-based exchange, by using Chwe’s stable concept. In addition, Nagarajan and Sosic (2007) examine the farsighted stability of coalition formation under a price competition (Bertrand competition) between n retailers. In their follow-on study—Nagarajan and Sosic (2009)—they study the possibility of a horizontal alliance among suppliers in an assembly system where one assembler and n suppliers face price competition. Regarding the latter approach, on the other hand, Meca, Timmer, Garcia-Jurado, and Borm (2004) analyze a cost allocation problem arising from cooperative inventory control by using a coalitional form game formulated on a typical model of inventory management. Slikker, Fransoo, and Wouters (2005) discuss fair profit allocation arising from inventory sharing among retailers based on the newsvendor model. Although the details of such related literature can be seen in good surveys by Nagarajan and Sosic (2008), Meca and Timmer (2008), Fiestras-Janeiro, Garcia-Jurado, Meca, and Mosquera (2011), it seems that their main focus is on cooperative inventory controls or price settings among retailers, or information sharing between the supplier and the retailer. In contrast, vertical cooperation for eliminating double marginalization due to wholesale pricing has received very little attention. To the best of our knowledge, the only exception is Guardiola, Meca, and Timmer (2007), who consider a core allocation of the grand coalition’s profit between one manufacturer and n monopolistic retailers. Indeed, our study explores the same situation as theirs in Section 5. However, our model is different from theirs in that they assume that only the manufacturer incurs a unit cost and that the manufacturer always determines the wholesale price as the leader in decentralized situations. In addition, our main analysis focuses on multi-tier supply chains. However, as mentioned in the previous section, this involves a troublesome problem that since an externality exists between coalitions, some assumption is required for the actions of players outside the deviating coalition in order to appropriately define the value of the coalition. Indeed, this type of problem is common to some topics including coalition formation under a substitutable goods oligopoly with a provision of public goods. Therefore, this problem has long been studied in game theory. Examples include Aumann (1959), Chander and Tulkens (1997), Chander (2007), Hart and Kurz (1983), and Rajan (1989), which are referred to in detail in Section 3. Nevertheless, we must note that none of these papers discuss vertical cooperation at all.

Finally, we reiterate the difference between this paper and Majumder and Srinivasan (2006), which is the most closely related work to our study. Regarding vertical integration, they mainly focus on coordination mechanisms such as a two-part tariff and a formation process for the grand coalition with successive cooperation between neighbors. In contrast, in this study, we attempt to investigate stable and fair profit allocation under the grand coalition in the framework of a cooperative game, while considering an ex-post change in the leadership position. In this sense, our contribution to the literature would be complementary to theirs.

In this section, we formulate our model of vertical integration as a cooperative game. Specifically, in 3.1, we first introduce our base model of leader–follower wholesale-price contracts before any cooperation. Then, in 3.2, we consider coalitions between any members and formulate the coalitional form game where the contract leader is variable.

Following Majumder and Srinivasan (2006), our model is based on a simple wholesale-price contract under an n-stage serial supply chain. The most upstream member is the manufacturer who faces an increasing marginal cost, while the most downstream member is the retailer who faces a price-elastic demand in addition to an increasing marginal cost. Any middle members are assemblers or wholesalers who also face increasing marginal costs. We suppose the sequential leader–follower contract among them. Specifically, at each stage, the follower member chooses the quantity it sells, in response to the wholesale price offered by the leader. For example, if the retailer offers its wholesale price as the contract leader, then his immediate upstream neighbor chooses the quantity it sells. Conversely, if this upstream neighbor offers a wholesale price to the retailer as the leader, then the retailer chooses the quantity it sells, in consideration of the retail price. In what follows, we formally describe these processes.

We consider a serial supply chain with n members 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              {
                              1
                              ,
                              2
                              ,
                              …
                              ,
                              n
                              }
                           
                        . The manufacturer is indexed as member 1, the retailer as member n, and assemblers or wholesalers as members 
                           
                              2
                              ,
                              3
                              ,
                              …
                              ,
                              n
                              -
                              2
                              ,
                              n
                              -
                              1
                           
                        . Let us assume that there is only one contract leader in the supply chain, who is labeled as l. This leader first offers the contract to its downstream neighbor 
                           
                              l
                              +
                              1
                           
                         and then member 
                           
                              l
                              +
                              1
                           
                         offers the next contract to its neighbor 
                           
                              l
                              +
                              2
                           
                        , and so on. Finally, the retailer determines its selling quantity. In a similar way, the leader also offers the contract to its upstream neighbor 
                           
                              l
                              -
                              1
                           
                         and then member 
                           
                              l
                              -
                              1
                           
                         offers the contract to its neighbor 
                           
                              l
                              -

                        , and so on. Finally, the manufacturer determines the quantity it produces. We note that the direction of contracts from the leader is always one way, and thus the contract sequence is uniquely determined once the leader position is given. Given leader l, we define the wholesale price offered to member i as

We first consider supply chains with an interior leader, that is,

We can formulate the game with leader l as the following extensive form game. We start from the decision of l in the first stage, followed by two branches for members 
                              
                                 l
                                 -
                                 1
                              
                            and 
                              
                                 l
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                            that are based on the wholesale prices offered by l. In each branch, we have a sequence of stages, with each stage consisting of the next member’s problem: one branch is for the members upstream of the leader, which leads to the manufacturer, and the other is for the members downstream of the leader, which leads to the retailer. The equilibrium concept we adopt is the subgame perfect equilibrium. As the number of members is finite, we can find the equilibrium of this game by using backward induction.

We consider cooperation by any members on the basis of the non-cooperative game formulated in the previous section. Specifically, while the supply chain system also employs a leader–follower contract framework, the members included in the coalition determine their wholesale prices and selling quantities at each stage to maximize their total profit. Majumder and Srinivasan (2006, Section 5.3) also discuss such a situation and prove that cooperation between the leader and either of its neighbors is always profitable for them, and thus by repeating such a process, the grand coalition where all members jointly form one coalition, can beneficially be formed. Majumder and Srinivasan (2006, Sections 5.1 and 5.2) also show other formation processes of coalitions that lead to the grand coalition. These results ensure the feasibility of vertical integration among all members in the system. Thus, acknowledging this, we here focus on analyzing the stability of the grand coalition after realizing it and on fair profit allocation among the members under the coalition. To do this, we formulate this problem as a coalitional form game (characteristic function game), which is known as the most standard model of a cooperative game, and investigate the core, the Shapley value, and the nucleolus of the game.

In order to formulate a coalitional form game, we must set the value of coalition (characteristic function) 
                           
                              v
                              (
                              S
                              )
                           
                         for each coalition 
                           
                              S
                              ⊂
                              N
                           
                         in an appropriate way. However, we should note that in this regard, there are two major issues. One of these is that we must assume how each member in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         responds to the formation of S, since the profit S it can earn is clearly dependent on the decisions of the members in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                        . The other problem is that under the situation where the whole system employs the leader–follower framework, we must also assume the order of contracts between S and each member in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                        , regardless of how the members in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         cooperate. Regarding the former, we should note that this type of problem has long been discussed in microeconomics and game theory, in particular in the area of horizontal mergers under oligopoly and coalition formation in public good provision, where players’ strategic interactions exhibit some externalities. Therefore, the appropriate value of the coalition (characteristic function) applicable to such situations has been developed. In particular, 
                           
                              α
                           
                        - and 
                           
                              β
                           
                        -characteristic functions are perhaps the best known, where coalition S assumes that the outside players (members in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                        ) will act so as to minimize the payoff of S (Aumann, 1959; Myerson, 1996, and so on). However, while such minimax-type actions might be justified under a zero-sum situation, they are obviously inappropriate under a non zero-sum situation where there is an externality (Chander, 2007). (Nevertheless, 
                           
                              α
                           
                        - and 
                           
                              β
                           
                        -characteristic functions can be justified in some models of a horizontal merger; see for example, Zhao (1999) and Norde, Pham Do, & Tijs (2002).) However, in fact, in our model, the worst scenario for S about the action of 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         is that at each stage, each member in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         offers the wholesale price equivalent to the retail price, which is so high as to exclude the demand of the final product. However, clearly each member in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         also does not benefit from this action. This implies that it is very important to take into account strategic interactions between a deviating coalition and outside members. Noting this, other types of characteristic functions have recently been developed where 
                           
                              v
                              (
                              S
                              )
                           
                         is defined as the equilibrium payoff of a game between S and every member in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                        . Among these functions, there are two typically characteristic ones. One is known as the 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        -characteristic function coalition (Chander & Tulkens, 1997; Chander, 2007; Hart & Kurz, 1983; Rajan, 1989, and so on), where it is assumed that for the deviation of S from the grand coalition, the members in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         break up into singletons and each member reacts individually (non-cooperatively) to maximize its own profit. That is, the value of a coalition can be obtained as the payoff earned at the equilibrium of the 
                           
                              |
                              N
                              -
                              S
                              |
                              +
                              1
                           
                        -person game between S and the members in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                        . The other function is known as “model 
                           
                              δ
                           
                        ,” which was introduced by Hart and Kurz (1983), where it is assumed that given a deviation of S, the members in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         keep the coalition. Therefore, the value of a coalition is defined as the payoff earned at the equilibrium of the two-person game between S and 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                        .

Of course, we must choose the most appropriate characteristic function depending on the context. For example, when a horizontal merger under Cournot competition or a coalition in public good provision is modeled, the 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        -characteristic function is commonly utilized. This is because the assumption in which each member of 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         acts independently can be justified, since doing so contributes to avoiding the free-riding by S arising from such competition, such that each member in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         can earn a higher profit. However, this assumption unfortunately lacks validity under our situation for the following two reasons. First, as discussed in Majumder and Srinivasan (2006, Section 6), under a vertical supply chain, each member in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         usually benefits from continuing to cooperate. The second reason is that as mentioned above, our leader–follower framework requires that we assume the order of contracts among members, regardless of how members in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         cooperate. However, this implies that if we consider the case, where each member of 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         individually acts and the leader might change depending on the coalition structure, we also have to appropriately assume who becomes the new contract leader. This seems to be a rather troublesome problem as the outcome 
                           
                              v
                              (
                              S
                              )
                           
                         can be drastically different depending on the assumptions. In addition, in order to realize such a situation, we might need some process where starting from the deviation of S, each member in 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         sequentially departs from the grand coalition, and finally, they coordinate with the new leader. However, as the number of members increases, this process takes a long time. As mentioned in the introduction section, this is not consistent with our motivation for decision-making under rapid changes in the business environment.

Based on these points, we adopt the formulation of “model 
                           
                              δ
                           
                        ” by Hart and Kurz (1983) (this model is also employed by some other papers including Rajan, 1989). In fact, we assume that even if S deviates from the grand coalition, each member of 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         keeps the coalition, and the game is reduced to a two-person game between S and 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                        . In contrast, regarding the order of the contract between them, we consider the following two cases: Case 1, where S (the deviating coalition) becomes the new leader, and Case 2, where 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              S
                           
                         (the remaining coalition) becomes the new leader. We should note that in each case, there is no adjacency restriction with regard to forming a coalition. That is, as in a usual coalitional form game, any coalition is allowed to form, even among nonadjacent members in a supply chain. In the next subsection, we explicitly give the values of the coalitions for each case.

As mentioned in the previous subsection, we can set the value of coalition 
                              
                                 v
                                 (
                                 S
                                 )
                              
                            as the total payoff earned by the members in S in the Stackelberg equilibrium of the two-person game between S and 
                              
                                 N
                                 -
                                 S
                              
                           . Both coalitions determine their wholesale prices and selling quantities in order to maximize their total profits, respectively. We should note that while the leader–follower game is employed between both coalitions, all of the strategic variables with regard to the members inside a coalition are determined simultaneously. Now, given any S, we suppose that S is the leader while 
                              
                                 N

                            is the follower. Then, for every

Furthermore, as in the non-cooperative situation previously discussed, we may assume, according to Lemma 1 of Majumder and Srinivasan (2006), that in the equilibrium, both quantities are always equivalent (there is no leftover product). It should be noted that in this game, there is a member who can be offered two wholesale prices by its immediate downstream and upstream neighbors. Nevertheless, the following Lemma ensures that the equilibrium profit is always determined uniquely.

                                 In each case (Cases 1 and 2), the equilibrium profit of the game is uniquely determined. The corresponding equilibria include the one, where all wholesale prices are zero, except the price set between the most downstream member inside the coalition excluding the retailer and its immediate downstream neighbor. Formally, let S be the leader and

                            earned in the equilibrium of this game. Lemma 1 indeed ensures that in each case and for every coalition, the process of finding the value of the coalition is reduced to such a simple model of a two-tier supply chain.

Hence, considering the equilibrium profit of this game, it follows that the values of a coalition can be classified into two cases according to whether or not the coalition includes the retailer. In addition, the value of the grand coalition is clearly identical in both cases and equal to the monopoly profit in which the coalition determines only the quantity of the final product, while setting all wholesale prices to be zero and incurring the total cost with regard to all members in it.

Therefore, we can explicitly describe the values of the coalitions for each case as follows.

As can be easily seen from the forms in (5)–(7), the values of the coalitions depend only on whether or not the coalition includes the retailer, and on the total costs of the members in the coalition. In other words, they do not depend on the specific position of the leader under pre-integration.

However, we note that this does not immediately imply that the formation of the grand coalition is not possible, since our values of the coalitions are defined as ex-post values and thus can be obtained after deviating from the grand coalition. (As mentioned above, the possibility of forming the grand coalition is discussed in Majumder & Srinivasan (2006, Section 5).) Furthermore, the values have a symmetric property in that all members other than the retailer n are indifferent regardless of their positions, as long as they have identical costs. These properties characterize our games and play an important role in a later analysis.

In what follows, we illustrate our values of the coalitions with a simple example.

In this section, we analyze the core, Shapley value, and nucleolus of our games formulated in the previous section in order to investigate fair profit allocation under the grand coalition. First, we introduce the definitions of these terms; however, for details, please see a standard textbook on cooperative game theory, such as Myerson (1996).

First, the core of a game is the set of all payoff vectors

In words, the core is the set of payoff allocations of 
                        
                           v
                           (
                           N
                           )
                        
                      that satisfies coalitional rationality, where for every coalition S, the total payoff among members in S is no less than the value of coalition 
                        
                           v
                           (
                           S
                           )
                        
                     . That is, if every member gains a core allocation, they have no incentive to deviate from the grand coalition through any coalition, which ensures the stability of the grand coalition. However, note that the core is a set that can be empty, while it can also include numerous allocations. Therefore, it is useful to consider some rational allocation rule that can always determine the payoff allocation uniquely rather than considering a set of solutions. Among such rules, consideration of the Shapley value and/or the nucleolus is the best-known way.

Specifically, the definition of Shapley value is given as follows. For the coalitional form game 
                        
                           (

                     where s is the number of members in S. In addition, we define 
                        
                           v
                           (
                           ϕ
                           )

                           0
                        
                      for the empty set.

As seen in Eq. (8), the Shapley value can be interpreted as the average of marginal contributions to the formation of the grand coalition. The payoff is allocated to each member in proportion to the degree of contribution to the formation of the grand coalition. More specifically, given a particular path to the grand coalition, that is, an order of adding players, the marginal contribution of each player i is defined as the marginal worth of i for joining the coalition. Then, the Shapley value can be obtained by taking the average of marginal contributions over all possible 
                        
                           n
                           !
                        
                      paths to forming the grand coalition. Therefore, by calculating the Shapley value, we can find a fair allocation among players under the grand coalition, based on the evaluation of the power of each player for forming the grand coalition.

We should note that the Shapley value need not satisfy the individual and coalitional rationalities even if the core is non-empty, which implies that it does not become a stable allocation if it is not in the core. In contrast, the nucleolus is well-known as a stable allocation, since it is ensured to necessarily be in the core if the game has a core.

Specifically, the definition of the nucleolus is given as follows. For any imputation 
                        
                           x

                     , the unique imputation of the game that minimizes the excess under the lexicographic order.

In Section 4.1, we analyze the core, and in the subsequent subsections, we focus on the Shapley value and the nucleolus for the game with non-empty core.

We immediately obtain the following clear results about the existence of the core.

                              The core of game

                              is always empty. In contrast, the core of game

                              is always non-empty.
                           

This theorem shows that in game

                        , where we suppose pessimistic members who expect that they cannot become the leader after any deviation from the grand coalition, the core allocation always exists. In contrast, however, we also have that in game 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    G
                                 
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                              
                           
                        , where we suppose optimistic members who expect that they can become the leader after any deviation, the core is always empty. More precisely, as explained in Section 3, game 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    G
                                 
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                              
                           
                         is inessential and thus does not have even an imputation set. As shown in Majumder and Srinivasan (2006), in game 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    G
                                 
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                              
                           
                        , a deviating coalition as the first mover can always obtain a higher profit even if it is a unilateral deviation. Therefore, each member has an incentive for the deviation, which is so high that the sum of profit allocations that can prevent the unilateral deviation exceeds the grand coalition’s profit. In contrast, in game 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    G
                                 
                                 
                                    B
                                 
                              
                           
                        , the most any member can obtain from any deviation is a gain of the second mover. Hence, members have a lower incentive for a deviation and thus the sum of profit allocations that can prevent the unilateral deviation does not exceed the grand coalition’s profit. Furthermore, under our scenario where all non-deviating members keep their coalition, there is almost no difference between the deviation by a single member and that by any group in the sense that the resulting profits are equal as the equilibrium profit of the two-person Stackelberg game, although there is some difference between their costs. This implies that the merit of any coalitional deviation vanishes, which indicates that any profit allocation satisfying individual rationality is a core allocation (

Indeed, the analyses of both the Shapley value and the nucleolus derive the same conclusion, although the logic underlying each result is slightly different. That is, part (a) of both Theorems 4.1-(1) and 4.2-(2) means that the Shapley value as well as the profit in the nucleolus are higher for a member who has a higher cost. This result might seem to be un-intuitive, since a more inefficient member in terms of the cost structure is treated well. However, in fact, any coalition benefits more from adding a member with a higher cost, since the effect of solving the double marginalization is relatively high. This is because a coalition including such a member can gain a higher margin, which in turn indicates that the coalition without him/her suffers from higher double marginalization. Under our model of a wholesale price contract, the merit of vertical integration is to entirely eliminate double marginalization. Therefore, it is acceptable that a member who contributes more to this elimination is well treated, resulting in a higher Shapley value. Further, since the value of the coalition itself is relatively high when it includes a member with a higher cost because of gaining a higher margin, the profit should be allocated more to such a member for the grand coalition to be stable, which leads to a higher allocation in the nucleolus. Next, part (b) also implies that the retailer has a strong influence on achieving stable vertical integration. This is because under the situation where the game is reduced to one between two coalitions including and excluding the retailer, the retailer always can gain some margin regardless of the order of decision, since it necessarily can set the monopoly price for the final product. Therefore, the retailer also always obtains a higher marginal contribution, as well as contributes to a higher value of the coalition.

In Table 1

                              n

                        , the Shapley value is always a core allocation, while for the case of 
                           
                              n

                              i
                              }
                              )
                              >
                              0
                           
                        ). This implies that in the Shapley value, the grand coalition’s profit must be allocated to every member to some extent, even to a member whose value of the individual coalition is zero. Therefore, if there are enough such members (i.e., members who have no cost, other than the retailer), the total of such “excess” can be sufficient to prevent the Shapley value from belonging to the core.

In the analysis of the Shapley value and the nucleolus in the previous section, we reach a conclusion that regardless of the leadership position, the members who exert a stronger power for vertical integration are the members incurring higher costs and the retailer. Hence, this implies that although the retailer always has a stronger influence, the power of the upstream manufacturer becomes relatively weaker, unless it is the fixed leader or it has a higher cost. However, both these conditions seem to be unrealistic. The rapid changes in the business environment may result in the contract leader being changed, as explained in the introduction section. In contrast, it is usual that technological progress can resolve some inefficiency, resulting in a decrease in cost. Therefore, we have one simple question: given such circumstances, under which conditions can the upstream manufacturer be in a beneficial position in a grand coalition? Finding the answer to this question might help the decision-making process of manufacturers who suffer from power shifts to retailers. Based on this motivation, we extend our model of a serial chain to a simple case where there are multiple monopolistic retailers, while there is only one manufacturer. For expositional simplicity, we do not consider middlemen, which implies that the supply chain consists of two tiers. In addition to Guardiola et al. (2007) introduced in Section 2, Tyagi (1999) employs a similar setting to ours. However, he also assumes that the manufacturer is always the Stackelberg leader. In addition, he considers a Cournot competition among retailers in a homogeneous good market. With this structure, we focus on the analysis of the Shapley value and the nucleolus, which are of most interest to us.

We consider a two-tier supply chain with one manufacturer (indexed as 0) and n retailers (indexed as

                        That is, the cost of the manufacturer is additive over retailers, implying that there is neither a scale economy nor a diseconomy. In fact, this assumption would be appropriately realistic for cases of sales to regional monopoly retailers under the existence of transportation and/or holding costs. Finally, the inverse demand function of the final products is identical for all retailers and is given as follows:

In this subsection, we focus on the difference between the fair profit allocations to the manufacturer and to the retailers. To do this, we should clarify the existence of the core in games

The first part of this theorem is straightforward because the demand and cost structures are symmetric across all retailers. The second part of the theorem shows that both the Shapley value and the profit allocation in the nucleolus of the manufacturer monotonically increase in the number of retailers, while those for retailers stay constant. The reason why these allocations to retailers stay constant is as follows: independent demands and costs imply the simple “star” network, where the manufacturer has bilateral relations with each retailer. Therefore, even if some retailers form a coalition, any synergy effect does not occur, which implies that the marginal contribution of each retailer is constant in the number of retailers included in the coalition. On the other hand, even if a retailer joins to a coalition including the manufacturer, each retailer can contribute only to eliminating double marginalization with regard to the bilateral link between this retailer and the manufacturer. Therefore, the marginal contribution of a retailer is also independent of the timing of joining to a coalition. In contrast, the marginal contribution of the manufacturer is increasing in the number of retailers included in the coalition, since the manufacturer can at once resolve double marginalization with regard to multiple links with those retailers. Hence, the Shapley value, which is the average marginal contribution, is increasing in n only for the manufacturer. On the other hand, under the network consisting of the collection of bilateral links, the nucleolus is clearly obtained as the sum of profit allocations in the nucleoli over those links. Specifically, if we consider the case of single retailer (
                           
                              n

                        ), then it is obvious that the profit allocations in the nucleolus for the manufacturer and the retailer are given by

Therefore, it follows that the power of the manufacturer relative to the retailers is increasing in the number of retailers. In fact, the third part of the theorem calculates the number of retailers such that the relationship between the fair profit allocations to the manufacturer and the retailers are reversed. As proved in the previous section, in a serial supply chain with symmetric costs, these allocations to the retailers are always higher than those to the manufacturer. Indeed, this is consistent with the result of

                        . However, Theorem 5.2 also shows that the threshold level is less than 2, which implies that the Shapley value and the profit allocation in the nucleolus of the retailers become higher than those of the manufacturer only under a serial supply chain.

                         monotonically decrease in the cost parameter k. This implies that as the cost is increasing, the minimum number of retailers such that the fair allocation to the manufacturer exceeds those of the retailers is decreasing. As observed in the previous section, the effect of vertical integration on the elimination of double marginalization is significant under higher costs. This result implies that under the existence of multiple retailers, the manufacturer has a higher contribution to this elimination, relative to the retailers.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we discuss vertical integration in light of the contract leadership position in supply chains by a normative approach. Although there are many works on vertical integration in two-tier supply chains, vertical integration in multi-tier supply chains has received little attention. In addition, we can find many real-world examples of a variety of leadership positions and rapid changes therein. Motivated by such examples, we investigate stable and fair profit allocations among members under vertical integration in a serial supply chain by utilizing cooperative game theory. From our model analysis, we obtain the following.

Regarding the stability of vertical integration, there exist core allocations in the case where all members are pessimistic in the sense that they are certain that they will not become the contract leader after any coalitional deviation from the grand coalition. In contrast, in the case where they are optimistic in the sense that they are sure they will become the leader, the core is always empty, which implies that integration is unstable. These results suggest that vertical integration is likely to break up in situations where all or some members decide to take contract leadership.

We also obtain some insights about fair allocations under vertical integration using the analyses of the Shapley value and the nucleolus, which are fortunately the same under the two different allocation rules. That is, when all members expect that the leadership position may change after integration, the retailer and members who have higher costs have relatively strong power, and as such, more of the grand coalition’s profit should be allocated to them. This result suggests that under situations facing a variable leadership and rapid cost improvements due to technological advances, the retailer is likely to be in a much more beneficial position under vertical integration; however, for the upstream manufacturer, this is not necessarily so. In this regard, our other analysis shows that even under such conditions, the upstream manufacturer can have relatively strong power if it can sell its product to multiple monopolistic retailers. In other words, forming a coalition with multiple retailers is one of the keys for the manufacturer to have a stronger influence on realizing stable vertical integration.

These results would give us some new managerial insights regarding strategic vertical integrations in real-world supply chains. For instance, regarding the example of the supply chain for providing e-books introduced in Section 1, which motivates our study, we might be able to explain why Amazon.com and Macmillan failed to agree on continuing their cooperation, resulting in the coalition breaking up. That is, it seems that both companies might have believed to have stronger power as the leader under vertical integration. Our result suggests that with such optimistic players, vertical integration cannot be stably maintained. However, our result also shows that integration among pessimistic players can be stable. In this sense, it might be reasonable that Amazon finally softened its attitude by taking into account the counterpart’s increasing power in the market, which led to a compromise. Although most executives of companies in supply chains well understand the efficiency of vertical integration, they might have concerns regarding profit allocation among members under vertical integration. From our investigation, we now have an implication for this: when it is expected that the contract leader in a supply chain can change, it is important for each member not to determine to take the contract leadership. In addition, regarding profit allocation, we clarify who should be allocated more profit.

Finally, we should note that some of our results largely depend on the assumptions employed in our study. For example, while our model assumed increasing marginal costs, we might have another cost structure that significantly alters the results. As Majumder and Srinivasan (2006) pointed out, our basic Stackelberg framework does not make sense under a serial chain with constant or diminishing cost structures, without any additional setup. However, in multiple retailer cases employed in Section 5, it might be meaningful to consider some economies of scale arising from cooperation among retailers, as Guardiola et al. (2007) discussed. In contrast, in this study, we assumed a serial monopolistic supply chain where there is one member in each tier. However, it would be interesting to consider the case of a serial chain where there is a competitive tier with horizontal competition among several members and the case of horizontal competition among several serial chains, as explored in some papers (Tyagi, 1999; Corbett & Karmarker, 2001; Carr & Karmarker, 2005; Majumder & Srinivasan, 2008, and so on). In addition, more importantly, we should note that for formulating our problem as an n-person coalitional form game, we employed some restrictive assumptions on how to define the values of the coalitions. As precisely explained in Section 3, at least in the manner employed in the related literature, we are sure that these assumptions can be justified to some extent. However, it is not clear whether or not even a slight change in the assumptions might significantly alter some of our results. For example, our study discussed two extreme cases regarding how the remaining members react to a deviation by some members from the grand coalition. Clearly, though rather complicated, other intermediate coalition structures can be considered. In this regard, however, it should be noted that how to justify the values of the coalitions is a harder task beyond the problem of vertical integration. This is left as an open problem in game theory as a topic of coalition formation in the presence of an externality, including its applications to horizontal mergers, provision of public goods, and so on. Nevertheless, we are sure that our study could provide the first framework of model analysis in the area of vertical integration, which requires further investigation in the future.
