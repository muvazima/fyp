@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The ultrasonic cutting technique is widely used throughout industry for the processing of high hardness and high strength materials which cannot be easily machined using traditional methods. However, the ultrasonic machining system is subject to significant vibration as a result of geometric effects, the material properties, the loading characteristics, and so forth. The deleterious effects of unwanted vibration can be mitigated by incorporating polymeric materials with enhanced stiffness and damping properties into the system structure [1–2]. However, despite the use of such materials, the cutting system invariably exhibits a complex nonlinear dynamic behavior characterized by jump phenomena, period-multiplying bifurcations, and chaotic motion [3–4]. In practice, vibration may have a significant effect on the quality (dimensional tolerance and surface roughness) of the machined component. Consequently, a detailed understanding of the ultrasonic system response under given excitation frequencies and driving forces is required.

The Duffing oscillator provides a convenient approach for modeling a wide variety of physical processes. It was shown in [5] that the oscillator system contains significant nonlinear hardening and softening effects. Moreover, Ueda [6] showed that systems governed by Duffing's equation exhibit steady state chaotic behavior and randomly transitional phenomena in certain parameter regimes. Nayfeh and Sanchez [7] presented a method based on Floquet theory for generating the bifurcation diagram for forced softening Duffing systems. Soliman [8] showed that for small excitation levels, hardening systems exhibit an apparently linear behavior. However, for high excitation levels, the behavior becomes nonlinear and unpredictable jumps to and from resonance occur. Aurelle et al. [9] used a two-degree-of-freedom coupled Duffing oscillator model to examine the nonlinear behavior of an ultrasonic transducer when excited at a frequency close to its resonance frequency. The results showed that the overall nonlinear response of the system was significantly dependent on the softening stiffness.

For nonlinear behaviors, chaotic motion exists in various physical system including mechanical engineering system, chemistry and biochemistry, Belousov–Zhabotinsky system, the Rössler system, Bray–Liebhafsky reaction system, and Electronics Chua's circuit etc. [10–13]. Lim et al. [14] investigated the vibration behavior of an ultrasonic cutting system, and showed that chaotic motion occurred for excitation accelerations less than a certain critical value.

In this paper, the coupling effect of nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratio (softening cubic stiffness coefficient over hardening cubic stiffness coefficient) is studied and it integrates the influence of softening and hardening for ultrasonic cutting system. The differential transformation methods (DTM) are used to solve the governing equations of the ultrasonic vibration cutting system. For the accuracy of numerical simulation, Botella et al. [15] proposed a complete quantization study of neuromorphic robust optical flow architecture using properties found in the cortical motion pathway and presented a useful framework for building bio-inspired systems in real-time environments, reducing computational complexity. Also, an extensive study is performed to avoid compromising the viability and the robustness. The presented architecture is customizable and adaptable, while emulating several neuromorphic properties, such as the use of several information channels of small bit width, which is the nature of the brain. However, most existing analyses of quantization effects are given under the condition that all decision-making blocks, if exist in a system, produce identical decisions in both fixed-point and infinite-precision (IP) implementations. Shi and Brodersen [16] had extended FFC (floating-point to fixed-point conversion) methodology to include decision making blocks and decision errors due to quantization. Hoffman et al. [17] used field programmable gate arrays and fixed-point numbers for hardware synthesis of artificial neural networks and a significantly sized artificial neural network for the classic character recognition problem has been synthesized for FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) hardware and simulated. Meyer-Bäse et al. [18] determined conditions that ensure the existence of the exponentially mean-square stability equilibria of the stochastic nonlinear system. It is assumed that the system is described by Ito-type equations. A Lyapunov function for the coupled system and an upper bound for the parameters of the independent stochastic process is derived. For ultrasonic cutting system, the DTM and Runge–Kutta method are used to compare and confirm the accuracy of computational values.

For the physical phenomenon of ultrasonic cutting system, the phase portraits, Poincaré maps, power spectra, bifurcation diagrams, and maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) are used to analyze the dynamic behavior. The investigation results show that dynamic behavior include quasi-periodic, periodic and chaotic motions under different operating conditions, and also found that non-synchronized effect can be used as the design basis for subsequent processing.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Duffing oscillator model of the ultrasonic cutting system and describes the use of the DTM method in solving the governing equations. Section 3 validates the DTM solution procedure and analyzes the dynamic behavior of the ultrasonic cutting system as a function of the nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratio and excitation force. Finally, Section 4 provides some brief concluding remarks.

Differential transformation is one of the most widely used of all techniques for solving differential equations due to its rapid rate of convergence and its minimal computational error. Furthermore, compared to the integral transformation approach, differential transformation has the further advantage that it can be used to solve nonlinear differential equations.

In this paper, the differential transformation method [19–21] is used to solve Eqs. (6–9), and also can be applied other numerical methods such as Adomian decomposition method (ADM), the variational iteration method (VIM) and the homotopy perturbation method (HPM) [22–30] to calculate the governing equations.

For the ultrasonic cutting system in this study, the system model is transformed by DTM with respect to the time domain t, and hence Eqs. (6–9) become

                         compares the solutions obtained from the DTM method for the system orbit with those obtained from the third-order Runge–Kutta method (RKM) given two different values of the nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratio (η). It is observed that the DTM results agree with those of the RKM method to four decimal places for both values of η. In other words, the basic validity of the DTM solution procedure is confirmed.


                        Table 2
                         shows the DTM results for the system orbits given two values of the cubic stiffness coefficient ratio (η = 1.2471 and 1.12) and time step intervals in the range of π/300 ∼ π/4800. It is seen that for time steps ranging from π/300 to π/2400, the solutions are insensitive to the time step interval. However, for a smaller step size of π/4800, the accuracy and stability of the numerical results are degraded. Thus, in the remaining simulations, the time step was assigned a constant value of π/600.

                        (a)−2(e) show the DTM results for the phase portraits of the ultrasonic cutting system given nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratios of η = 0.003, 0.006, 0.6245, 1.247 and 1.65, respectively. For η = 0.003 and 1.65, the system exhibits non-periodic and non-symmetric unsteady motions, respectively (Figs. 2a and e). However, for η = 0.006, 0.6245 and 1.247, the system performs stable periodic motion (Figs. 2b−2d). The dependence of the system behavior on the nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratio is confirmed by the power spectra results presented in Fig. 3. (3.1−3.5).

                         both perform unsteady nonlinear motion for all considered values of η. The non-periodic behavior is particularly apparent at lower values of η. Hence, it is inferred that a larger hardening cubic stiffness coefficient ratio increases the severity of the unsteady behavior. For an excitation force of

In other words, for excitation forces in the range of 0.1 ∼ 1.0, the system performs stable vibration over the cubic stiffness coefficient ratio range of 0.2 < η < 2.0.

Hence, if the ultrasonic cutting system is to perform stable and synchronized vibration, the excitation force should be assigned a value of 2.0 and the nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratio should be limited to the range of 0.006 ≦ η < 1.248.

                        2 behaves periodically at η = 0.003 and 1.0, but chaotically at η = 1.248, 1.47 and 1.65. The dynamic behaviors of x
                        2 are summarized in Table 4
                        . In general, the results confirm that x

The Lyapunov exponent is used to prove the occurrence of chaos. As the exponent becomes smaller than, or approaches zero, the system behaves in steady and periodic motion. However, when it is greater than zero, the system is unstable and chaos occurs. Figs. 10(a)−10(d) show the maximum Lyapunov exponent plots of the ultrasonic cutting system given nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratios of η = 0.003, 0.006, 1.248 and 1.65, respectively. Forη = 0.003 and 0.006, the MLE for x
                        1 is negative and approaches zero. In other words, the system performs stable motion. However, for η = 1.248 and 1.65, the MLE has a value greater than zero. Hence, the system performs non-periodic motion characterized by chaos and instability.

In this paper, differential transformation method is applied for system numerical analysis and obtained the orbits of x
                        1 and x
                        2 correctly. Then, the power spectra, Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams, and MLE are used to distinguish the nonlinear behavior. Also, the proper time step size is chosen as π/600 for DTM to decrease calculation time without using smaller time increment shown in Table 5.
                        
                     


                        Table 5 compares the MLE values of the solutions obtained by the DTM method using two different time step sizes with the equivalent results obtained from three Runge–Kutta methods (i.e., 3rd, 4th and 5th order, respectively). Note that the nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratio has a value ofη = 0.006 in every case and Ω and 
                           
                              F

                         are assigned values of 3.0 and 2.0, respectively. The computation times of the various methods are also presented for comparison purposes. It is seen that for all four methods, the MLE has a negative value and is close to zero. In other words, the results confirm that the system performs periodic motion for η = 0.006. Notably, the results also show that the MLE solutions are insensitive to the time step size. However, as expected, the calculation time increases with a decreasing step size for all four methods.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This study has investigated the nonlinear vibration characteristics of an ultrasonic cutting system as a function of the nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratio η. The governing equations of the system have been solved in the time domain using the DTM method. Moreover, the motion behavior of the system has been examined by means of phase portraits, power spectra, Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams, and the maximum Lyapunov exponent. In general, the results have shown that the system performs periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic motion, depending on the system conditions. For a small excitation force (
                        
                           F
                           ˜
                        
                      = 1.14 × 10−3), nonlinear motion occurs for all values of η in the range of 0 ∼ 2.0. The nonlinear behavior is particularly evident at smaller values of η. Hence, it is inferred that under low excitation forces, the dynamic response of the system is dominated by the hardening cubic stiffness coefficient. For 
                        
                           F
                           ˜
                        
                      = 0.1, unstable behavior occurs over a more restricted stiffness coefficient ratio range of 0 ≦ η < 0.2. As 
                        
                           F
                           ˜
                        
                      is further increased to 1.0, the region of unstable behavior is further narrowed, while that of periodic behavior is broadened. Thus, for all excitation forces in the range of 0.1–1.0, stable vibration is obtained over the nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratio interval of 0.2 < η < 2.0. The bifurcation diagrams for x
                     1 and x
                     2 have shown that the system performs synchronized vibration over the nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratio interval of 0.006 ≦ η ≦ 2.0 at 
                        
                           F
                           ˜
                        
                      = 1.14 × 10−3 and 2.0, but non-synchronized vibration at 
                        
                           F
                           ˜
                        
                      = 0.1 and 1.0, respectively. Overall, the results show that to ensure stable and synchronized vibration of the ultrasonic cutting system, the excitation force should be set to 2.0 and the nonlinear cubic stiffness coefficient ratio limited to the range of 0.006 ≦ η < 1.248.

In order to accelerate the rate of convergence and improve the accuracy of the calculations, the overall t domain can be split into a number of sub-domains. The differential equation can then be solved in each domain.

The approach described above is used to split the time domain into a total of n sub-domains, as shown in Fig. A.1
                     . Considering function x(t) in the first sub-domain (0 ≤ t ≤ t
                     1,t
                     0 = 0), the one-dimensional differential transformation is given by:

                      and A.2

If f(t) and g(t) are two uncorrelated functions of t, and F(k), G(k) are the corresponding transformation functions, respectively, then the basic properties of the differential transformation are as follows:

                              2 are independent of t and k, then
