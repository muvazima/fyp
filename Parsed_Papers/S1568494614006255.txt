                  This work illustrates the use of a multi-objective optimization approach to model and optimize the performance of a simple thermoacoustic engine. System parameters and constraints that capture the underlying thermoacoustic dynamics have been used to define the model. Work output, viscous loss, conductive heat loss, convective heat loss and radiative heat loss have been used to measure the performance of the engine. The optimization task is formulated as a five-criterion mixed-integer non-linear programming problem. Since we optimize multiple objectives simultaneously, each objective component has been given a weighting factor to provide appropriate user-defined emphasis. A practical example is given to illustrate the approach. We have determined a design statement of a stack describing how the design would change if emphasis is given to one objective in particular. We also considered optimization of multiple objectives components simultaneously and identify global optimal solutions describing the stack geometry using the augmented É›-constraint method. This approach has been implemented in GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System).
