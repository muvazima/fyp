                  Evolutionary algorithms are one of the most common choices reported in the literature for the tuning of fuzzy logic controllers based on either type-1 or type-2 fuzzy systems. An alternative to evolutionary algorithms is the simple tuning algorithm (STA-FLC), which is a methodology designed to improve the response of type-1 fuzzy logic controllers in a practical, intuitive and simple ways. This paper presents an extension of the simple tuning algorithm for fuzzy logic controllers based on the theory of type-2 fuzzy systems by using a parallel model implementation, it also includes a mechanism to calculate the feedback gain, new integral criteria parameters, and the effect of the AND/OR operator combinations on the fuzzy rules to improve the algorithm applicability and performance. All these improvements are demonstrated with experiments applied to different types of plants.
