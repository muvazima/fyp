                  Using state-of-the-art frontier efficiency methodologies, we study the efficiency and productivity of Swiss insurance companies in the life, property/casualty, and reinsurance sectors from 1997–2013. In this context, we provide the first empirical analysis of internationalization strategies of insurance companies, a topic of high interest in the business and economics literature, but one that has to date not been the focus of efficiency studies in the insurance sector. We find that productivity and efficiency have improved with regard to property/casualty and reinsurance. In the case of life insurance, productivity and efficiency diminished; however, life insurance firms with higher levels of international business exhibit superior efficiency levels. We observe that diversification strategies directed to the European market are more beneficial compared to those targeting markets outside of Europe.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

As has happened in many other industrialized countries, the Swiss insurance market has undergone major changes over the last 20 years. Deregulation of financial services in the 1990s led to increased competition and internationalization of the insurance business. Capital market conditions changed substantially in a similar manner. Due to historically low interest rates, previously common strategies of significant “safe” bond holdings with long-term maturity and high interest rates were rendered problematic as bonds that came to term had to be replaced by such with much lower interest rates. Moreover, changing supervisory and legal frameworks, such as the Swiss Solvency Test introduced in 2006, resulted in the establishment of integrated risk management systems within the insurance companies.

This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the efficiency and productivity development in Switzerland during this period of major changes. Efficiency measurement is one of the fastest growing areas in the business and economics literature and the insurance sector has seen particularly high growth in the number of studies applying efficiency methods (see Eling & Luhnen, 2010a for a review). The Swiss insurance industry, however, has been the subject of relatively little research in this context; to date, it has been considered only in a cross-country context, yielding ambiguous results.

                        1
                        A number of cross-country comparisons include Switzerland, but none take a detailed look at the Swiss situation. For example, there is no analysis of efficiency determinants in the Swiss insurance market. Moreover, the existing empirical results for Switzerland are very mixed, i.e., low, average, and high efficiencies are observed, providing no clear indication of productivity development in the Swiss insurance market. Thus, one of the goals of this paper is to provide clearer insight into the productivity situation in Switzerland. In Online-Appendix A we summarize the extant empirical evidence for Switzerland.
                     
                     
                  

Our study provides sharper insight into the level and determinants of efficiency in the Swiss insurance industry. But for two reasons the importance and scope of the paper stretches beyond the borders of Switzerland. First, while most efficiency studies are restricted to one sector and a relatively short time period, our dataset covers a long time period and all subsectors
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        On average, efficiency studies in the insurance sector analyze a time period of 7 years (see Eling & Luhnen, 2010a); we consider a time period of 17 years. About 67 percent of all efficiency studies only look at life, non-life, or specifically at property/casualty (Eling & Luhnen, 2010a); only one study looks at reinsurance separately (Cummins & Weiss, 2002). We analyze all these subsectors individually.
                      of a market that is representative of many insurance markets in terms of development and penetration.
                        3
                     
                     
                        3
                        According to Swiss Re (2013), the Swiss insurance market ranks seventh in Europe (17th in the world), with premium volume of USD 61 billion in 2012. Moreover, in 2012 it ranked first regarding insurance density in Europe (second in the world), with USD 7604 premiums per capita, and fifth regarding insurance penetration in Europe (13th in the world), with premiums to GDP of 9.63 percent (see AXCO, 2013).
                      The dataset thus provides an opportunity to compare and cross-check findings from other countries, across different time periods, and across different subsectors.
                        4
                     
                     
                        4
                        To our knowledge, we are the first to systematically test the robustness of the efficiency results across subperiods (before the first crisis, i.e., 1997–2001, between the two crises, i.e., 2002–2007, and for 2008–2013) and across all subsectors of the industry. In addition, we also distinguish our work from the existing literature with a systematic analysis of nonlinear relationships and interaction effects, all of which provide useful insight into the nature of efficiency in the insurance sector. We thus contribute to the growing number of innovative DEA applications, e.g., the inclusion of uncontrollable variables (see Huang & Eling, 2013; Yang & Pollitt, 2009), two-stage bootstrapping procedures (see Barros, Nektarios, & Assaf, 2010), relational two-stage DEA modeling (see Kao & Hwang, 2008, 2014), and cross-frontier analysis (see Biener & Eling, 2012).
                      Second, the data allows us to investigate the internationalization strategies of insurance companies, an issue of high interest in the business and economics literature, but one that has not to date been the focus of efficiency studies in the insurance sector. Switzerland is a persuasive context in which to analyze internationalization strategies, since numerous Swiss insurers are active outside Switzerland, to such an extent that 67 percent of the Swiss premium volume is earned abroad (see Swiss Insurance Association, 2014) – a value substantially higher than in other countries (see, e.g., Altuntas & Gößmann, 2012; Theis & Wolgast, 2010).

Our results show best practice technology improvements for Swiss property/casualty (p/c) and reinsurance firms, whereas for life insurance we observe an overall productivity decrease. Our findings suggest that the internationalization of the Swiss insurance business has a positive impact on life insurer efficiency, but not for p/c. In addition, we observe that entering the non-European market for Swiss life and p/c insurers is not as beneficial as entering into European markets. Moreover, we validate findings from other efficiency studies.
                        5
                     
                     
                        5
                        That is, for different subsectors and across a long time period we find that increasing the size of operation increases efficiency in life, p/c, and reinsurance (e.g., in line with Cummins & Zi, 1998). On organizational form, we reject the expense preference hypothesis (e.g., in line with Eling & Luhnen, 2010b, or Biener & Eling, 2012). We show that high debt ratios are detrimental for efficiency (e.g., in line with Luhnen, 2009).
                      The results are useful for academics, insurance company managers, regulators, and policymakers seeking to better understand market structure and firm performance.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows. In Section 2 we review the relevant literature on efficiency measurement and develop our hypotheses. The methodology and data are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the empirical results, separately for life, p/c, and reinsurance. Section 5 concludes.

We test four main hypotheses, which we summarize in Table 1, and include further “classical” variables (i.e., organizational form, leverage, premium growth, and company age) as control variables in the later analysis, for which we do not state specific hypotheses.

Deregulation and internationalization of the financial services industry, in conjunction with widespread economic changes such as low interest rates, have created significant competitive pressure for Swiss insurers. More competitive markets have forced the exit of those firms not able to adapt to state-of-the-art technology, especially because bad underwriting can no longer be compensated by high capital market returns. The observed changes in the last 20 years thus give reason to expect an increase in both productivity and efficiency (i.e., average productivity relative to the best firms in the industry).

Productivity changes over time for the Swiss market are analyzed by Donni and Fecher (1997) in a cross-country sample. Small improvements of +1.00 percent p.a. for Switzerland are found over the period 1983–1991, while the sample's average annual productivity change amounts to +5.50 percent p.a. The Swiss improvement is the smallest among all analyzed countries. The authors indicate that the improvement is mostly due to best practice technology progress. Focusing on productivity growth in five European insurance markets (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), Bertoni and Croce (2011) investigate the main causes of productivity changes in life insurance for 1997–2004. Overall, they observe a significant TFP increase of, on average, 6.71 percent p.a. that is mostly due to best practice technology progress (on average +6.67 percent p.a.) and only partly accounted for by technical adoption (on average +0.04 percent p.a.). These authors, too, indicate that, in the observed countries, more technical progress occurred in the best practices firms, whereas the average insurer was not able to catch up.

                           6
                           Other studies examine the development of efficiency and productivity for other European markets such as Germany and the United Kingdom, and the U.S. market. For the German market, Luhnen (2009) finds an increase of productivity in the German property/liability market of about 8.20 percent over the period 1995–2006. The analysis shows that technological progress (+7.90 percent) is the main driver of this development. Hussels and Ward (2007) analyze German and U.K. life insurers for the period 1991–2002 and find small TFP changes over the whole period (+2.60 percent for Germany, –1.90 percent for the United Kingdom), which again are mainly accounted for by technical progress (Germany), and negative technical efficiency change (United Kingdom). Many other markets have been studied with regard to their TFP improvements for several time horizons, most of which find moderate productivity increase over time (see Fecher, Kessler, Perelman, & Pestieau, 1993 for France; Cummins, Turchetti, & Weiss, 1996 for Italy; Mahlberg & Url, 2003 and Ennsfellner, Lewis, & Anderson, 2004 for Austria; Barros, Barroso, & Borges, 2005 for Portugal; Cummins & Rubio-Misas, 2006 for Spain; Bikker & van Leuvensteijn, 2008 for the Netherlands; and Cummins & Xie, 2008 for the United States).
                         Following the above line of reasoning and the existing empirical results, we expect that (hypothesis H1) efficiency and productivity in the Swiss insurance market will have increased over the sample period 1997–2013. From a theoretical point of view one might expect the productivity increase to be driven by best practice adoption—that is, less productive companies either improve productivity or leave the market—but the empirical literature for Europe indicates that improvements are more driven by technology progress.

The European insurance market was deregulated in 1994, with the main purpose being to create a single insurance market in the European Union and thus improve the industry's competitiveness and efficiency. Opening the market increased both competition within countries and cross-border activity.

                           7
                           When analyzing efficiency development after 1994, several studies document that the deregulation influenced efficiency of European insurers. See, e.g., Cummins and Rubio-Misas (2006), Hussels and Ward (2007), Davutyan and Klumpes (2008), Bertoni and Croce (2011), and Vencappa, Fenn, and Diacon (2013).
                         Switzerland is integrated into the European environment via bilateral agreements with the European Union. The simplified access to new markets provides significant expansion opportunities, especially for firms from countries with superior insurance market performance, whereas, at the same time competition from foreign firms in home markets requires more effort to retain competitive advantage. Numerous Swiss insurers are active outside Switzerland, to such an extent that 67 percent of Swiss premium volume is earned abroad (see Swiss Insurance Association, 2014); likewise, large international insurers have branches in Switzerland. Concurrently, there are several successful firms that exclusively serve the Swiss market. Switzerland is thus an interesting case for an analysis of the relationship between international diversification and efficiency in insurance markets.

International diversification is extensively researched in the strategic management and international business literature (see, e.g., Capar & Kotabe, 2003; Hitt, Tihanyi, Miller, & Connelly, 2006). From a theoretical standpoint, international diversification is driven by economies of scale, access to new resources, average cost reduction, extension of innovative capabilities, knowledge acquisition, location advantages, and access to foreign markets (see Hitt et al., 2006), all of which imply that there should be a positive relationship between international diversification and firm performance. However, complexity and cost of coordination, especially for large foreign operations, and cultural differences between the home and the foreign markets (the so-called liability of foreignness) are viewed as major barriers to successful international diversification (see Hitt, Hoskisson, & Kim, 1997; Hitt et al., 2006; Zaheer, 1995). These diverse theories, on how international diversification influences firm performance, are reflected in empirical work (see, e.g., Hitt et al., 2006, for a review of the empirical literature). The conflicting findings of this research have resulted in the development of alternative models that incorporate the costs as well as the benefits of international diversification, for example, assuming u-shaped (see, e.g., Capar & Kotabe, 2003; Ruigrok & Wagner, 2003), inverse u-shaped (see, e.g., Hitt et al., 1997; Kotabe, Srinivasan, & Aulakh, 2002), and s-shaped (see, e.g., Lu & Beamish, 2004) relationships. There is no research on how international diversification impacts efficiency in insurance markets. The only study that is somewhat related (Altuntas & Gößmann, 2012), although it focuses on return on assets and not efficiency, finds a positive impact of German insurers’ international diversification on home market performance.

                           8
                           A study by Katrishen and Scordis (1998) focuses on the impact of international diversification on achieving economies of scale in a cross-country study for the years 1985–1992. The authors find decreasing economies of scale with increasing international diversification. Berry-Stölzle, Hoyt, and Wende (2010) analyze business strategies for insurers entering and growing in emerging markets and find that successful strategies involve a high growth rate, increased size, and more emphasis on life insurance. Moreover, lower financial leverage and mutual organizational form are associated with better performance. All these effects are also measured by our analysis. Another work of interest in relation to ours is Buch et al. (2014), who discuss productivity and internationalization decisions in the banking sector.
                        
                     

Based on this first piece of evidence, we expect (hypothesis H2) a positive relationship between the level of international diversification and insurer efficiency. Note that the discussion of internationalization in this paper is limited to life and p/c insurers. The business model of reinsurance is to diversify risks globally, which is why every reinsurer by definition is internationally diversified; we thus cannot analyze variation in the degree of internationalization across reinsurance companies.

Most studies find that there is a positive relation between size and efficiency. Expectation for increased efficiency from an increase in firm size, however, is only reasonable among firms operating under increasing returns to scale (see Cummins & Rubio-Misas, 2006). Those firms, mostly small or mid-sized companies that often represent the majority of data samples in empirical analyses can leverage significant scale advantages. Scale advantages result from average per unit output cost reductions when the volume of output increases. The most frequently discussed source of scale economies is the spreading of a firm's fixed production costs, such as computer systems and financial capital, over a larger volume of output. Similarly, scale economies may arise from the learning effects gained by managers operating at larger scale. In addition, in the insurance sector it is usually assumed that a larger scale of operation reduces income volatility, since risk pooling is more effective (see Cummins & Rubio-Misas, 2006). Once scale advantages are exhausted, firm efficiency no longer benefits from increasing size (i.e., they operate under constant returns to scales) or even exhibit scale disadvantages (i.e., decreasing returns to scale).

Many studies find results in line with the theoretical predictions of a positive relationship between size and efficiency (see, e.g., Cummins & Zi, 1998; Eling & Luhnen, 2010b; Luhnen, 2009). However, some studies argue that the very largest firms suffer from diseconomies of scale (e.g., due to complexity) so that they are not as efficient as middle-sized insurers (see, e.g., Fenn, Vencappa, Diacon, Klumpes, & O'Brien, 2008). Diacon, Starkey, and O'Brien (2002) find, however, that large and small insurers are more (technically) efficient than middle-sized insurers, indicating a u-shape of efficiency values. While Yuengert (1993) concludes that size and efficiency are statistically unrelated, Zanghieri (2008) states that there is a nonlinear relationship between size and efficiency. For life and non-life insurance he shows concave relations between size and cost/profit efficiency (i.e., curvilinear and inverted u-shape). The only study including the Swiss market finds that a group of large Swiss insurers is less efficient than a group of small ones (Rai, 1996), although for each size group, the author observes a positive relationship between size and efficiency (i.e., overall a nonlinear relation). Until now, no unique relationship between firm size and efficiency has been identified. We follow the economic rationale and the most widespread empirical finding in the insurance efficiency literature and expect (hypothesis H3(a)) a positive relation between firm size and efficiency.

Whereas an analysis of size and its effect on efficiency is informative about the level of efficiency relative to the size of operation, scale economies indicate whether efficiency differences result from a firm being too big or too small or whether an increase in operational size is likely to increase or decrease efficiency. In general, there are three types of scale economies: (1) firms not operating at optimal scale and potentially generating disproportionately high additional returns by increasing the size of operations (increasing returns to scale; IRS), (2) firms not operating at optimal scale and potentially generating disproportionately low additional returns by increasing the size of operations (decreasing returns to scale; DRS), and (3) firms generating proportional additional returns by increasing the size of operations (constant returns to scale; CRS). This pattern occurs because, while small firms can benefit from average cost reductions with increasing size, complexity of operation outweighs those advantages when firms become too large.

Most empirical studies find that smaller insurance firms operate under IRS, while larger firms operate under DRS and some under CRS.

                           9
                           
                              Yuengert (1993) finds increasing returns to scale for U.S. life firms with up to US$15 billion in assets, whereas Cummins and Zi (1998) find these only for firms with up to US$1 billion in assets. For U.S. property/liability firms, increasing returns to scale are documented up to US$137 million in assets. See also Fecher et al. (1991) for France, Hardwick (1997) for the United Kingdom, Hwang and Gao (2005) for Ireland, Cummins and Rubio-Misas (2006) for Spain, Qiu and Chen (2006) for China, and Luhnen (2009) for the German property/liability industry.
                         We assume the same will be true for the Swiss insurance industry and thus expect that (hypothesis H3(b)) small and medium-sized insurers are operating under IRS, but that large firms mostly operate under DRS or CRS. A confirmation of these expectations will have important implications for managers, regulators, and policymakers because it will provide justification for mergers among small and medium-size insurers, but not for mergers among large insurers.

Another factor that is analyzed, especially in the M&A context, is economies of scope. In the context of efficiency, a central question is whether a firm benefits more from specializing in one or a limited set of products, or from a broad diversification of the product portfolio. The two main hypotheses discussed in literature are the conglomeration hypothesis and the strategic focus hypothesis. The conglomeration hypothesis states that firms can take advantage of cost and revenue scope economies by operating in several business lines or offering a multitude of different products, resulting in superior efficiency compared to specialized firms. In contrast, the strategic focus hypothesis claims that specialized insurers generate superior efficiency by focusing on their core business where they exhibit competitive advantages.

Evidence from the insurance literature is again not consistent. For example, Meador, Ryan, and Schellhorn (2000) find support for the conglomeration hypothesis from the U.S. life market for the period 1990–1995. Luhnen (2009) and Eling and Luhnen (2010b) observe that interacting in different lines of business is not always superior to focusing on core business activities. According to Cummins, Weiss, Xie, and Zi (2010), strategic focus is superior to conglomeration in the insurance industry. Berger, Cummins, Weiss, and Zi (2000) note that the conglomeration hypothesis dominates for some types of financial services (i.e., larger insurers with emphasis on personal lines and vertically integrated distribution systems) and the strategic focus hypothesis dominates for other types (i.e., smaller insurers with emphasis on commercial lines and nonintegrated distribution systems). Berry-Stölzle, Hoyt, and Wende (2013) confirm that the diversification-performance relationship for insurance companies depends on company size. This may explain the empirical puzzle of why generalists and specialists both appear to be competitively viable in the long run. The only Swiss-specific result in this area is provided by Rai (1996), who states that specialized insurers in Switzerland are more efficient than diversified insurance firms. This is in line with the strategic focus hypothesis and leads us to expect that (hypothesis H4) specialized insurers are more efficient than diversified insurers (strategic focus hypothesis). In the empirical part, we also interact specialization and size in order to also test the coexistence prediction by Berger et al. (2000).

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

We use the input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) with constant (CRS) and variable returns to scales (VRS) to approximate “best practice” production, cost, and allocative frontiers, and the output-oriented DEA with VRS to compute revenue frontiers. To robustly estimate the efficient frontiers in the first stage, we rely on the bootstrap approach introduced by Simar and Wilson (2000) which takes into account the sensitivity of efficiency measures to sampling variation and estimates bias-corrected DEA efficiency scores. We then apply second-stage regressions to make inferences about interactions of efficiency estimates and a set of covariates. We estimate sector-specific efficient frontiers as opposed to using a pooled frontier for the whole Swiss insurance market. This is important since life, non-life, and reinsurance represent distinct business models and are, thus, usually treated as distinct industries in efficiency studies (see, e.g., Cummins et al., 2010; Eling & Luhnen, 2010b).

It is well known that DEA is sensitive to extreme outliers in the output, size, and dispersion of the industry. By contrast, other studies such as Fenn et al. (2008) use one-stage Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) so that the above described two stages can be conducted simultaneously; this permits Fenn et al. (2008) to integrate both cultural and economic factors into a single model. There is no general consensus in the literature as to which methodology is most appropriate, and both DEA and SFA have advantages and disadvantages. SFA has the main disadvantage of using strong assumptions regarding the form of the efficient frontier. It assumes a specific functional form (e.g., translog, composite cost) and therefore expects a certain underlying economic behavior that may or may not be valid. DEA has the advantage of imposing less structure on the efficient frontier. However, in contrast to SFA, it has the disadvantage of not taking into account random error. Consequently, DEA approaches run the risk of taking all deviations from the efficient frontier as inefficiencies, therefore possibly mistaking a true random error for inefficiency. A decision as to which methodology is most appropriate, thus, has to be based on the specific data at hand. We performed three different tests to analyze the sensitivity of our data and results to outliers: first, we trimmed the in- and output data; second, we excluded outliers based on the cloud methodology (see, e.g., Andrews & Pregibon, 1978; Wilson, 1993); as a third test, we skipped the largest company. The results of these three analyses (shown in Online-Appendix B) indicate that our main results are robust. We thus conclude that, for our data, the sensitivity to extreme outliers is not a major problem, and decided to use DEA.

To analyze the development of efficiency and productivity over time, we use the Malmquist index of total factor productivity (TFP) (see Caves, Christensen, & Diewert, 1982) and decompose TFP into its principal sources: technical change and technical efficiency change. Technical change represents changes in production technology from one period to another and thus describes shifts in the best practice production frontier. Technical efficiency change concentrates on changes in a firm's distance from the best practice frontier from one period to another. Technical efficiency change can be separated into pure technical efficiency change (measured relative to the VRS frontier) and scale efficiency change (which analyzes differences in distance of VRS to CRS frontier). As for the general efficiency estimates, one can use input- and output-oriented models; for the sake of consistency, we estimate input-oriented TFP. In this context we also incorporate the robust estimation of the Malmquist indices by means of a bootstrap approach as in Simar and Wilson (1999).

To identify drivers of firm efficiency we analyze the impact of firm-specific determinants on efficiency within a second-stage regression. Simar and Wilson (2011) compare statistical estimators for which the second-stage regression is well defined and meaningful: truncated regression and ordinary least squares (OLS). They point out that second-stage OLS estimation is consistent only under very strict conditions, which are not satisfied by our data. For this reason we use the two-stage double bootstrap truncated regression procedure suggested in Simar and Wilson (2007), which provides consistent second-stage estimations.

                           As a robustness test, we also applied OLS. The conclusions based on our OLS estimators support those drawn from our truncated regression analysis with only two exceptions. The OLS results are available upon request.
                         In the specifications of the bootstrap algorithm, efficiency scores that have support between 1 and infinity (i.e., 1 defines an efficient firm) are used, which is why we transform the efficiency scores, which are bounded between 0 and 1, by 1/efficiency, in a first step. This changes the interpretation of the regression coefficients (i.e., negative coefficients imply an increase in efficiency, positive coefficients a decrease). The model that is estimated has a left truncation point at 1 and is specified as follows:

These seven firm-specific characteristics measure international diversification (i.e., ratio of premiums written abroad to total premiums written), firm size (i.e., natural logarithm of total assets), specialization (i.e., Herfindahl Index of written premiums over line of businesses), organizational form (i.e., stock vs. mutual), leverage (i.e., ratio of debt to total assets), premium growth (i.e., year-to-year changes in premiums), and company age (i.e., natural logarithm of age).

                           Another covariate that has not been analyzed extensively in frontier efficiency analyses is market share. We exclude this variable from our analysis because it is highly correlated with firm size (correlation coefficient = 0.986 for life, 0.825 for p/c, 0.931 for reinsurance). Other variables included in additional tests, but not shown here, are market-specific variables (e.g., interest rate, concentration (Herfindahl Index of the market) and inflation). These firm-invariant characteristics cannot be included together with the time effects.
                         While the first three represent Hypotheses H2–H4, the other four are used as control variables commonly applied in insurance efficiency studies.

Our data originate from the Swiss regulator FINMA and have not yet been employed in the literature. According to the Swiss Insurance Supervision Act, all Swiss insurers are required to file their annual reports with the regulator so that we have complete market coverage. Our dataset consists of life, p/c, and reinsurance financial statements reported for the period 1997–2013 and contains information for all insurers operating in Switzerland. Data for the years 2008 onward are available on the FINMA webpage. Data prior to 2008 are available from the regulator upon request.

                           Every year the data are aggregated in an annual report published by the regulator and are also used in other national and international reporting (e.g., OECD, EUROSTAT). See www.finma.ch for more details. In terms of scope and depth, the data are very comparable with other regulatory data sources such as the regulatory annual statements filed by insurers with the U.S. NAIC (e.g., used in Leverty & Grace, 2010) or the data from the German regulator BaFin (e.g., used in Luhnen, 2009).

                           Regarding internationalization, the FINMA only collects premiums of Swiss firms doing business abroad. That means that, e.g., Zürich Versicherungs-Gesellschaft AG (Swiss insurer active in several countries) is considered an international firm, whereas AIG Life Insurance Company (Switzerland) Ltd. (Swiss division of international insurer AIG) is not an international firm, since it does not do international business itself. Robustness tests in which Swiss divisions of international insurers are also treated as international firms (see Online-Appendix C) show that Swiss life insurers that operate internationally have higher efficiency levels, while Swiss divisions of international insurers are not performing well in terms of efficiency.
                        
                     

There is widespread agreement in the insurance literature in regard to the choice of inputs, outputs, and prices (see Cummins & Weiss, 2013; Eling & Luhnen, 2010a). According to the value-added approach (see, e.g., Berger et al., 2000; Grace & Timme, 1992; Leverty & Grace, 2010), insurance firms fulfill three major functions: risk pooling/bearing, financial services, and intermediation. As a proxy for the risk pooling/bearing and financial services functions, we use the present value of losses paid plus additions to reserves (i.e., real incurred losses) for p/c and reinsurance and paid benefits plus additions to reserves for life insurers. In the literature, premiums are sometimes used instead of real incurred losses to proxy risk pooling/bearing and financial services. However, the use of premiums as a proxy is subject to criticism since premiums already represent price times quantity of the output and not just output (see Yuengert, 1993), which is why we focus on paid benefits and incurred losses. The output variable that best proxies the intermediation function is the real value of total investments. Insurance firms receive funds from their customers and invest them until the firm is required to pay benefits or the funds are withdrawn by the policyholder in the case of asset accumulation products (see, e.g., Cummins & Weiss, 2013).

The price for the output real incurred loss is defined as the difference of net premiums earned and the output value (paid benefits/present value of losses plus additions to reserves) divided by this output value (see, e.g., Grace, Leverty, Phillips, & Shimpi, 2015; Leverty & Grace, 2010). Since earned premiums represent an estimate of expected losses, this ratio shows the relative markup between the expected and actual losses. To avoid negative ratios, we average the firm-specific values to a market average per years as it is usually done with input prices (see, e.g., Cummins & Rubio-Misas, 2006). For the price of the intermediation output (total investments) we use the expected rate of return of these investments as a proxy. This is given by the weighted average of returns for debt and equity investments weighted by the proportion of assets invested in debt securities and stocks. The rate of return for debt securities is defined by the actual investment income without dividends divided by the total of debt instruments (see Cummins & Weiss, 2013; the data are again taken from the Swiss regulator). The rate of return for the equity investments is given by 7-year averages of yearly return rates of the MSCI World (taken from Thomson Reuters Datastream). As for the real incurred loss price, we again average the firm-specific values on a market level to avoid negative returns.

For the input factors, the literature suggests the use of labor, business services, and capital (see, e.g., Cummins, Rubio-Misas, & Zi, 2004; Eling & Luhnen, 2010a). However, because of limited data availability, common practice is to aggregate labor and business services into one category labeled “operating expenses” (including commissions; see, e.g., Ennsfellner et al., 2004; Fenn et al., 2008). According to Cummins and Weiss (2013), operating expenses are mostly labor related (i.e., the largest components are employee salaries and commissions), and thus one should approximate the price for operating expenses by the price of labor. As price of labor we use an annual wage variable for the Swiss insurance sector, which we obtain from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. The input capital is subdivided into debt and equity capital. For the price of debt capital we use 10-year average returns of Swiss confederation bonds (obtained from the Swiss National Bank); similarly, as a proxy for the price of equity capital we use 7-year averages of yearly rates of return of the Swiss Market Index (SMI) (returns collected from Datastream). This approach avoids the problem of negative returns and is used in other studies (e.g., Cummins et al., 2004; Diboky & Ubl, 2007; Luhnen, 2009).

                           14
                           In principal every insurer should have own prices for debt and equity capital, which depend on its capital structure and portfolio risks. Cummins and Weiss (2013) discuss some alternative price measures. As a robustness test, we also estimated all models with firm-specific input and output prices. Results are available upon request. Those findings confirm the observations in Section 4.
                        
                     

For our analysis we have an unbalanced panel dataset for the entire Swiss insurance industry covering the period 1997–2013 that is separated into life, p/c, and reinsurance. The advantage of using an unbalanced panel is that it allows the inclusion of firms entering and leaving the market in the observation period. From our initial dataset we exclude all observations for which one input or output is non-positive since DEA requires inputs and outputs to be non-negative.
                           15
                        
                        
                           15
                           An exception is output one (real incurred losses). If real incurred losses are negative, this can be due to a negative amount of current losses/benefits paid (which is impossible, and in which case we excluded the observation), or to a negative amount of additions to reserve (which is possible) that was higher than the current losses paid. In the latter case, we shifted outputs for the whole sample such that they are non-negative. Given translation invariance of the model, this approach is possible (see, e.g., Pastor, 1996). However, this translation invariance in our implementation is just given for outputs (if input-oriented DEA model is used). Thus, for revenue efficiency (for which an output-oriented DEA model is needed and so by theory translation invariance in outputs is not given), we used reduced data without all negative observations in output one. Summary statistics for the reduced sample are provided in Online-Appendix D. For the analysis of revenue efficiency, we had to delete about 1.5 percent of the data in life, 4.5 percent in p/c, and 12.9 percent in reinsurance.
                         Additionally, to account for comparability over time, we deflate all inputs and outputs by the Swiss consumer price index (obtained from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office) to the base year 2010 (see, e.g., Cummins & Zi, 1998). Our final dataset consists of 34 life, 86 p/c, and 101 reinsurers.
                           16
                        
                        
                           16
                           We cover 100 percent of the life, 96 percent of the p/c, and 67 percent of the reinsurance market in 1997, measured by total written gross premiums. We obtained the total market premium volume from the FINMA website. This number also included all premiums earned in Switzerland by non-Swiss insurers. Since many foreign reinsurance firms have business in Switzerland this is one reason for the relatively small cover of our data in reinsurance. The second reason is that the total premium volume also included reinsurance premiums that primary insurers earned and we have just pure reinsurance firms (no direct insurers) in our sample for reinsurance.
                         The relatively large number of reinsurance firms is due to numerous new market entrants in the analyzed period. Summary statistics of inputs/outputs and prices are given in Table 2.
                        
                     


                        Table 3
                         presents the average, bias-corrected efficiency values for cost (CE), technical (TE), allocative (AE), scale (SE), and revenue efficiency (RE). The efficiency levels are relatively high across the different sectors. For example, life insurers’ CE ranges between 0.93 and 0.98, indicating that the average life insurer can improve CE by about 2–7 percentage points to be fully CE.

                           Although, the cross-country studies of Davutyan and Klumpes (2008), Zanghieri (2008), and Eling and Luhnen (2010b) include the Swiss life insurance market, we cannot directly compare their results with our analysis, since their measures are not based on single-country frontiers. Relative to geographically close insurance markets, such as Germany, the Swiss life insurance market exhibits higher efficiency (see, e.g., Trigo-Gamarra & Growitsch, 2010, who find CE between 0.22 and 0.66; see also Hussels & Ward, 2007).
                         Scores for p/c and reinsurance are slightly smaller than those for life. For example, the values for CE in p/c range between 0.82 and 0.90,
                           18
                        
                        
                           18
                           Results exist for the p/c market for other countries; however, most of these include reinsurers, which limit the comparability of the results. Other markets exhibit smaller (e.g., Cummins & Xie, 2008 for the United States and Luhnen, 2009 for Germany) or similar (e.g., Berry-Stölzle et al., 2009 for Germany) efficiency values than those found for Switzerland.
                         those for reinsurance between 0.81 and 0.89.
                           19
                        
                        
                           19
                           There is little literature analyzing reinsurance efficiency separately since most studies subsume reinsurance under the non-life category, including the p/c insurance market. The only study we are aware of that investigates efficiency for reinsurers specifically is that of Cummins and Weiss (2002), who use the standard deviation of ROE as input and the mean ROE as output.
                         Those results, however, do not necessarily indicate that p/c and reinsurance firms are less efficient than life firms; it might be that the life insurers are more homogenous.
                           20
                        
                        
                           20
                           The conclusion that life insurers have higher scores than non-life insurers is in contrast to the results of many other papers (Fenn et al., 2008; Eling & Luhnen, 2010b; Vencappa et al., 2013). As indicated, we believe that the Swiss life insurance market is very homogenous, while in other countries, there is more differentiation. One explanation for the homogeneity might be that 2/3 of the life business is highly standardized and regulated pension business. Also, the comparability of the mean efficiency values based on different frontiers is limited. To provide a convincing argument regarding the dominance of a particular line of business over another, a comparison of the frontier technology and, thus, the application of, e.g., cross-frontier analysis (CFA; Cummins, Weiss & Zi, 1999b; Biener & Eling, 2012), would be necessary, which is not the focus of this paper.
                        
                     

In Table 4
                         we measure TFP changes using input-oriented Malmquist productivity indices. We present results for the complete observation period as well as averages across yearly changes. The latter is important because, in an unbalanced panel, the TFP change for the complete observation period will contain only a limited number of observations.

The TFP change for life insurance indicates a productivity decline over the complete observation period of about 13 percent.
                           21
                        
                        
                           21
                           The TFP scores presented in Table 4 show the reciprocal of the indices used in other papers (e.g., Luhnen, 2009) and thus do not represent the standard definition by Färe and Grosskopf (1996). The reason to use this definition is the easier interpretability: an index value of >1 indicates productivity growth, an index <1 productivity decline.
                         This is due to a shift in the frontier by a similar amount (technical change of –13 percent). This negative overall trend is also illustrated by an average (i.e., geometric) yearly reduction of about 1 percent in both of these values. This result indicates that, over the observation period, Swiss life insurers consistently lost productivity. Moreover, even though best practice firms became less productive, non-efficient firms could not catch up, indicating that the entire life insurance market suffered from this technological regress. We believe these findings illustrate the general difficulties experienced by the life insurance sector in adapting to an increasingly challenging business environment of low interest rates and increased competition from other financial service providers, such as banks. While the level of inputs remains largely unchanged, in many cases the output levels decline, for instance due to the loss of business to competitors in other industries or due to lower investments.

                           22
                           Although a decline in technical efficiency is not very intuitive, it is sometimes documented also for other countries (see, e.g., Cummins & Rubio-Misas, 2006, or Grifel-Tatjé & Lovell, 1996 for insurance and banking in Spain). The technical regress can be broken down into environmental effects and managerial effects. While it is implausible to assume that the management has become worse, changes in the business environment might negatively affect the ability to transform inputs to outputs. Cummins and Rubio-Misas (2006) argue that the costs of adjusting to a new regulatory environment might lead to a slippage in the production frontier. Especially for life insurance, they note that technical regress could also occur because of an increase in the output quality, e.g., associated with the increasing importance of asset allocation products in life insurance, which require a higher level of technology investment to provide competitive services. Our findings thus mirror the results documented by Cummins and Rubio-Misas (2006) for Spain.
                        
                     

For the p/c and reinsurance industry, we find no significant TFP change over the whole period. However, yearly average scores indicate an increase in TFP of about 2 percent (p/c) and 4 percent (reinsurance). In both sectors this increase is explained by progress in best practice technology, that is, a positive technical change (1 percent for p/c and 2 percent for reinsurance per year), and also by efficiency improvements, indicated by an average yearly technical efficiency increase of 1 percent in both sectors. This result is in line with an analysis of the Swiss market in a cross-country setting from 1983–1991 by Donni and Fecher (1997) and with other European studies showing that productivity improvements in general result both from technology progress and better technology adoption.

Our findings confirm hypothesis H1 for p/c and reinsurance, but not for life insurance. The positive development of technology in the p/c and reinsurance sectors (i.e., the development of the best practices firms) is accompanied by a similar technical efficiency change. This implies that despite the industries’ progress, insurers on average follow the technological improvements of their peers in the industry, and can even catch up slightly to best practices. The results are in line with other European studies showing that productivity improvements in general result both from technology progress and better technology adoption.

                              Luhnen (2009) observes a TFP change of 8.20 percent for the German p/l market over a period of 12 years, whereas our results for p/c do not show significant productivity progress over the whole sample period. However, Luhnen's TFP improvement and our average 2 percent TFP increase per year are similar trends. For life, we find no improvement, whereas Bertoni and Croce (2011) find a significant improvement of 6.71 percent p.a. in Europe. Detailed by-year changes in TFP growth are presented in Online-Appendix E.
                        
                     

We present second-stage regression results of the reciprocal technical, cost, and revenue efficiency estimates on seven firm-specific characteristics. Descriptive statistics and correlation characteristics of the covariates are shown in Online-Appendix F.
                           24
                        
                        
                           24
                           We consider correlations between all variables to get a sense of whether our regression coefficients are biased due to multicollinearity. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is found to be relatively small and well below 0.4 (see Online-Appendix F). Only the control variable company age has relatively high product-moment correlations with several other variables, which, however, does not bias our regression coefficients (see regression analysis without covariate age in Online-Appendix F). Thus, multicollinearity does not strike us as a serious concern.
                         The results from the truncated regression based on the Simar and Wilson (2007) approach are presented in Table 5
                        . Note again that the interpretation of the effects is reversed because of the transformation in the dependent variable. For all models in Table 5 and the following analyses, we calculate p-values for each coefficient based on 2000 bootstrap replications. We define the p-values to be the frequency of bootstrap estimates with the opposite sign as the original coefficient (e.g., if the coefficient is negative in the first run, the p-value for this coefficient is the ratio of non-negative bootstrap estimates to total number of bootstrap estimates computed; see, e.g., Afonso & Aubyn, 2006; Luhnen, 2009).

We measure international diversification by the ratio of foreign premiums to total premiums, which is standard in the strategic management and international business literature (see, e.g., Capar & Kotabe, 2003). Table 5 reveals a positive relationship for all efficiency measures in the life insurance market. These results confirm our hypothesis for the life market. For the p/c insurance industry, however, the regression results show a negative relationship (TE, CE) or are not significant (RE). For life insurers, the opportunities created by the European Single Market to extend sales territory thus seem to increase efficiency. In addition, these possibilities improve the ability to choose best-practice technology and the cost-minimal input combinations. p/c insurers seem to react differently to these opportunities, which might be explained by a “liability of foreignness” (see, e.g., Zaheer, 1995).
                              25
                           
                           
                              25
                              In Online-Appendix G, we look at the interaction between international diversification, size and specialization. Particularly the effect on p/c insurers’ efficiency depends on the level of specialization; the negative effect between international diversification and efficiency is more severe for highly specialized p/c insurers.
                            The regression results thus partly support hypothesis H2. The result for life insurance is in line with Altuntas and Gößmann (2012), who observe a positive relation between return on assets and international diversification for German insurers. The findings imply that internationalization strategies and increasing the international operations (e.g., via mergers and acquisitions) are beneficial from an efficiency point of view only for life insurers.

The analysis of economies of scale is based on a two-tiered approach. We first, determine the level of scale inefficiencies (i.e., distance to the efficient frontier) as a function of firm size in Table 5 and in a second step elicit the source of scale inefficiencies by determining the position of a firm relative to the different areas of the production function—i.e., IRS, CRS, or DRS. We then gather information on the structure of the frontier and identify the areas, in which firms operate under IRS, CRS, or DRS and relate those to firm size. Following this frequently applied approach (see, e.g., Cummins & Zi, 1998; Hardwick, 1997; Luhnen, 2009; Yuengert, 1993), we determine level as well as type of scale inefficiencies for each firm. We find an increase in TE, CE, and RE with increasing size for life, p/c, and reinsurance (Table 5). The regression result thus confirms a positive trend for all subsectors and all efficiency measures, supporting hypothesis H3(a). Our results for all subsectors are against Rai (1996), although in accordance with much of the efficiency literature (e.g., Cummins & Zi, 1998; Luhnen, 2009; Eling & Luhnen, 2010b).
                              26
                           
                           
                              26
                              An additional test using quadratic terms in the regression is provided in Online-Appendix H and shows a convex relationship for size.
                           
                        

In Table 6
                           , we analyze economies of scale. We define three equal-sized size groups and look at the distribution of return to scales for each group. For all three sectors, firms from the “Small” category mostly operate under IRS and CRS, while those from the “Large” group mostly operate under DRS. The pattern for medium-sized insurers is not as clear-cut. The results in Table 6 are consistent with analyses in other countries (see, e.g., Yuengert, 1993; Cummins & Zi, 1998 for U.S. life insurance; Hardwick, 1997 for U.K. life insurance; Luhnen, 2009 for German p/l insurance) and the literature on whole insurance markets (e.g., Cummins & Rubio-Misas, 2006 for Spain), and confirm hypothesis H3(b). Our results further indicate that mergers among small and medium-sized insurers can be justified on efficiency grounds, but that mergers among larger insurers cannot.
                              27
                           
                           
                              27
                              We analyze the economies of scale in more detail in Online-Appendix I. We find that the majority of life insurers with assets up to CHF 3.6 billion operate under IRS and CRS, whereas for p/c and reinsurance, the critical triggers for this are about CHF 100 million (reinsurance) to CHF 191 million (p/c). The merger threshold for life insurers is higher than the threshold in Cummins and Zi (1998), but the result for p/c is close to the U.S. value documented in Cummins and Xie (2013). Nevertheless, the potential efficiency benefits must outweigh the merger costs. Thus, due to the already high level of scale efficiency in the Swiss market, the efficiency gains from a merger might be limited for small insurers. It must also be noted that even among the largest insurers we find some that operate under IRS and CRS, indicating that there may be important managerial lessons to be learned from scale-efficient insurers (see Cummins & Xie, 2013).
                           
                        

The analysis of firm specialization shows significant negative impact of specialization on TE in all sectors (see Table 5). Thus, a high level of specialization hinders the ability of firms to choose the best-practice technology. Regarding CE of p/c insurance we also observe this negative relationship. Our results thus indicate support of the conglomeration hypothesis, which has found a great deal of support using U.S. data (see, e.g., Meador et al., 2000). The hypothesized positive effect between the degree of specialization and efficiency cannot be confirmed for any subsector or efficiency measure. The strategic focus hypothesis (H4) and the existing results for Switzerland by Rai (1996) thus cannot be confirmed.
                              28
                           
                           
                              28
                              A second measure for specialization (companies are defined to be specialized if two-thirds of their total premiums were earned in one line of business; otherwise not) was applied and yields the same results; the results are available upon request. In Online-Appendix G, we also interact specialization and size to test the coexistence prediction by Berger et al. (2000). The results show that for small p/c and small reinsurers it is better to be specialized, while for larger insurers it is better to be diversified. This finding is in line with the general literature on strategic management (e.g., Porter, 1980) and efficiency (e.g., Berger et al., 2000). For life insurers the results are insignificant.
                            An explanation for this result might be that the majority of the insurers in our sample (especially in the life and p/c sector) sell relatively standardized products and exhibit integrated value chains (i.e., emphasis on personal lines and vertically integrated distribution systems). This result again emphasizes the relatively high level of homogeneity in the Swiss insurance market.

In the life sector, mutual insurers are more efficient than stocks. This effect is confirmed in p/c insurance for the TE and CE measure, whereas the RE measure shows the opposite effect. This general finding is in line with Luhnen (2009) for the German p/l market as well as with Biener and Eling (2012) for the European and U.S. markets. Increasing leverage has a negative effect on TE and CE across the entire Swiss insurance market. For RE the effect is only observable for the life insurance market. The regression results for premium growth do not reveal a clear pattern over all subsectors. We find a positive relationship between premium growth and the TE and CE measures in reinsurance; for life insurance we observe a positive relationship for RE and for p/c insurance for TE. There is a significant positive relation between company age and efficiency in p/c insurance. However, a negative effect of company age on efficiency is shown in reinsurance for TE and CE and life in RE.
                           
                        

To further analyze the international diversification topic, we split the amount of international business into premiums earned in Europe and premiums earned outside of Europe. This premium split is relevant, since only the EU market has been deregulated and harmonized. For growth in other parts of the world, substantial barriers still exist. To analyze these effects, we include two international diversification ratios into our regression: one for business in Europe and one for business outside of Europe.

The results in Table 7 underline the positive effect of international business on life insurers’ efficiency already observed in Table 5. Both business in European countries and business outside of Europe significantly contribute to this positive effect for all efficiency measures. However, the absolute magnitude of the effect for Europe is consistently larger than the effect for business outside Europe. Diversifying in the European market thus seems preferable to diversifying outside of Europe. Again consistent with Table 5, we find that, for p/c insurers, internationalization is only efficiency-enhancing in one case (RE). Notably, this effect is only present for the diversification within Europe, while the corresponding coefficient for non-Europe is insignificant. Again, we see that the efficiency effect for Europe is consistently better than the effect for business outside Europe.

We also define alternative internationalization measures to check the robustness of the international diversification results presented in Section 4.2. In addition to the ratio used in Table 5 (i.e., premiums earned abroad to total premiums earned), we define an entropy measure (see, e.g., Qian, Khoury, Peng, & Qian, 2010), a modified globalization Herfindahl index (see, e.g., Cummins, Tennyson, & Weiss, 1999a), and the number of areas operating in. The results for all alternative specifications yield the same conclusions as the ones presented above and are thus presented in Online-Appendix J (there we also provide the exact definitions of these measures). It thus seems that there is a general positive link between international diversification and efficiency in life insurance and a negative relation for p/c insurance.

                           We also test the robustness of the results across subperiods (before the first crisis, i.e., 1997–2001, between the two crises, i.e., 2002–2007, and for 2008–2013). The results for life insurance are consistent across all subperiods, while for p/c and reinsurance there are few variations. See Online-Appendix K.
                        
                     

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We study the productivity and efficiency of Swiss firms active in the life, p/c, and reinsurance market from 1997–2013 using frontier efficiency methodologies. The Swiss insurance market has undergone major changes in the last 20 years, including deregulation, increased competition, changing capital market conditions, and changing supervisory and legal frameworks. These major changes are reflected in substantial productivity and efficiency changes.

A summary of all results and a comparison with the extant literature is provided in Table 8. In the p/c and reinsurance markets, yearly average productivity increased slightly over the sample period due to similar degrees of improvement in both the technology frontier and efficiency. In contrast, we find a decline of best practice technology for life insurance firms giving rise to a decline in productivity. And yet, even though the best practice firms became less productive, the average insurer was not able to catch up to them. We interpret these findings as illustrating the difficulties experienced by the entire life insurance sector in adapting to the increasingly challenging business environment (e.g., low interest rates, increased competition from other financial services providers). Our results suggest that the internationalization of the Swiss life insurance industry as well as increasing the size of operation in the Swiss insurance industry have a positive impact on insurer efficiency. In addition, we observe that entering the non-European market for Swiss life and p/c insurers is not as beneficial as entering into European markets. Moreover, we find that stock firms are not more efficient than mutual firms, a rejection of the expense preference hypothesis (Mester, 1991).

Our results also validate and help to better understand the determinants of productivity in the insurance sector. Organizational form has an impact on life and p/c insurers’ success. High debt ratios are detrimental to insurer efficiency. These findings underline the importance and appropriate definition of risk-based capital standards by regulators. We also want to emphasize the importance of analyzing nonlinear relationships and interactions between different covariates in achieving a better explanation of the true effect underlying the data.

More research is needed on international diversification. An application to other markets and cross-country settings or an even more explicit analysis of the functional form of the relationship between international diversification intensity and efficiency (i.e., testing for u-, inverted u-, or s-shaped relations with continuous variables) will be worthwhile. The data sample for such an analysis should contain estimates for international diversification for which nonlinear relationships can be tested (e.g., international diversification measures that are not highly correlated with their higher orders). Mediating this relation with connected covariates might be also convenient. Also interesting is the interrelation between risk-based capital standards and efficiency, which has not yet been explored. Finally, it might be interesting to more closely analyze market-specific determinants in a cross-country context, that is, for instance, to measure the impact of changes in market conditions on efficiency (e.g., interest rate, concentration, inflation, etc.). One promising new tool in this context, which, however, would require a cross-country analysis, is the incorporation of uncontrollable variables in the efficiency analysis (see, e.g., Huang & Eling, 2013). Such an analysis can be especially useful for better understanding the productivity and efficiency decline in the life insurance industry. In the context of cross-country analyses also Stochastic Frontier Analysis (Fenn et al., 2008) might yield further insights, especially given that in contrast to DEA it permits to integrate both cultural and economic factors into a single model.
