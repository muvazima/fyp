                  Convex risk measures for European contingent claims are studied in a non-Markovian jump-diffusion modeling framework using functional Itô’s calculus. Two representations for a convex risk measure are considered, one based on a nonlinear g-expectation and another one based on a representation theorem. Functional Itô’s calculus for càdlàg processes, backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with jumps and stochastic optimal control theory are used to discuss the evaluation of convex risk measures. FPDIEs and PDIEs for convex risk measures are derived in the Markovian and non-Markovian situations, respectively. An entropic risk measure, which is a particular case of a convex risk measure, is discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Quantitative risk management is one of the important topics in the interface between modern finance and actuarial science. Different risk metrics have been introduced and their uses in the practices of risk management have been studied in both the finance and actuarial science literature. One of the popular risk metrics in both finance and insurance industries is Value at Risk (VaR). The history of VaR may be traced back to the well-known “4:15 report” in J.P. Morgan and an early use of VaR methodology in practice may be attributed to the Risk-Metric Group. The uses of VaR as a risk metric and for the purpose of risk regulatory capitals have once been recommended by some regulators such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). There has been a large amount of research on VaR in both the academic and industrial communities. The classic monograph by Jorion (1996) provides a comprehensive discussion on VaR and its practical implementation.

In a landmark paper by Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, and Heath (1999), the use of VaR for risk measurement was questioned from a theoretical point of view. In particular, it was noted in Artzner et al. (1999) that VaR does not satisfy the sub-additive property which means that diversification may increase risk. This seems counter-intuitive from the perspective of traditional finance. Artzner et al. (1999) employed an axiomatic approach to study risk measures and introduced a class of coherent risk measures satisfying four desirable properties including the sub-additive property. Two typical examples of coherent risk measures are the generalized scenario expectation and the expected shortfall. The generalized scenario expectation is given by a representation of a coherent risk measure by Artzner et al. (1999) while the expected shortfall is given by the average loss when the loss level exceeds a certain threshold given by the Value at Risk. Coherent risk measures have been applied to evaluate (unhedged) risks arising from trading derivative securities. Some works are, for example, Siu and Yang (2000), Yang and Siu (2001), Siu, Tong, and Yang (2001), Boyle, Siu, and Yang (2002), Elliott, Chan, and Siu (2006), Elliott, Siu, and Chan (2008) and Hao and Yang (2011), amongst others.

Liquidity risk has received much attention in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008. Its importance has been highlighted in Basel III, where some liquidity requirements were introduced. The incorporation of liquidity in risk measurement was studied in the academic literature before the GFC. For example, Föllmer and Schied (2002) and Frittelli and Rosazza-Gianin (2002) introduced a class of convex risk measures which is a generalization of the class of coherent risk measures of Artzner et al. (1999). The key idea is that the convexity property of a risk measure can incorporate nonlinearity attributed to liquidity risk of a large trading position. A precursor of a convex risk measure is the convex premium principle pioneered by Deprez and Gerber (1985). Rosazza-Gianin (2006) studied the relationship between convex risk measures and nonlinear g-expectations, where the latter can be represented as solutions of backward stochastic differential equations. Convex risk measures have been used to evaluate (unhedged) risks arising from trading derivatives, (see, for example, Elliott and Siu, 2012, 2013a, 2013b, Siu, 2012, and Elliott, Siu, and Cohen, 2015).

In this paper, convex risk measures for European-style contingent claims are studied in a non-Markovian, jump-diffusion modeling framework. A key feature of such model is that the model coefficients such as the drift, volatility and jump amplitude depend on the price path of the underlying security up to the current time. Functional Itô’s calculus is used to discuss the evaluation of convex risk measures. This calculus was introduced by Dupire (2009) and was further developed in the works of Cont and Fournie (2010, 2013) and Levental, Schroder, and Sinha (2013), amongst others. It is an extension of classical Itô’s calculus with a view to dealing with functionals of stochastic processes. Two representations for convex risk measures are considered here. For the first representation, as in Rosazza-Gianin (2006) and Øksendal and Sulem (2009) for example, a convex risk measure is related to a nonlinear g-expectation in the jump-diffusion modeling set up, where the latter is represented as the solution of a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with jumps. Using functional Itô’s calculus for RCLL, or càdlàg, processes in Levental et al. (2013), martingale representation for functionals of jump-diffusion processes as well as the unique decomposition of a special semimartingale, the solution of the BSDE corresponding to the nonlinear g-expectation, or the convex risk measure, is identified. More specifically, under some “smoothness” assumptions of the functional representing the convex risk measure, a functional partial differential-integral equation (FPDIE) satisfied by the convex risk measure is obtained while the control components of the solution of the BSDE are identified by a functional derivative and a functional difference. The second representation follows from the representation theorem of a convex risk measure in Föllmer and Schied (2002) and Frittelli and Rosazza-Gianin (2002). In this case, a convex risk measure is specified by two major components, namely a family of probability “scenarios” and a penalty function. Here the family of probability “scenarios” is specified by a family of stochastic exponentials while the penalty function is specified by the expectation of a path integral of a convex function as in Øksendal and Sulem (2009) and Delbaen, Peng, and Rosazza-Gianin (2010) for example. In this case, using the functional Itô’s calculus in Levental et al. (2013) in coupled with a BSDE approach to stochastic optimal control, a FPDIE satisfied by the convex risk measure is obtained. A particular case of convex risk measures, namely the entropic risk measure, is considered. A (F)PDIE for the entropic risk measure is derived in the (non)-Markovian situation.

Functional Itô’s calculus was used in Siu (2012) to evaluate convex risk measures for (unhedged) risks arising from trading derivative securities. The present paper is related to Siu (2012). It may perhaps be thought of as an extension of Siu (2012) to a non-Markovian jump-diffusion process, except that unlike Siu (2012), dynamic convex risk measures and forward-backward stochastic differential equations are not considered here. The non-Markovian jump-diffusion process may be quite flexible in incorporating financial and insurance risks modeled by diffusion processes and compound Poisson processes, respectively. In Bülhmann, Delbaen, Embrechts, and Shiryaev (1996), the no-arbitrage pricing under general semimartingales was considered so that a general approach may be provided for pricing financial and insurance risks. Subscribing to the general philosophy of Bülhmann et al. (1996), the evaluation of risk measures under non-Markovian jump-diffusion processes is considered here with the hope that this may provide some insights into developing a general approach for measuring financial and insurance risks. In Siu (2013), a risk-minimizing optimal asset allocation problem was considered in a non-Markovian stochastic volatility models with jumps. Siu and Shen (2014) considered a risk-minimizing pricing of contingent claims in a non-Markovian, regime-switching jump-diffusion model. Convex risk measures and BSDEs were used in Siu (2013) and Siu and Shen (2014). However, functional Itô’s calculus was not adopted in Siu (2013) and Siu and Shen (2014). In Jazaerli and Saporito (2013), functional Itô’s calculus was used to discuss the computation of Greeks of derivative securities in a non-Markovian diffusion situation.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the modeling framework, a convex risk measure as well as its relationship with a nonlinear g-expectation and a BSDE with jumps are briefly discussed. In Section 3, using functional Itô’s calculus, the FPDIE and the PIDE satisfied by the convex risk measure are derived. The second representation for the convex risk measure is considered in Section 4. The entropic risk measure is discussed and the corresponding (F)PDIE is derived in Section 5.

A standard continuous-time financial model with two tradable primitive securities, namely a risk-free bond and a risky share, is considered. The time horizon of the financial model is the finite horizon

                           ,
                           T
                           ]
                           ,
                        
                      where T < ∞. As usual, uncertainty is described by a complete, filtered probability space 
                        
                           (
                           Ω
                           ,
                           F
                           ,
                           F
                           ,
                           P
                           )
                           ,
                        
                      where 
                        P
                      is a reference probability measure from which a family of real-world probability measures is generated and 
                        F
                      is a filtration 
                        
                           {
                           F
                           (
                           t
                           )
                           |
                           t
                           ∈
                           T
                           }
                        
                      satisfying usual conditions, say the right-continuity and 
                        P
                     -completeness. The filtration 
                        F
                      will be specified later in this section. To simplify the discussion, it is assumed that the interest rate of the risk-free bond is zero, and so the discounting factor is identical to one.

In the sequel, the jump component of the non-Markovian jump-diffusion process for the price process of the risky share is first described. This process was considered in Øksendal and Sulem (2011) which may be thought of as an extension to the Markovian jump-diffusion process considered in Øksendal and Sulem (2008).

The risk of the claim G(T) is described by a convex risk measure introduced independently by Föllmer and Schied (2002) and Frittelli and Rosazza-Gianin (2002).

                     Consequently, ρ(H) can be interpreted as an economic capital requirement for the risky position H, (see, for example, Artzner et al., 1999; Föllmer and Schied, 2002 and Frittelli and Rosazza-Gianin, 2002).

There are different representations of a convex risk measure. As in Frittelli, Rosazza-Gianin, and Szegö (2004); Rosazza-Gianin (2006) and Øksendal and Sulem (2009) for example, a representation of a convex risk measure based on a nonlinear g-expectation is used here. The key idea is to represent the convex risk measure as a nonlinear g-expectation which is then given by the solution of a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with jumps. The relationship between nonlinear g-expectations and solutions of BSDEs was established in Peng, Karoui, and Mazliak (1997). The link between BSDEs with jumps and nonlinear g-expectations was studied in Royer (2006).

                     Some technical conditions such as the Lipschitz continuity of the driver g are imposed to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the BSDE with jumps, (see, for example, Pardoux, 1997; Tang and Li, 1994 and Royer, 2006).

In Royer (2006), under the square-integrability assumption for the terminal condition of a BSDE with jumps, a nonlinear g-expectation is represented as the first component of the solution of the BSDE with jumps. In partictular, the nonlinear g-expectation

                     . It was noted in Øksendal and Sulem (2009) that the convexity of the risk measure ρ follows from the convexity of the driver g.

In this section the solution of the BSDE with jumps corresponding to the convex risk measure, or the nonlinear g-expectation, is identified using functional Itô’s calculus with jumps in Levental et al. (2013). More specifically, the first component of the solution, which is the convex risk measure, is identified as the solution of a functional partial differential-integral equation (FPDIE). Whereas, the control components of the solution are identified as a functional derivative and a functional difference.

Firstly we present some notation, concepts and results in Levental et al. (2013) which are used in the developments here. These notation, concepts and results are presented by adapting to the current modeling framework.

The functional Itô’s formula presented in Corollary 1, a martingale representation as well as the unique decomposition of a special semimartingale are now used to identify the solution of the BSDE with jumps corresponding to the convex risk measure. Some results presented below may be thought of as an extension of those in Siu (2012) to a non-Markovian jump-diffusion case.

The unique decomposition of a special semimartingale has been used to derive some results in stochastic analysis, mathematical finance, stochastic filtering and stochastic optimal control. For example, Elliott (1976b) used the unique decomposition of a special semimartingale to derive a stochastic minimum principle. Elliott (1982), (see Chapter 18), used the unique decomposition of a semimartingale to derive some filtering results. Elliott and Kohlmann (1988) derived a martingale representation result using the unique decomposition of a special semimartingale together with stochastic flows. Elliott and Kopp (2005), (see also the relevant references therein), adopted the unique decomposition of a special semimartingale and stochastic flows to derive some pricing and hedging results for contingent claims. Elliott and Siu (2013a) used the unique decomposition of a special semimartingale and stochastic flows to identify the solution of a Markovian backward stochastic differential equation and applied the result to evaluate a convex risk measure under a Markovian diffusion process for asset price dynamics.

The basic idea of the proof of Theorem 2 here is similar to those in Dupire (2009), (see Theorems 2 and 3 therein), Siu (2012), (see Theorem 5.1 therein), and Cont and Fournie (2013), (see Theorem 5.2 therein), where the non-Markovian diffusion situations were considered.

The relationships between functional BSDEs and path-dependent PDEs were studied by some authors, (see, for example, Cosso and Russo, 2014; Ekren, Keller, Touzi, and Zhang, 2014; Ji and Yang, 2013; Peng and Wang, 2016, and the relevant references therein).

The following corollary identifies the solution of the BSDE with jumps. This is an extension of Theorem 5.2 in Siu (2012) to the non-Markovian jump-diffusion case.

Instead of representing the convex risk measure as a nonlinear g-expectation, we consider here an alternative representation of the convex risk measure based on the representation theorem in Föllmer and Schied (2002) and Frittelli and Rosazza-Gianin (2002) which is stated as follows:

According to Theorem 3, to specify a convex risk measure, one needs to specify the family of (real-world) probability measures 
                        P
                      and the penalty function η. Here 
                        P
                      is generated by a family of stochastic exponentials whose history may be traced back to the seminal work of Dolèans-Dades (1970). The classic monographs by Elliott (1982), (see Chapter 13 therein), and Jacod and Shiryaev (2003), (see Chapter 4 therein), provided some discussions on stochastic exponentials.

                     . In Delbaen et al. (2010), it was shown that under some continuity assumptions, the penalty function of a dynamic convex risk measure can be represented in the above form in the case of Brownian filtration. This form of the penalty function was also used in, for example, Elliott and Siu (2011), Siu (2012, 2013) and Siu and Shen (2014), amongst others.

Then as in Theorem 3, the convex risk measure for the contingent claim G(T) can be represented as follows:

                           Levental et al. (2013) used the functional Itô’s formula for RCLL processes in their paper in coupled with the Bellman principle to derive a “functional” Bellman equation for a stochastic optimal control problem. This then led to a verification theorem for an optimal control. Here, instead of using the Bellman principle, a BSDE approach together with the functional Itô’s formula for RCLL processes in Levental et al. (2013) are used to discuss the stochastic optimal control problem arising from the evaluation of the convex risk measure.

In this section a particular case of convex risk measures, namely an entropic risk measure, is considered. By specializing some results in Section 4, a FPDIE for the entropic risk measure is derived. Again in the Markovian case, the corresponding PDIE for the entropic risk measure is obtained.

An entropic risk measure is a convex risk measure with penalty function given by a relative entropy between two measures 
                        
                           P
                           
                              θ
                           
                        
                      and 
                        P
                     . It is related to an exponential premium principle in actuarial science, (see, for example, Gerber, 1979 and Goovaerts, De Vylder, and Haezendonck, 1984 for an excellent exposition of an exponential premium principle). Entropic risk measures were discussed by a number of authors from the mathematical and financial perspectives, (see, for example, Föllmer and Schied, 2002; Frittelli, 2000; Frittelli and Rosazza-Gianin, 2002, and Barrieu and El Karoui, 2005; Barrieu, El Karoui, and Carmona, 2009 and Föllmer and Knispel, 2011). Here an entropic risk measure resembling to the ones used in Siu (2012) and Siu and Shen (2014), for example, is adopted.

It is known that the relative entropy between the two measures

                        Recalling that the entropic risk measure is related to an exponential premium principle in actuarial science, it may be interesting to explore the use of the results derived in this section to provide FPDIE and PDIE representations for exponential premiums of insurance claims in non-Markovian and Markovian cases, respectively.
