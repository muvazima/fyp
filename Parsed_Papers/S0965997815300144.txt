                  The objective of this research was to use finite element modeling and simulations to evaluate the ballistic resistance of woven fabrics and soft body armor. In the work of this paper, nonlinear finite element (FE) simulations were performed to evaluate the response of single- and multi-layer woven fabrics under ballistic impacts. A shell-element based fabric material model was first validated using perforation tests performed on a single-layer fabric under high-velocity impact by a spherical steel projectile. The validated model was then used to replicate high- and low-velocity impacts by a blunt aluminum projectile on eight-layer Kevlar targets. Results from the multi-layer simulations were shown to have good agreement with experimental data. Finally, the validated fabric model was used to simulate a full-scale ballistic test on a groin protector panel of the interceptor body armor system. The simulation results of both the single- and multi-layer impacts were shown to match well with experimental data in terms of the projectile's residual velocities. This research confirms the effectiveness of the fabric model and can be extended to a wide range of applications involving soft body armors.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Woven fabrics have been employed as protective materials for hundreds of years. Modeling these materials has been a difficult task due to the complex nature of both the fiber material and the woven structure [1]. Woven fabrics are generally made of strands, or yarns, of a particular material woven in a cross-hatched pattern consisting of ‘warp’ and ‘fill’ yarns. Typically, fabrics are characterized by the geometry of the weave as well as the material used. Despite the firm understanding of the characteristics of the yarn material, determining the bulk behavior of fabrics remains a challenge and is still under investigation.

Since the 1950s, extensive experiments have been conducted in the interest of capturing and studying the behavior of woven fabrics under ballistic impacts, accompanied by theoretical study and model development. In an early work by Susich et al. [2], they studied the impact points on a nylon sheet that had been perforated by a 0.22 caliber projectile, and characterized the behavior of multiple sheets. Wilde et al. [3] investigated the behavior of nylon during ballistic penetration using high-speed photographic equipment. Laible and Demommee [4] conducted experiments on the ballistic protection of Kevlar and fiberglass laminates; they found that Kevlar was superior in projectile containment. Prosser et al. [5] performed projectile perforation tests in which optical sensors were used to capture the fabric responses. In the experimental studies of ballistic impacts, high-speed photography was often used to capture projectiles’ perforations and fabric responses [6,7]. Under the direction of the U.S. Department of Transportation, multiple studies have been conducted to assess the performance of Kevlar and Twaron fabrics in resisting impacts and penetrations [8,9], with focus on high-speed imaging and numerical modeling of aircraft engine containment structures.

Given the challenges in testing woven fabrics under ballistic impacts, various modeling approaches have been employed to study their behavior. These modeling efforts can be divided into two major categories: analytical and numerical [10]. In analytical models, well-established principles of continuum mechanics are used to develop constitutive models to predict the general behavior of fabrics. Early efforts in the development of analytical models for woven fabrics began in the 1970s, as seen in the work by Wilde et al. [3] in which a simplified mechanical model was developed to predict the energy loss of the projectile. Vinson and Zukas [11] formulated a stepwise procedure for determining the strains, projectile positions, forces, and accelerations for impacts on both nylon and Kevlar fabrics. Leech [12] developed a model for studying the eigen frequencies and Floquet waves of cloths and nets using Hamilton's principle and Fourier representations. While these early models sufficed for the time, more complex and comprehensive models were developed in the 1990s. Parga-Landa et al. [13] developed a comprehensive analytical model based on conservation of momentum to predict the velocity history of the projectile. Three primary friction forces were identified: projectile-fabric, inter-layer, and yarn intersection frictions, with yarn intersection friction being the primary cause of the observed strain gradients. Benloulo et al. [14] incorporated a time-dependent failure criterion into the model by Parga-Landa et al. [13] with an assumption that any energy lost by the projectile must be equal to the energy transferred into the fabric (i.e., drag was neglected). Billion and Robinson [15] developed an analytical model of a projectile in non-homogeneous, or hybrid, packs of fabrics based on a linear prediction of kinetic energy loss as a function of projectile penetration depth. Hou et al. [16] developed an analytical model for a three-dimensionally woven fabric incorporating yarns woven perpendicularly to the typical weave plane. An analytical model was developed to calculate the energy absorption of the yarns as well as the deformed shape of the fabric at point of impact. Due to the complex nature of fabrics, there is currently no single, agreed-upon analytical model that can be generally applied to a wide range of fabric materials.

Numerical methods, specifically the finite element (FE) method, provide a practical means of finding a solution to studying the fabric behavior [17]. With explicit modeling of the fabric components, this approach can capture particular phenomena such as yarn interactions and crimping that may cause difficulty to the analytical methods. Freeston and Claus [18] developed a wave-centric fabric model in which strains in individual yarns were described by strain wave reflections at yarn intersections. Roylance [19] used a single-yarn numerical model to study wave propagation and its effect on strain. In the work by Roylance et al. [20], they developed a numerical model to address many of the shortcomings of impact-related numerical models. Based on the previous work on single yarns, Roylance et al. [21] developed a model for an entire sheet of woven nylon fabric. The model stepped away from their previous work in which fabric cross-overs were modeled as pin joints and slippage at the fiber joints was incorporated. Multiple layers of fabric were handled by simply increasing the density of the fabric in the model and did not account for inter-layer friction or slippage. Shim et al. [22] developed a model that had similar underlying formulation to that of Roylance et al. [20], but used a different approach in determining the properties of fibers. The fiber properties were determined using a four-element viscoelastic model that was developed by Termonia and Smith [23] for modeling polymer responses. The model was validated using perforation tests and showed significant improvement over the model developed by Roylance et al. [20].

All of the aforementioned models relied on some assumptions regarding the weave geometry and yarn interaction. In the work by Shockey et al. [8], a full three-dimensional (3D) model was developed to explicitly represent all yarns using solid elements. Despite its high complexity, this model could generate realistic behaviors without making major assumptions. The development of 3D models was also seen in the work by Tarfaoui and Akesbi [24] to characterize other weave configurations, i.e., twill weaves. D'Amato [25] modelled a unit cell consisting of three intersecting yarns in the tri-axial weaves of a carbon fiber composite. To study the friction effects at yarn crossovers, Duan et al. [26] modeled a plain weave fabric using solid elements and conducted impact simulations with various boundary conditions. While 3D models generally had good accuracies, the implementation of such models was found to be impractical for design engineers to use. Simons et al. [27] sought to optimize the solution process of the model previously developed by Shockey et al. [8] using a commercial solver. Lim et al. [28] developed a model for LS-DYNA utilizing membrane elements and relying on a strain-rate dependent, isotropic elastic-plastic material model to account for the viscoelastic properties of yarns as well as strain-rate dependent failures.

Currently, the numerical modeling of woven fabrics has evolved into simplified micro-mechanical models. In this approach, a representative volume cell (RVC) is characterized and used in repetition to model an entire sheet. For example, in the work by Teng et al. [29], a sheet of fabric was reduced to its smallest, periodically repeating sub-domain consisting of an intersection of one warp yarn and one fill yarn. Early development of an RVC-based numerical method was seen in the work of Dasgupta et al. [30], which was primarily focused on the thermo and thermo-mechanical properties of woven fabrics. Tan et al. [31] developed an RVC model utilizing a sinusoidal beam approximation for yarns to predict the failure strengths of various yarn configurations in tensile loading conditions. Tabiei and Ivanov [32] implemented an RVC-based model into LS-DYNA in an effort to accurately capture the yarn locking and packing before the elastic properties of yarns played a role in energy absorption. Building on their previous work, Ivanov and Tabiei [33] implemented a second model to implement the crimping behavior of the yarns as well as contact forces and frictions at fiber crossovers. Boisse et al. [34] used the RVC technique to study various weave geometries under quasi-static loading conditions. Xue et al. [35] developed a constitutive model based on the microstructure of the fabric using a unit cell technique, which allowed for calculating shear deformations due to the trellising effect. One novel technique developed, termed multi-scale modeling, combined 2D and 3D models [36] so that models with high accuracy in terms of point-of-impact behavior could be explored at a far less computational cost than a full-scale 3D model [37].

In the current work, numerical models of single- and multi-layer Kevlar woven fabric sheets were created in LS-DYNA based on the work by Ivanov and Tabiei [33]. The single-layer model was first used in simulations of impacts by a steel ball under various impact velocities and validated using experimental data. The numerical model of an eight-layer fabric was then used to simulate the impacts by an aluminum cylinder at various impact velocities and the results were also validated against experimental data. Finally, an experiment was performed in which a 9-mm bullet was fired at both single- and multi-layer Kevlar woven fabric sheets used in production body armor. The fabric model was then used to simulate this experiment to demonstrate real-world applicability of the numerical model.

In this section, the viscoelastic loose fabric model in LS-DYNA (MAT 234) is introduced [38]. This fabric model was developed based on the work by Ivanov and Tabiei [33] for polymer fabrics in impact and other high-strain rate applications. In this fabric model, the RVC approach was used to capture both the reorientation of the yarn matrix during impact and the viscoelastic properties of the individual yarns. Fig. 1
                      illustrates a single crossover point of a warp yarn and a fill yarn, with the geometric parameters given by the span or yarn length (L), fabric thickness (t), yarn width (w), and yarn cross-sectional area (S). These parameters and the initial angle between yarns were provided as user-specified material parameters.

The primary source of energy dissipation in woven fabrics is the viscoelastic behavior of the yarns. Most soft body armor in use consists of polymeric materials that require accurate modeling of the viscoelastic response of the fabric at room temperature. The material model MAT_234 in LS-DYNA used a three-element viscoelastic model to model the tensile response of the yarns, as shown in Fig. 2.
                        
                     

The first element, a, is a Maxwell element without a dashpot and accounts for primary bond failures. The second element, b, is a Kelvin–Voigt element and accounts for the secondary bond failures. The differential equation of viscoelasticity can be written as

                        where d is half of the distance between the centerlines of a fill and warp yarn, L is the yarn length at a joint, and S is the cross-sectional area of the yarn. Details and the equations and calculations of yarn strains and stresses can be found in Ref. [33]. The equilibrium equation at each time step is solved numerically in LS-DYNA using the Newton–Raphson method.

The employment of the RVC technique allows the material model to capture the trellis-like response of yarn intersections. The warp and fill yarns initially form an angle, e.g., with a braid angle of 90° for plain weave fabrics. During deformation, the yarns may rotate to a certain angle at which point the geometry of the yarns allows no further rotation. At the point of maximum rotation, the fabric is considered ‘packed’ and the trellis is to be collapsed. The packing process is illustrated in Fig. 3
                        . The maximum rotational angle, or the locking angle, of the yarns is governed purely by the geometry of the yarns.

The locking angle can be determined using the initial angle (assumed to be 45° for a plain woven fabric), the width (w), and the span (s) as

The rotational angles of the yarns were determined at each time-step in the material models. Details on calculating the rotational angles can be found in Ref. [33]. The consideration of this rotational angle allows for the implementation of rotational friction at the intersection. Although the rotational friction is often neglected, the energy dissipated through friction in impacts, especially in low-speed impacts, is believed to be high and should be considered in simulation models. To implement the rotational friction, the yarns are approximated as overlapping bands with some contact area, and the friction moment is given by

The material model for woven fabric was first validated using the experimental work on a single sheet of Twaron fabric, which had nearly identical material properties to Kevlar 129 [22]. In this experiment, a steel projectile, which was 9.0 mm in diameter and weighed 3.5 g, was shot toward a 110 × 120 mm sheet of plain-weave Twaron clamped along the 110-mm edges. The tests were conducted at different impact speeds ranging from 140 to 420 m/s at 10 m/s intervals. A laser-photodiode system was employed to record the pre- and post-perforation velocities of the projectile.
                        
                     

The FE model of a single sheet of Twaron fabric was generated, as shown in Fig. 4, with the size and thickness matching the test sample. Square membrane elements were used with a mesh size of 1.3 mm. All six degrees of freedom of the nodes along the shorter edges were constrained to represent the clamped fixture in the experiment. Table 1
                         summarizes the material properties assigned to the fabric model. The spherical steel projectile was modeled using shell elements with a sufficiently dense mesh to accurately capture the curvature. Given its unnoticeable deformation in the experiments, an elastic material model was used for the steel projectile. The contact between the projectile and fabric was handled by the automatic-general-interior contact in LS-DYNA for its good numerical stability and ability to handle edge contacts as well as self-interaction of the fabric layer. Based on a comprehensive study on friction of Kevlar by Martinez et al. [39], the coefficients of static and dynamic friction were chosen as 0.5 and 0.25, respectively, for the Kevlar–steel interaction. Per recommendations of Ivanov and Tabiei [33], a small damping coefficient was included in the simulation to account for damping due to air resistance.

A total of 29 simulations were run at initial velocities ranging from 140 to 420 m/s with an increment of 10 m/s. The residual velocities (i.e., post-impact velocities) of the projectile and the absorbed energy (i.e., the energy loss of the projectile) were obtained from the 29 simulations and plotted with their respective initial velocities in Fig. 5. The residual velocities were measured at 200 μs from the beginning of the simulation.

Four distinctive regions were observed from the results in Fig. 5, from both the experiments and simulations. For the first region, the projectile had initial velocities from 140 to 180 m/s and was captured by the fabric and can be seen in the 170 m/s impact case in Fig. 6
                        . The transition from capture to perforation was clear in the experimental data at 180 m/s, marked by a significant increase in residual velocity. The simulation data did not exhibit as clear a transition as seen from experimental data, but the downward trend corresponded to the contained projectile and the transition point was within 10 m/s of the experimental data. In the work of Shim et al. [22], there was no clear indication of how the non-zero residual velocities for the captured cases were measured in the experiments. Therefore, for the captured cases, this study was focused on the post-impact deformations of the woven fabric from simulation results, which were compared to experimental observations. To this end, the residual velocities of the captured cases from simulation results were not very indicative.

The initial velocities from approximately 190–270 m/s constituted the second region, a low-speed perforation region corresponding to 30–130 J of initial energy. As noted by Shim et al. [22], this region exhibited large deformations and high-energy absorption that was linearly related to the initial kinetic energy.

The third region was identified as a transitional region with initial velocities from 270 to 310 m/s: the fabric response evolved from high-energy absorption and large deformation to low-energy absorption and small deformation. Both the simulation results and experimental data by Shim et al. [22] showed a clear trend of dramatically increased residual velocities compared to the initial velocities. Fig. 7
                         shows the deformed fabric for the case of the 290 m/s impact. While this velocity is on the upper end of the low-speed regime, it effectively illustrates a characteristic low-speed displacement profile with a large deformation observed before perforation. More importantly, the simulation results exhibited a well-defined transition region similar to the one observed in experiments, indicating that the model was capable of capturing complex behaviors of the fabric.

The fourth region, which was from 310 to 420 m/s and corresponded to 170–320 J of initial energy, encompassed the high-speed response of the fabric. In this region, very little energy was absorbed by the fabric and the residual velocities of the projectile had a linear correlation with the initial velocities, as seen from both simulation results and experimental data. It can be seen from the energy plot in Fig. 5 that the simulation and experimental curves did not match well before they eventually converge at 420 m/s. While the experimental data showed a decreasing trend of energy absorption in relation to the initial velocity, the simulation results showed a nearly flat curve of absorbed energy in this high-speed response region. Nevertheless, the fabric response from simulation results matched the observations by Shim et al. [22]: the projectile perforated relatively cleanly through the sheet and a distinct deformation cone was no longer present. As seen in the case of the 390 m/s impact (Fig. 8
                        ), the small deformation surrounding the impact point is characteristic of a high-speed response and is also in agreement with the low measured absorbed energy.

Overall, the simulation results for the single-layer penetrations indicated good applicability of the FE model to fabric impact problems. Compared to experimental data, the low-speed response was found to be more accurate than the high-speed response with respect to energy absorption. The residual velocities predicted by the simulations matched well to experimental data. The deviation of simulation results from the experimental data in the high-speed tests could be attributed to a handful of factors. Primarily, since the material model was incapable of capturing the yarn pull-out behavior, it predicted a reduced energy absorption by not accounting for the friction during yarn pull-out. Ivanov and Tabiei [33] also noted that the thickness of the fabric sheet did not have a true physical analog; rather it was an estimated term based on the individual yarn thickness, as well as crimping at yarn intersections. This, along with other unknowns, could reasonably account for the mismatch in high-speed energy absorption. Nevertheless, the results had an overall good fit to experimental data; this warranted the usage of the FE model in subsequent simulations.

To further determine the applicability of the FE model, simulations were carried out on tests of multi-layer Kevlar fabrics. As observed in the single-layer testing, the projectile penetrated the fabric at nearly all velocities. For woven fabric to be a viable solution in body armor, it must be assembled in multiple layers. Woven-fabric armors typically consist of at least eight layers and often 28 or more layers. These multi-layer configurations have a new energy absorption mechanism due to inter-layer frictions, which can dramatically change the body armor behavior.

Starrett [7] performed a range of experiments on 8- and 16-layer Kevlar targets impacted by aluminum projectiles of varying masses and tip shapes. The initial and residual velocities of the projectile were recorded and the impact tests were captured using high-speed video. In this section, the FE fabric model was evaluated using the experimental configurations to further determine its applicability to full-scale simulations of multi-layer armors. Simulations were conducted on two cases in the work by Starrett [7] in which eight-layer Kevlar 129 fabric targets were impacted by blunt-tipped 6061-T6 aluminum cylinders that measured 5.38 mm in diameter and weighed 2.79 g. The eight-layer fabrics were stitched together along all four corners to reduce slippage of the interior fabric layers during impact. The targets measured 200 mm × 200 mm and were clamped to a stationary fixture along two parallel edges, with the other two edges unrestrained. The projectiles were shot toward the center of the target at initial velocities of 267 and 428 m/s, respectively. For the case of 267 m/s, the aluminum projectile was fully contained by the eight-layer Kevlar fabric. In the case of 428 m/s, the experiment resulted in a full perforation, allowing the measurement of residual velocity. In both cases, the tips of the aluminum projectiles were found to deform slightly after impacts.

The FE model of the eight-layer fabric, shown in Fig. 9
                        , was similar to the single-layer model in that each layer was meshed with 1.3 mm square membrane elements. The eight layers were then arranged on top of one another to create the final assembly with each layer in direct contact with the adjacent layers. The boundary conditions of the eight-layer model were the same as the single-layer one, i.e., the two vertical edges were fully constrained and the two horizontal edges were free. The projectile, which had a blunt or flat tip, was modeled using shell elements of sufficiently small size to capture the cylindrical shape. An elastic material with properties corresponding to 6061-T6 aluminum was assigned to the cylinder to capture the small deformations observed by Starrett [7]. Given the anticipated severe deformations and the large number of nonlinear contacts between the projectile and the fabric as well as between the fabric layers, the general interior contact algorithm was employed for its accuracy and stability in such scenarios.

Similar to the single-layer case, the coefficients of static and dynamic frictions were defined as 0.5 and 0.25, respectively, between the projectile and fabric. The mutual dynamic friction coefficient between the fabric layers 0.5. A damping coefficient was assigned to the fabric to account for air resistance. In this case, the damping coefficient was larger than that used in the single-layer model with consideration of the air-buffer between adjacent layers of the eight-layer fabric. Consequently, there would be more damping due to air in a multi-layer impact than that in a single-layer impact. Because it was very difficult, if not impossible, to implement the true effect of air resistance in LS-DYNA, a reasonable damping coefficient was deemed appropriate to account for this effect.

Nonlinear FE simulations were performed and the time histories of the displacements and velocities of the projectile were extracted from simulation results. For the impact at 267 m/s, the projectile was contained by the fabric; this was in agreement with the experimental observations. At 200 μs, the residual velocity was 60.3 m/s in the simulation while it was approximately 57.6 m/s in the experiment (see Fig. 10
                        ). While the residual velocity in the simulation was within 5.2% error compared to experimental data, the velocity histories of both low- and high-speed cases showed some variations during the first 75 μs. The simulation results showed a more rapid reduction in velocity than that in the experiment. As time progressed, both curves showed a trend toward a gradual, linear slope and became nearly overlaying within the last 50 μs. Over the duration of the impact, the displacements of the projectile were slightly less than those from the experiment, indicating less projectile penetration predicted by the simulation (see Fig. 11
                        ). The smaller penetration depth can be attributed to the more rapid reduction in velocity observed during the initial stages of impact. Nevertheless, both sets of data matched very closely and the ultimate penetration depth of the projectile was 24.5 mm from the simulation, while it was 24.8 mm from the experiment. Successive states of the simulation at 25 μs intervals are shown in Fig. 12
                        . In line with observations by Starrett [7], the deformation region assumed a pyramidal shape.

For the high-speed (428 m/s) impact, simulation results were also comparable to experimental data. The projectile was observed to fully penetrate all layers in the simulation and retain a majority of its velocity. The velocity history in Fig. 10 showed the simulation results again dropping faster than the experimental results during the first 50 μs of impact. After the penetration, the simulation results showed a residual velocity of 316 m/s while the experimental result was approximately 324 m/s, approximately a 2.5% difference. The displacement histories in Fig. 11 for both the simulation and experiment showed a nearly linear relationship with time, with a slight divergence emerging after 50 μs. Fig. 13
                         shows six successive instances of the projectile at 25 μs intervals in the simulation. Similar to the single-layer case, a notable decrease in the overall deformation around the impact point was evident at high impact velocities. Despite its smaller magnitude, the deformed region assumed a pyramidal shape, which was in agreement with the observations of Starrett [7].

Overall, both the low- and high-speed simulation results agreed well with experimental data. The multi-layer model differed only slightly from the single-layer model in that the viscous damping coefficient was increased. The increase was justified given that there were nine bodies in contact as opposed to two. Unlike the case of the single-layer fabric under high-speed impact, the results of the multi-layer fabric under high-speed impact remained very close to experimental data. This re-convergence may be attributed to the higher energy absorbed in general due to eight layers of fabric in contact. The velocity loss of the projectile due to air resistance was calculated by Starratt [7] and found to be less than 1 m/s. Although neglecting air resistance could incur some errors, the overall results from the multi-layer simulations further demonstrate the applicability of the FE model to complex impact scenarios involving woven fabrics.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

At present, the evaluation of soft body armor is entirely experiment-based. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) has a set of standards on testing the ballistic resistance of body armor [40]. These standards outline the classifications of different types of armor as well as specific conditions and testing configurations for approval. Although the current NIJ standards do not allow numerical results served as evidence for soft armor's ballistic resistance, numerical evaluation of body armor could provide insights to manufacturers and help improve the design of body armor. To this end, the fabric FE model validated in the preceding work was used on production soft body armor to further investigate its applicability as well as to study the behavior of fabric armor.

Soft body armor is produced by many manufacturers for a wide range of end users. Of particular interest is the primary line of armor in use by U.S. Armed Forces known as the interceptor body armor (IBA), which consists of an outer vest, deltoid protectors, side protectors, and a groin protector. Among the IBA components, the groin protector was selected for testing. The groin protector is composed of 28 layers of Kevlar KM2 fabric contained within a Nylon sleeve. The protector attaches to the lower portion of the outer vest and hangs approximately 12 in. below the attachment point, providing coverage of the pelvic region. The dimensions of the groin protector are shown in Fig. 14
                         
                        [41]. The relatively small size of the groin protector combined with its tapering shape made it a good candidate for comparing simulation predictions with experimental results.

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

Selection of a projectile was driven by the desire to maintain a high level of realism. While validation studies typically employ gas guns for high precision, armor in use would unlikely be subjected to those types of impacts. In 1982, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) agreed on a standard type of small arms ammunition, which had a cartridge of 9-mm diameter with a parabola tip known as the 9 × 19 NATO or 9 × 19 Parabellum [42]. Since the 1980s, the 9 × 19 NATO has been used extensively by many governments around the world, including the U.S. military. These factors, along with the wide availability, led to the choice of 9 × 19 NATO cartridge for testing. The particular configuration used in this test was a standard pressure, aluminum cased, 115 grain copper-coated solid lead round. While designed to be used in barrels as short as 3 in., the round was fired from a 16 in. barrel with a 1:16 twist to ensure all propellant was fully combusted at the time the projectile left the barrel.

Testing was conducted at an indoor facility to minimize environmental unknowns. The groin protector was fixed to a steel frame by its top and bottom edges, as shown in Fig. 15
                        . The sides and angular edges were left unrestrained. The target was positioned two feet from the end of the barrel. Data acquisition equipment consisted of an IDT RedLake MotionXtra HG-XR high-speed video camera that was capable of recording at 10,000 frames/s. The camera was positioned perpendicular to the line of projectile travel to capture the projectile's motion and the target deformation. The projectile's velocity was calculated using positional measurements from the video data.

Two different tests were conducted using the groin protector. Previous simulations indicated that 28 layers would likely contain the projectile. To enable more accurate initial and residual velocity measurements, it was determined the testing should allow full penetration of the projectile. By this approach, the projectile's residual velocity could be recorded and the energy absorbed by the target could be evaluated. To allow full penetration of the projectile, the groin protector was disassembled into a single-layer target and an eight-layer target. The single-layer test was mainly used to evaluate the material properties. The eight-layer target was used to evaluate the fabric material model with focus on layer interaction. The combination of the two tests was expected to provide sufficient results to evaluate the effectiveness of the fabric material model in modeling production fabric armor.

The simulations were configured to replicate the experimental conditions as closely as possible. For both the singe-layer and the eight-layer test, the MAT_234 material model was used for the KM2 fabric with material properties given in Table 2
                        . Geometric parameters of the yarns were assumed to be similar to those of the Kevlar 129 and were left unchanged from previous simulations. Nodes along the top and bottom edges of the target were fixed for all six degrees of freedom, and nodes on the other two sides were left unconstrained. The target was meshed with 1.3 mm square elements, with the angled edges left in a ‘jagged’ state. Because the point of impact was sufficiently far from these edges, this approach would not introduce any significant error. The FE model of the eight-layer fabric target is shown in Fig. 16.
                        
                        
                     

The projectile was modeled based on dimensions from the NATO Standard Agreement (STANAG) 4090 [42]. A variable mesh was used to accurately capture the parabolic shape of the tip. An elastic material model (MAT_001) was used with the properties of lead. An initial velocity was prescribed on all the nodes matching the recorded velocity from the experimental data. Because the barrel used in the experiment was rifled, an angular rotation was imparted on the projectile. However, based on the thickness of the targets and the rate of rotation, the projectile was found to rotate 0.028° while in contact with the target. This rotation was deemed negligible and was not incorporated into the FE model.

For the test of the single-layer fabric, the target after impact is shown in Fig. 17. The initial velocity of the projectile was recorded to be 488 m/s. The impact generated a relatively clean, round hole with a few broken yarns protruding from the rear side of the target. The weave directly surrounding the hole appeared to be packed while the rest of the target appeared unchanged. Yarns oriented horizontally and vertically from the center of impact were observed to undergo some degree of pull-out. No slippage was noticed in the fixture. Using the high-speed video data, the residual velocity of the projectile was determined to be 486 m/s, indicating 14.5 J of energy absorbed by the target.

The results from the FE simulation were in close agreement with the experimental data. The residual velocity of the projectile was found to be 486.5 m/s, indicating 10.9 J of energy absorption by the target. The target of the simulation after impact is also shown in Fig. 17. The simulation model showed a similar, small round hole in the target center. Although the model was incapable of simulating yarn pull-out, elements along the vertical and horizontal lines from the center of impact exhibited high stress values and some elements even reached the failure stress. This behavior served as an evidence of the model capturing the crimping of yarns. The general deformation of the target also appeared to extend horizontally and vertically from the point of impact. These results indicated that the model could replicate the bulk response of the fabric observed from the experiment. The velocity histories of the projectiles in the experiment and simulation are shown in Fig. 18
                        . Because the velocity in the experiment was extracted from positional measurements, there were limited data points regarding the specific behavior of the projectile as the velocity was lost. A close inspection of the deceleration region showed that the residual velocities in the experiment and simulation were very close to one another. Overall, the results from the single-layer simulation matched the experimental data quite well.

For the eight-layer test, the projectile was observed to fully penetrate all layers of the target. Similar to the single-layer target, the eight-layer target exhibited a small, round hole at the point of impact. The front and back sides of the target after impact are shown in Fig. 19
                        . The initial velocity was recorded as 488 m/s. The yarns directly surrounding the impact point appeared to be packed with the rest of the weave unchanged. Yarn pull-out was again observed originating horizontally and vertically from the point of impact. The degree of pull-out decreased from layer to layer toward the rear of the target with no discernible pull-out on the last layer. From the high-speed video data, the residual velocity of the projectile was determined to be 451 m/s, which equated to 258.9 J of energy absorbed by the fabric. No slippage between the target and the frame was observed.

Results from the eight-layer simulation agreed well with the experimental data, though not to the extent of the single-layer results. The residual velocity of the projectile was 471 m/s, within 6% difference compared to experimental data. The velocity history of the projectile in the simulation compared to that in the experiment is shown in Fig. 18. Based on the velocity, the energy loss of the projectile was calculated as 121.5 J. This large discrepancy of energy absorption is mainly due to the use of an elastic material for the projectile, which did not account for the large deformation upon impacting the eight-layer target. Similar to the experimental results, the simulation model showed the majority of the residual deformation as a small hole at the point of impact with little deformation observed throughout the rest of the target. The rear of the target exhibited slightly more deformation than observed in the experiment. Despite the model's inability of simulating yarn pull-out, the deformations appeared to extend along the horizontal and vertical lines passing through the point of impact. These were the same areas that yarn pull-outs were observed.

For further analysis, still images were extracted from the high-speed footage for comparison with successive deformation states available from the FE simulation results. Successive states at 100 μs intervals are shown in Fig. 20
                         for the single-layer case. Both the experiment and the simulation indicated approximately 15 mm of displacement in the target. In general, the shape of the deformed region predicted by the simulation maintained a pyramidal shape, and this was also observed in the experiment. The experimental images clearly show the broken yarns, which were not fully represented in the model due to the use of shell elements with bulk material properties.

                         shows the successive deformation states at 100 μs intervals for the eight-layer case. A displacement of approximately 10 mm was observed in both the simulation and the experiment. The shape of the deformed region, however, varied slightly from the experiment to the simulation. The experimental images showed a flatter wave front while the simulation images showed a more conical shape.

As previously discussed, this could mainly be caused by the elastic material model, which resulted in an under-estimated deformation of the projectile. Another factor that could account for the observed discrepancy in deformation shapes is the air between layers. The presence of air could affect the transfer of energy from layer to layer thus changing the shape of the impact wave. The degree to which the air could be a significant factor, however, remains unknown. Ultimately, the simulation predictions matched the experimental results reasonably well for both the single-layer and the eight-layer fabric targets.

In this study, FE analysis with a woven fabric material model was used to evaluate the applicability of a developed FE model in predicting the behavior of single- and multi-layer woven fabrics under ballistic impact. Nonlinear FE simulations were performed on various fabric configurations and projectile geometries over a range of impact velocities. As a culmination, the FE model was employed to predict the behavior of a ballistic impact on production body armor to demonstrate the viability of the model in real-world applications.

The FE model was first validated using experimental data of single-layer perforation on Kevlar sheets. Based on a comparison of the initial and residual velocities of the projectile, the model was determined to be capable of capturing the behavior of the fabric throughout its various response regimes. In particular, the model captured large deformations during low-speed perforations with a high level of energy being absorbed by the fabric. The model was also shown capable of capturing the high-speed impact response during which very little deformation was observed and the energy absorption was at a minimum. Moreover, the transition from low-speed to high-speed response predicted by the model matched that from the experimental data. The FE model was then employed in predicting the response of multi-layer fabrics at both a low and high velocity. Experimental data from impact tests on eight-layer Kevlar fabric were used to validate results of FE simulations that were performed with matching initial conditions of the experiments. In both the low-velocity non-penetrating test and the high-velocity penetrating test, the simulation results were within 5% difference compared to experimental data. Despite the added complexity of the behavior by the system of layers, it was concluded that the model would be capable of predicting the behavior of assemblies of fabric sheets.

Finally, with validation completed in both single- and multi-layer configurations, the fabric material model was employed in simulations on a piece of production soft body armor impacted by a standard 9 mm lead projectile. The simulation results were validated using experiments in which high-speed imaging equipment was used to capture the response of the fabric as well as the residual velocity of the projectile through positional measurements. The initial impact velocity observed in the experiment was used in the simulations of both single- and multi-layer tests. The residual velocities predicted by the FE models were within 6% difference compared to the recorded residual velocities for both tests conducted.

From the work of this paper, it was shown that the developed FE model in conjunction with material model MAT_234 in LS-DYNA was capable of capturing the behavior of woven fabrics with both single- and multi-layer configurations. Specifically, the model accurately predicted both the low-speed and high-speed response of the fabric, despite the fact that these two responses are different. Moreover, the deformation behavior around the point of impact was also accurately predicted by the model. The pyramidal wave front observed in all experiments was evident in all simulations. Lastly, the experiment conducted proved that the model was applicable for evaluating full-scale soft body armor using the finite element method. Due to the neglect of yarn pull-out effects, there exists room for future improvement such as the implementation of a yarn pull-out mechanism while maintaining the shell-element configuration. Nevertheless, this material model shows applicability in evaluating other types of armor, such as vests. The usefulness of this material model may extend further into such areas as optimizing armor behavior through specifically tuning individual material properties and thus developing guidelines for designing armor materials. The relative ease with which hundreds of simulations can be completed in place of experiments allows nearly unlimited armor configurations to be evaluated. Ultimately, the use of such FE modeling and simulation may lead to rapid advancements in the life-saving capabilities of body armor.
