                  The cardiovascular and respiratory autonomic nervous regulation has been studied mainly by hemodynamic responses during different physical stressors. In this study, dynamics of autonomic response to an orthostatic challenge was investigated by hemodynamic variables and by diverse linear and nonlinear indices calculated from time series of beat-to-beat intervals (BBI), respiratory cycle duration (RESP), systolic (SYS) and diastolic (DIA) blood pressure. This study included 16 young female patients (SYN) with vasovagal syncope and 12 age-matched female controls (CON). The subjects were enrolled in a head-up tilt (HUT) test, breathing normally, including 5min of baseline (BL, supine position) and 18min of 70° orthostatic phase (OP). To increase the time resolution of the analysis the time series were segmented in five-minute overlapping windows with a shift of 1min. Hemodynamic parameters did not show any statistical differences between SYN and CON. Time domain linear analysis revealed increased respiratory frequency and increased blood pressure variability (BPV) in patients during OP meaning increased sympathetic activity and vagal withdrawal. Frequency domain analysis confirmed a predominance of sympathetic tone by steadily increased values of low over high frequency power in BBI and of low frequency power in SYS and DIA in patients during OP. The nonlinear analysis by symbolic dynamics seemed to be highly suitable for differentiation of SYN and CON in the early beginning of OP, i.e., 5min after tilt-up. In particular the index SYS_plvar3 showed less patterns of low variability in patients reflecting a steadily increase in both BPV and sympathetic activity. The proposed dynamical analysis could lead to a better understanding of the temporal underlying mechanisms in healthy subjects and patients under orthostatic stress.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is a temporal loss of consciousness due to a reduction in cerebral blood flow by an orthostatic stress being the women the more probably population to report syncopal episodes [1]. In clinical practice evaluation of autonomic function associated with VVS is routinely performed by means of the head-up tilt (HUT) test. The HUT test, in which the subject undergoes a change of position very quickly from supine to certain tilt or orthostatic phase (OP), causes a reduction in venous return leading to diminished stroke volume and cardiac output. To maintain blood pressure, the reduction in stroke volume must be compensated for by reflex mechanisms that increase total peripheral resistance. Otherwise, blood pressure falls leading to cerebral hypoperfusion and syncope [2]. VVS has been studied from different points of view using unmedicated or medicated HUT to understand its underlying physiological mechanisms or to predict possible syncopal episodes. In 2013, Forleo et al. published a review of HUT experimental protocols for diagnosing VVS where among other issues it is reported that the sensitivity of the test increases as the duration of the OP increases [3]. From the signal processing point of view, acquired cardiovascular and respiratory time series have been analyzed mainly by linear techniques and by some nonlinear techniques using one temporal window at supine, tilt and recovery phases. Furthermore, in analysis of cardiovascular variability, indices derived from linear techniques have been standardized [4] but in the case of nonlinear indices their usefulness is still under research.

In 1997, Lipsitz et al. [5] studied a cohort of healthy subjects, in a HUT test protocol, with a maneuver of paced breathing followed by spontaneous breathing. The authors found highly periodic blood pressure rhythms in those healthy subjects that later developed syncope, suggesting an unstable physiological control network that predisposes individuals to circulatory collapse. Nowadays, researches point out that clinicians should be aware of the prognostic implications of the variability in blood pressure [6]. In fact, Rickards et al. in 2014 published a review focused on blood pressure and cerebral flow variability in different health status as risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and end-organ damage from hypertension, among others [7]. In the review, blood pressure variability analysis was performed just close to the syncope event and for healthy subjects. Consequently, more research needs to be done to validate the usefulness of BP variability to improve health outcomes to avoid detrimental consequences on vital organs [7–9].

We hypothesize that univariate linear and nonlinear analysis of segmented cardiovascular and respiratory time series, as performed in this study, may reveal changes in the dynamic of the autonomic regulation response in healthy females and in female patients with VVS, facing an orthostatic challenge. Accordingly, in the present study, under an unmedicated HUT test protocol and including healthy subjects and VVS patients, the aim is three-fold: first, to increase the temporal resolution of the analysis of the HUT test response by a segmentation procedure of cardiovascular and respiratory time series; second, to find representative indices by diverse linear and nonlinear techniques that evidence the time course of fluctuations of sympathetic and vagal activities in both subject groups and third, to elucidate the importance of changes in blood pressure variability for VVS patients and healthy subjects.

@&#METHODS@&#

In this study, 16 female patients diagnosed with vasovagal syncope with a mean age of 26±8 years and 12 age-matched female controls with a mean age of 26±5 years were enrolled. All SYN cases were patients of the National Institute of Cardiology (NIC), at Mexico City, with at least 2 syncope or presyncope episodes within the previous 12 months. Presyncope was determined if the subject experienced weakness, diaphoresis, chills, dizziness and nausea without loss of consciousness. VVS was confirmed by the HUT test. Controls were healthy volunteers with no syncope or presyncope history and negative HUT test. In this study the phase of the menstrual cycle was not controlled; there is a controversy about its influence on the autonomic regulation [10,11]. Studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of the NIC and performed under informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. High-resolution ECG (1000Hz sampling frequency), continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) and impedance cardiography (ICG) were simultaneously recorded using a Task Force Monitor (CNSystems, Graz, Austria). The subject was first adjusted to a tilting table and allowed to accommodate to supine position to guarantee a stable condition. Data recording started with a rest period of 5min in the supine position (baseline – BL). During one minute, the subject underwent a 70° head-up tilt. The duration of the following orthostatic phase (OP) varied between 30 and 40min in case of the controls. Regarding patients, the HUT test was aborted by returning the tilt table back to supine positions if the patient developed symptoms of presyncope during orthostatic phase. This reduced the maximal comparable duration of orthostatic phase between patients and controls down to 18min, see Fig. 1
                        .

Time series of successive beat-to-beat intervals (BBI, tachogram), the time interval between two successive breaths (RESP, respirogram), systolic (SYS, systogram) and diastolic (DIA, diastogram) blood pressure values were extracted from ECG, ICG and CNAP, respectively. All extracted time series were manually reviewed and subsequently corrected for by interpolation of ventricular premature beats and artifacts using an adaptive filter to obtain normal-to-normal beat time series (NN) [12]. Data analysis was performed twofold: in the first analysis we used 20 five-minute overlapping windows with a shift of one minute to investigate the dynamical changes from baseline to and during orthostatic phase, comparing in each window female controls (CON) with female VVS patients (SYN). The 20 windows referred to the following stages: window 1 (baseline – BL), windows 2–6 (transition including one minute of tilt-up to orthostatic phase) and windows 7–20 (orthostatic phase – OP), see Fig. 1. The second analysis included all overlapping five-minute windows (7–20) inside orthostatic phase which were consecutively compared with baseline (BL), separately for each CON and SYN.

The impedance cardiography signal was used to monitor hemodynamic parameters noninvasively. The blood flow in the thorax reflected by the ICG was processed to determine (a) stroke volume (SV) [ml], (b) cardiac output (CO) [L/min], and (c) total peripheral resistance (TPR) [dyne*s/cm5]. The measurement of hemodynamics in addition to heart rate allows clinicians to evaluate autonomic function during orthostatic challenge. In this study, hemodynamic parameters were statistically analyzed in the same way as linear and nonlinear indices.

Various univariate methods based on linear and nonlinear dynamics have been established for the analyses of autonomic regulation. However, most of these methods are primary used for HRV analysis (i.e. BBI) and some have also been applied for the analysis of blood pressure variability (i.e., SYS and DIA) [13,14]. In this study, for cardiovascular and respiratory cycle variability analysis indices were obtained in the time-, frequency- and nonlinear dynamics domains.

HRV and BPV were quantified by calculating linear indices from each tachogram (BBI_*), systogram (SYS_*) and diastogram (DIA_*) in the time and frequency domains (TD, FD) in accordance to the Task Force recommendations [4]. Standard HRV and BPV indices from TD included meanNN, sdNN and rmssd, see Table 1
                              . The TD indices meanNN and sdNN were also calculated from each respirogram (RESP_*).

The FD indices LF, HF, P, HF/P, LFN, HFN and LF/HF were calculated for HRV as well as for BPV, see Table 1. Traditionally it has been reported that LF from HRV analysis reflects mainly sympathetic and to an unknown part vagal activity, whereas HF refers to pure vagal activity. In case of sympatho-vagal balance, the ratio LF/HF has normally values between 1.5 and 2 [4]. The total spectra power P is representative for the total variance of all NN values ≤0.4Hz. The LF band from blood pressure time series reflects only sympathetic modulation of vascular tone [9,15]. The former indices were determined calculating the power spectral density by an autoregressive model, since its intrinsic generality and its capacity to detect formant frequencies.

A well-known physiological phenomenon of cardiovascular coupling is the baroreflex, which is responsible for BBI decelerations (bradycardia) caused by increased systolic blood pressure as well as BBI accelerations (tachycardia) caused by decreased systolic blood pressure [16]. The baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was analyzed through the linear dual sequence method in the TD by the bradycardic and tachycardic slopes of BBI and SYS couplings under defined criteria. In studies with different acquisition protocols, it has been reported that the cardiovascular system is influenced by the ANS, in which increased sympathetic activity leads to decreased HRV, reduced BRS and increased BPV [15,17].

In signal processing, fractals are self-similar patterns that occur as correlated fluctuations over a large range of time scales. A nonlinear method that quantifies the presence or absence of fractal correlation properties in non-stationary time series is the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) [18,19]. First, the discrete NN interval time series NN(i) of the total length N was integrated. Then the integrated time series y(k) (k between 1 and N) was divided into equal and non-overlapping segments of length n. Next, y(k) was detrended by subtracting the local trend y
                              
                                 n
                              (k), determined by using a least-squares regression in each segment. The root-mean-square fluctuation value F(n) of the integrated and detrended time series was calculated as:

Finally, the scaling exponent α was estimated as the slope of the double-log plot of F(n) against n. In this study the classical short-term and long-term fractal scaling exponents α
                              1 and α
                              2 were calculated. It has been reported that a value of α
                              1 from a BBI time series of a healthy subject is about 1 which reflects fractal-like behavior. Values smaller than 1 indicate a loss of fractal-like HR dynamics and more irregular signals as in the case of patients with cardiovascular diseases, whereas values greater than 1 represent more correlated and regular signals [14].

Based on the Zip algorithm for loss-less data compression of signals [20], a modified CE algorithm was introduced that quantifies the extent to which the data from cardiovascular time series can be compressed without any loss of information [21,22]. CE is defined as the ratio of the length M of the compressed and the length L of the original time series and is therefore, a measure for time series irregularity. High CE values reflect low compressible and hence more variable and irregular time series. For the determination of CE an appropriate window length w and a look-ahead buffer of length b have to be defined.

The nonlinear method of SD is suitable for a description of system dynamics and is based on the coarse graining of the original time series by four symbols [23–25]. In this study, the alphabet A={0, 1, 2, 3} was used to transform BBI, SYS, DIA or RESP time series into a symbol sequence according to the following transformation rules:

The cardiac, blood pressure and respiratory fluctuations, caused by vagal and sympathetic activities [14] were investigated by the probability of occurrence “pW” of 64 (43) possible word types consisting of three consecutive symbols, i.e., “000”, “001” … “332” and “333”.

Based on the probability distribution of all word types, a global parameter for cardiovascular and respiratory dynamics, the Renyi entropy of the word distribution, was calculated as:

Another global variability index is pTH1, which determines the number of word types with a probability of occurrence greater than a threshold 1%. For the calculation of further SD indices, another alphabet consisting only of symbols “0” and “1” was used to quantify the occurrence of patterns of low or high variability. Hereby, defined thresholds are used for HRV (τ
                              =2, 5, 10 or 20ms) and BPV (τ

                              The index plvarτ was determined by the probability of occurrence of the word “000000”, which represents even intermittently decreased variability [12]. SD indices evaluated from cardiovascular and respiratory time series are described in Table 1.

In this study the data did not meet the requirements such as normal distribution or variance homogeneity, and therefore we used non-parametric tests for statistical evaluation. First, univariate statistical analysis via non-parametric Mann–Whitney-U-tests were used to determine which of the linear and nonlinear methods discriminated between female controls and female patients with vasovagal syncope in each of the 20 windows [26]. For the second statistical evaluation of univariate differences in all parameters comparing baseline (BL) and consecutive orthostatic phase windows, separately for each CON and SYN, we applied the non-parametric Friedman rank test for repeated measures and subsequently, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for pair-wise comparisons. In addition, adjustments to statistics were performed via multiple testing using the Bonferroni–Holm method to correct the p-values from Wilcoxon-test results. Boxplots were used to graphically represent the dynamic behavior of significant parameters during the HUT test in terms of median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, minimum and maximum value of the data set in each of the 20 windows. The statistics software was SPSS 20.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY) while the significance was subdivided into three levels for descriptive purposes: slightly significant for p
                        <0.05 (*), significant for p
                        <0.01 (**) and highly significant for p
                        <0.001 (***). Regarding Figs. 2–6 and 8
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        , the related statistical results from both analyses were presented next to the boxplots (1st line: CON vs. SYN in each of the 20 windows; 2nd and 3rd line: BL vs. OP windows (7–20) separately for each group). Boxplots figures just for the most representative indices are included in the paper while the statistical values for these and other linear and nonlinear indices that support the discussion are listed in Table 2

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Stroke volume, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were determined dynamically in supine and orthostatic positions, see Fig. 2(a)–(c); Fig. 2(d) shows the statistical results between groups (first row for each hemodynamic variable) as well as between BL and OP. The dynamic results showed that the stroke volume was reduced during the OP from window 7 (first 5min of OP) in comparison with BL and it remained with similar behavior until the end of OP, see Fig. 2(a) and (d). However, no statistical differences were found between groups, i.e., both CON and SYN subjects are affected in similar way. In the case of cardiac output, no significant differences were found neither between BL and OP nor between groups, see Fig. 2(b) and (d). Finally, the total peripheral resistance present in BL was increased from the first 5min of OP with statistical differences in both groups but again no statistical differences were found between groups (see Fig. 2(c, d)). Finally, the total peripheral resistance present in BL was increased from the first 5min of OP with statistical differences in both groups but again no statistical differences were found between groups (see Fig. 2(c, d)). The former results are in line with findings in other researches, e.g., regarding stroke volume, Folino et al. investigated if an increment in sympathetic activity during a 60° OP was reflected by an increase in ventricular contractibility in VVS patients quantified by tissue-Doppler echocardiography. Their results revealed that the left ventricular ejection fraction did not evidence significant variation during HUT in both negative and positive VVS patients [27]. In summary, based on the statistical results the hemodynamic variables included in this study did not expose differences between healthy subjects and patients.

Time domain analysis of HRV showed that the dynamics of BBI_meanNN index revealed a progressive increase of HR from BL in both groups, with smaller variance in patients, implying augmented sympathetic activity, see Fig. 3(a); statistical results are included in the figure. The BBI_rmssd index showed decreased HRV by means of steadily decreased behavior in the course of OP, equally in patients and in controls. This behavior pointed to a steady decline of vagal activity in both groups with reduced variance, and with a tendency of greater decrease of vagal activity, in patients. In fact, the statistical tests showed significantly decreased values for the indices BBI_meanNN and BBI_rmssd for both groups (p
                        <0.01 for CON, p
                        <0.001 for SYN), from the first 5min of OP compared to BL. However, no statistical differences were found between SYN and CON.

Concerning BPV, the TD indices SYS_meanNN and DIA_meanNN were significantly increased in both groups during OP compared to BL (p
                        <0.01 for CON, p
                        <0.001 for SYN). In fact, the statistical values indicated that the orthostatic stress modified significantly the baseline status. However, no statistical differences were found between groups. Regarding SYS_sdNN and DIA_sdNN indices just statistical differences were found for SYN group when baseline was compared with OP windows. Furthermore, SYS_sdNN index showed statistical differences between groups just from windows 12–18 (corresponding to 10–16min after tilt-up). In the case of SYS_rmssd highly statistical differences (p
                        <0.001) between SYN and CON were found, which were sustained through the HUT test, see the statistical results displayed in Fig. 4 and Table 2. From Fig. 4, it can be observed that the BL status of the CON group was not affected by the orthostatic challenge as no statistical differences were found. On the contrary, for the SYN group BL behavior was significantly statistically altered during the complete OP (p
                        <0.01). Also, it is remarkable the time course of the SYN_rmssd index in female patients as reflected by progressively increased SYS_rmssd values with an oscillatory behavior, i.e., the SYN group was highly sensitive to the orthostatic challenge from the first 5min after tilt-up. For diastolic blood pressure variability, the index DIA_rmssd was significantly (p
                        <0.01) increased in SYN during OP compared to CON showing no significant differences compared to BL neither for patients nor for controls. Consequently, in this study statistical significances between groups were found stronger for systolic BPV.

In the case of the respiratory cycle duration, the index RESP_meanNN did not reflect statistical differences between BL and OP windows for any group, see Fig. 5. However, this index time course demonstrated a different pattern of respiratory cycle duration for SYN compared to CON (p
                        <0.001). Therefore, the respiratory cycle duration in SYN was significantly smaller than in CON from the first 5min after tilt up to the end of OP. Frequently, patients developing syncope, experience hyperventilation. Some studies demonstrated in pre-syncopal patients that increasing the depth of respiration results in an enhancement of blood pressure oscillations [28]. This was in line with the dynamic results of this study showing an increased respiratory frequency as well as increased BPV in patients with VVS already in the first 5min of orthostatic phase. Therefore, the time course of the indices RESP_meanNN, SYS_rmssd and DIA_rmssd allows describing the dynamics of the autonomic imbalance in female patients due to orthostatic stress.

A predominance of sympathetic tone was confirmed by frequency domain analysis of segmented cardiovascular time series showing increased values, through the orthostatic challenge for BBI_LF/HF, SYS_LF and DIA_LF in SYN compared to CON. For HRV, the index BBI_LF/HF was significantly (p
                        <0.01) increased in SYN from the first 5min of tilt up to the end of OP with an oscillatory behavior, see Fig. 6(a). It is notable how the orthostatic stress affected in a different way the dynamics of the autonomic balance in CON and SYN. Furthermore, the index revealed statistically unchanged autonomic balance in CON in contrast to highly significant (p
                        <0.001) alterations in SYN during OP when compared to BL, see associated statistical significances at the bottom of Fig. 6(a). To evidence the high sympatho-vagal imbalance in SYN the dynamic behavior of LFN and HFN is shown independently for each group in Fig. 6(b); from the first 5min of tilt up, LFN markedly increases while HFN decreases up to the end of OP. Complementary, in patients, an increase in BBI_LF/HF ratio was associated predominantly with a marked (p
                        <0.01) decrease in BBI_HF/P during OP compared to CON and to BL. Consistent with previous findings, this suggests that an increase in BBI_LF/HF ratio of HRV probably depends largely on vagal deactivation [29], starting from the first 5min of the tilt up.

Considering BPV, the indices SYS_LF and DIA_LF, measures of sympathetic activity [17], were increased in SYN but not in CON during OP with statistical significances (p
                        <0.01) from the first 5min after tilt-up, see Table 2. Hereby, SYS_LF revealed higher values and was highly significantly (p
                        <0.001) increased during OP in comparison with BL. The results of FD reinforce the importance of BPV analysis due to different HUT test responses between SYN and CON already from the first 5min of OP. However, the interpretation of LF/HF in HRV and LF power in BPV is questionable due to linear approaches and the uncertainty of the related autonomic modulations. Therefore, we further discuss results from other linear and nonlinear methods.

Indices bslope and tslope revealed that the baroreflex sensitivity was modified differently in healthy female subjects and in female patients, see Table 2. The bslope index was higher significantly (p
                        <0.01) decreased during the first 10min of OP, while tslope demonstrated higher significantly (p
                        <0.01) reduced values during 11–17min of OP. In patients, these two measures of BRS showed higher significantly reduced values for bslope (p
                        <0.01) than for tslope (p
                        <0.05) during the analyzed OP compared to BL. Therefore both types of baroreflex mediated modulations were considerably affected in syncope patients by the orthostatic stress with bradycardic more than tachycardic fluctuations. In contrast, the autonomic regulation in female controls was not affected by the orthostatic stress. In this study, the decrease in BRS accompanying an evolving VVS was expected and is in line with the findings by other researches using different acquisition protocols [29,30]. It is plausible that central or peripheral baroreflex dysfunction exists, i.e., a functional diminution of baroreceptors responsiveness, that is thought to result in the inability to sense or compensate for changes in gravitational forces by initiating an adequate compensatory hemodynamic response in subjects with VVS [28,30].

Analysis of HRV by CE, as a measure for the irregularity of the time series, revealed that the BBI_CE index was not significantly different between CON and SYN in any of the 20 windows during HUT test, Table 2. Only slightly significantly (p
                           <0.05) decreased BBI_CE was found for SYN during OP compared to BL. In this context, the significantly reduced BBI_CE was in agreement with more regular BBI time series and decreased HRV during OP and therefore, with increased sympathetic activity. By the BBI_CE, BBI_meanNN and BBI_rmssd indexes a similar conclusion can be reached regarding the autonomic response in CON and SYN groups.

For BPV analysis, SYS_CE and DIA_CE indexes were significantly (p
                           <0.01) different between SYN and CON. In fact, SYS_CE revealed that healthy and VVS females react different from the first 5min after tilt-up with a prominent difference (p
                           <0.001) around the minute 10, see Table 2. Furthermore, highly significantly increased SYS_CE (p
                           <0.001) was demonstrated for SYN for the comparison of all windows during OP with BL and less significantly (p
                           <0.05) for DIA_CE only during windows 9–12. The steadily increased SYS_CE and DIA_CE confirmed less regular blood pressure time series in patients due to orthostatic stress, i.e., less compressible BP time series implied increases in both BPV and sympathetic activity. The CE of blood pressure time series was not significantly changed in CON during OP compared to BL.

The short-term scaling exponent BBI_α1 was considerably (p
                           <0.01) increased in SYN, but not in CON, during all windows of OP compared to BL. Concerning the direct comparison between SYN and CON, BBI_α1 was slightly statistically different (p
                           <0.05) for the first 8min after tilt-up and from 7min before the end of OP, see Table 2. Mean values of BBI_α1 varied ≈1.0 in CON during HUT test, but increased in SYN from ≈1.0 in BL to ≈1.4 during OP. HRV analysis by DFA pointed out more fractal correlation properties in BBI time series in SYN and therefore, confirmed increased sympathetic activity.

Analysis of BPV dynamics by DFA showed that there were no statistically significant differences between values of short-term scaling exponent α1, while there were some for the long-term scaling exponent α2, see Table 2. However, for SYS_alpha1 and SYS_alpha2 the values for patients were lower than for healthy subjects. Consequently, BPV was less regular from SYN than from CON. For DIA both indices showed a less sensitive behavior to discriminate CON and SYN. It is plausible that the size of the temporal window affected the results of DFA. Also, CE and DFA methods were further applied to RESP, but did not reveal any significant differences in this study and consequently, no comments are included in this paper.

The nonlinear SD method revealed slightly significant differences from HRV analysis. For instance the word pW201 showed a higher probability of occurrence for CON than SYN for most of the OP windows. Furthermore, only SYN showed statistically significant alterations of the BL status due to the orthostatic stress. In addition, analysis of RESP variability exhibited significant differences between controls and patients. In this context, the decrease of RESP_Forbword was significant (p
                           <0.05) during the first 5min of OP and highly significant (p
                           <0.001) after 12min of tilt-up, while RESP_WDRenyi was significantly increased in SYN during the whole OP with highly significant differences from 11 to 16min, see Table 2. A lower number of forbidden word patterns along with a higher irregularity of the word distribution indicated increased respiratory variability in SYN.

In comparison, the most highly significant differences between patients and controls were obtained from BPV analysis by SD, in particular for systolic blood pressure. BPV analysis of diastolic blood pressure by SD showed similar results, but less significant, see Table 2. In general, in controls there were two dominant word types (“000” and “222”) during HUT test, which referred to constant short-term SYS oscillations close to the mean value, see blue bars in Fig. 7(a). For patients, the probabilities of occurrence pW000 and pW222 decreased significantly during OP, and therefore, the SD probability distribution map of the words became more uniform, indicating higher BPV, see Fig. 7(b). Hence, systolic BPV was highly significantly increased in SYN during OP.

Global parameters from SD analysis of BPV that were significantly different between SYN and CON were Forbword, WDRenyi and pTH1, for both SYS and DIA. Regarding SYS in patients, the index SYS_Forbword, a measure for decreased BPV, was highly significantly (p
                           <0.001) decreased during the complete OP compared to CON, see Table 2, and significantly (p
                           <0.05) decreased in OP compared to BL. In contrast, a measure of overall irregularity of SYS time series, SYS_WDRenyi, reflecting increased BPV, was highly significantly (p
                           <0.001) increased during the whole OP as well as significantly (p
                           <0.05) increased at the end of OP compared to BL, see Table 2. In addition, the SD index SYS_pTH1 was significantly increased during OP. Hereby the analyzed windows during OP showed high fluctuating p-values according to the three defined significance levels, see Table 2.

More differences between SYN and CON considering BPV analysis by SD were demonstrated by the parameter SYS_plvarτ using different thresholds (τ
                           =2, 3 and 4mmHg). This index analyzes very small changes in the differences of consecutive blood pressure amplitudes and is a measure for decreased BPV. SYS_plvarτ seemed to be highly suitable to discriminate between groups in the very early beginning of OP shortly after tilt-up. In this study the index SYS_plvar3 revealed the highest significant differences (p
                           <0.001) between patients and controls from the first 5min after tilt-up and during the whole OP, see Table 2. The index was highly significantly (p
                           <0.001) and steadily decreased in SYN during OP compared to both, CON and BL, see Fig. 8
                           . Controls showed constant mean values for SYS_plvar3 greater than 80% during HUT test, whereas in patients, averaged values continuously decreased from ≈80% in BL to ≈30% at the end of OP. The dynamics of plvar3 showed progressively less patterns of low variability in patients, which can be interpreted as a steady increase in both BPV and sympathetic activity. The other SYS_plvarτ indices also revealed significantly lower values for patients, but were statistically less significant than SYS_plvar3, see Table 2.

In this study findings included a steady decrease in HRV and BRS as well as an increase in BPV (especially systolic), and respiratory cycle duration variability in female patients during orthostatic challenge compared to controls. Further, these changes suggested a progressive autonomic imbalance toward increased sympathetic activity and vagal withdrawal in female patients due to orthostatic stress. Hereby, the increased variability of systolic blood pressure, known as a marker of less effective baroreflex and therefore impaired autonomic regulation, was demonstrated already during the first 5min of orthostatic phase, and therefore sooner and more pronounced than diastolic BPV or HRV. In a previous study, impaired BP regulation in healthy male subjects has been found only around 1minute before syncope by linear methods, but not yet in female VVS patients at the very beginning of the orthostatic phase [31]. Furthermore, in this study the dynamics of cardiac, respiratory and blood pressure variability were well maintained in healthy women during orthostasis, i.e., the stress test did not affect the cardiovascular or respiratory dynamics of female controls.

Although our purpose in this study was not related to the prediction of syncope, one of our main findings is that BPV, analyzed by SD, provided good strong statistical differentiation between VVS patients and controls at a very early stage of OP. In fact, discriminant analysis using only SYS_plvar3, classified VVS patients from controls with 94% sensitivity and 83% specificity in window 7, which corresponds to the first 5min after tilt-up. In comparison, the linear time domain index SYS_rmssd classified patients with 88% sensitivity and 83% specificity in the same window. These results support the fact that HRV had a low predictive value in comparison with BPV [32,33].

A limitation of this study is related to the applied linear and nonlinear techniques, which most of them require stationarity. In fact, the temporal windows 2–6 include information of the transition phase that is in nature nonstationary and although the associated results were included throughout the paper, they were not discussed. So, those results need to be taken with caution. In a future work applying time-varying techniques could be relevant to evaluate the information in the transition phase. A second limitation is related to the studied population that just included healthy and VVS female subjects. However, gender differences may be important to consider and females are the population more affected by VVS. Finally, the dynamical behavior of the indices reported in this study showed oscillations, whose analysis was not included and needs further research.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper the dynamics of the autonomic nervous system were studied by linear and nonlinear processing techniques on cardiovascular and respiratory time series. To increase the temporal resolution of the analysis, the time series were segmented to dynamically assess the autonomic response in healthy subjects and VVS patients under orthostatic stress. The dynamical analysis of systolic blood pressure variability by SD seemed to be the most adequate to reveal alterations in the autonomic response of young female patients as early as the first 5min after tilt-up. The finding raises the possibility that early abnormalities within the regulation of the vascular system might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of VVS and plausibly, leading to a functional disturbance of the cerebral blood circulation and oxygen supply. The proposed dynamic analysis could lead to a better understanding of the temporal subjacent mechanisms in healthy subjects and patients under orthostatic stress.
