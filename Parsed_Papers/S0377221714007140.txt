                  In this paper, we address the impact of uncertainty introduced when the experts complete pairwise comparison matrices, in the context of multi-criteria decision making. We first discuss how uncertainty can be quantified and modeled and then show how the probability of rank reversal scales with the number of experts. We consider the impact of various aspects which may affect the estimation of probability of rank reversal in the context of pairwise comparisons, such as the uncertainty level, alternative preference scales and different weight estimation methods. We also consider the case where the comparisons are carried out in a fuzzy manner. It is shown that in most circumstances, augmenting the size of the expert group beyond 15 produces a small change in the probability of rank reversal. We next address the issue of how this probability can be estimated in practice, from information gathered simply from the comparison matrices of a single expert group. We propose and validate a scheme which yields an estimate for the probability of rank reversal and test the applicability of this scheme under various conditions. The framework discussed in the paper can allow decision makers to correctly choose the number of experts participating in a pairwise comparison and obtain an estimate of the credibility of the outcome.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Decision making (Bhushan &#38; Rai, 2004; Yager, 2004) consists of choosing a specific course of action between several alternatives and is encountered in countless areas of human activity. In many circumstances, where complex decisions need to be made involving high stakes, it is desirable to proceed in a structured and methodological manner, rather than simply rely on the skills and intuition of a single decision maker. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) or multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) (Triantaphyllou, 2000) aim at facilitating decision makers in complicated situations where numerous and sometimes conflicting criteria or factors have to be taken into account.

MCDM is further classified into multi-objective decision making (MODM) and multi-attribute decision making (MADM) (Pohekar &#38; Ramachandran, 2004). In MODM, a set of objective functions is optimized subject to constraints and hence the efficient solutions in a set of alternatives are sought. MODM typically requires the solution of a series of mathematical programming models in order to reveal implicitly defined efficient solutions. On the other hand, in MADM, a small number of pre-determined alternatives are to be evaluated under a common set of criteria and the best alternative is usually selected by making comparisons between alternatives with respect to each criterion.

A fundamental problem in decision making is to grade the importance of a set of alternatives and assign a weight to each of them. The importance of alternatives usually depends on several criteria which can be evaluated within the decision making framework in which pairwise comparisons (PWC) are an essential ingredient (Saaty &#38; Vargas, 2001). In the context of MADM, PWC enables the ranking of alternatives by allowing the experts to compare the various criteria or alternatives in pairs instead of assigning their priorities in a single step (Saaty, 1977). This reduces the influence of subjective point of views, associated with eliciting weights directly. PWC is usually performed in MADM methods such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty, 2003), the Weighted Product Method (WPM) (Chang &#38; Yeh, 2001), the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) (Brans, Vincke, &#38; Mareschal, 1986), the Analytic Network Process (ANP) (Saaty, 2004) and so on. The aim of this paper is to consider the influence of uncertainty in PWC and how the credibility of the outcome can be assessed. Although the focus is on PWC alone, the results have some implications on the applications of MADM frameworks, particularly in the number of experts that are required and how the credibility of key parts of the framework can be ascertained.

In recent years, PWC has been used either as a stand-alone method or as part of complex MADM frameworks on several areas including government (Huanga, Chub, &#38; Chiang, 2008), business (Lee &#38; Kozar, 2006), industry (Chan, Lau &#38; Ip, 2006), healthcare (Liberatore &#38; Nydick, 2008), technology (Gerdsri &#38; Kocaoglu, 2007), education (Zahedi, 1986), communications (Dede, Kamalakis, &#38; Varoutas, 2011a, 
                     2011b; 
                     Dede, Varoutas, Kamalakis, Fuentetaja, &#38; Javaudin, 2010), agriculture (Abildtrup et al., 2006) and energy planning (Kok &#38; Lootsma, 1985). The method itself has also been the focus of extensive research in the field of decision making. Recently in Fan and Liu (2010)
, a form of uncertain preference information, called ordinal interval numbers, was used in pairwise comparisons in order to rank the alternatives. In Doumpos and Zopounidis (2004)
, the issue of how pairwise comparisons can be used for the classification of alternatives in different classes of preference is discussed. The problem of deriving the weights from the pairwise comparison matrices using several alternative approaches is studied in Barzilai (1997) and Choo (2004)
. In Kwiesielewicz and Van Uden (2004)
 several issues concerning the inconsistency of the pairwise comparison matrix and its impact on the decision making process are highlighted. In addition, fuzzy pairwise comparison for solving the decision making problems has been proposed in Boenderb, Graan, and Lootsma (1989), Deng (1999) and Mikhailov (2005)
. In Marimin, Umano, Hatono, and Tamura (1998)
 linguistic labels are used in order to express fuzzy preference relations in pairwise decision problems. Moreover, Shiraishi, Tsuneshi, and Motomasa (1998)
 dealt with the properties of the principal eigenvector of PWC matrices.

The influence of uncertainty due to the imperfect and subjective expert judgments is of paramount importance when considering the credibility of the outcome of a decision making process. Several studies have attempted to shed some light on this issue in the context of PWC. For example, in Carmone, Karab, and Zanakis (1997), Monte Carlo simulations were performed to study the Incomplete Pairwise Comparisons (IPC) algorithm and investigate the effect of missing information in pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, in Aull-Hyde, Erdogan, and Duke (2006) it has been shown that given a sufficiently large group size, the consistency of the aggregate comparison matrix is guaranteed regardless of the measures used to estimate the consistency of the individual matrices, if the geometric mean method is used to estimate the weights. Moreover, in Hahn (2003) a stochastic characterization of the pairwise comparison judgments is provided, while statistical models for deriving the weights of the alternatives using Markov chain Monte Carlo are also presented. Furthermore, Farkas (2007) theoretically studied the conditions for rank reversal on perturbing the PWC matrices, while Chen and Kocaoglu (2008) also studied the rank reversal problem in this particular context, and came up with an algorithm to analyze the sensitivity of hierarchical decision models.

The main purpose of our work is to provide a suitable characterization of the impact of uncertainty in PWC. A first step in order to characterize the impact of uncertainty in PWCs, is to identify a suitable measure for quantifying its effects. Assume for instance that N different alternatives are pairwise compared by M experts, each with possibly a different view on the ranking of the alternatives. As discussed further below in Section 2.1, PWC aims at providing an average ranking, encompassing all these diverse opinions of the experts. It is of course natural to expect that the credibility of the overall process will be increased as the size of the expert group increases. Therefore, one possible way of measuring the trustworthiness of the results is to define the probability of rank reversal (P
                     RR) (Saaty &#38; Vargas, 1984) as follows: Let W
                     1, …, WN
                      be the weights calculated by the PWC in the case of a very large group of experts (M → ∞). In a practical situation where M is finite, uncertainty may undermine the PWC and the calculated weights wk
                      may turn out different than Wk
                     . Uncertainty can be due to the difference of opinion among the experts or inconsistent pairwise comparisons. The probability of rank reversal is formally defined as:

                     A high P
                     RR implies that the outcome of the PWC in question is not trustworthy and could therefore lead to incorrect decision making. There are two important issues that need to be addressed concerning P
                     RR:

                        
                           a)
                           How does P
                              RR relate to the number of experts M? An obvious way to reduce the effect of uncertainty is simply to increase M, but from a practical point of view, this is not a trivial task. It is usually difficult to locate many experts within a single organization or even in the wider public with sufficient expertise that would be willing to participate in the PWC surveys. On the other hand, there is no clear answer to the question of how many more experts need to participate in order to considerably reduce the uncertainty of the outcome. Say for example, that there are already M = 10 experts participating in the endeavor. How much is there to be gained in terms of P
                              RR by doubling or even quadrupling the size of the group of experts?

How can P
                              RR be estimated from actual expert judgments in practice? When applying PWC in a specific decision making problem, one has access to the elements of a limited number of pairwise comparison matrices P
                              (
                              
                                 m
                              
                              ) (where 1 ≤ m ≤ M). So the question becomes whether one can extract any kind of information regarding P
                              RR and hence the credibility of the results based on just the elements of P
                              (
                              
                                 m
                              
                              ).

The present paper attempts to deal with both points above. We first discuss a model for incorporating uncertainty in PWC and consider a suitable measure for quantifying the uncertainty level. We then discuss how P
                     RR varies with the group size M depending on the uncertainty level and extract several interesting conclusions from this variation. It is shown that there is not much sense in using more than M = 15 experts in the decision making process because the rate of decrease of P
                     RR is already small for M > 15. We then address the issue of how P
                     RR can be estimated from just the values of the pairwise comparison matrices P
                     (
                     
                        m
                     
                     ) obtained by the experts. Given this information, we discuss a numerical method for estimating P
                     RR based on Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicate that for a sufficiently large group of experts, one can obtain a reasonable approximation to the actual value of P
                     RR.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we briefly summarize the PWC method laying the theoretical foundations for incorporating uncertainty and present the model used in our simulations. In Section 3, the results obtained when applying the proposed model are presented and the convergence of the P
                     RR is examined, considering the impact of various aspects which may affect the estimation of probability of rank reversal, such as varying uncertainty level among the experts, alternative preference scales and weight estimation methods. We also consider the case where the judgments are determined in a fuzzy manner. In Section 4 a numerical method is proposed in order to estimate the P
                     RR from the actual user judgments. Finally, some concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.

In this section, we introduce the model used for incorporating uncertainty in the pairwise comparison matrices. Section 2.1 provides a brief overview of the pairwise comparison framework, while Section 2.2 considers the effects of uncertainty-induced perturbations under general assumptions. Section 2.3 details the uncertainty model adopted in this paper. In Section 2.4 we describe how we can estimate the probability of rank reversal through Monte Carlo simulation.

Within the PWC framework, instead of directly assigning priorities to the various alternatives Ai

One way of measuring the inconsistency of a pairwise comparison matrix is to calculate the Consistency Ratio (C.R.) defined as:

                        The denominator in Eq. (3) stands for the Random Index (R.I.) which is an average random consistency index derived from a sample of randomly generated reciprocal matrices with elements scaled according to Saaty (2003)
. Values of C.R. smaller or equal than 0.1 are generally considered as acceptable and in this case, the matrix is said to be nearly consistent (Saaty, 2003).

                         determine the priorities of the alternatives and hence the outcome of the PWC process. The method of estimating the weights from the PWC matrices is by no means unique. In the next sections we will also consider what happens when the weights are estimated using the geometric mean method. We will also discuss the situation where the pair wise judgments are carried out in a fuzzy manner and the weights are calculated accordingly.

Before proceeding to the description of the uncertainty model used in this paper, it is useful to consider the impact of uncertainty in PWC under very general assumptions. From a theoretical standpoint, we may consider that uncertainty acts as a kind of “noise” that impairs the pairwise comparisons. We may think of P

                         and have smaller impact on their actual statistical behavior (e.g. their PDF). Furthermore the weights wk
                         in Eq. (5) are the sum of 
                           
                              w

                         with respect to m and the CLT again points out that wk
                         will also be approximately Gaussian-distributed. We will numerically verify this claim in Section 3.1.

The discussion of Section 2.2 already points out an intuitive way of incorporating uncertainty in the PWC matrices. Instead of assigning a fixed value for the elements 
                           
                              P
                              
                                 i
                                 j
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 m
                                 )
                              
                           
                         we may assume that 
                           
                              P
                              
                                 i
                                 j
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 m
                                 )
                              
                           
                         varies randomly inside an interval [Dij, Uij
                        ] (Saaty &#38; Vargas, 1987). In addition, if the experts carry out their comparisons according to Table 1, then the allowed values for 
                           
                              P
                              
                                 i
                                 j
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 m
                                 )
                              
                           
                         should be discrete. A word of caution is in order here however: the length Uij
                         − Dij
                         of the interval [Dij, Uij
                        ] is not a suitable measure for the level of uncertainty. To illustrate this, consider the intervals I
                        1 = [1/9,1] and I
                        2 = [1, 2] with lengths 1 − 1/9 = 8/9 and 2 − 1 = 1 respectively. Although I
                        1 has a smaller length than I
                        2, it is easy to see that it actually corresponds to higher uncertainty level than I
                        2 since there are nine distinct values of Table 1 (i.e. 1/9, 1/8,…, 1) that are located inside I
                        1 while there are only two such values for I
                        2. This points out that in order to quantify the uncertainty level it is preferable to consider the number nij
                         of discrete values contained in the interval rather than its length. In fact, since an interval with Dij
                         = Uij
                         corresponds to no uncertainty a more suitable measure of the uncertainty level is nij
                         − 1.

Based on the above observation we consider the following mapping of the values V of Table 1, into a set of integers u = q(V) with −8 ≤ u ≤ 8 such that:

                        1 and I
                        2 considered in the paragraph above, this quantity is 9 and 1 respectively which indicates that indeed I
                        1 corresponds to a much larger uncertainty level than I
                        2. We also define the inverse mapping q
                        −1 of q such that q
                        −1(q(V)) = V.

Another interesting question is how the boundaries Dij
                         and Uij
                         are determined in the first place. It is evident that since Dij
                         and Uij
                         can take a variety of values one can think of them as random variables themselves. One way of randomly selecting Dij
                         and Uij
                         is to start with an initial nearly consistent matrix A = [Aij
                        ] and set

 and (10) ensure that the integers uij

Given samples of the randomly generated pairwise comparison matrices P
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ), it is interesting to relate the strength of the perturbations s to the expected uncertainty level L = 〈q(Uij
                        ) − q(Dij
                        )〉 = 〈nij
                        〉 − 1 shown in Fig. 1
                        
                        
                        . Note that the mapping in Eq. (9) and (10) forces uij
                         and dij
                         to remain bounded inside [−8, 8] even if |Δuij
                        | is large. This implies that L is determined by both s and the value of q(Aij
                        ). Given the value of s, the corresponding value of L is estimated by Monte Carlo simulations. The results are plotted in Fig. 1 which provides a means of translating the value of L to the perturbation strength s and will be used in the realization of the uncertainty model described below.

Taking into account the above discussion, we now proceed to determine how the probability P
                        RR of rank reversal is related to the uncertainty level L and expert group size M. Our approach is based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. In each iteration k, we generate a matrix A
                        (
                        
                           k
                        
                        ), the elements of which are randomly chosen from the values of Table 1. If A
                        (
                        
                           k
                        
                        ) is not nearly consistent (i.e. C.R. > 0.1 according to Section 2.1) then it is discarded and we recalculate A
                        (
                        
                           k
                        
                        ) until this criterion is met. Given the value of L and the value of each element

                         are determined, we generate a large number of PWC matrices (typically N
                        matrix ≅ 104) and distribute them in N
                        G = ࣰ⌊N
                        matrix/M⌋ࣻ groups of M nearly consistent matrices P

                        matrix and where ࣰ⌊x⌋ࣻ stands for the largest integer which is smaller than x. In the context of Section 2.2, the matrices P
                        (ν) can be assumed as a perturbed version of A
                        (
                        
                           k
                        
                        ) and the perturbation is simply ΔP
                        (ν) = P
                        (ν) − A

                        ). For each of these N
                        G expert groups we calculate the priorities of the alternatives as discussed in Section 2.1. We then estimate the number F
                        G of groups for which the order of priorities calculated is different than the order of priorities W'
                           k
                         calculated by averaging out the weights obtained by all the matrices P
                        (ν). The latter priorities corresponds to the order obtained by a very large (M = N
                        matrix) group of experts and since N
                        matrix is very large, one expects that W'
                           k
                         are approximately equal to the ideal weights Wk
                         corresponding to the limit of infinite group of experts (M→∞). The probability of rank reversal for iteration k is then approximated as P
                        RR(A
                        (

                        G/N
                        G. In the next iteration k + 1 we estimate a different initial matrix A
                        (

                        MC is the total number of MC iterations. It is interesting to note that one can estimate P
                        RR for many different values of M using the same random samples of the pairwise comparison matrices.

In this section, we present the results obtained when we apply the framework described above in Section 2. Section 3.1 presents some numerical results that further validate the first order analysis of Section 2.2, while Section 3.2 examines the convergence properties of P
                     RR.

Τo validate our first order analysis, as presented in Section 2.2, we numerically calculate the PDF of a representative average weight wk
                         obtained by a group of experts of size M. The PWC matrices of all experts are calculated as discussed in Sections 2.3 and 2.4 starting from the same nearly consistent N × N initial matrix A with C.R. < 0.1. The results are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, for the cases of M = 10 and M = 40 experts, respectively, both for N = 4 and N = 6 criteria. 106 Monte Carlo (MC) iterations are used and we assume the case where the uncertainty level L is equal to 3. The figure shows the PDFs obtained using either the full weight calculation method outlined in Section 2.1 and the first order approximation given by Eq. (6). Also shown is the Gaussian fit to the former PDF (the Gaussian fit to the latter case is practically the same). The figures illustrate that Eq. (6) is indeed a valid approximation for the individual and hence the average weight perturbations. In addition, the average weights follow a normal distribution in accordance to what has been discussed in the previous paragraph. Similar results are obtained for the rest of the weights as well as for other values of N, L and M. Fig. 3 shows the PDF obtained for M = 40 starting from another initial matrix A.

The above discussion in Section 2.2 and the results of this section highlight the fact that to a first order, other than determining the mean value and standard deviation of the priorities wk

                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                         should play a secondary role in the rest of the statistical properties of wk
                         (e.g. the shape of their PDF).

Applying the uncertainty model discussed in Sections 2.3 and the Monte Carlo simulation procedure in Section 3.1, we can calculate the probability of rank reversal P
                           RR, in order to estimate its dependence on the expert group size M which is a key issue from a practical point-of-view, as discussed in the introduction. We first examine the convergence properties of P
                           RR with respect to M, in the case of a relative small number of alternatives (N = 3), taking into account a variety of uncertainty level values L. For each value of M, we performed N
                           MC = 103 iterations and on each iteration we generated N
                           matrix = 104 random matrices. As indicated in Fig. 4
                           (a), P
                           RR is already low (below 7 percent) even for a group size as small as M = 10 for reasonable values of L. Another important conclusion drawn by the figure is that the convergence speed of P
                           RR is rather slow. For example, for L = 7, P
                           RR changes from 6.8 percent to 3.5 percent when the number of experts is increased from 10 to 20, implying a small practical gain from increasing the expert group size, since P
                           RR is already low for M = 10. The gain is even lower for smaller uncertainty levels. The figure also illustrates that there is not much sense in increasing the number of experts beyond M = 15 since the reduction in P
                           RR is even smaller.

In order to examine the reliability of the estimated P
                           RR values we can calculate the confidence intervals. We first start with the statistics of the values Pr
                            for the probability of rank reversal P
                           RR obtained by running multiple Monte Carlo iterations for a single value of M. If all these values are similar, we can deduce that our results are credible. Fig. 5
                           plots the PDF of the calculated P
                           RR values obtained by their histogram over N
                           MC = 103 simulations for N = 3, M = 10 and L = 7. Since the value of P
                           RR in each simulation is calculated as the average over many independent realizations, the Gaussian PDF fits very well with the estimated PDF. We also notice that there are small variations in the calculated P
                           RR values (the PDF is practically non-zero from 0.067 to 0.070). Since the statistics are Gaussian, we may also readily calculate the confidence interval I
                           C for a 95 percent confidence level. Using standard confidence interval formulas (Hanke &#38; Wichern, 2008) we readily find that I
                           C = [0.067, 0.068] and I
                           C = [0.0179, 0.0180] in the case where L = 7, N = 3, M = 10 and L = 1, N = 3, M = 10 respectively. These tight confidence intervals imply that the number of iterations considered in the calculations of Figure 4 is adequate in order to accurately estimate the probability of rank reversal. Similar results are obtained when estimating the confidence intervals of other points in the graphs. For example for M = 40, L = 7, N = 3 we obtain I
                           C 
= 
[ 0.0099, 0.01].

To further understand the convergence of P
                           RR with respect to M, we calculate the differential decrease ΔP
                           RR(M) in the probability of rank reversal when the group size is increased by ΔΜ = 1 expert:

In Fig. 4(b) we have plotted ΔP
                           RR as a function of M. The figure indicates that even for L = 7, the changes in the probability of rank reversal when an additional expert is added in the group are very small (below 1 percent per expert) at M = 15. It therefore makes little sense of increasing the expert group size beyond that. This is also shown in Fig. 4(a) where increasing M from 15 to 40 has very little impact from a practical point of view, since the additional number of experts only marginally reduces the uncertainty of the outcome.


                           Fig. 6
                           (a) shows the values of P
                           RR for the case where N = 6 alternatives are pairwise compared, assuming the same uncertainty levels as in Fig. 4. As expected, since the number of alternatives is now larger, one obtains higher values for P
                           RR than in (may even exceed 20 percent in some cases). Indicatively, for L = 7 the confidence intervals are I
                           C = 
[0.22, 0.23] and I
                           C = 
[0.0245, 0.0255] for M = 10 and M = 40 experts, respectively. Fig. 6(b) shows the corresponding values of ΔP
                           RR and it is deduced that varying the size of the expert group is now more beneficial. For M = 10, P
                           RR is reduced to about 18 percent when the group size is increased by 1 in the case of L = 7. However, for M > 15, the gain becomes progressively smaller as a result of the slow convergence of P
                           RR. Given the practical restrictions of increasing the group size, the figure suggests that using more than 15 experts may not have a strong bearing in the uncertainty of the results.


                           Fig. 7
                           illustrates the convergence of PWC for different values of criteria N and a constant L = 3. We consider the cases where N = 2, N = 4 and N = 6. The model easily allows to consider cases where N > 6, but in actual situations, performing PWC with that many alternatives becomes impractical since the number of pairwise comparisons N
                           c for each expert is given by N
                           c = N(N −
 1)/2 and therefore scales as O(N
                           2). As shown in the figure, P
                           RR does depend on N: For a group size of ten experts (M = 10), P
                           RR ≅ 6 percent when the experts are asked to make pairwise comparisons on six alternatives and this drops slightly to 3.5 percent when the number of criteria is 6. Other than that, the convergence behavior of P
                           RR does not seem dependent on the number of criteria. In all cases, there is no significant gain in increasing the group size beyond 15. This is due to the slow convergence properties of PWC, which seems to hold regardless the number of alternatives used and the uncertainty level.

Up to this point, we estimated P
                           RR taking the same uncertainty level associated with each expert in the group. It is also interesting to carry out this estimation when a different uncertainty level L
                           (
                           
                              m
                           
                           ) is assumed for each expert m. From a practical point-of-view, this reflects what could happen when the level of expertise varies from participant to participant. Fig. 8
                           (a) shows the values of P
                           RR, as a function of the expert group in the case where the uncertainty level L
                           (
                           
                              m
                           
                           ) is randomly selected with equal probability inside the integer interval [1, 7]. The results are shown for N = 3 and N = 6. One obtains similar convergence behavior
 to the previous case. Similar results were also obtained if we calculate the differential decrease ΔP
                           RR(M) as shown in Fig. 8(b). The similar convergence behavior
 observed in the case of varying uncertainty level can be explained taking into account the theoretical framework of Section 2.2, where we have shown the statistical properties of the uncertainty perturbations other than their mean value and standard deviation, are not expected to play that big of a role in the statistics of the weight and hence of the P
                           RR. We therefore expect a change in the values of P
                           RR but its convergence behavior
 with respect to M should be more or less the same.

The linear preference scale consisting of integers from one to nine and their reciprocals shown in Table 1 is used quite often in applications of the PWC method. Saaty (1991)
 advocates this scale as the best one to represent weight ratios. Nevertheless, it is interesting to investigate the convergence properties of P
                           RR considering alternative preference scales such as the inverse linear or the logarithmic scale (Ishizaka &#38; Labib, 2011). Instead of the elements in Table 1, in the former scale we use the elements 9/(10 − x) where x ∈ 
{1, 2,…, 9} as well as their inverses (10 − x)/9. The alternative scale {1/9, 2/9,…, 1,…, 9/2, 9} can therefore be indexed in the same way as the scale of Table 1 but with a different mapping q(V). The matrices can again be chosen by randomly selecting the indices as before and applying the alternative mapping. The elements of the logarithmic scale are determined by log
                              α
                           (x + (α − 1)) where x ∈ {1, 2,…, 9} and α > 1 and their inverses and can be again indexed in a similar way. In any case, we may still use L as a measure of uncertainty.


                           Fig. 9
                           (a) and (b) illustrates ΔP
                           RR for the inverse linear and logarithmic scales, respectively in the case N = 6. For the logarithmic scale we assumed a = 2 (Ishizaka, Balkenborg, &#38; Kaplan, 2011). As shown in Fig. 9, the convergence of ΔP
                           RR is again slow, implying that the convergence of P
                           RR is similar even when an alternative preference scale is used by the experts. From Fig. 9(a) and (b) one may deduce that ΔP
                           RR varies in a similar manner as before, again suggesting that there is no significant gain in increasing the group size beyond 15.

Another important issue to consider is whether the results presented above depend on the weight estimation method. Instead of estimating the weights 
                              
                                 w
                                 k
                                 
                                    (
                                    m
                                    )
                                 
                              
                            through the eigenvalue method (EM) discussed in Section 2.1, one could also apply the Geometric Mean Method (GMM) or equivalently the Logarithmic Least Square Method (LLSM) (Saaty, 1990). This method attempts to fit the elements of the pairwise comparison matrix P
                           (
                           
                              m
                           
                           ) with a perfectly consistent matrix, i.e. a matrix whose elements are of the form 
                              
                                 
                                    w
                                    i
                                    
                                       (
                                       m
                                       )
                                    
                                 
                                 /
                                 
                                    w
                                    j
                                    
                                       (
                                       m
                                       )
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . The weights are therefore determined by minimizing the following metric through unconstrained nonlinear optimization:

                           Fig. 10
                           (a) and (b) shows the values of P
                           RR and ΔP
                           RR for the case of GMM, where N = 6 criteria are pairwise compared assuming several uncertainty levels L. It is shown that for both low and high L, one obtains a similar convergence behavior for P
                           RR and ΔP
                           RR as in the EM case. Comparing Fig. 10(a) and (b) with Fig. 6(a) and (b) respectively one also deduces that the actual values of ΔP
                           RR and P
                           RR are approximately the same implying that both weight estimation achieve approximately the same credibility.

In this section we investigate the case where the experts carry out their comparisons in a fuzzy manner (Deng, 1999), i.e. by assigning fuzzy numbers in the elements of the pairwise comparison matrix (Chao Chung, 2011). A fuzzy number

                           (x) between 0 and 1. This weight distribution is called a membership function. In the special case where the membership function is triangular, then

To carry out fuzzy PWC, we need to define a fuzzy preference scale where fuzzy numbers are used instead of precise numbers as in a conventional preference scale. The pairwise comparison elements will therefore consist of fuzzy rather than precise numbers. The scale adopted can be a fuzzy extension of a conventional scale such as the one in Table 1. The fuzzy scale adopted in this work consists of the fuzzy numbers

The minimization constraints are outlined in (Wang, Elhag, &#38; Hua, 2006). In our implementation we use MATLAB's fmincon function which is based on the interior point algorithm (Waltz, Morales, Nocedal, &#38; Orban, 2006). To calculate the average fuzzy weights

                                       (
                                       ν
                                       )
                                    
                                 
                              
                            are determined according to the fuzzy scale as discussed above. From this point forward the simulation procedure is the same as before except that the weights are calculated by the minimization of Eq. (18) instead of the eigenvalue method. In the context of fuzzy judgments, we assume that rank reversal occurs whenever there exist at least two indices i, j for which the ordering of the center or the upper edge of the corresponding membership function changes compared to the one obtained by a large group of experts.

In Fig. 11(a) and (b) we show ΔP
                           RR in the case of fuzzy judgments as a function of the expert group size, for N = 3, N = 6 criteria respectively. The figures illustrate that even in the case of fuzzy judgments, the convergence of P
                           RR is again slow. For N = 6, ΔP
                           RR is smaller than 0.01 for M > 15 even for large uncertainty levels indicating not much practical gain in further increasing the group size.

The previous analysis dealt with the impact of uncertainty in the evaluation of the priorities of the alternatives, quantified in terms of P
                     RR. We now consider the issue of estimating P
                     RR from actual user data, i.e. a relatively small number of pairwise comparison matrices P
                     (
                     
                        m
                     
                     ) obtained by a single expert group. In this section, we propose a numerical method to achieve this and validate our approach with numerical simulations.

Our scheme for evaluating the probability of rank reversal is described in the dash line frame of Fig. 12. We first extract some information on the statistical properties of the perturbations (step 2 in Fig. 12). One approach is to calculate the maximum and minimum values of

Assuming uniform statistics, Eqs.(19) and (20)–(21) are two alternative methods for determining the statistics of the perturbations. Once these statistics are identified, one can perform Monte Carlo simulations (step 3 in Fig. 12) to determine the probability P
                        RR. In the first case, one generates a large number N

                         and standard deviation σij

                        PWC/M⌋ࣻ groups containing M matrices each. The probability of rank reversal can be approximated by calculating the number of times for which the priorities obtained by each of these groups is not the same as that obtained by the initial weights wk

In order to validate the P
                        RR estimation procedure we again resort to Monte Carlo simulations as suggested by the rest of Fig. 12. In each Monte Carlo iteration k, we calculate an initial matrix A
                        
                           k
                         and estimate the intervals [Dij, Uij
                        ] as before (Section 3.1). We then generate the matrices P
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) where 1 ≤ m ≤ N
                        matrix. We choose the first M matrices P

                           m
                        
                        ) where 1 ≤ m ≤ M to correspond to the user matrices, while the rest of the matrices are to estimate the actual probability of rank reversal P

This is in accordance with what was discussed in Section 2.2 where the CLT was used to discuss the perturbation statistics. The statistical properties of the perturbed weights resemble those of a Gaussian distribution. In addition, according to the CLT, it is the mean value and the standard deviation that primarily determine this distribution rather than other measures like D'

                        (std) = 2 percent for M = 10 which corresponds to less than half the value of P
                        RR implying that the method correctly estimates the order of magnitude of P
                        RR which is important in practical applications of the method. Similar observations are drawn in the case where N = 6, shown in Fig. 13(b) indicating that the method provides reasonable accuracy for increasing number of alternatives. On the other hand, the “minmax” method produces larger errors in the estimation of P
                        RR and especially in the case where N = 6 produces errors which are larger than the value of P
                        RR itself. It is also interesting to investigate the accuracy of both methods under an even greater uncertainty level. In Fig. 14
                        (a) and (b) we show the values of e
                        (std) and e
                        (minmax) in the case where L = 7 again for N = 3 and N = 6 respectively. It is again deduced that the “std” method provides sufficient accuracy when estimating the probability of rank reversal while the “minmax” approach leads to significant larger errors. Both methods however seem to provide a correct estimate regarding the order of magnitude of P
                        RR.


                        Fig. 15
                        discusses the accuracy of the “std” approach for a group size equal to M = 15 which according to Section 3, is a sufficient group size to estimate the priorities of the alternatives, given the limitations of practical PWC applications. It is verified that e
                        (std) is significantly smaller than P
                        RR implying a tolerable error in the estimation of the probability of rank reversal.

In the aforementioned results, the eigenvalue method was used for the estimation of PWC weights. Nevertheless, it would be very interesting to investigate the estimation of P
                        RR from actual user data applying the Geometric Mean Method, as analyzed previously in Section 3.2.3. Fig. 16
                        shows the values of P
                        RR and e
                        (u) for the case where N = 3 criteria are pairwise compared assuming an uncertainty level L = 5. The results reveal that the values of P
                        RR, estimated by actual user data, increasing the expert group size is more or less the same as mentioned before in the context of EM in Fig. 13(a). It is again deduced that the “std” method provides sufficient accuracy while the “minmax” approach leads to larger errors.

It is also interesting to investigate the estimation of P
                        RR from actual user data considering the representation of judgments by fuzzy numbers, as discussed in Section 3.2.4. Toward this end, we apply the scheme shown in Fig. 12 except that the matrices are now replaced by their fuzzy extensions and the weights are calculated in a fuzzy manner as discussed previously. Again the probability of rank reversal from actual user data can be estimated using both the “minmax” and “std” methods. The uncertainty model is modified in order to incorporate the fuzzy judgments in the opinion of experts when generating the matrices R

                           l
                        
                        ), where the elements 
                           
                              R

                                 l
                                 )
                              
                           
                         either are uniformly chosen from [D'

                           ij
                        ] for the case of “minmax”, or follow a uniform distribution determined by the mean value μij
                         and standard deviation σij
                         for “std” method. In Fig. 17
                        we show the values of e
                        (std) and e
                        (minmax) in the case where L = 5 and N = 6. Inspection of the results depicted in the figure reveals that similar conclusions are drawn for the estimation of P
                        RR from actual user data in the case of fuzzy judgments. It is obvious that applying either the traditional PWC or the fuzzy triangular representation of PWC judgments, the “std” method prevails against the “minmax” for the estimation of P
                        RR from actual user data.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we applied an uncertainty model to address two important issues concerning the probability of rank reversal in pairwise comparisons. The first issue concerned how this probability is reduced by augmenting the number of experts participating in the surveys. The results dictate that there is not much to be gained by increasing the number of experts beyond 15, even if uncertainty level is large. Using perturbation theory we have argued that the convergence of the probability of rank reversal with the number of experts is not crucially dependent on the uncertainty statistics. We have also shown numerically that the choice of comparison scale and weight selection method does not significantly affect the convergence. The second issue concerned the problem of how the probability of rank reversal can be estimated in practice, from the elements of the pairwise comparison matrices of a single expert group. Two alternative methods have been discussed for extracting information on the statistical behavior of the uncertainty-induced perturbations. It was shown that one of them provides reasonable good accuracy and can therefore be used in practical applications of the method for estimating the credibility of the outcome. Interestingly enough, this conclusion holds under other situations such as fuzzy pairwise judgments, alternative preference scales, weight estimation methods and accounting for a different uncertainty level for each expert in the group.
