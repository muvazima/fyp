                  A text-independent speaker recognition system using a hybrid Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) and conventional i-vector modeling technique is proposed. In this framework, the total variability space (TVS) is estimated using PPCA while the i-vectors of target speakers and test utterances are extracted using the conventional method. This leads to appreciable decrease in development time, while the time required for training and testing remains unchanged. In this a paper, an algorithmic optimization to the PPCA's EM algorithm is developed. This is observed to provide a speed up of 3.7×. To simplify the testing procedure, two different approximation procedures are proposed to be used in this framework. The first approximation assumes a covariance matrix computed based on the PPCA framework. The second approximation proposes an optimization to avoid inverting the precision matrix of the i-vector. The comparison of time taken by these approximations with the baseline i-vector extraction procedure shows speed gains with some deterioration in performance in terms of the Equal Error Rate (EER). Among the proposed techniques, a best case trade-off is obtained with a speed up of 81.2× with deterioration in performance by 
                        0.7
                        %
                      in absolute terms. Speaker recognition performances are studied on the telephone conditions of the benchmark NIST SRE 2010 dataset with systems built on the Mel Frequency Cepstral Co-efficient (MFCC) feature. A trade-off in the performance is observed when the proposed approximations are used. The scalability of these trade-offs is tested on the Mel Filterbank Slope (MFS) feature. The trade-offs observed with the approximations are reduced when the two systems are fused.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The total variability space model for speaker recognition has become an integral part of state-of-the art speaker recognition systems today [1]. The zeroth and the first order statistics of an utterance with respect to a Universal Background Model (UBM) is used to represent the entire utterance using a low dimensional vector. This low dimensional vector is called the i-vector. The mathematical model is described as follows
                        
                           (1)
                           
                              s
                              =
                              m
                              +
                              T
                              w
                           
                        
                      where s is the supervector obtained from an utterance of speech, m is the model bias, T is the matrix containing the basis vectors of the total variability space and w is the i-vector corresponding to s.

The success of this modeling framework has been well documented [2]. It is an integral part of state-of-the-art speaker recognition systems today. Its success lies in its ability to obtain a low and fixed dimensional representation of a speech utterance making it convenient for model level channel compensation. Techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [1,3], Within Class Covariance Normalization (WCCN) [4], and Probabilistic LDA (PLDA) [5,6] are applied on the i-vectors to obtain superior performance compared to their Universal Background Model–Gaussian Mixture Model (UBM-GMM) counterparts [1].

In this framework for speaker recognition, the i-vectors are obtained with respect to the TVS (Total Variability Space) defined by T for every utterance of speech. They are further subject to channel compensation using the earlier mentioned techniques. A log-likelihood score is obtained in the PLDA domain between the train and test i-vectors to evaluate the veracity of a claim in the speaker recognition task. The scores are further subject to typical score normalization techniques such as z-norm, t-norm or s-norm [7]. This constitutes a typical speaker recognition system. Throughout this paper, the conventional system is referred to as the Factor Analysis (FA) approach.

The presence of large amounts of auxiliary data for development has played a critical role in the success of the TVS model for speaker recognition. Typically, 1000s of hours of data are used to estimate the hyperparameter T in Eq. (1) 
                        [2]. The development data is also used to obtain the projection matrices for LDA, WCCN and PLDA. Unlike channel compensation techniques, the development time taken to estimate the hyperparameter is long. This is primarily due to the dimension of the supervector s and the first order statistics (defined later), which is dependent on the number of mixtures in the UBM and the dimension of the feature used. If an F dimensional sequence of vectors are obtained from an utterance of speech and are then aligned with a C-mixture UBM, a CF dimensional supervector is obtained. Considering that the number of mixtures is typically 1024 or 2048, and that the conventional features such as MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Co-efficients) have around 19 to 22 dimensions that are further appended with velocity and acceleration parameters, the dimension of the supervector becomes large.

In an earlier work in [8], the hyperparameter estimation process is simplified with use of the Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) algorithm instead of using the conventional EM algorithm as done in [1] providing considerable speed ups. However, the i-vectors are extracted just as in the FA system. A 4× speed up in the development time is observed with a trade-off in the performance of the speaker recognition system. This technique of applying PPCA instead of the conventional EM algorithm stems from the observation with respect to the importance of encoding made in [9]. As the hyperparameter is intended to capture the subspace in which the supervectors lie, it would be better to use a computationally less expensive algorithm to estimate it, while retaining the i-vector extraction procedure (encoding) in the FA system. The speedups obtained are as a result of the differences in the computational complexities of the PPCA and FA's EM algorithms to estimate T. The computational complexities of the E- and M-steps of the conventional and the PPCA techniques for each iteration are summarized in Table 1
                        . In this table, R refers to the number of basis vectors chosen and

                        . Consider a speaker recognition system built for male speakers in this paper, MFCC-based systems have 
                           F
                           =
                           44
                        , 
                           R
                           =
                           500
                        , 
                           C

                         and 
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 dev
                              
                           
                           ≈
                           22
                           
                           000
                        . Thus, the 2nd and the 3rd terms in the summation of the computational complexity of the E-step in the conventional method (in Table 1) are large. These terms are avoided by the PPCA algorithm, providing a speed up in estimation time.

The hybrid system's motivation can be realized by viewing the TVS framework as consisting of a dictionary learning step and an encoding step. Fig. 1
                         shows the framework split into these two stages. The dictionary learning step corresponds to the hyperparameter (T) estimation, which is the set of basis vectors defining the TVS. The encoding phase corresponds to the extracting i-vectors for the utterances with respect to the dictionary T. Based on the observation made in [9], the importance of the encoding method used is clear. However, this is shown only with respect to sparse encoding techniques and need not necessarily apply to probabilistic methods. The results in [8] show the importance of extracting i-vectors the conventional way even when the dictionary is estimated using PPCA. The differences in speaker recognition performances arise due to the different assumptions made by the techniques. The conventional i-vector extraction technique assumes that the supervector is formed from an utterance generated by a GMM, whereas the PPCA technique assumes that the supervector follows a normal distribution. This fundamental difference in the assumption of the generative model of a supervector leads to the poor performance of the conventional PPCA framework (where PPCA is used for both dictionary learning and encoding) compared to the FA framework (where the conventional modeling approach is used for both dictionary learning and encoding). Thus, extracting i-vectors using the conventional encoding technique even when the model parameter is estimated using the PPCA technique leads to better performances of the speaker recognition system. This system shall be referred to as the hybrid system throughout this work — a system in which the dictionary is leaned using the PPCA technique while the i-vectors are extracted using the conventional method. We shall use the term hybrid i-vector for the i-vectors estimated using the conventional extraction technique from the matrix T estimated using PPCA. The term PPCA i-vector shall be used for vectors w extracted using the PPCA i-vector extraction technique. The conventional TVS method (as used in [1]) shall be termed FA throughout this paper.

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

With the success of combining PPCA and FA methods, it is proposed to exploit the relation between the FA-based i-vectors and the hybrid i-vectors. In [8], it is shown that the MAP estimate of i-vector's covariance matrix introduces discriminative properties to the i-vector. However, estimating the covariance is computationally the most expensive part in i-vector extraction (the details will be discussed later). This forms the basis of works such as [10–12]. In [10], an approximation through diagonalization for the covariance matrix is proposed. In [11], approaches including a Variational Bayes (VB) method is introduced that helps reduce the memory load of the extractors. This is observed to be slower than the conventional i-vector extractor, though. Another VB-based approach to i-vector extraction is introduced in [12]. These two VB based methods have a small memory foot-print but are slower than the conventional extractor even though the i-vector estimates are exact. The methods described in [10] are however only approximations to the i-vector but are faster than the original method. This paper focuses on fast methods for i-vector extraction based on the observations made on the importance of the covariance matrix for the hybrid system. Two simple approximations to the covariance estimate are introduced that would simplify i-vector extraction for the test cases. The first method uses a simple PPCA-based co-variance estimate and the second method is a simplification to the method described in [10]. Both techniques are shown to reduce the computational and memory complexity of the i-vector extractors.

In the initial part of this work, an algorithmic simplification to the PPCA's EM algorithm is introduced. This leads to further improvement in the hyperparameter estimation stage on top of the speed up obtained over using the hybrid framework. These simplifications do not change the output at any stage. The systems proposed in this paper are tested on the NIST 2010 SRE dataset [13]. As the proposed techniques provide only approximate estimates, it is necessary to ensure that degradation is graceful. To ensure the robustness of the approaches, it is proposed to test them across two features — Mel Frequency Cepstral Co-efficients (MFCC) ([14] and Chapter 6 in [15]) and Mel Filterbank Slope [16–18]. The latter has been shown to be better suited to speaker recognition tasks and graceful degradation across these features would confirm that the methods proposed are suitable for state-of-the-art speaker recognition systems. The results of the fusion are studied to further verify the scalability of the speaker recognition performance. A computationally simpler system is obtained as a result.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the conventional i-vector based speaker recognition system and relevant terminologies. Section 3 provides details of the hybrid speaker recognition system. In that section, the proposed optimization to PPCA's EM algorithm and the relationship between PPCA and hybrid i-vectors are detailed. The results of the experiments performed on NIST 2010 SRE dataset are discussed in Section 4.

The Total Variability Space framework [1] is derived from the Joint Factor Analysis (JFA) framework [19]. Eq. (1) shows how a supervector (s) [20] corresponding to an utterance can be represented as a low-dimensional vector (w) in the subspace, the total variability space, defined by T. To estimate the i-vector given an utterance and the hyperparameter T, the zeroth and first order statistics are initially computed. Given a sequence of feature vectors computed 
                        {

                        }
                      from an utterance of speech, the whitened first order statistics are computed as follows

                      represents the zeroth order statistics for an utterance. The alignment of the feature vectors with respect to a mixture is hard (in this particular implementation). The whitening with respect to the UBM means and variances is done as is often the case in conventional i-vector system implementations. As shown in Eq. (2), the first order statistics are whitened with respect to the UBM covariance matrix.

Given f and T, w is estimated as follows

The EM algorithm to estimate T is computationally intensive. The algorithm estimates the basis vectors of the subspace spanned by the supervectors. Thus, it is interesting to explore if a computationally simpler algorithm could be used to replace it. In [8], a hybrid system is developed that uses the PPCA algorithm to estimate T from the first order statistics. The i-vector extraction stage to train speaker models and test claims with respect to utterances is preserved as in the conventional TVS based system. This system is described in the next section.

The block diagram of the hybrid system that uses the PPCA technique for hyperparameter estimation and the FA method for i-vector extraction is given in Fig. 2
                     . With the zeroth and first order statistics obtained for each utterance in the development dataset, the matrix T is obtained using the EM algorithm of the PPCA technique. The Expectation and Maximization steps are given below [23]

                      Notice that the input to the EM algorithm are the set of first order statistics and not supervectors. It is observed that PPCA systems in which i-vectors are derived from supervectors rather than first order statistics perform worse. The Gaussian assumption of the PPCA model is still valid as f is pre-whitened.

                      The above equation is the ML estimate of w according to the PPCA model. The MAP estimate is given in Eq. (10). While testing with i-vectors, it is observed that there is no difference in using either the ML estimate or the MAP estimate.

The time taken for each iteration of the PPCA algorithm can be reduced by simplifying Eqs. (10), (11) and (12). Define

The computational complexity reduces as result of avoiding the extra summation in the second term on the right hand side of Eq. (11). This is avoided as a result of not having to compute

                        ). It can be argued that the use of these weights add information in the hybrid framework that is otherwise absent in the dot product score computed in the PPCA framework. This observation is exploited to simplify the i-vector estimation process by simplifying the procedure to estimate the covariance matrix of the i-vector.

Using PPCA to estimate T provides speed ups at development time. The time required to estimate the i-vectors is still the same as in the FA system. The observation that using the covariance estimate has improved the performance of PPCA can be exploited to improve the time required to estimate i-vectors during testing. It is assumed that the i-vectors for enrollment are already available in this case. In such a case, it is possible to approximate the estimate of the covariance matrix for the hybrid i-vectors of the test utterance. Two different types of approximations are proposed

While it is true that the extraction procedure is exactly the same as that of PPCA, this approximation is applied only on the test cases. The target i-vectors are still estimated in the hybrid fashion. Thus, this system is different from both the conventional PPCA system and the hybrid PPCA/FA system. Such a technique depends on the discriminative information present in the covariance matrix of the target speaker.

In this method, the expression for covariance estimate in Eq. (5) is used to derive an approximate estimate with the help of the mixture weights of the UBM. This method is a faster implementation of the method proposed in [10]. The approximation is given as follows

                         can be precomputed, the memory and computational complexity are greatly reduced. Also, the troublesome cubic term in the computational complexity of the conventional i-vector extraction is absent as the matrix being inverted is only diagonal.

This method is different form the Eigen decomposition-2 method proposed in [10], in which the submatrices are explicitly diagonalized to achieve a faster method.

The two methods proposed in the previous subsections result in approximate estimates of the i-vector. However, to the author's knowledge, these methods are faster than the available methods in the literature. In recent efforts to simplify the i-vector extraction procedure, Variational Bayes (VB) algorithms have been shown to provide accurate estimates of the i-vector while reducing the memory complexities of the procedures [11,12]. The VB method proposed in [12] will be referred to as VB-1 while the method proposed in [11] will be referred to as VB-2. These methods are slower than the conventional i-vector extractors, though. The two methods proposed in this paper are faster than the conventional i-vector extractor and subsequently the VB-based algorithms, and have low memory loads.

The time and memory complexities of these algorithms are summarized in Table 2
                        . The VB-based methods are iterative in nature and hence, the number of iterations (k) is taken into account while computing their costs. VB-2 computes the i-vectors blockwise and hence the size of the block (b) plays a role in the cost of memory. Both approximations proposed consume more memory than VB-1 and VB-2, but are faster. The effect of these approximations will be compared in the next section.

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

All experiments are conducted on the benchmark NIST 2010 SRE dataset [13]. The core condition in the dataset contains 9 sub-conditions. Only results on the telephone and microphone conditions with normal and low vocal efforts are reported (det5, det8 and det9). Each of these three conditions aims to test the robustness of the speaker recognition system by varying parameters controlling the training and testing conditions — communication media (telephone vs microphone) and vocal effort (low and normal). The number of trials amount to approximately 87 000.

First, experiments are conducted to show the applicability of the hybrid PPCA-FA framework for speaker recognition. In the earlier work [8], the results are reported only on NIST 2008 with a smaller development data set. Thus, there is a need to re-establish the applicability of the framework on NIST SRE 2010 dataset. Experiments are then conducted to evaluate each of the approximations proposed in the previous section. All these sets of experiments proposed until now are performed on systems built with MFCC features. The system is also tested with MFS features to test its scalability. This is to verify if the improvements/degradations observed for MFCC-based systems on the proposed methods can be extended to other features. All the systems are re-evaluated for MFS and compared with the performance of MFCC. The systems are then fused at the score level to achieve superior performance. Weights of 0.6 for MFS and 0.4 for MFCC are used. These weights are derived based on experiments on the NIST 2008 SRE dataset to obtain the best EER. The weights on MFCC are varied form 0.1 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1. The weight on MFS is 1 less than MFCC's weight in each case. In these development experiments, NIST 2008 was not used to estimate UBM parameters or T. A complete i-vector system was trained and test on NIST 2008 dataset for this purpose.

The front–end parameters for the sequence of feature vectors extracted from an utterance are detailed here. The common front–end parameters to both features (MFCC and MFS) include pre-emphasis with weight 0.97, window length of 25 ms, a shift of 18 ms, a 256 point FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and 40 filters to compute log Filterbank energies (FBE).

Cepstral co-efficients of dimension 22 are computed from the 40 log Filterbank Energies (FBE) for each frame. Cepstral Mean Subtraction is performed for every utterance [24]. Delta features are computed with 7 frames and appended to the original feature stream. This is followed by feature warping over 300 frames [25]. A fast algorithm to perform feature warping is used. This is described in [18].

MFS features are extracted with parameters similar to the MFCC features. The 40 log FBE values are used to compute a vector of slope values for every frame. Every slope value in a frame is computed from 4 consecutive FBE values. The vector of slope values are subject to Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) [26,27] and 24 co-efficients are retained for male speakers while only the first 20 co-efficients are retained for female speakers. This is an empirically decided value through optimization on the NIST 2003 database [28]. The velocity parameters are computed as in the case of MFCC and feature warping is applied. For both MFCC and MFS, tri-Gaussian based VAD module is used [29]. In the tri-Gaussian based model, one Gaussian is used to represent each of silence, noise and speech (in the order of increasing energy).

Three channel compensation algorithms are used — LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), WCCN (Within Class Covariance Normalization) and PLDA (Probabilistic LDA) — in that particular order. Before applying LDA, the i-vectors are whitened. The whitening operation is summarized as follows:

                         is the whitening matrix obtained by estimating the principal components of the development data set (Chapter 3 in [3] and Chapter 12 in [21]). The length normalization is done to avoid heavy tailed behavior of i-vectors obtained especially from microphone utterances [31]. In [32], it is shown that LN (Length Normalization) is a simpler alternative to assuming student's t prior for PLDA.

The LDA technique optimizes the Fisher discriminant criterion by maximizing the interclass variance while minimizing the intraclass variance [3]. The LDA projection matrix (

                        ) is obtained from the length normalized development data set. Only i-vectors belonging to speakers who have more than 5 utterances are chosen for LDA estimation. The LDA projected development data is used to obtain WCCN projection matrix (

                        ). In WCCN, the interclass covariance is used as a distance normalization matrix. Let the combined projection matrix be

                         and let the channel compensated i-vector be

The PLDA model for channel compensation models the i-vector as follows

The hidden variables h and y have a standard Normal distribution as their priors. ϵ is the residual variability for the i-vector with respect to the parameters F and E. To compare with the LDA,

                         can be considered as intraclass variance. The EM algorithm to estimate F and E is given in [5]. To compute the similarity between two given i-vectors, the log-likelihood ratio between the hypothesis that the two i-vectors belong to the same class and otherwise is computed. This can be simplified to ([32])

All the systems presented in the paper are channel compensated with PLDA modeling. The log-likelihood scores are obtained for every claim and the scores are normalized using s-norm score normalization technique. s-norm is a combination of z-norm and t-norm [7]. 150 speakers are used for each gender for z-norm and t-norm.

The time taken by each of the optimizations and approximations is analyzed. The techniques are tested on a Core i5 system with 8 GB RAM and 2 TB SATA Hard Disk with supervectors loaded from the disk every time they are required.

First, the effect of the proposed algorithmic optimization to PPCA is studied. Fig. 3
                         shows the time taken for each iteration of the EM algorithm before and after the optimization. The proposed optimization is indeed beneficial considering that there is no change in the output after every iteration. An average speedup of 3.7× is obtained for each iteration of the algorithm on a dataset of 20 000 utterances.


                        Table 3
                         presents the results of experiments conducted to study the time taken by the different i-vector extractors discussed in this paper. The techniques compared are — FA, VB-1, VB-2, AN and AC. The time taken to extract the i-vectors given the zeroth and first order statistics are presented along with the speaker recognition performance of the respective systems on the det5 condition. The speaker recognition performances are reported in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER). Channel compensation and scoring are done as explained earlier.

The time taken by different techniques are compared with respect to the baseline FA approach. The values are obtained after averaging over 10 runs. The CPU time is recorded from within the program such that there is no effect of I/O (Input/Output) operations. The standard deviation of the time taken is not reported as the values are too small (≈0.01), which is expected as the code is profiled in the innermost loop (only the computation of i-vector is timed given all necessary input parameters). The results are presented for the MFCC based systems. The FA approach is considered the baseline approach. The VB-1 and VB-2 methods' performances are shown so that the proposed techniques can be compared with other similar techniques. The VB-2 method presented in Table 3 uses 10 blocks and applies a threshold of 10 on the Euclidean distance of the estimates across two consecutive iterations while testing for convergence.

Results from Table 3 indicate that the proposed approximations provide appreciable speed ups. The techniques AN and AC provide speed ups by a factor of 92.8 and 81.2, respectively. As expected, the deterioration observed while using AN is worse than that on AC. Considering the reduction in time taken and graceful deterioration it can be concluded that the proposed method to use Approximate Covariance provides promising results. Both techniques perform worse than the baseline and the VB-based methods, though. As a future studies, it will be interesting to observe if the VB-based algorithms converge faster if initialized with the proposed approximations. Currently, the VB-1 algorithm is initialized with a diagonal covariance. In the VB-2 algorithm, the i-vector entries are all set to 0 initially.

The time taken by AC in its baseline implementation is also faster than the FA based method. The proposed optimizations provide a speed up by a factor of 1.3, thus justifying the modifications.

@&#RESULTS AND ANALYSIS@&#

First, the results on MFCC based system are reported. This is compiled in Table 4
                        . As already shown in [8], a minor deterioration is observed in the hybrid framework compared to the conventional i-vector system (termed FA in the table). However, this is better than the performance of the PPCA based system. A worst case deterioration of 
                           0.6
                           %
                         is observed in det5 condition with respect to the FA system. This is the trade-off obtained after estimating T using PPCA. With respect to the PPCA system, an improvement of at least 
                           0.3
                           %
                         is observed except. The results of the approximations on the covariance matrices are also reported. In the case Hybrid-AN, where the PPCA i-vectors are directly used for testing, a consistent deterioration can be observed with respect to all baseline systems. Thus, this may not be a good approximation even while considering the improvements in computational complexity of the method. The approximation AC, termed Hybrid-AC, proves to be very useful. The degradation in this case is graceful for the approximation made. This is similar to the degradation observed in [10]. A worst case deterioration of 
                           1
                           %
                         is observed with respect to the FA system. With respect to the hybrid system this is only 
                           0.7
                           %
                        . An improvement with respect to the PPCA system is observed in all 3 conditions.

The results on the MFS based system are reported in Table 5
                        . Clearly, with respect to the performance of FA system, MFS's performance is superior to that of MFCC in most cases. This is once again observed in the case of PPCA systems. The deterioration from the FA system to the hybrid system can be observed in det5 condition. In other conditions, this is negligible.

The approximations are then applied on the MFS system. The pattern observed in the case of MFCC repeats here as well. The approximation AN hurts the performance of the system while the approximation AC shows graceful degradation. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the hybrid system and the proposed approximations are scalable across features similar to MFCC.

The scalability of these systems is now tested while combining the two features. In [33], MFS (termed FSL in the work) is shown to have complementary information with MFCC, Modified Group Delay and LPCC (Linear Prediction Cepstral Co-efficients). Thus, the MFCC and MFS based systems are combined by fusing the score-normalized PLDA likelihoods. The results are reported in Table 5 along with results of the MFS based systems. The four systems are prefixed “Fused-”. A considerable improvement is observed in all three types of fusion. Only systems that use the same kind of approximation are fused. Consistent improvements are observed in all three cases. An important observation is that the fused AC system has performance similar to that of the fused hybrid system. This is important as the approximation proposed to be used turns out to be beneficial when multiple features are combined. The speed up obtained even while combining multiple features will be appreciable even when compared to the individual systems. An interesting comparison is that between the Fused-FA and Fused-AC systems. A worst case deterioration of 
                           0.3
                           %
                         is observed even when the approximations are made at both stages of the system — dictionary learning and encoding. The improvement in computational complexities of the system makes such a result highly beneficial.

A hybrid PPCA and FA based framework for speaker recognition is used. The results of this framework is compared to that of the conventional PPCA and FA based speaker recognition system on the NIST 2010 SRE benchmark data set. A graceful deterioration in performance is observed with respect to that of FA system while reducing the development time.

The i-vector extraction stage is further optimized by applying two different approximations — AN and AC — on the covariance estimate of the i-vector corresponding to the test utterance. Extraction with AN provides speed gains by a factor of 92.8 and that with AC provides speed gains by a factor of 81.2. The performance of AC-based systems are better than that of AN based systems. The approximations are tested on MFCC and MFS based systems. The degradations are observed to be scalable across these features. The systems are combined at the score level and superior performance gains are observed with respect to the individual systems. Moreover, the performance of the AC-based fused system is shown to provide graceful deterioration compared with the corresponding FA-based and Hybrid FA/PPCA-based systems.

The speed-ups obtained in the proposed i-vector extraction techniques coupled with success of the hybrid PPCA-FA approach provide sufficient encouragement to analyze if these approximations can be incorporated in the hybrid framework instead of employing the PPCA approach to estimate T. A natural extension would be to use the PPCA estimates to bootstrap the conventional FA estimation algorithm that uses the proposed approximations, especially AC, in the EM algorithm mentioned in Section 2. This reduces the system development, enrollment and scoring times.
