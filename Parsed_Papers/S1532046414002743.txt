                  For cancer classification problems based on gene expression, the data usually has only a few dozen sizes but has thousands to tens of thousands of genes which could contain a large number of irrelevant genes. A robust feature selection algorithm is required to remove irrelevant genes and choose the informative ones. Support vector data description (SVDD) has been applied to gene selection for many years. However, SVDD cannot address the problems with multiple classes since it only considers the target class. In addition, it is time-consuming when applying SVDD to gene selection. This paper proposes a novel fast feature selection method based on multiple SVDD and applies it to multi-class microarray data. A recursive feature elimination (RFE) scheme is introduced to iteratively remove irrelevant features, so the proposed method is called multiple SVDD-RFE (MSVDD-RFE). To make full use of all classes for a given task, MSVDD-RFE independently selects a relevant gene subset for each class. The final selected gene subset is the union of these relevant gene subsets. The effectiveness and accuracy of MSVDD-RFE are validated by experiments on five publicly available microarray datasets. Our proposed method is faster and more effective than other methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cancer classification is one of the conventional problems in microarray gene expression data [1–7]and includes tumor detection and prediction of some rare diseases [8–11]. Many methods have been applied to cancer classification, such as naive Bayes classifier (NBC) [12], partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) [13], support vector Machines (SVMs) [14,15], and k nearest neighbor (kNN) [16].

The accuracy of cancer classification largely depends on the biological relevance of genes [17]. Thus, gene selection can be viewed as a key stage for cancer classification based on microarray data and feature selection algorithms have been rapidly developed in the past few decades. For the gene expression data, the expression level of some genes is highly correlated, which plays an important role in biological evolution. When these genes are located on the same biological path, this correlation is more pronounced [18]. In this case, traditional feature selection methods ignore the relationships between genes, and choose only a few from these highly related genes. The irrelevant genes not only result in lower classification performance, but also add extra difficulties in finding informative genes [19,20].

As a general learner, SVM could be applied to the problems of classification [21], regression [22], and feature extraction [23]. Here, we focus on feature selection. Considering whether the evaluation criterion involves classification models, we can divide SVM-based feature selection methods into three groups: wrapper feature selection based on SVM, embedded feature selection based on SVM, and hybrid feature selection of filter and wrapper based on SVM.

Weston et al. proposed the wrapper feature selection algorithm based on SVM, which finds useful features by minimizing bounds on the leave-one-out error using gradient descent [24]. Guyon et al. proposed a SVM-RFE (recursive feature elimination) feature selection algorithm, which is the most representative algorithm [23]. Duan et al. presented a gene selection method similar to SVM-RFE, called MSVM-RFE. At each step, MSVM-RFE trains multiple linear SVMs on subsamples of training data and computes the feature ranking scores from statistical analysis of the weight vectors [25]. However, MSVM-RFE is computationally more expensive than SVM-RFE. Embedded feature selection algorithms based on SVM are similar to other embedded methods. Li et al. proposed an embedded feature selection algorithm [26] that can adaptively identify important features through introducing data driven weights, which simultaneously implements classification and gene selection. However, this method requires adjusting more parameters, and its performance largely depends on those parameters. How to design the objective function based on the standard SVM is the key and difficult issue of this type of algorithm. Lee and Leu proposed a hybrid feature selection algorithm based on SVM for microarray data analysis [27]. Specifically, this method uses the genetic algorithm to generate a number of subsets of genes, the chi square test to select a proper number of the top-ranked genes for data analysis, and SVM to verify the efficiency of the selected genes.

Among the methods mentioned above, SVM-RFE has attracted considerable attention for its simplicity and intuition. However, since SVM-RFE can only be applied to binary classification problems, Jeong et al. proposed feature selection algorithms based on support vector data description (SVDD) for one-class classification problems [28]. SVDD can describe a target data distribution, also called one-class SVM [29–31]. Two feature selection algorithms based on SVDD were presented in [28], or SVDD-radius-RFE and SVDD-dual-objective-RFE. SVDD-radius-RFE minimizes the boundary of target samples measured by its radius squared [28]. SVDD-dual-objective-RFE maximizes a dual-objective function of SVDD to provide a compact description boundary. However, it is very time-consuming to apply both SVDD-based methods to gene selection.

SVDD-based feature selection methods were proposed for one-class classification problems, and they cannot be applied to multi-class problems. Although SVM-RFE can be extended to multi-class classification problems by using the strategies of one-against-all [32], one-against-one [33], decision tree [34], and so on, its training speed is not optimistic.

To solve multi-class classification problems and reduce the time complexity of both SVM-RFE and the SVDD-based feature selection methods, we propose a multiple SVDD-RFE (MSVDD-RFE) method. Specifically, we first learn multiple feature selection models via multiple SVDD models, where each class has a corresponding model. For each model, we remove features according to the direction energy of its center vector. If the energy in some direction is small, the feature corresponding to this direction is eliminated. In doing so, multiple feature subsets are obtained by multiple models. Then, we combine these subsets into the selected feature subset. The concept of MSVDD-RFE can be generalized to SVDD-radius-RFE and SVDD-dual-objective-RFE when handling multi-class classification problems. We validate that MSVDD-RFE provides more precise classification performance and less time consumption, by experiments on five public microarray datasets.

Section 2 introduces SVDD and two SVDD-based feature selection algorithms, and proposes multiple SVDD for feature selection. Simulation experiments are presented in Section 3 and our conclusions are presented in Section 4.

We introduce SVDD and the two feature selection methods based on SVDD, and propose the multiple SVDD-based feature selection method.

SVDD is a one-class classifier [29–31]. Compared with SVM, SVDD only allows learning from one-class data. SVDD can be implemented using hyperplane or hypersphere methods. The former takes the origin as an abnormal point and makes an optimal hyperplane away from it as far as possible [35], and the latter constructs a hypersphere to contain as many targets as possible [29,31]. For SVDD, we only need one-class data or target samples to construct the learning model expressed by a hypersphere. If a point falls within the hypersphere, it belongs to the target sample set; otherwise, it would be an abnormal point, or outlier.

Two SVDD-based feature selection methods were proposed in [28] and are described briefly here. There are two cases, considering either a few outliers and targets, or only considering targets. We will only discuss the latter.

The performance of SVDD strongly depends upon how compactly the constructed hypersphere describes the target samples, while discriminating outliers [28]. The size of hypersphere can be characterized by its radius. The criterion for feature selection in SVDD-radius-RFE is related to the hypersphere radius.

                         is small, then the data must be compact in the i-th direction. Our goal is to contain as many target points as possible. Compact data would produce a small hypersphere radius, which could not contain most target data. Thus, features in compact distribution direction(s) should be removed, and those in dispersed distribution direction(s) should be retained.

                         is the number of classes, and n is the number of samples. Only one class is used to train an SVDD model without considering the other classes. We train an SVDD model for each class to make full use of the training samples. Fig. 1
                         gives the framework of MSVDD-RFE. We first divide the set X into c subsets according to class labels, where

                         denotes the subset containing samples belonging to the j-th class. Then we train an SVDD model for the j-th class, producing feature subset 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                                 
                                    j
                                 
                              
                           
                        . Finally, these feature subsets are combined to form the index subset, F.

Similar to SVM-RFE, we remove one feature from the feature set in each iteration. Using the subset

                        , we train an SVDD model and obtain the center vector,

Feature subsets in Algorithm 1 are the index sets of selected features, i.e., these features are retained. We focus on the feature selection and obtain a new dataset with less features. Any suitable classifier, such as SVM, kNN, or neural network could be used to build a classification model on the resultant dataset.

SVM-RFE could be extended to multi-class classification problems using the one-against-one, one-against-all, and/or decision tree methods. For these methods, we need multiple SVMs. For the one-against-all method, c SVM models would be required, while the one-against-one and decision tree methods, would require

                         models, respectively. For each model, we can select a feature subset. However, for all these methods the training data must be repeatedly used, which results in irrelevant features. Since the one-against-one method is the faster of the three [33], we used that as a comparator in our experiments. For simplicity, SVM-RFE with one-against-one is denoted by M-SVM-RFE.

The SVDD-radius-RFE and the SVDD-dual-objective-RFE methods can also be extended to multi-class tasks using our concept. We can build multiple SVDD for both methods, and we call them MSVDD-radius-RFE and MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE, respectively. The selection criteria are unchanged. MSVDD-radius-RFE removes the feature with the smallest

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Five publicly available gene microarray datasets were used to validate the performance of our proposed method, and summarized in Table 2
                        . The first two datasets (Leukemia and colon Tumor) are two-class datasets, while the other three datasets (Leukemia3, Novartis, and Lung Cancer) are multi-class.

In these data sets, all genes are expressed as numerical values at different measurement levels. Since the value 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             
                                                a
                                             
                                             
                                                i
                                             
                                             
                                                j

                         is related to the value of genes, we normalize each gene on the interval 
                           
                              [
                              0
                              ,
                              1
                              ]
                           
                        , so that all genes can be measured on the same scale.

We also consider other feature selection methods. For two-class datasets, six methods were compared: SVM-RFE, SVDD-radius-RFE, SVDD-dual-objective-RFE, MSVDD-radius-RFE, MSVDD-dual-objective -RFE, and MSVDD-RFE. Note that, for SVDD-radius-RFE and SVDD-dual-objective-RFE, only one-class samples are supported. We chose the class with the largest number of samples, or randomly chose the target class when each class had the same number of samples. For multi-class datasets we used only four methods: M-SVM-RFE, MSVDD-radius-RFE, MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE, and MSVDD-RFE. In these methods, the parameter C has a vital influence on experimental result. Therefore, we use 5-fold cross validation to select C to achieve the best results. In the SVDD-like methods, the parameter C takes five linearly and equally spaced values in the interval 
                           
                              [
                              1
                              /
                              n
                              ,
                              1
                              ]
                           
                        , where n is the number of training samples. For SVM, C takes values in the set 
                           
                              {

                              ,

                        .

We use recalls to evaluate the performance of the methods. The recall of the j-th class is

                         is the number of incorrectly classified samples in the j-th class. We coded the problems in Matlab R2013a, and conducted the experiments using a Pentium PC with 2.8GHz processor and 2GB main memory.

There are two types of leukemia: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). We split the into two subsets: a training set used to select genes and adjust the parameters of classifiers, and a test set used to estimate the performance of the obtained system. All samples had 7129 features, corresponding to some normalized gene expression values extracted from microarray images. We took ALL as the target samples and AML as negative samples. This dataset can be found in [36].

MSVDD-RFE, our proposed method, was compared with SVM-RFE, SVDD-radius-RFE, SVDD-dual-objective-RFE, MSVDD-radius-RFE, MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE, and no feature selection. For SVM-RFE, SVDD-radius-RFE and SVDD-dual-objective-RFE methods, we found 200 useful features. For MSVDD-RFE, MSVDD-radius-RFE and MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE methods, we used a separate SVDD model to select 100 features and combined these. Hence, we found at most 200 features for these methods.

As discussed above, after obtaining the feature subset, we can use any classifier to classify the reduced data. Here, we compare k nearest neighbor and SVM.


                           kNN is a popular conventional classifier due to its simplicity and efficiency. kNN finds the k nearest points in the training set for a new test point, and assigns it to the most common class among those neighbors, Since k influences the classification accuracy, a 3-fold cross validation for k was performed on the training set. Considering the average recall of all methods, we set 
                              
                                 k
                                 =
                                 5
                              
                            in the following experiments.


                           Table 3
                            shows the classification results and running time of these methods.

MSVDD-RFE provides the best average recall, which means that the selected features are more discriminative. The recall rate of AML using MSVDD-RFE is 57% greater than that of MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE, and approximately 6 times that obtained by SVDD-radius-RFE. The average recall rate is also higher (approximately 25%-35%) than the suboptimal result. Comparing computational time, MSVDD-RFE takes significantly less time than all other feature selection methods.

MSVDD-RFE is outstanding among the methods listed here. The experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our method in feature selection.

SVM is a state of the art classification system, and has been widely used for classification and regression problems. SVM tries to find an optimal hyperplane with maximal margin.

In the SVM classifier, linear and RBF kernels are used. The RBF kernel requires a kernel parameter, and so the regularization parameter C and kernel parameter were selected by 3-fold cross validation on the training set (Table 4
                           ). The advantage of MSVDD-RFE, our proposed method, compared with other methods is clear. The SVM classifier may more suitable for obtaining higher average recall across all the methods, but note that the average recall of MSVDD-RFE is higher with kNN (Table 3). However, the selection of hyperparameters in SVM is a common and difficult problem. Thus, we chose kNN to classify the selected features for its simplicity and efficiency.

We compared the selected features obtained by these methods on the Leukemia dataset. The criterion function values of different methods (Fig. 2
                           , criterion values are set to zero when they are not selected) were used to measure the significance of selected features.

In [37] showed the 50 genes most highly correlated with the ALL-AML class distinction. We compared the feature selection methods with that list, to measure the accuracy of selection of important genes. Table 5
                            shows the percentage of important genes among those selected by these methods. MSVDD-RFE (11.50%) and SVM-RFE (11.22%) are very close, but the other SVDD-based methods select at most one important gene. MSVDD-RFE can not only quickly select genes, but also discriminate the AML and ALL classes well. Table 6
                            gives the index, gene identity (Gene ID) and definition of four genes which are simultaneously selected by two SVDD models in our method.

Similar to the Leukemia dataset, the colon Tumor dataset also has two classes, or tumor and normal. Among them, 40 tumor biopsies are from tumors and 22 normal biopsies are from healthy parts of the colons of the same patients. Two thousand out of around 6500 genes were selected based on the confidence in the measured expression levels. We take the 40 tumor biopsies as the target samples and 22 normal biopsies as negative samples in colon Tumor. Since there is no defined training and test set, we randomly select training and test samples. In addition, our final result is the average on the 10 runs so as to avoid randomness. This dataset can be found in [38].

Experimental setting is the same as that in Section 3.2. The average results are shown in Table 7
                        . On the colon Tumor dataset, MSVDD-RFE is inferior to MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE which achieves the best recall. MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE is an extension method using the idea of our multiple SVDD models. However, MSVDD-RFE is much faster than MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE. In addition, MSVDD-RFE is inferior to SVM-RFE which has the least time cost. But the selected features by SVM-RFE are not so useful for classification. In summary, the method proposed here still has certain advantages. Note that the extend versions of SVDD-radius-RFE and SVDD-dual-objective-RFE get better recall rates than the original versions. It is reasonable that the two extend versions have higher time costs since they need to address multiple hyperspheres. In addition, Table 8
                         also gives the index, Gene ID and definition of six genes which are simultaneously selected by two SVDD models in our method.

MSVDD-RFE is inferior to MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE which achieves the best result at the cost of speed. This allows us to make more meaningful comparisons between the two methods. We respectively take the reduced dimension 50, 100, 400 and 800. The other experimental setting are not changed. From Fig. 3
                        , we have the similar conclusion as those from Table 7. Although MSVDD-RFE has a worse classification performance than MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE, the running time of MSVDD-RFE is much less than that of MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE.

                         microarrays. The 203 specimens of the Lung Cancer dataset [40] include 139 samples of lung adenocarcinomas (ADEN), 21 samples of squamous cell lung carcinomas (SQUA), 20 samples of pulmonary carcinoids (COID), 6 samples of small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) and 17 normal lung samples (NORMAL). Each sample is described by 12,600 genes for Lung Cancer.

For Leukemia3 and Novartis, we randomly selected training samples, with the balance as test samples, and repeated this process for 10 trials. We report the average results in Table 9
                         (for Leukemia3) comparing M-SVM-RFE, MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE, and MSVDD-radius-RFE, and MSVDD-RFE. We performed two-tailed t-tests with significant level 0.05 to determine significant differences between our proposed method and the others, also shown in Table 9. Our proposed method, MSVDD-RFE, is superior to the other methods for both recall rate and time cost. Furthermore, MSVDD-RFE is significantly superior to MSVDD-radius-RFE.


                        Table 10
                         summarizes the experimental results on the Novartis dataset. MSVDD-RFE achieves the second best average recall, after M-SVM-RFE. However, MSVDD-RFE choses useful features somewhat more quickly. The main reason is that Novartis is a four-class dataset. Hence, M-SVM-RFE uses 6 binary SVM models, and MSVDD-RFE employs four hyperspheres for four classes. MSVDD-RFE is significantly superior to MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE. Considering computational time, MSVDD-RFE is a good choice when the number of classes in a dataset is large, which supports the analysis of computational complexity.

Considering the high dimensionality of the Lung Cancer dataset, only 5 trials are performed. All four methods discussed above were compared methods initially, but we abandoned MSVDD-dual-objective-RFE and MSVDD-radius-RFE for their time complexity. The average recall and running time for the Lung Cancer dataset are presented in Table 11
                        . These results are similar to those for Novartis. The average recall achieved by M-SVM-RFE, was not significantly better than for MSVDD-RFE. on the other hand, MSVDD-RFE shows significantly shorter computation time. Thus, again, our proposed method is a good choice when the number of classes on a dataset is large.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We propose a new fast gene selection method for multi-cancer classification using multiple SVDD models, MSVDD-RFE. This method can efficiently address classification tasks with a large number of features and a small number of samples. MSVDD-RFEcan eliminate feature redundancy and realize feature dimension reduction simultaneously. The method also provides more compact and discriminative gene subsets.

We performed experiments on five real-world datasets, Leukemia, Colon Tumor, Leukemia3, Novartis and Lung Cancer. The kNN classifier and SVM are used to measure the performance of feature selection. MSVDD-RFE provides good classification performance with less computation time compared to other approaches.

For the Leukemia, Colon Tumor, Leukemia3 and Novartis datasets, we have average recalls at better than 90%. However, the result of the Lung Cancer dataset was unsatisfying. Since ensemble learning can improve classification performance, we will use ensemble learning to provide enhanced performance on this dataset.
