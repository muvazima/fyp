                  DEA production games have recently been introduced in a paper by Lozano (2013). In the present paper we further investigate these cooperative games. We establish the links between the class of DEA production games and the classes of linear programming games and linear production games. We also analyse the Owen set of DEA production games and discuss the interpretation of these allocations for different levels of cooperation between agents.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Linear programming games (see Curiel, 1997) are games in which the worth of each coalition is the optimal value of a linear programming problem which depends on the coalition. One remarkable subclass of linear programming games is that of linear production games. In a linear production process, a firm produces p finished goods (outputs) by using m resources. The quantities available of the different resources involved in the production process are the components of a vector r ∈ IR
                        m
                     , where for 
                        
                           k
                           =
                           1

                           m

                     rk
                      > 0 represents the availability of the kth resource. The firm wants to plan the production that maximizes the total revenue of selling the production. The quantity produced is denoted by y ∈ IR
                        p
                      where for 
                        
                           j

                     yj
                      ≥ 0 represents the quantity produced of the jth commodity. Let A ∈ IR
                        m×p
                      be the technological matrix of the firm; akj
                      represents the quantity of the kth resource needed to produce one unit of the jth commodity. If the market prices are the components of vector u ∈ IR
                        p
                     , the linear production process described by (A, u, r) can be optimized by solving the following linear programming program:

                     Owen (1975) used cooperative game theory to study the general class of linear production games and proved that these games have a non-empty core. He also proposed an allocation scheme of the total revenue obtained when all the players cooperate, which yields allocations in the core of the cooperative production game. These core allocations are obtained by assigning to each player the sum of the amount of each resource that this player brings to the production process valued using the dual prices corresponding to model (1) when all agents cooperate.

Subsequently, Owen’s linear production game has been extended in several directions (see, for instance, Granot, 1986 and Feltkamp, van den Nouweland, Borm, Tijs, & Koster, 1993). Fuzziness in the coalitions and in the data coefficients has also been considered in Owen’s models (Nishizaki and Sakawa, 2000 and Fukuda, Ishijara, Muto, Tijs, & Brânzei, 2005). Other related production games are investigated in Timmer, Borm, and Suijs (2000), where each producer has the possibility of using different input-output transformation techniques, and in Fernández, Fiestras-Janeiro, García-Jurado, and Puerto (2005), where non-centralized linear production games are addressed.


                     Lozano (2013) has recently studied cooperative linear production models in which a set of recorded observations of the production process can be used to plan future production on the basis of a technology inspired in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). In these DEA models the production technology is assumed to be implicit in the input-output data given by the set of recorded observations, and the efficient units are those located on the frontier of the production possibility set defined by the set of observations and the quantities of resources. Two levels of cooperation are considered in these models. One situation is that in which the agents in a coalition only share their resources and each agent plans the production according to his recorded observations. In a higher cooperation level, the agents also share technology. This means that in the common production process, production is planned by taking into account the whole set of recorded observations of the coalition. In Lozano (2013), DEA production games are presented as extensions of linear production games.

The goal of the present paper is to further investigate these DEA production games and to establish the links between DEA production games, linear programming games and linear production games.

We first prove some preliminary results on collective DEA production processes. We show that if the agents share both the resources and the technology, then the production can be centralized and taken over by any of the agents in the coalition. Another interesting fact is that if the technology is assumed to exhibit constant returns to scale, then the DEA production game which arises does not depend on the level of cooperation. When the technology exhibits variable returns to scale, the final profit depends on the level of cooperation, and if solely the resources are shared, then in general, optimal production is only achieved when different several agents produce.

We prove that any DEA production game with constant returns to scale can be seen as a linear production game, and vice versa, any linear production game can be written as a DEA production game with constant returns to scale. The transformations needed to establish this equivalence are explicitly provided. In relation to DEA production games with variable returns to scale, we focus on a significant subclass: those games for which all coalitions are able to produce with the resources available. In this case, transformations are also provided which enables us to prove that the games in this class are non-negative linear programming games, and hence they can also be considered linear production games.

The second part of the paper is devoted to the study of the Owen set for DEA games. Several tools could be used to allocate the revenue obtained from production when the agents cooperate. The nucleolus (Schmeidler, 1969) and the Shapley value (Shapley, 1953) are well-known allocation rules for cooperative games. However, these two allocation schemes share a high computational difficulty in our setting. We center our attention in the Owen set, which shows up as an interesting and economically intuitive solution concept for DEA games. Duality theory of linear programming is used in order to compute equilibrium prices for the resources that generate allocations in the core. The interpretation of the Owen set provides new insights for the various versions of these production games. Moreover, the computation of the corresponding allocations is performed by solving a single linear programming problem.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, DEA production games are described and the links with linear production games are investigated. In Section 3, the Owen set for these cooperative games is analyzed. The results are illustrated throughout the paper.

                      represent the availability of the resources. The DEA production process is denoted (X, Y, c, b). To plan the input and output levels (x, y), which provide the maximum revenue of the production process, the following optimization problem (DEA production problem) has to be solved:

                      is a vector whose components are the parameters of the DEA envelopment model, and the set Λ depends on the assumptions about the returns to scale of the technology considered.

The generalization of the notion of returns to scale for the multiple output case has been widely investigated within the framework of DEA. The technology described by a production possibility set, T, constructed by the inputs and outputs of the recorded observations exhibits constant returns to scale if

                      for μ > 0. The technology given by the production possibility set {(x, y)∣Xλ ≤ x,  Yλ ≥ y,  λ ≥ 0} exhibits constant returns to scale. Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (1984) proved that for the technology associated to production possibility set

Thus, for constant returns to scale (CRS) the set of parameters Λ is

The game aspect of this decision model arises when the resources available for production are supplied by a set of agents (players), 
                        
                           N
                           =
                           {
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           n

                      which cooperate by pooling their resources. Moreover, in Lozano (2013), two levels of cooperation are considered: technology-sharing (model I) in which the players share the resources, and each player uses the recorded observations corresponding to all the agents in the coalition in order to plan his own production; and resource-pooling-only (model II), where the cooperation is restricted to pooling the resources.

Note the differences between model I and model II. In model I each player uses the recorded observations corresponding to all the agents in the coalition in order to plan his own production (the production possibility set of each agent in the coalition is defined by the matrices X(S) and Y(S)). In model II cooperation is restricted to pooling the resources (the production possibility set of each agent i ∈ S is defined by X(i) and Y(i)). The dimensions of the parameters in these models, λ(i) and μ(i), are also different.


                     Jahanshahloo, Soleimani-damanech, and Mostafaee (2007) show that in any optimal solution of the models (2) and (3), the constraints represented by Y(S)λ(i) ≥ y(i) and Y(i)μ(i) ≥ y(i) for all i ∈ S, hold as equalities. On the other hand, there is an optimal solution of these models for which the constraints that define the target inputs (X(S)λ(i) ≤ x(i), X(i)μ(i) ≤ x(i)), also hold as equalities for all i ∈ S. As a consequence, the characteristic functions vI
                      and vII
                      can be defined equivalently as:

                     ), considering model I or model II, and assuming constant returns to scale or variable returns to scale, is called a DEA production game.

We first prove that in the technology-sharing models (model I), the optimal production of any coalition can be centralized, since any member of the coalition can take over the total production. It can also be distributed in any way among the coalition members.

An interesting fact is that when the technology implicit in the production process presents constant returns to scale, the game arising from the technology-sharing model and the game arising from the resource-pooling-only model coincide. Note that in these models, since the problems corresponding to

The rest of this section is devoted to establishing the links between linear production games and DEA production games with constant returns to scale.

The following proposition establishes that given any linear production game, an equivalent DEA production game which is CRS can be defined. Lozano (2013) proved this result. We include it here with a different proof adapted to our notation.

                              Every linear production game is equivalent to a DEA production game with constant returns to scale.

The columns of the technological (m × p)-matrix, A, represent the vectors of inputs needed to produce one unit of the corresponding outputs. Thus, (A, I), where I is the identity matrix of order p, can be considered as the set of recorded observations (inputs and outputs, respectively) of each player.

It is now going to be shown that if constant returns to scale are assumed, any DEA production game is in the class of linear production games.

                              Every DEA production game associated to a production process where constant returns to scale are assumed is equivalent to a linear production game.

                              The class of linear production games coincides with the class of DEA production games with constant returns to scale.
                           

It is worth remarking that the class of linear production games coincides with the class of non-negative totally balanced games (see González-Díaz, Garcia-Jurado, & Fiestras-Janeiro, 2010). As a consequence, the class of DEA production games with constant return to scale also coincides with the class of non-negative totally balanced games.

For instance, in order to obtain the value of observation 1 at level 1, the inputs of observation 1: (20, 151), are needed, together with the participation of player 1 to whom the observation belongs. The agents are considered as resources since they have to be present for the coalition to obtain the corresponding value. In the case of the value of the fourth observation, since it belongs to agent 3, who is not in the coalition, the constraints require that

An extension of linear production games are the so-called linear programming games (Curiel, 1997). These are games whose characteristic function is obtained by solving linear programming problems in which the right-hand sides in the constraints depend on the coalitions. The linear programming problems need to be feasible and bounded for every coalition. These models extend linear production games by dropping the non-negativity restrictions on the parameters.

In the case of DEA production games with variable returns to scale, for some coalitions, S ⊂ N, the problems defining

                         may turn out to be infeasible. This happens, for instance, if the resources available have changed and they no longer permit the recorded observations to be supported. For instance, in Example 1, if the current availability of inputs is (30, 120) instead of (21, 160), then Organization 1 constitutes an infeasible coalition since its only recorded vector of inputs is (20, 151), and therefore if variable returns to scale are assumed, this organization is unable to produce.

The rest of the results in this section refer to the subclass of DEA production games with variable returns to scale for which all the coalitions are feasible. Note that all coalitions are feasible if and only if every individual coalition is feasible, thus this requirement does not depend on the level of cooperation considered. We prove that these DEA production games are linear programming games.

We have to distinguish between the resource-pooling-only model (model II) and the technology-sharing model (model I).

                              Every DEA production game with variable returns to scale in which all the coalitions are feasible, and where the cooperation between the agents consists only of pooling the resources, is equivalent to a linear programming game.

                              Every DEA production game with a variable returns to scale, in which all the coalitions are feasible and the cooperation between the agents consists of both pooling the resources and sharing the technology, can be seen as a linear programming game.

As proved in Curiel (1997), the class of linear programming games coincides with the class of totally balanced games. The results in Propositions 5 and 6 establish that DEA production games with variable returns to scale in which all the coalitions are feasible are linear programming games, and therefore totally balanced. Furthermore, they are non-negative. Since the class of non-negative totally balanced games coincides with the class of linear production games (González-Díaz et al., 2010), then these games are also linear production games. This fact is formally established in the following corollary.

                              Any DEA production game with variable returns to scale in which all the coalitions are feasible is equivalent to a linear production game.
                           

When several producers pool their resources and perhaps share their technologies in order to generate synergies in the collective production process, the problem that arises is how to allocate among the agents involved, the total revenue that has been obtained from selling the common production. We concentrate on finding allocations in the core of the game corresponding to the production process. The core of a TU cooperative game, (N, v), is defined as

                     Allocations in the core of a game are stable, in the sense that no coalition has any incentive to deviate from the grand coalition.


                     Owen (1975) provided a procedure to find stable allocations in the core of the linear production game. The procedure sets the prices of the commodities that each producer contributes to the common production process as the dual prices obtained for these commodities in the problem for the grand coalition. The set of core allocations obtained is known as the Owen set of the linear production game. This set has been characterized by van Gellekoom, Potter, Reijnierse, Engel, and Tijs (2000) and is, in general, a proper subset of the core of the linear production game. The allocation scheme defined by Owen can also be generalized to the class of linear programming games. Thus, the Owen set can be considered a solution concept in the class of DEA production games.

In this section we present a detailed analysis of the Owen set for DEA production games and provide an interpretation of these allocations in this new setting in which the technological matrix is implicitly given by the set of recorded observations of the production process.

Firstly we concentrate on DEA production processes, ((X(i), Y(i))
                        i ∈ N
                     , c, (b
                     
                        i
                     )
                        i ∈ N
                     ), in which constant returns to scale are assumed. Consider the associated DEA production game (N, vC
                     ).

The following result shows that, when constant returns to scale are assumed in the production process, the Owen set of the DEA production game depends on only those dual variables γ that correspond to the resource constraints when all the agents cooperate. The allocations in the Owen set are obtained by assigning to each player the quantity obtained by selling their individual resources at the dual prices.

The following result shows that, for this model, the allocations in the Owen set are obtained by assigning to each player the quantity obtained by selling their individual resources at the dual prices, corrected through the addition of a (positive or negative) number that represents the best net value of his recorded observations if outputs are valued by the market prices and inputs are valued by the dual prices.

                           . Therefore, the dual problem has a multiplicity of optimal solutions. The values of the optimal dual variables and the extreme points of the Owen set are shown in Table 3.

Note that in this case, some of the Owen allocations depend on the quantities of resources provided by each organization and the best net value of the recorded observations of each of these organizations, whereas others only depend on the highest value of the recorded observations of each organization, since dual prices of the resources are equal to 0. This is the case of the last allocation in Table 3

We now consider the highest level of cooperation in which agents in the same coalition pool their resources and share their technologies, that is, game

The following proposition shows that, if variable returns to scale are assumed and the agents share resources and technology, then core allocations can be obtained by assigning to each player the revenue obtained by selling their individual resources at the dual prices, corrected with the best recorded performance from among the whole set of recorded observations, when outputs are valued by market prices and inputs are valued by

                           . This problem has a single Owen allocation; it consists of the core allocation shown in Table 4
                           
                           
                           
                           .

In this case, the quantity available of the first resource limits the production. Therefore, Owen’s allocation depends on the quantity of this resource provided by each organization. Since the organizations share technology, the best net value of the recorded observations of each organization is the same for all organizations.

It follows from the results in Curiel (1997) that the allocations in the Owen set for linear programming games are core allocations. As a consequence, both DEA production games with constant returns to scale, and DEA production games with variable returns to scale in which all the coalitions are feasible, are balanced games.

To finish the analysis it is worth to investigate the case of DEA production games with variable returns to scale in which infeasible coalitions exist. If the grand coalition is feasible, Owen’s allocation scheme can also be applied. However, no guarantee exists that this scheme originates core allocations. However, for a result obtained by Owen’s allocation scheme to be in the core of the DEA game, it is necessary and sufficient that the quantity assigned to each agent is non-negative. This fact is formalized for the case of resource-pooling-only in the following result.

                           . By applying Owen’s scheme, Organization 1, which is an infeasible coalition receives a negative payoff (as shown in Table 7) and therefore, this allocation is not in the core.

DEA production games arise from linear production processes in which a set of recorded observations can be used to plan future production on the basis of a technology inspired in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Two levels of cooperation are considered in these models: the agents only share their resources or the agents also share technology. A first conclusion is that if the technology is assumed to exhibit constant returns to scale, then the DEA production game which arises does not depend on the level of cooperation.

Any DEA production game with constant returns to scale can be seen as a linear production game, and vice versa. The subclass of DEA production games with variable returns to scale, for which all coalitions are able to produce with the resources available, coincides with the class of non-negative linear programming games and therefore with the class of linear production games.

Although several tools could be used to allocate the revenue produced in DEA production games, an interesting and economically intuitive solution concept is the Owen set. There are new insights into the interpretation of these sets of allocations for the various versions of these games.

There are many real world situations which can be modeled as DEA production games, for example, hospitals and health centers of a city sharing their resources, or a group of farmers sharing their resources and technology. In general, situations where some organizations are not using all of its resources or do not have the most advanced and productive technology. Moreover, since this class of games coincides with the class of totally balanced games, the results in this paper could be considered in other game theory models, for example, games associated with controlled mathematical programming problems (Dubey & Shapley, 1984), market games (Shapley & Shubik, 1969), maximum flow games and generalized network problems (Kalai & Zemel, 1982a; 1982b), and risk allocation games (Csóka, Herings, & Kóczy, 2009).
