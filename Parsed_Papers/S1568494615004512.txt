               Abstract
               
                  Even though Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) constitute a powerful and essential tool for pattern recognition and data mining, the common SOM algorithm is not apt for processing categorical data, which is present in many real datasets. It is for this reason that the categorical values are commonly converted into a binary code, a solution that unfortunately distorts the network training and the posterior analysis. The present work proposes a SOM architecture that directly processes the categorical values, without the need of any previous transformation. This architecture is also capable of properly mixing numerical and categorical data, in such a manner that all the features adopt the same weight. The proposed implementation is scalable and the corresponding learning algorithm is described in detail. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithm by applying it to several well-known datasets.
