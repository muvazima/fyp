                  The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it provides a contribution to the debate on judicial efficiency by conducting an applied research on the Italian tax judiciary thanks to a database covering the activities of the Italian tax courts over a 3-year period (2009–2011). On the other hand, it also contributes to the methodological debate, as it compares results obtained with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Directional Distance Function (DDF), two related non-parametric techniques which allow evaluating the efficiency of each observation as the radial distance from the efficient frontier defined by the best observations. While DEA has already been used to assess the mere technical efficiency of judicial systems, the DDF offers a valuable additional contribution, since it makes it possible to minimize the social cost of production of adjudication in the measurement. This feature makes it particularly attractive in those sectors in which production externalities may arise, such as judicial delays in the case investigated here. Additionally, the paper first applies the bootstrap to the DDF procedure in order to provide more robust estimates and to compare them with the DEA results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The judicial system is vital to society for a number of reasons. It is crucial in protecting formal rights and in supplying citizens with what they perceive as justice. It is pivotal in the interplay with the legislature and the executive in order to jointly concur in providing socially and economically valuable outcomes. Moreover, it plays a role in fostering sustainable development and in making the economy healthy by effectively enforcing private property rights and by sending potential investors credible signals about the reliability of the economic system. In the same vein, only if the judiciary is accountable to the law, does it make sense to exchange goods via contracts.

Although these issues are hardly new, until a decade ago only a handful of theoretical and empirical contributions had dealt with them. More recently, attention has been paid to the actions of international organizations like the World Bank or the European Community, which have focused on the connection between the judiciary and sustainable development and, when needed, have fostered the reform of national judiciaries in order to make them effective.

Thus, interest in the tools for efficiency assessment has gained momentum in the scholarly and political debate. Studies on the performance of judicial systems, on the optimal organization of courts, and on incentives governing the judges’ activities have become a flourishing portion of the scientific literature. Following this line of inquiry, our paper attempts to provide an efficiency evaluation of a specialized branch of the Italian judiciary, the tax courts system.

Tax courts are specialized since they essentially provide a judicial forum in which individuals or firms can dispute allegations of tax deficiencies. Naturally, this activity is very much economically connoted, since the resolution of tax disputes is central in preserving the proper working of public finance. However, measuring court efficiency is here somewhat ancillary to the purpose of moving forward in the methodological debate as well. In fact, while ‘accidentally’ providing insights into the performance of the Italian tax judiciary, this paper discusses the issue of how to properly consider the effect of externality on efficiency.

In specific production sectors, such as the judicial system, two dimensions affect overall performance. One is a strictly quantitative measure – in our case, the ability to settle the highest number of disputes for given levels of inputs. The other, more qualitative dimension, concerns how the output is supplied; in the judicial system, this measure regards the time needed to settle a dispute. In other words, what is usually known as judicial delay represents, from an economic point of view, a negative externality – i.e. a “bad” output. Indeed, this is a key pillar of efficiency assessment, central to making the system consistent. Long delays undermine the reliability of the judiciary and, in the long run, they have an impact on the demand for justice and on the attractiveness of an economic system (Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, Levine, & Maksimovic, 2000; Jappelli, Pagano, & Bianco, 2005; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, & Vishny 1997; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, & Vishny 1998; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, & Vishny 2000; Levine, 1999; Rajan & Zingales, 1995).

This approach also provides methodological insights, as the standard models based on the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) commonly used for efficiency assessment become ineffective when it comes to considering the emergence of a production externality, i.e. a bad output. Since the latter introduces a social cost of production, it must be properly taken into account when assessing overall efficiency. The DDF appears to be the most suitable tool for such an assessment, because it simultaneously considers the maximization of a good output for given inputs and the minimization of a bad output. By using bootstrap and distinct regression models, the paper tries to identify the main determinants of the efficiency scores calculated with the two approaches and to check for substantial differences.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the literature on judicial efficiency, with specific focus on how this concept affects different dimensions, both internal and external to courts. In Section 3, the DEA and DDF formulations computed in the paper are introduced and described from a methodological point of view, while Section 4 illustrates the organization of Italian tax courts. Section 5 discusses the empirical strategy and shows some preliminary results by highlighting the differences between calculations performed using the DEA and DDF methods. Section 6 further develops the empirical analysis and presents additional points for discussion. Finally, Section 7 provides some concluding remarks.

A number of articles have recently dealt with the issue of how to assess the determinants of the ‘production of justice’, specifically focusing on judicial efficiency. The issue is complex, since it involves a quantitative and a qualitative dimension. The former is a familiar concept in production theory and it concerns how to provide the maximum quantity of output (decisions) for given inputs. The latter looks at how the output is produced and at whether there are negative side effects, like long waiting times, since the time needed to settle disputes can be central to determining the uncertainty and, in turn, the reliability of a judicial system. A number of studies have favored the latter perspective, focusing on the determinants of delays in reaching decisions assumed as a rough proxy for overall judicial efficiency, thus understood as the ability of the system to respond to the demand for justice (Binford, Greene, Schmidlkofer, Wilsey, & Taylor, 2007; Cauthen & Latzer, 2008; Lindquist, 2007). In order to gain insights into the production technology, other studies have analyzed the relationship between the productivity of judges and their educational background, which appears to be significant in explaining how quickly they reach a decision (Choi, Gulati, & Posner, 2010; Landes, Lessig, & Solimine, 1998; Ramseyer, 2012). In the same vein, Dimitrova-Grajzl, Grajzl, Sustersic, and Zajc (2012) look at the productivity of First Instance Courts in Slovenia, considering both the number of judges and the current caseload for the judicial production process, and they find that the former becomes insignificant while the latter remains significant. Beenstock and Haitovsky (2004) examine the Israeli courts, suggesting that increasing the number of judges is not an efficient strategy in order to boost their productivity. The two scholars show that there is a correlation between the judges’ workload pressure and their productivity; hence, according to their hypothesis, the number of cases completed decreases if the number of judges increases.

A step forward towards a more reliable methodology to measure productive efficiency is represented by the adoption of the DEA approach, which allows comparing homogenous production units – in this case, courts – and calculates relative technical efficiency scores, thus providing a robust measure of productive efficiency of single courts.

In studies on the judiciary, DEA has so far been performed by using a single-stage model (Chaparro & Jimenez, 1996; Kittelsen & Førsund, 1992; Lewin, Morey, & Cook, 1982) as well as a two-stage model (Deyneli, 2012; Marselli & Vannini, 2004; Schneider, 2005). In their pioneering article, Lewin et al. (1982) use the DEA methodology to analyze the efficiency of criminal courts and judicial districts in North Carolina, adopting the number of judgments and the number of cases pending for less than 90days as outputs, whereas the inputs considered are: caseload, number of district attorneys and staff, days of court held, number of misdemeanors within the caseload, and size of white population. The analysis identifies the inefficient judicial districts and the comparison group, which is made up of efficient and comparable districts, and its purpose is to suggest suitable corrective policies to improve the performance of the inefficient Decision Making Units (DMUs).


                     Kittelsen and Førsund (1992) carry out a study on Norwegian district courts, using the number of judges and staff as input and the number of cases completed as output, while also taking judicial classification (civil, criminal) into account. The authors analyze 107 District Courts of First Instance over 4years (1983–1986), i.e. a bigger sample than in the abovementioned study by Lewin et al. (1982). Moreover, the analysis is shaped around seven categories of output (i.e. lawsuits are classified according to seven crime categories); therefore, more specific results can be collected. The authors argue that the observed inefficiency is due to economies of scale in the Norwegian judicial system, i.e. the far from optimal size of these courts.


                     Chaparro and Jimenez (1996) measure the technical efficiency of the administrative sections of the Spanish Courts, using staff (labor force) as input and number of cases completed as output, also drawing a distinction between cases ending with a judgment or with other forms of resolution (e.g. settlement, withdrawal of suit, etc.).

Focusing on Italy and adopting the two-stage model, Marselli and Vannini (2004) propose an analysis of the national Districts of the Court of Appeal. They use the judges’ workload and total number of cases (divided between pending and incoming) as inputs and the number of cases completed as output. Then, environmental variables are introduced into the second stage to study inefficiency. Schneider (2005) presents a work on German courts also based on a two-stage analysis. Here, the number of cases dealt with is the output, whereas the number of judges and their caseloads are the inputs. In the second stage, the author looks at the relationship between the productivity of the courts and the judges’ careers.

A more recent study by Yeung and Azevedo (2011) applies the DEA technique to measure the efficiency of Brazilian courts, taking the number of judges and staff as input and the number of both first and second instance judgments as output. Using the same methodology, Deyneli (2012) analyzes the relationship between judicial efficiency and the salary of judges at the European level. In the first stage, the author chooses the number of judges and staff as input and the number of resolved cases as output, while in the next stage the judges’ salary, their training, and the number of courts are introduced as regressors.

In their research on tax judiciary, Falavigna, Ippoliti, and Ramello (2014) refine the use of DEA in studying judicial efficiency by also introducing the bootstrap option, as suggested by Simar and Wilson (2007). The authors analyze the judges’ productivity and the impact of public policies aimed at reducing their numbers.

The only case in which the DDF has been applied to the judiciary is a study by Peyrache and Zago (2012), which focuses on optimal court size in the Italian justice system. The authors consider a specific public policy aimed at improving court performance by merging different courts and suggest an alternative approach to the criteria adopted by the government. However, their assumption on the directional vector does not allow them to include the production of undesirable outputs, i.e. externalities affecting the overall balance of efficiency. Yet, as emphasized by the literature mentioned at the beginning of this section, the time needed by a court to settle a dispute is undoubtedly an important feature of judicial performance. Delays are among the key factors that have an impact on the overall cost of the judicial system, both perceived, as they increase the degree of uncertainty in obtaining justice, and real, as longer lawsuits imply higher costs for the parties (lawyers’ fees) and for the system (public expenditure and congestion of the judiciary). Hence, as previously argued, failing to consider this dimension can severely affect the overall efficiency evaluation, reducing its usefulness in relation to policy prescriptions.

By contrast, the DDF formulation can be employed to pursue, at the same time, the maximization of targets and the minimization of the social cost of production, thus integrating the two issues at hand, i.e. efficiency in the production of justice and judicial delay. To the best of our knowledge, this perspective has not yet been adopted in assessing the judiciary, while it has been applied, for instance, to the study of airports. In this case, flight delays are an undesirable output affecting efficiency and the endorsement of DEA models without considering externalities can lead to wrong conclusions and have negative policy implications (Lozano & Gutiérrez, 2011; Pathomsiri, Haghani, Dresner, & Windle, 2008).

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

This section briefly introduces the standard DEA model – so far the most common methodological approach used to assess judicial efficiency – and then provides a comprehensive description of the DDF technique, in order to better understand the specific characteristics which make it a more appropriate tool for the case under investigation. To begin with, it is worth noting that, although DEA and the DDF are two different specifications of the same methodology (linear programming based on envelop theory), the latter formulation, as will be argued below, is more flexible and enables the asymmetric joint treatment of good and bad outputs (i.e. efficiency will increase if good outputs increase and it will decrease if bad outputs increase). This section also provides a description of the bootstrap application.

The DEA methodology has been widely applied to many different contexts in order to compute the technical efficiency of Decision Making Units (DMUs)
                           1
                           See, for instance, applications to the banking sector/credit risk, Staub, da Silva e Souza, and Tabak (2010), Fethi and Pasiouras (2010), Ray and Das (2010), to energy and the environment, Zhou, Ang, and Poh (2008), and to the healthcare sector, Cheng, Hwang, and Shao (2005), Pulina, Detotto, and Paba (2010), Ippoliti and Falavigna (2012).
                        
                        
                           1
                        . It makes it possible to build a deterministic, non-parametric production frontier used as reference to calculate technical efficiency scores on the basis of the input or output distance function, which are both radial.

As is well known, the approach can be input-oriented or output-oriented and, in general, the input-oriented approach is preferred, since decision makers find it easier to control inputs than outputs. In the present analysis, input quantities are reduced proportionally while outputs remain unchanged. However, in the case of the judiciary, the possibilities of changing inputs are limited, due to the rigidity of the system; hence, courts can act more easily on the output side than on input factors. Therefore, we adopt an output-oriented approach following the original formulation by Farrell (1957) and we assume constant return to scale (CRS) following the majority of contributions in the judicial field.

Thus, technical efficiency scores (TEi
                        ) referring to each court-DMU are computed by solving the following linear programming duality problem, on the basis of the output-oriented DEA approach:

                        −1 is the proportional increase in outputs that could be achieved by the i-th court (k is the total number of courts) with input quantities held constant. λ is a vector of kx1 weights allowing convex combination of inputs and outputs, Y is a kxn output matrix, X is a kxm input matrix.

This definition of TE means that courts with technical scores equal to 1 are efficient; as the score increases, courts become inefficient. Notice that, in this case, all slack variables in the DEA model are assumed equal to 0. Finally, in order to improve the robustness of the estimates, the Simar–Wilson bootstrap procedure is applied (Simar & Wilson, 2007).

This model is consistent with the approaches of previous studies following the DEA methodology (e.g. Chaparro & Jimenez, 1996; Deyneli, 2012) and, consequently, it provides results in line with those works. Therefore, it represents a benchmark for comparison with the DDF results and helps us to understand the added value of this further development of DEA techniques in cases similar to the one investigated here.

Although the DEA models have been used for modeling undesirable factors in efficiency evaluation by reversing bad outputs or using different transformations, these procedures have been criticized and alternative approaches have been proposed in order to explicitly model a technology producing joint outputs, while gauging performance in terms of increased good output and decreased bad output (see, for instance, Färe, Grosskopf, Norris, & Zhang, 1994; Førsund, 2009; Scheel, 2001; Seiford & Zhu, 2002; Tyteca, 1997). The Directional Distance Function (DDF), in particular, offers the advantage that it can be estimated using the same linear programming techniques employed for DEA, but it also provides a more suitable model for the occurrence of an externality. This is due to the weak disposability of outputs – considering specifically that one output is bad – and the null-jointness property, which makes the bad output an unavoidable product of the production process (Färe & Grosskopf, 2004). These specifications best suit the case of the judiciary, which solves disputes but, at the same time, unavoidably produces delays.

In actual fact, the DDF approach coincides with the standard DEA, except for some additional constraints related to the output side, which are: the additional constraint on bad outputs (treated separately and asymmetrically in the DDF), a different definition of the distance function (inputs/outputs for DEA, directional for the DDF), the mentioned null-jointness property, and the weak disposability assumption on bad outputs.

                         a vector of undesirable outputs, which are represented, in our case, by the amount of time needed to come to a decision. Based on the traditional assumptions on technology and input–output sets, we assume that undesirable outputs are jointly produced with decisions. This hypothesis is called null jointness, in notation:
                           
                              
                                 ∀

                                 0
                                 ⇒
                                 y
                                 =
                                 0
                              
                           
                        where B is a kxj matrix collecting undesirable output observations. Indeed, all decisional activities require a certain amount of time. Moreover, another largely accepted assumption is the so-called weak disposability assumption, which refers to the trade-off between good and bad outputs. The decisional process takes time and, being the inputs fixed, the only way to increase the number of judgments is to reduce decisional times, but this is only compatible with a contraction in the total number of decisions reached. The reasoning cannot be as direct as in the case of an industrial plant producing energy. In the latter case, weak disposability is clear because, for given inputs and technology, the only way to reduce pollution is to reduce the amount of energy. In our case, the undesirable output, which is the total amount of time needed to come to a decision, can be reduced only if the inputs (mainly the judges and administrative staff) concentrate their efforts on a more limited number of cases. Therefore, the result is that their production (the number of decisions) will decrease, and this confirms the provisions of weak disposability. Vector y of good outputs represents the total amount of decisions issued by each court, while vector b contains the cumulative amount of time spent by the courts in reaching these decisions.

Therefore, the classic assumption of free disposability of outputs no longer holds true for all the outputs, but only for the subset of good outputs (Färe, Grosskopf, Lovell, & Pasurka, 1989). In particular, the reduction of y can occur without additional costs, while reducing the amount of b (keeping y unchanged) requires additional costs (or, better, an increase in the amount of inputs). In notation, the weak disposability in (y,
                        b), where 0⩽
                        α
                        ⩽1 and P(x) is the production possibility set, is as follows:

                                 x
                                 )
                                 ⇒
                                 (
                                 x

                                 α
                                 y
                                 ,
                                 α
                                 b
                                 )
                                 ∈
                                 P
                                 (
                                 x
                                 )
                              
                           
                        Then, weak disposability implies that good and bad outputs can be proportionately contracted but the inputs remain fixed. However, as previously underlined, increasing the number of decisions reached is costly and the additional amount of resources needed contradicts the assumption of fixed inputs. The standard free disposability assumption remains valid only for the subset of desirable outputs y – in our case, the number of decisions issued by each court, which, of course, can be reduced using the same amount of inputs without additional costs.

The Directional Distance Function (DDF) represents the maximum feasible proportional contraction of bad outputs (time necessary to define a case) and expansion of good outputs (total quantities collected) in a pre-assigned direction (Chambers, Chung, & Färe, 1996; Chambers, Chung, & Färe, 1998; Färe & Grosskopf, 2000). The value is equal to 0 for efficient courts, which contribute to identifying the frontier, and it increases with inefficiency, like any standard distance measure. The directional output distance function is defined as follows:

                        The Directional Distance Function re-scales the observed output vector (y,
                        
                        b) on the frontier following the g direction; then, (y,−b) in our case. The β value, estimated for each DMU, directly represents the scaling factor, and thus the distance from the best practice frontier.

Similarly to the method adopted in the previous DEA approach, a bootstrap procedure is then applied to the DDF, following the recent results by Simar, Vanhems, and Wilson (2012), who expand on the idea put forth in Simar and Wilson (2011) valid for the DDF in the input–output space.

The basic idea of bootstrapping is that inference about a population from sample data can be modeled by resampling the sample data and performing inference on them. As the population is unknown, the true error in a sample statistic against its population value is unknowable. In bootstrap resamples, the ‘population’ is in fact the sample, and this is known; hence, the quality of inference from resample data is measurable.
                           3
                           More formally, the bootstrap works by treating inference of the true probability distribution J, given the original data, as being analogous to inference of the empirical distribution of Ĵ, given the resampled data. The accuracy of inferences regarding Ĵ using the resampled data can be assessed because we know Ĵ. If Ĵ is a reasonable approximation to J, then the quality of inference on J can in turn be inferred.

The application of the bootstrap procedure allows correcting score estimates with a bias, and this is particularly important because it ensures that estimates are robust. The bootstrap procedure has never been applied to the DDF in previous studies, and this analysis adopts the theoretical approach proposed by Simar and Wilson (2011) and Simar et al. (2012).

                        The sub-sample size p can be chosen using the method suggested by Simar and Wilson (2011).

The Italian tax judiciary is ruled by Legislative Decree 546/92, according to which specialized courts are responsible for trials concerning tax law matters. The Commissione Tributaria Provinciale (hereinafter CTP) is a first instance court with provincial jurisdiction, whereas the Commissione Tributaria Regionale (hereinafter CTR) is a second instance court with regional jurisdiction. These courts rule on tax cases in which citizens or firms appeal against tax judgments. Hierarchically, the second instance court is higher than the first instance court and it is responsible for appeals against first-instance judgments.

The court of last resort is the Supreme Court of Cassation (i.e. Corte Suprema di Cassazione), which has its seat in Rome and acts as the appellate court for all civil, criminal and tax cases. The Supreme Court of Cassation cannot overrule the interpretation of the lower courts, but simply ensures the legitimacy of their decisions.

For reasons essentially related to sample size, the paper focuses on first instance courts and their efficiency, analyzing 103 CTPs and considering panel data for the years 2009–2011.

The procedures to review tax cases as well as the organization of the courts are strictly regulated by the aforementioned law. According to it, two types of workers can be identified: judges, ruling on tax cases, and staff, supporting the decision-making process by dealing with all the required bureaucracy. As for the judges, two key figures are the President of the CTP and the President of the Section. The former is responsible for the whole CTP and is in charge of screening all cases before assigning them to the appropriate sections. The latter is responsible for a specific section, as well as for each case assigned to the section by the President.
                        4
                        Note that the President of the CTP is also the president of the first section.
                     
                     
                        4
                      Each section is made up of a president, a vice-president and at least four judges, and there can be up to two benches, which comprise the president or vice-president and another two judges. The number of these sections can vary and the Ministry is responsible for its regulation. Fig. 1
                      summarizes the organization of CTPs.

The legal procedure is divided into a number of successive steps. Every step describes a task in the production process of first instance tax courts and, therefore, it is relevant in order to understand how the system works.

Once an allegation has been made by the Italian Revenue Office responsible for tax collection, the accused party can either agree to pay the due amount (including a fine) or file a complaint with the competent CTP (depending on the party’s fiscal domicile). The workflow of the CTPs is represented in Fig. 2
                      and further summarized below:
                        
                           –
                           
                              Step 1: the CTP’s staff receive the documentation and perform all necessary activities, including entering the case into the ministerial database and forwarding it to the President of the CTP.


                              Step 2: the President of the CTP performs a preliminary screening of the case and decides whether to dismiss it or to forward it to the competent section.


                              Step 3: the President of the Section performs a more detailed screening and issues the related order. This step corresponds to the time needed to either begin the trial or dismiss the case.


                              Step 4: If the President decides the case should be pursued, the bench holds the trial, issues its judgment, and forwards it to the staff.


                              Step 5: the judgment is notified to the parties.

In line with the proposed methodologies, the empirical strategy consists of two stages. In the first stage, the Technical Efficiency (TE) scores are calculated; then, in the second stage, they are regressed on a number of explanatory variables which should explain the determinants of court inefficiency.

The bootstrap procedure, described above, is applied in both cases.

Let us now look at the first stage in greater detail. Following some of the studies mentioned above, this work adopts as output for both models the number of cases completed (i.e. the number of cases with a sentence or court order). The input variables introduced into the models are factors that might affect court productivity in this specific sector (i.e. number of judges) and the demand for justice (number of cases pending on January 1st of each year and number of incoming cases). According to this approach, we can imagine the efficiency of a CTP as its ability to maximize the number of cases completed in relation to a given amount of inputs, including available resources as well as the demand for justice, given by the sum of the stock (i.e. backlog of cases) and flow (i.e. incoming cases). The time needed to settle a dispute is considered a “bad” output in the DDF, measured as the amount of time elapsing between the submission of the case to the CTP and the notification of the judgment to the parties.

                      presents descriptive statistics about inputs and both good and bad outputs, as well as the TE scores. Data about judges, cases pending on January 1st of each year considered (i.e. backlog), incoming cases, as well as cases resolved, are extracted from the annual report on tax justice by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, responsible for tax courts.
                        5
                        The data can be downloaded from the website of the Ministry of Economy and Finance: http://www.finanze.it
                        
                     
                     
                        5
                      As mentioned above, the data describe the activities of all 103 CTPs over a three-year period (2009, 2010, and 2011).

In order to compare the efficiency scores of the radial output-oriented DEA with the DDF, the figures have been normalized by computing the inverse of DEA and 1+DDF.
                        6
                        We are particularly grateful to one of the referees for suggesting this procedure. In greater detail, the values have been normalized for DEA: score=(1/DEA efficiency score), while for the DDF: score=(1/1+DDF efficiency score).
                     
                     
                        6
                     
                  

In this case, all scores range between 0 and 1, with 1 as benchmark, and it is easy to see from Table 1 that neglecting the externality returns a higher average efficiency score. Fig. 3
                      shows a map of Italy’s CTPs and displays their average efficiency scores for the three-year period 2009–2011, calculated according to the two distinct methodologies and normalized as described. Once more, it is quite evident that the figures are different; moreover, including the externality can reverse the efficiency scores of specific CTPs (e.g. Islands). This is crucial if the results are used to support policy making, since neglecting judicial delay can direct the policymakers’ attention to the wrong benchmark.

As a robustness check, in order to determine whether the differences in using the DEA vs. the DDF approach are statistically significant, the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test (Wilcoxon, 1945) is applied. The null hypothesis is that both distributions (results from DEA and the DDF) are the same.
                        7
                        This test is applied to the data for each year (2009, 2010, and 2011) and also to their mean. In all the cases, the p-values indicate that the null hypothesis can be rejected at any level above 2.45%; then, the distributions are significantly different.
                     
                     
                        7
                     
                  

In light of the above, it is now possible to proceed with the second stage of the analysis according to the Simar–Wilson procedure (2007) and to test the determinants of the TE scores. The independent variables are presented in Table 2
                      and are consistent with those identified by Falavigna et al. (2014).

Firstly, geographical location seems to be an important covariate, but further simplifications are required to handle it in a manageable way. From a socio-economic point of view, Italy can be subdivided into five macro areas: North-West, North-East, Center, South, and Islands. This classification is thus captured by a dummy variable, in order to account for the heterogeneity among CTPs due to their belonging to a specific macro area. Then, the average number of active sections is considered. This is given by the mean between the number of active sections on January 1st and on December 31st of every year.

In addition, proxies for the judges’ efforts and for the systems used to manage the courts are included. To capture the former, the number of sittings and the number of cases per judge are considered. The average number of sittings per judge is equal to the ratio between total presences at bench sittings (i.e. total number of sittings multiplied by three, which is the number of judges in each section) and number of judges in a given CTP. The average number of cases per judge is equal to the ratio of cases discussed in sittings and number of judges in a given CTP.

Finally, to capture the effect of how a given CTP is managed, the time required to implement each step, as described in Section 4 (and in Fig. 2), is considered.

The independent variables are normalized with a logarithmic transformation in order to satisfy the normality assumption of the distribution. Finally, through a covariance matrix, the correlation among variables is tested, with acceptable results. For instance, the highest value is that of the correlation between North-West and average number of cases per judge, which is statistically significant (p-value: 0.0000) and equal to −0.3971.


                     Table 3
                      shows the results of the Truncated Regression Model, while in Table 4
                      the results of the Multiple Regression (panel data) Model are displayed, applying the bootstrap option with 200 replacements. In both models the statistical tests are jointly zero and thus the hypothesis is rejected, i.e. if all the regression coefficients in the fitted model are zero.

Moreover, the square of the multiple correlation coefficients (R-sq) is good, although greater in the model with the DDF than in that with DEA (28% of the variance of the TE scores is accounted for by the explanatory variables in the DDF, vs. 19% in the DEA approach). Finally, it has been tested that the error terms are independently normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance

Although the estimators used are different, the truncated model and the Multiple Regression Model lead to common findings of great interest. First, both regression models, and both the DDF and DEA, suggest that the North-West is the most efficient geographical macro-area, since the technical efficiency score increases (i.e., there is a positive coefficient) moving from the South to the North-West of Italy. Moreover, note that dummies identifying other macro areas are statistically significant with a p-value lower than 0.01 only if the negative externalities are introduced into the model.

Secondly, looking at the duration of each step, a CTP can increase its efficiency by reducing the time needed by a bench to come to a judgment and issue a decision (step 4). This result is statistically significant in both the DEA and the DDF model. The opposite holds true if we consider the time needed for step 1; in this case, the findings are significant (with a p-value lower than 0.1) but divergent in terms of sign (Table 4). It is worth noting that this is the beginning of the procedure; hence, although it is not yet the core of the technology for dispute resolution, it is important in order to keep the procedure on the right track. The DDF shows that, in such a case, slightly more time and care may be beneficial to the efficiency score, i.e. keeping judicial delay low, while the DEA is unable to grasp this peculiarity. This is also in line with the null-jointess property of the DDF, which thus proves to be a more suitable technique for the cases in which zero externality is valid only for zero output.

Another interesting detail concerning procedural organization emerges in step 5, i.e. the notification of the judgment to the parties. This activity does not contribute to resolving the dispute but simply involves communicating the bench’s decision to the parties. Hence, stockpiling envelopes on a desk is simply a waste of time, negatively affecting overall efficiency. Once more, while it clearly emerges with the DDF, this aspect is not captured by DEA.

On the whole, the above is relevant not only for overall efficiency assessments, but also for what concerns policy implications. After all, courts are productive technologies and their internal organization is important to understand and possibly foster efficiency. If the aim of the analysis is to provide suggestions about how to pursue efficiency, properly considering the outputs – including externalities – and the individual steps of the productive process is crucial.

Also, the covariate average number of cases per judge is significant in both cases, but there are great differences depending on the approach used, and DDF yields a coefficient two times higher than the one obtained using the DEA approach both in the Multiple Regression Model and in the truncated model. This provides additional hints for organization management. A CTP can boost its technical efficiency by increasing the number of active sections or the productivity of its judges (i.e., number of cases assessed by the judges), but the average number of sittings per judge is significant only when using the DDF (i.e., it is not statistically significant under the DEA approach with p-value>0.1). Moreover, also in this case we can observe how DDF yields a coefficient three times higher than the one obtained using the DEA approach both in the Multiple Regression Model and in the truncated model.

On balance, the implications go far beyond the merely methodological debate: the empirical evidence shows that, in terms of public policy, neglecting a bad outcome can lead to the wrong interpretation or even to the wrong prescriptions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper adopts the Directional Distance Function to estimate judicial efficiency in the specific case of Italian tax courts and to compare the results thus obtained with those calculated using a standard DEA model. Additionally, the bootstrap is applied to the DDF procedure in order to provide more robust estimates to be compared with the DEA results (as for the DEA methodology, the bootstrap procedure is applied following Simar–Wilson, 2007).

While standard DEA models, more commonly used to assess the performance of a production unit, identify efficiency by maximizing outputs while keeping inputs equal, other DEA formulations perform a similar calculation but, at the same time, they refine the measure by minimizing bad outputs. This is a crucial feature when there is an externality which, if not considered, would otherwise lead to severe consequences. In other words, while the standard DEA approach is a powerful tool for production theory when the only target is productivity, those specific formulations prove to be crucial when production also involves bad outputs, i.e. externalities. Hence, efficiency assessments cannot disregard the appropriate balance between good and bad outputs without making the overall exercise weak or even wrong. In the paper we use the DDF formulation as it seems to be the appropriate DEA approach given its specific features, especially the null-jointness property and the weak disposability assumption on bad outputs

In the case under investigation, the externality is given by judicial delay, which produces social costs for what concerns the certainty of justice as well as private and public expenditure to enforce laws. In turn, this can endogenously affect the demand for justice – since potential plaintiffs might be discouraged from pursuing cases, as well as the overall reliability of the judiciary.

The empirical evidence obtained by applying a two-stage approach according to Simar and Wilson (2007) shows that in the field of justice “the sooner the better” is a desirable but not affordable option. Although judgment times cannot be close to zero – which is also in line with the null-jointness property of the DDF, there are however nuances concerning the organization of dispute resolution, since saving time at every stage does not always produce the expected results and, accordingly, the pursuit of technical efficiency along with externality minimization requires the fine-tuning of every single step. All the above is much more evident if the DDF model is used.

In this regard, the article offers a new insight into the organization and productivity of a specialized portion of the Italian judiciary, but it also provides a case study to test how an objective analysis of delay is crucial when judicial efficiency is at stake. A simple production efficiency assessment sheds light on how well a court performs but not on how well it serves society. The DDF rectifies the calculation by solving the conundrum, thus making findings more reliable for policies pursuing productive efficiency.
